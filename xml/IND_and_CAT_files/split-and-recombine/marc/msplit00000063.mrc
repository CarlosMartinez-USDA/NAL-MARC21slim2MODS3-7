Limited attention has been given to the immunotoxicity of these chemicals. The present study revealed a concentration‐dependent increase of reactive oxygen species content and an induced expression of redox‐sensitive transcription factors in zebrafish embryos after exposure to various concentrations of BPA, NP, and BPA/NP mixture for 4 h to 168 h postfertilization. Transcription of genes related to the immune response, including IFNγ, IL1β, IL10, Mx, TNFα, CC‐chemokine, and CXCL‐clc, were significantly up‐regulated on exposure to EDCs. A significant induction of concentrations of proinflammatory mediator, nitric oxide, accompanied by an increase in the activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and an upregulation of inducible NOS gene expression, was detected in zebrafish embryos on exposures to EDCs. To elucidate the potential mechanisms by which BPA and NP activate the innate immune response, expression profiles of genes related to the Toll‐like receptors (TLRs) signaling pathway were examined. Expressions of TLR3, TRIF, MyD88, SARM, IRAK4, and TRAF6 were altered on exposure to EDCs. The authors' results demonstrate that exposure to BPA and NP significantly affects the expression of genes related to immune response in zebrafish embryos following oxidative stress.

Between 2010 and 2013, a voluntary JD control program was successfully launched in Ontario, Canada, including a Risk Assessment and Management Plan (RAMP) and JD ELISA testing of the entire milking herd. Over the last decade, the organic dairy sector has been growing. However, organic farming regulations and philosophies may influence the risk for JD transmission on Ontario organic dairy farms. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate differences in JD ELISA test positive prevalence, risk factors for JD and recommendations for JD prevention between organic and conventional dairy herds in Ontario. RAMP results (i.e. RAMP scores and recommendations) and ELISA results were available for 2103 dairy herds, including 42 organic herds. If available, additional data on milk production, milk quality, and herd characteristics were gathered. Organic and conventional herds had a similar herd-level JD ELISA test-positive prevalence (26.2% and 27.2%, respectively). Organic herds (4.2%) had a higher within-herd JD ELISA test-positive prevalence compared to conventional herds (2.3%) if they had at least one JD test-positive animal on the farm. Organic farms had lower risk scores for biosecurity (9 points lower), and higher scores in the calving (7 points higher) and the calf-rearing management areas (4 points higher). After accounting for RAMP score, organic farms received fewer recommendations for the calving management area (Odds Ratio=0.41) and more recommendations in the adult cow management area (Odds Ratio=2.70). A zero-inflated negative binomial model was built with purchase of animals and the herd size included in the logistic portion of the model. Herd type (organic or conventional), colostrum and milk feeding practices, average bulk tank somatic cell count, and presence of non-Holstein breeds were included in the negative binomial portion of the model. Organic farms had a higher number of test positive animals (Count Ratio=2.02). Further research is necessary to investigate the apparent disconnect between risk factors and recommendations on organic dairy farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiosecurity 3abreeds 3acalving 3acattle diseases 3acolostrum 3acows 3across-sectional studies 3adairy farming 3adairy herds 3adisease prevention 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3aherd size 3ainfectious diseases 3amilk 3amilk production 3amilking 3amodels 3aorganic production 3arisk assessment 3arisk factors 3asomatic cell count 3aOntario 0aBtSCC 0aCI 0aCOS 0aCR 0aHES 0aHP 0aICC 0aIQR 0aJD 0aLntotnotest 0aMAP 0aOJEMAP 0aRAMP 0aZINB 0aDairy cow 0aParatuberculosis 0aControl program 0aOrganic farming 0aRisk factor1 aSorge, Ulrike S.1 aDeVries, Trevor1 aGodkin, Ann1 aLissemore, Kerry1 aKelton, W.

In this study, the effect of initial concentration on the rheological behavior of ice slurry was investigated experimentally. Ice slurry flowed upward and downward to keep it homogeneous in the tube, and pressure drop was measured to explain the rheological behavior of the ice slurry. The ice packing factor, Reynolds number, and initial aqueous solution concentration were varied as parameters. The ice slurry flow characteristics exhibit a pseudo-plastic fluid tendency for 5 and 10 wt% of the initial concentration. Ice slurry generated from 2 wt% ethanol solution behaves as a Newtonian fluid.  aPublisher supplied data 0aIce slurry 0aTwo-phase flow 0aPressure drop 0aNon-Newtonian fluid 0aCoulis de glace 0aÉcoulement diphasique 0aChute de pression 0aFluide non newtonien1 aYamanada, Yushi1 aMakino, Yuki1 aAsaoka, Tatsunori0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2016 Aug., v. 68 p.218-225dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2016.04.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001800169245011300187300001800300520145600318592002801774650001101802650001601813650001301829650001401842650001301856650001201869650002801881650001801909650003501927650004001962700002002002773009202022856008402114990002302198852000902221655001202230IND60087405820221121220654.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008740582DNAL7 a226411032pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlocke, David10aMaterial properties of photomechanical infrared receptors in pyrophilous Melanophila beetles and Aradus bugs  ap. 3392-3399.  aJewel beetles of the genus Melanophila and some pyrophilous species of the flat bugs genus Aradus show a pyrophilous behaviour and have developed so-called photomechanical infrared (IR) receptors. In a spherical photomechanical IR sensillum incoming IR radiation is converted into micromechanical action, finally stimulating the dendritic tip of a mechanosensitive sensory cell. The tip is located inside a tiny cuticular sphere with a diameter of about 12μm. The material properties of the different cuticular components of this sphere are of great importance for stimulus generation. We measured the modulus and hardness of the outer exocuticular shell of the sphere and the mesocuticle inside the core. Measurements were made by nanoindentation at sensilla which were partly cut open under dry as well as under rewetted (i.e. quasi-natural) conditions. We found that in the rewetted sensilla the outer exocuticular shell of the sphere in the Melanophila sensillum is about 50% harder and 20% stiffer than reference exocuticle, and that in both species especially the rewetted mesocuticle of the inner core of the IR sensilla is significantly softer (about 80% in Melanophila) and more compliant (about 90% also in Melanophila) than the reference mesocuticle. The findings can be interpreted as special adaptations of the cuticular microdomains of photomechanical infrared sensilla to enhance thermomechanical performance and, thereby, sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAradus 3aMelanophila 3ahardness 3areceptors 3asensilla 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxmetabolism. 2aInfrared Rays 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexmetabolism1 aSchmitz, Helmut0 tActa biomaterialia.g2012 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.3392-3399dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008400166300001600250520106000266592002801326650001501354650001701369650001401386650001601400650001201416650001801428650002301446650002401469650002101493650002001514650001701534650001401551653001501565653001701580653001801597653002601615653002401641700002001665700002001685773010001705856008701805852000901892655001201901IND60526100120221122050558.0190402e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052610012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, C.10aMicroencapsulation of canola oil by lentil protein isolate-based wall materials  ap. 264-273.  aThe overall goal was to encapsulate canola oil using a mixture of lentil protein isolate and maltodextrin with/without lecithin and/or sodium alginate by spray drying. Initially, emulsion and microcapsule properties as a function of oil (20%–30%), protein (2%–8%) and maltodextrin concentration (9.5%–18%) were characterized by emulsion stability, droplet size, viscosity, surface oil and entrapment efficiency. Microcapsules with 20% oil, 2% protein and 18% maltodextrin were shown to have the highest entrapment efficiency, and selected for further re-design using different preparation conditions and wall ingredients (lentil protein isolate, maltodextrin, lecithin and/or sodium alginate). The combination of the lentil protein, maltodextrin and sodium alginate represented the best wall material to produce microcapsules with the highest entrapment efficiency (∼88%). The lentil protein-maltodextrin-alginate microcapsules showed better oxidative stability and had a stronger wall structure than the lentil protein-maltodextrin microcapsules.  aPublisher supplied data 3acanola oil 3adroplet size 3aemulsions 3aingredients 3alentils 3amaltodextrins 3amicroencapsulation 3aoxidative stability 3aprotein isolates 3asodium alginate 3aspray drying 3aviscosity 0aCanola oil 0aSpray drying 0aMicrocapsules 0aEntrapment efficiency 0aOxidative stability1 aVarankovich, N.1 aNickerson, M.T.0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.264-273dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03438naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006100153245009900214300001600313520187400329592002802203650002202231650001402253650000902267650001502276650001002291650001502301650001502316650001202331650001102343650001802354650001002372650001102382650001102393650001202404650001602416650001702432650001502449650001102464651001202475653001402487653002002501653001702521653003002538653002102568700001902589700001902608700002402627700001702651773011902668856008802787852000902875655001202884IND60619140820221122235814.0190705e20190220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061914082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.2422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOswald, Claire J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8766-671510aSpatial distribution and extent of urban land cover control watershed-scale chloride retention  ap. 278-288.  aIn some cold regions up to 97% of the chloride (Cl−) entering rivers and lakes is derived from road salts that are applied to impervious surfaces to maintain safe winter travel conditions. While a portion of the Cl− applied as road salt is quickly flushed into streams during melt events via overland flow and flow through storm sewer pipes, the remainder enters the subsurface. Previous studies of individual watersheds have shown that between 28 and 77% of the applied Cl− is retained on an annual basis, however a systematic evaluation of the spatial variability in Cl− retention and potential driving factors has not been carried out. Here we used a mass balance approach to estimate annual Cl− retention in 11 watersheds located in southern Ontario, Canada, which span a gradient of urbanization. We evaluated the influence of multiple landscape variables on the magnitude of Cl− retention as well as the long-term rate of change in stream Cl−concentration for the same systems. We found that mean annual Cl− retention ranged from 40 to 90% and was higher for less urbanized watersheds and for watersheds with urban areas located farther from the stream outlet. This result suggests that less urbanized watersheds and ones with longer flow pathways have more Cl− partitioned into storage and hence the potential for legacy Cl− effects on aquatic organisms. While we did measure statistically significant increasing trends in stream Cl− concentration in some watersheds, there was no consistent relationship between the long-term rate of change in stream Cl− concentrations and patterns of urbanization and the magnitude of Cl− retention. Based on our results we present a detailed conceptual model of watershed Cl− dynamics that can be used to guide future research into the mechanisms of Cl− retention and release within a watershed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic organisms 3achlorides 3acold 3acold zones 3alakes 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amelting 3amodels 3aoverland flow 3apipes 3arivers 3astorms 3astreams 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aOntario 0aRoad salt 0aLegacy chloride 0aMass balance 0aLong-term chloride trends 0aAquatic toxicity1 aGiberson, Greg1 aNicholls, Erin1 aWellen, Christopher1 aOni, Stephen0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 652 p.278-288dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.2423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245005800160300002000218520135900238592002801597650001501625650002601640650001701666650002201683650001601705650001201721650001901733650001101752650000701763650001901770650001901789650001501808650001601823650002901839650002601868700002101894700001801915700001501933700001201948773012401960856007402084852000902158655001202167IND60666835420221118064218.0190919e20141028xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066683542DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08820d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Huan-Ping10aPhotocatalytic degradation of methylene blue in ZIF-8  ap. 54454-54462.  aMetal–organic frameworks (MOFs), a new class of porous crystalline materials, have attracted great interest as a promising candidate for sustainable energy and environmental remediation. In this study, ZIF-8, a versatile MOF based on imidazolate ligands, was selected as a photocatalyst to decompose methylene blue (MB) under UV light irradiation. The influence factors, kinetics, and mechanism of photocatalytic MB degradation and stability of ZIF-8, were also studied. The results revealed that the ZIF-8 photocatalyst exhibited efficiently photocatalytic activity for MB degradation under UV irradiation, which was confirmed through the detection of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) by a fluorescence method. The MB degradation over the ZIF-8 photocatalyst followed a pseudo-first-order kinetics model. ZIF-8 worked effectively over a wide pH range from 4.0 to 12.0, and showed both high adsorption capacity and degradation efficiency for MB in a strong alkaline environment. The enhanced efficiency in a strong alkaline environment resulted from the higher charged ZIF-8 (pH > pHₚzc) and the elevated yield of ˙OH facilitated by increased OH⁻ concentration. The possible pathway of photocatalytic degradation of MB in ZIF-8 was proposed. The results indicated that ZIF-8 can be used as a highly efficient photocatalyst to decompose organic pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3afluorescence 3ahydroxyl radicals 3airradiation 3aligands 3amethylene blue 3amodels 3apH 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3aremediation 3arenewable energy sources 3aultraviolet radiation1 aWang, Chong-Chen1 aZhang, Yiwen,1 aWang, Peng1 aLi, Ran0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 28, v. 4, no. 97 p.54454-54462dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08820d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04330naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245015400156300001600310520252300326592002802849650001202877650001702889650002002906650001202926650001102938650002002949650001802969650001402987650001903001650001403020650001003034650001603044650001003060650001503070650001503085650002003100650001603120650002403136650001903160650000903179650001303188650001303201650001503214650002103229650001603250651001003266653002603276653002003302653001703322653002803339653002403367700001603391700001303407700001503420700001403435773015803449856007603607852000903683655001203692IND60681662720221119165904.0200117e20191016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068166272DNAL7 a10.3920/QAS2018.12952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, X.J.10aPrediction model of rice crude protein content, amylose content and actual yield under high temperature stress based on hyper-spectral remote sensing  ap. 517-527.  aCrude protein and amylose constitute two main representative components of rice quality. The non-destructive, quick assessment of grain crude protein content (GCPC), grain amylose content (GAC), and actual yield (AC) are necessary for quality and yield diagnosis in rice production. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of high temperature stress on rice GCPC, GAC and AC, to define the relationships of GCPC, GAC, and AC to ground-based canopy hyper-spectral reflectance and derivative parameters, and to establish quantitative models for real-time monitoring of rice GCPC, GAC, and AC using sensitive spectral parameters under high temperature stress. Two field warming experiments were performed in Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, China, to investigate the effects of high temperature ((treated for continuous 3 days from 9:00 am to 14:00 pm, average temperature was set at 35, 38 and 41 °C) and a control (CK)) at flowering stage in Liangyoupeijiu rice cultivar, using a free air temperature increase apparatus. Canopy hyper-spectral reflectance, GCPC, GAC, and AC were measured under high temperature treatments during different growth stages (flowering stage, grain-filling and ripening stages). The results showed that GCPC, AC (GAC) in Liangyoupeijiu were clearly reduced (increased) under high temperature stress in this study compared with the values of CK, and the reducing extent of GCPC and AC (the increasing extent of GAC) was increased with the increase of high temperature level. The hyper-spectral reflectance in different wavelength regions under high temperature stress was different. They increased in visible light region with the elevation of temperature, but reduced in near-infrared region. Among some selected spectral indices at three different growth stages used to estimate GCPC, GAC and AC, the optimum indices were difference vegetation index(810,450) and perpendicular vegetation index- Landsat multispectral scanner with high R² when regressed against GCPC, GAC and AC. Furthermore, GCPC, GAC and AC prediction based on flowering stages were preferred than that on grain-filling and ripening stage by much bigger correlation coefficients. The six regression models developed in this study showed the agreement between the predicted and observed values when testing independent data under high temperature stress. Thus, the selected key hyper-spectral parameters can be reliably used to estimate GCPC, GAC and AC in rice under different high temperature treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aOryza sativa 3aair temperature 3aamylose 3acanopy 3acrop production 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3afilling period 3aflowering 3afoods 3aheat stress 3alight 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3aquality control 3areflectance 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3arice 3aripening 3ascanners 3avegetation 3avegetation index 3awavelengths 3aChina 0acrude protein content 0aamylose content 0aactual yield 0ahigh temperature stress 0aspectral parameters1 aZhang, Y.H.1 aLi, R.Y.1 aShen, S.H.1 aBao, Y.X.0 tQuality assurance and safety of crops & foods.g2019 Oct. 16, v. 11, no. 6 p.517-527dWageningen Academic PublisherswJournal:J000000147x1757-837X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3920/QAS2018.12953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245016300164300001600327520159200343592002801935650001501963650003101978650003602009650001402045650001402059650001902073650002202092650001202114650001402126650002302140650000902163650003002172650002102202650001302223700002002236700001802256700001302274700001802287773010302305856008302408990002302491852000902514655001202523IND60098149920221118013918.0141104e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009814992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ki Mo10aIncreased glyoxalase I levels inhibit accumulation of oxidative stress and an advanced glycation end product in mouse mesangial cells cultured in high glucose  ap. 152-159.  aChronic high glucose levels lead to the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) as well as AGE precursors, such as methylglyoxal (MG) and glyoxal, via non-enzymatic glycation reactions in patients with diabetic mellitus. Glyoxalase 1 (GLO-1) detoxifies reactive dicarbonyls that form AGEs. To investigate the interaction between AGEs and GLO-1 in mesangial cells (MCs) under diabetic conditions, AGE levels and markers of oxidative stress were measured in GLO-1-overexpressing MCs (GLO-1-MCs) cultured in high glucose. Furthermore, we also examined levels of high glucose-induced apoptosis in GLO-1-MCs. In glomerular MCs, high glucose levels increased the formation of both MG and argpyrimidine (an MG-derived adduct) as well as GLO-1 expression. GLO-1-MCs had lower intracellular levels of MG accumulation, 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (an oxidative DNA damage marker), 4-hydroxyl-2-nonenal (a lipid peroxidation product), and nitrosylated protein (a marker of oxidative-nitrosative stress) compared to control cells. Expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes I, II, and III was also decreased in GLO-1-MCs. Furthermore, fewer GLO-1-MCs showed evidence of apoptosis as determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick labeling assay, and activation of both poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage and caspase-3 was lower in GLO-1-MCs than in control cells cultured in high glucose. These results suggest that GLO-1 plays a role in high glucose-mediated signaling by reducing MG accumulation and oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aNAD ADP-ribosyltransferase 3aadvanced glycation end products 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acultured cells 3adiabetes mellitus 3aglucose 3aglycation 3alipid peroxidation 3amice 3aoxidative phosphorylation 3aoxidative stress 3apatients1 aKim, Yŏng-suk,1 aJung, Dong Ho1 aLee, Jun1 aKim, Jin Sook0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 318, no. 2 p.152-159dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.0133Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002800176245008000204300001500284520173900299592002802038650001802066650001802084650001402102650001502116650001402131650002102145650001502166650002402181650002002205650002102225650001902246650001702265650001002282650001602292650000902308650001602317650001402333650002602347650004302373650001202416650001302428650002102441700002202462700002002484700001902504773015202523856007002675856010602745990002302851852000902874655001202883IND60608534320221119195633.0190510e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060853432DNAL7 a10.3791/554652doi7 aPMC55122852pmcid7 a284480132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyons-Cohen, Miranda R.10aPrecision-cut mouse lung slices to visualize live pulmonary dendritic cells  ap. e55465.  aInhalation of allergens and pathogens elicits multiple changes in a variety of immune cell types in the lung. Flow cytometry is a powerful technique for quantitative analysis of cell surface proteins on immune cells, but it provides no information on the localization and migration patterns of these cells within the lung. Similarly, chemotaxis assays can be performed to study the potential of cells to respond to chemotactic factors in vitro, but these assays do not reproduce the complex environment of the intact lung. In contrast to these aforementioned techniques, the location of individual cell types within the lung can be readily visualized by generating Precision-cut Lung Slices (PCLS), staining them with commercially available, fluorescently tagged antibodies, and visualizing the sections by confocal microscopy. PCLS can be used for both live and fixed lung tissue, and the slices can encompass areas as large as a cross section of an entire lobe. We have used this protocol to successfully visualize the location of a wide variety of cell types in the lung, including distinct types of dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, T cells and B cells, as well as structural cells such as lymphatic, endothelial, and epithelial cells. The ability to visualize cellular interactions, such as those between dendritic cells and T cells, in live, three-dimensional lung tissue, can reveal how cells move within the lung and interact with one another at steady state and during inflammation. Thus, when used in combination with other procedures, such as flow cytometry and quantitative PCR, PCLS can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of cellular events that underlie allergic and inflammatory diseases of the lung.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aT-lymphocytes 3aallergens 3aantibodies 3abreathing 3achemoattractants 3achemotaxis 3aconfocal microscopy 3adendritic cells 3aepithelial cells 3aflow cytometry 3ainflammation 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3aneutrophils 3apathogens 3aquantitative analysis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aslicing 3astaining 3asurface proteins1 aThomas, Seddon Y.1 aCook, Donald N.1 aNakano, Hideki0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Apr. 05, , no. 122 p.e55465-e55465dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/554653Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55465/precision-cut-mouse-lung-slices-to-visualize-live-pulmonary-dendritic  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03288naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005600145245010400201300001600305500001900321500002000340520162000360592002801980596003502008596005402043596005902097650001302156650002102169650001302190650001902203650001102222650001302233650001302246650001402259650002002273650001102293650002002304700005702324700005302381700005502434700005602489700005602545773012902601856007902730852000902809655001202818IND60728866620221120025042.0210225e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072886662DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.152472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shasha1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1234-165710aElemental sulfur reduction by a deep‐sea hydrothermal vent Campylobacterium Sulfurimonas sp. NW10  ap. 965-979.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSulfurimonas species (class Campylobacteria, phylum Campylobacterota) were globally distributed and especially predominant in deep‐sea hydrothermal environments. They were previously identified as chemolithoautotrophic sulfur‐oxidizing bacteria (SOB), whereas little is known about their potential in sulfur reduction. In this report, we found that the elemental sulfur reduction is quite common in different species of genus Sulfurimonas. To gain insights into the sulfur reduction mechanism, growth tests, morphology observation, as well as genomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on a deep‐sea hydrothermal vent bacterium Sulfurimonas sp. NW10. Scanning electron micrographs and dialysis tubing tests confirmed that elemental sulfur reduction occurred without direct contact of cells with sulfur particles while direct access strongly promoted bacterial growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that most species of Sulfurimonas probably employ both periplasmic and cytoplasmic polysulfide reductases, encoded by genes psrA₁B₁CDE and psrA₂B₂, respectively, to accomplish cyclooctasulfur reduction. This is the first report showing two different sulfur reduction pathways coupled to different energy conservations could coexist in one sulfur‐reducing microorganism, and demonstrates that most bacteria of Sulfurimonas could employ both periplasmic and cytoplasmic polysulfide reductases to perform cyclooctasulfur reduction. The capability of sulfur reduction coupling with hydrogen oxidation may partially explain the prevalenceof Sulfurimonas in deep‐sea hydrothermal vent environments.  aPublisher supplied data  aDY135‐B2‐01cCOMRA Program  a2018YFC0310701cNational Key R&D Program of China  a41672333cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abacteria 3abacterial growth 3adialysis 3adirect contact 3aenergy 3agenomics 3ahydrogen 3aoxidation 3aoxidoreductases 3asulfur 3atranscriptomics1 aJiang, Lijing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3771-65181 aHu, Qitao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5748-24211 aLiu, Xuewen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8088-42101 aYang, Suping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6200-22261 aShao, Zongze1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4784-090X0 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.965-979dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.152473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245013500171300001600306520114200322592002801464653002201492653001601514653002101530653002201551653001801573653002501591653001601616653002501632653002501657653001801682700001601700700001101716700001601727700001401743773011801757856008601875852000901961655001201970IND60606598720221119231412.0180726e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060659872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2016.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Mengnan10aVisual experimental research on the effect of nozzle orifice structure on R124–DMAC absorption process in a vertical bubble tube  ap. 107-117.  aA visual experimental platform for R124–DMAC bubble absorption in a vertical tube absorber was designed and built for this research. The bubble behaviors, flow pattern characteristics and distributions are observed and the bubble absorption heights (BAHs) were measured when the two kinds of different structure nozzles (single-orifice or multi-orifice nozzle) were applied in the absorber. The results showed that the BAH will heighten with increases of vapor flow rate and nozzle flow area. Based on visual experimental observations, the BAH or bubble absorption performance was significantly affected by the velocity of vapor from the nozzle rather than by the nozzle structure. The proportion of slug flow in BAH or the BAH can be decreased by using a multi-orifice nozzle in the absorber under the same flow area condition. However, the flow resistance of the vapor through the nozzle will increase, which has a negative action on the performance of absorption refrigeration systems. So, using multi-orifice nozzle does not improve the absorption performance of the bubble absorber under the same nozzle flow resistance condition.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBubble absorption 0aR124–DMAC 0aNozzle structure 0aVisual experiment 0aVertical tube 0aAbsorption de bulles 0aR124–DMAC 0aStructure de tuyère 0aExpérience visuelle 0aTube vertical1 aXu, Shiming1 aWu, Xi1 aHu, Junyong1 aWang, Wei0 tInternational journal of refrigeration.g2016 Aug., v. 68 p.107-117dElsevier LtdwJournal:26758x0140-70077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrefrig.2016.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245014800153300001800301520171200319592002802031650001402059650002302073650002702096650001302123650003002136650000902166650001402175650001402189650002102203650001802224650001502242700002402257773010802281856007202389852000902461655001202470IND60132903920221120201811.0150513e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013290392DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.22382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jian10aUptake and depuration of pharmaceuticals in reclaimed water by mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki): A worst‐case, multiple‐exposure scenario  ap. 1752-1758.  aPrevious studies showed that caffeine, diphenhydramine, and carbamazepine were bioconcentrated by mosquito fish (Gambusia holbrooki) from freshwater bodies directly affected by reclaimed water. To understand the uptake, depuration, and bioconcentration factors (BCFs) under the worst‐case conditions, the authors exposed 84 mosquito fish to reclaimed water under static renewal for 7 d, followed by a 14‐d depuration phase in clean water. Characterization of the exposure media revealed the presence of 26 pharmaceuticals, whereas only 5 pharmaceuticals—caffeine, diphenhydramine, diltiazem, carbamazepine, and ibuprofen—were present in the organisms after only 5 h of exposure. Caffeine, diltiazem, and carbamazepine were quickly taken up by mosquito fish following a similar uptake curve. Diphenhydramine and ibuprofen, on the other hand, were more gradually taken up by mosquito fish but were also eliminated fairly quickly, resulting in the 2 shortest depuration half‐lives at 34 h and 32 h, respectively. For comparison, BCFs based on rate constants (BCFb), steady‐state concentrations (BCFₐ), and saturation‐state concentrations (BCFc) were calculated. Values of BCFbranged from 0.23 to 29 and increased in the order of caffeine < carbamazepine < diltiazem < diphenhydramine < ibuprofen. Values of BCFₐand BCFcranged from 2.0 to 28 and increased in the order of carbamazepine < caffeine < diltiazem < diphenhydramine < ibuprofen. This is the first study using a nonartificial exposure–treated wastewater matrix to generate pharmacokinetic data for pharmaceutical mixtures in aquatic organisms.

Vitrification was performed at a controlled temperature of either 5 °C or 39 °C at a constant relative humidity of 40% for various time periods from 0.5 wk up to 8 wk. During vitrification, the vitrified collagen membranes (collagen vitrigels, CVs) exhibited a rapid growth in fibrillar density through the evaporation of water and an increase in fibrillar stiffness due to the formation of new and/or more-stable interactions. On the other hand, the collagen fibrils in CVs maintained their D-periodicity and showed no significant difference in fibrillar diameter, indicating preservation of the native states of the collagen fibrils during vitrification. Keratocyte phenotype was maintained on CVs to varying degrees that were strongly influenced by the collagen fibril nanoarchitectures. Specifically, the vitrification time of CVs mainly governed the keratocyte morphology, showing significant increases in the cell protrusion number, protrusion length, and cell size along with CV vitrification time. The CV vitrification temperature affected the regulation of keratocyte fibroblasts' gene expressions, including keratocan and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), demonstrating a unique way to control the expression of specific genes in vitro.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3acollagen 3acornea 3aevaporation 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3agenes 3aphenotype 3arelative humidity 3atemperature 3avitrification1 aPhillip, Jude M.1 aMajumdar, Shoumyo1 aWu, Pei-Hsun1 aChen, Jiansu1 aCalderón-Colón, Xiomara1 aSchein, Oliver1 aSmith, Barbara J.1 aTrexler, Morgana M.1 aWirtz, Denis1 aElisseeff, Jennifer H.0 tBiomaterials.g2013 Dec., v. 34, no. 37 p.9365-9372dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.08.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02106naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001100145245006500156300001600221520106600237592002801303650001101331650001201342650001001354650001701364650001901381650001401400650001101414650001501425650001501440650001201455651000901467700002001476700001601496700001701512700001901529773010301548856004801651852000901699655001201708IND4486274920221119231505.0120707e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448627492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11769-012-0551-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yu10aHolocene climate cycles in northwest margin of Asian monsoon  ap. 450-461.  aIn the mid-latitude regions of the Asian continent, Zhuye Lake is located in the northwest margin of the Asian monsoon, where the modern climate is affected by the Asian monsoon and Westerlies. In this study, we investigated the absolutely dated Holocene records in Zhuye Lake for detecting the Holocene climate cycles. Totally, 14 14C dates and 6 optically simulated luminescence (OSL) dates are obtained from the QTH01 and QTH02 sections. The proxies of grain-size, total organic carbon content (TOC), C/N and δ13C are used for wavelet analysis, and the results show obvious ∼256, ∼512 and ∼1024-year climate cycles, which are consistent with the Holocene millennial and centennial scale climate cycles in the typical Asian summer monsoon domain. In different parts of the Zhuye Lake, the Holocene sediments show variable climate cycles that are affected by the lake basin topography. In the Zhuye Lake, the Holocene climate cycles are mainly correlated with the solar-related Asian summer monsoon variability and the North Atlantic ice-rafting events.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3alakes 3aluminescence 3amonsoon season 3asediments 3asummer 3atopography 3awatersheds 3awavelet 3aAsia1 aWang, Nai’ang1 aLi, Zhuolun1 aZhou, Xuehua1 aZhang, Chengqi0 tChinese geographical science.g2012 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.450-461dSpringer-Verlagx1002-00637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11769-012-0551-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02334naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009100166500002200257520102100279592002801300650001501328650001501343650001101358650002701369650001801396650002401414650001301438650001501451650001201466650002701478653001801505653001401523653001401537653001501551653001401566653001201580700001801592700001701610700001501627700001901642700002001661773009101681856008301772852000901855655001201864IND60666091520221118022444.0190923s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066609152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Peng-Fei10aNanostructures serve as adsorbents for the selective separation/enrichment of proteins  aPre-press version  aIn proteomic analysis, the high efficient separation of proteins from complex biosample matrixes is the prerequisite.

Two paired sites, one in a sloping area and another one in a contiguous flat area, were chosen. The vineyard soils of the two plots of each paired site were managed with conventional soil tillage (CT) and Vicia faba cover crop (CC) the preceding 5 years. SOC was measured in three points along the slope (top, middle and foot parts) and in the flat area. Results showed that in the slope area the highest SOC content was found in CC management, with an average value of 9.52 ± 0.34 g kg−1, whereas the SOC content under CT was 8.74 ± 0.20 g kg−1. In the flat vineyard, the SOC ranged from 9.88 ± 0.11 g kg−1 to 10.47 ± 0.20 g kg−1 under CT and CC, respectively.The SOC increase was 6% in the flat area and 9% in the sloping vineyard after five years since CC management adoption. The higher C sequestration rates in the sloping vineyard in comparison to the flat area could be attributed to the role of CC to prevent sediment and nutrient erosion. These results were compared with those by reference works and with the results of 39 vineyards paired-sites. Findings demonstrated that C sequestration rate is strongly correlated to slope gradient and the C sequestration per se due to the effect of added C input by the cover crop is overestimated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVicia faba 3acarbon sequestration 3acover crops 3areference works 3asediments 3asoil organic carbon 3atillage 3avineyard soils 3avineyards 3aItaly 3aSicily 0aC loss 0aC sequestration rate 0aSlope 0aCover crop 0aVineyards1 aMinacapilli, Mario1 aSantoro, Antonino1 aRodrigo-Comino, Jesús,1 aCarrubba, Alessandra1 aSarno, Mauro1 aVenezia, Giacomo1 aGristina, Luciano0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 20, v. 652 p.300-306dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.10.2473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02382naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245009100160500002200251520088600273592002801159650002401187650002301211650002901234650002901263650001201292650000901304650001301313650001801326650001401344650001501358650001501373650001301388653001301401653001401414653001401428653001301442653002301455653002301478653002701501653002501528653002701553700001701580700001201597700001401609700001801623700001901641773010001660856008301760852000901843655001201852IND60666091620221118022439.0190913e20190904xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066609162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin10aEmerging applications of nanozymes in environmental analysis: opportunities and trends  aPre-press version  aAs an ensemble that is able to exhibit both the catalytic characteristics of enzymes and the features of nanoscale materials, nanozymes have experienced rapid development in the past few years. Compared with natural enzymes, nanozymes with better stability can be mass produced at lower cost. More attractively, their properties can be expediently designed and tailored for various demands. With these merits, they have found extensive applications in sensing, biomedicine, and environmental treatment. In this review, we make a comprehensive summary on the emerging use of nanozymes in environmental analysis. Emphasis is focused on the nanozyme-based principles and strategies explored for the sensing of toxic ions, pesticides, phenolic pollutants, antibiotic residues, and pathogens. Opportunities and trends for nanozymes in future environmental monitoring are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic residues 3acatalytic activity 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental monitoring 3aenzymes 3aions 3amedicine 3ananomaterials 3apathogens 3apesticides 3apollutants 3atoxicity 0aNanozyme 0aToxic ion 0aPesticide 0aPathogen 0aAntibiotic residue 0aPhenolic pollutant 0aColorimetric detection 0aFluorescent analysis 0aElectrochemical sensor1 aWang, Linjie1 aDu, Dan1 aNi, Liang1 aPan, Jianming1 aNiu, Xiangheng0 tTrends in analytical chemistry.g2019 Sept. 04, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11800x0165-99367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trac.2019.1156533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245010800162300002000270520109600290592002801386650001401414650002301428650003001451650002101481650001501502650001301517650002401530650001101554650002201565650001401587650001301601650001401614650001301628653005001641653002101691653003201712653003001744653003001774700001601804700001501820700005601835700005801891700001601949700002101965700006001986773014202046856007802188852000902266655001202275IND60687130220221121211825.0200325e20200304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068713022DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b226742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Jun-Hui10aPt₅Se₄ Monolayer: A Highly Efficient Electrocatalyst toward Hydrogen and Oxygen Electrode Reactions  ap. 13896-13903.  aElectrocatalysts with high activities toward multiple electrode reactions are scarce and therefore highly sought. Here, we investigate the electrocatalytic performance of the two-dimensional (2D) Pt₅Se₄ monolayer toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Our density functional theory calculations show that the Pt₅Se₄ monolayer can serve as a low-Pt-loading trifunctional electrocatalyst with good kinetic and thermal stabilities. Specifically, the HER performance of the Pt₅Se₄ basal plane is predicted to be superior to that of 2D layered Pd or Pt dichalcogenides. Even considering the solvent effect, the catalytic OER performance of the Pt₅Se₄ monolayer is predicted to be comparable to the prevalent OER catalyst—IrO₂, while the catalytic ORR performance of the Pt₅Se₄ monolayer is even higher than the predominating Pt(111) surface. Overall, the Pt₅Se₄ monolayer can be a promising trifunctional catalyst that exhibits high activities toward all hydrogen and oxygen electrode reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3aselenides 3asolvents 0atwo-dimensional trifunctional electrocatalyst 0amonolayer Pt5Se4 0ahydrogen evolution reaction 0aoxygen evolution reaction 0aoxygen reduction reaction1 aLi, Li-Heng1 aZhang, Wei1 aXue, Kan-Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2894-79121 aWang, Chundong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6728-05191 aWang, Jiafu1 aMiao, Xiang-Shui1 aZeng, Xiao Cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4672-85850 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Mar. 04, v. 12, no. 12 p.13896-13903dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b226743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03619naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245017400205300001100379506007600390520157100466592002802037596006902065596012802134596002602262506003702288650001302325650001202338650002302350650001002373650000902383650002902392650001702421650001902438650001802457650000902475650002302484650001702507650002802524650000902552700001302561700001702574700001802591700001602609700001202625700001502637700001302652700001602665700001802681700002002699700001502719700001702734700001802751700001802769773010302787856008202890852000902972655001202981IND60590403920221207084224.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059040392DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1233-52doi7 aPMC57740872pmcid7 a293479092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Baobao10aIdentification of minor effect QTLs for plant architecture related traits using super high density genotyping and large recombinant inbred population in maize (Zea mays)  ap. 17.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Plant Architecture Related Traits (PATs) are of great importance for maize breeding, and mainly controlled by minor effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, cloning or even fine-mapping of minor effect QTLs is very difficult in maize. Theoretically, large population and high density genetic map can be helpful for increasing QTL mapping resolution and accuracy, but such a possibility have not been actually tested. RESULTS: Here, we employed a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) strategy to construct a linkage map with 16,769 marker bins for 1021 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Accurately mapping of well studied genes P1, pl1 and r1 underlying silk color demonstrated the map quality. After QTL analysis, a total of 51 loci were mapped for six PATs. Although all of them belong to minor effect alleles, the lengths of the QTL intervals, with a minimum and median of 1.03 and 3.40 Mb respectively, were remarkably reduced as compared with previous reports using smaller size of population or small number of markers. Several genes with known function in maize were shown to be overlapping with or close neighboring to these QTL peaks, including na1, td1, d3 for plant height, ra1 for tassel branch number, and zfl2 for tassel length. To further confirm our mapping results, a plant height QTL, qPH1a, was verified by an introgression lines (ILs). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a method for high resolution mapping of minor effect QTLs in maize, and the resulted comprehensive QTLs for PATs are valuable for maize molecular breeding in the future.  aPublisher supplied data  a91435206; 31421005cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFD0100404; 2016YFD0101803cNational Key Technologies Research & Development Program-Seven Major Crops Breeding Project  a2011-G15c948 Project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aZea mays 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acolor 3acorn 3agenotyping by sequencing 3ainbred lines 3ainflorescences 3aintrogression 3aloci 3aplant architecture 3aplant height 3aquantitative trait loci 3asilk1 aLiu, Han1 aLiu, Zhipeng1 aDong, Xiaomei1 aGuo, Jinjie1 aLi, Wei1 aChen, Jing1 aGao, Chi1 aZhu, Yanbin1 aZheng, Xinmei1 aChen, Zongliang1 aChen, Jian1 aSong, Weibin1 aHauck, Andrew1 aLai, Jinsheng0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.17-17dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1233-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01746naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245019400165300001200359520042400371592002800795650002900823650002800852650001000880650001000890650002500900650002200925653001400947653001900961653001400980700001900994700001401013700001701027700001701044700001901061700001701080700005501097773009001152856008501242852000901327655001201336IND60529717920221117191235.0161020e20160210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052971792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2015.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Liwei10aDraft genome sequence of Talaromyces verruculosus (“Penicillium verruculosum”) strain TS63-9, a fungus with great potential for industrial production of polysaccharide-degrading enzymes  ap. 5-6.  aTalaromyces verruculosus has long been known to be a supreme cellulase and antimicrobial extrolite producer.

M.10aOpen-source single-particle analysis for super-resolution microscopy with virusmapper  ap. e55471.  aSuper-resolution fluorescence microscopy is currently revolutionizing cell biology research. Its capacity to break the resolution limit of around 300 nm allows for the routine imaging of nanoscale biological complexes and processes. This increase in resolution also means that methods popular in electron microscopy, such as single-particle analysis, can readily be applied to super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. By combining this analytical approach with super-resolution optical imaging, it becomes possible to take advantage of the molecule-specific labeling capacity of fluorescence microscopy to generate structural maps of molecular elements within a metastable structure. To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm — VirusMapper — packaged as an easy-to-use, high-performance, and high-throughput ImageJ plugin. This article presents an in-depth guide to this software, showcasing its ability to uncover novel structural features in biological molecular complexes. Here, we present how to assemble compatible data and provide a step-by-step protocol on how to use this algorithm to apply single-particle analysis to super-resolution images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aanalytical methods 3acell biology 3acomputer software 3aelectron microscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3aimage analysis1 aMercer, Jason1 aHenriques, Ricardo0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2017 Apr. 09, , no. 122 p.e55471-e55471dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/554713Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/55471/open-source-single-particle-analysis-for-super-resolution-microscopy  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03095naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245013300166300001600299520163200315592002801947650002501975650001202000650001802012650002902030650001602059650002502075650001302100650000902113650001602122650001302138650001302151650001102164650001402175650001002189650002102199650001802220650000902238650001502247650002102262650003202283700001702315700002202332700001802354773010202372856008302474990002302557852000902580655001202589IND60098150420221120040429.0141104e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009815042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.11.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelz, Sandra12aA methionine-choline-deficient diet elicits NASH in the immunodeficient mouse featuring a model for hepatic cell transplantation  ap. 276-287.  aNon-alcoholic staetohepatitis (NASH) is associated with fat deposition in the liver favoring inflammatory processes and development of fibrosis, cirrhosis and finally hepatocellular cancer. In Western lifestyle countries, NASH has reached a 20% prevalence in the obese population with escalating tendency in the future. Very often, liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option. Recently, transplantation of hepatocyte-like cells differentiated from mesenchymal stem cells was suggested a feasible alternative to whole organ transplantation to ameliorate donor organ shortage. Hence, in the present work an animal model of NASH was established in immunodeficient mice to investigate the feasibility of human stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cell transplantation. NASH was induced by feeding a methionine/choline-deficient diet (MCD-diet) for up to 5weeks. Animals developed a fatty liver featuring fibrosis and elevation of the proinflammatory markers serum amyloid A (SAA) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα). Hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased as well as alanine aminotransferase demonstrating inflammation-linked hepatocyte damage. Elevation of αSMA mRNA and collagen I as well as liver architecture deterioation indicated massive fibrosis. Both short- and long-term post-transplantation human hepatocyte-like cells resided in the mouse host liver indicating parenchymal penetration and most likely functional engraftment. Hence, the NASH model in the immunodeficient mouse is the first to allow for the assessment of the therapeutic impact of human stem cell-derived hepatocyte transplantation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3aanthropogenic activities 3ablood serum 3acell transplantation 3acollagen 3adiet 3afatty liver 3afibrosis 3ahepatoma 3ahumans 3alifestyle 3aliver 3aliver transplant 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3astem cells 3atriacylglycerols 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aStock, Peggy1 aBrückner, Sandra1 aChrist, Bruno0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 318, no. 3 p.276-287dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.11.0053Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01376naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008800168300001600256520043400272592002800706650001800734650002200752650001000774700002200784700002200806700002000828700002400848773011100872856008200983852000901065655001201074IND60793320920221117104126.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079332092DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078220501772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemlyanov, I.

Of these, more than 1500 survived to pupation or parasitoid emergence, with annual frequencies of parasitism ranging from 1.7–7.6%. More parasitoids tended to emerge from E. clarus larvae collected later in the season, and parasitism varied significantly among host plants. In total we reared six morphologically distinct species of primary parasitoids (all koinobiont endoparasitoids) from E. clarus larvae; these included four species of Braconidae and a single species each of Ichneumonidae and Tachinidae. The braconid Pneumagathis spiracularis (Muesebeck) is reported as a parasitoid of E. clarus for the first time along with the first host plant associations for P. spiracularis. New host plant associations are reported for the ichneumonid Casinaria lamina (Viereck) parasitic on E. clarus. We also report the trigonalid Orthogonalys pulchella (Cresson) as a parasitoid of P. spiracularis along with new host plant associations; P. spiracularis is the first reported host other than a species of Tachinidae and the second record of a trigonalid parasitic on a species of Braconidae. Images of adult parasitoids are provided, and relevant natural history data are presented based on our careful rearing protocol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBraconidae 3aEpargyreus clarus 3aIchneumonidae 3aTachinidae 3aadults 3abutterflies 3aendoparasitoids 3ahost plants 3ametropolitan areas 3anatural history 3aparasitism 3apupation 0ahost plant 0ahost-parasitoid interactions 0aphenology 0aseasonality1 aWeiss, Martha R.1 aBlock, Cedar1 aKula, Robert R.0 tProceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington.g2021 Jan. 29, v. 123, no. 1 p.120-135dThe Entomological Society of WashingtonwJournal:jnl43298x0013-87977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4289/0013-8797.123.1.1203Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04533naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245017000180300001600350506002800366520302600394592002803420506003703448650002003485650001903505650001803524650001203542650001403554650001003568650001603578650001703594650001103611651001103622653002203633653002303655653001803678700003503696700004003731700002103771700002703792700003203819773012503851856009003976852000904066655001204075IND60784802520221207072355.0151014e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078480252DNAL7 a10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v9i3.23812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Lucas Pereira10aYield in cultivars of the West Indian gherkin for different doses of biofertiliser = Produtividade de cultivares de maxixeiro em função de doses de biofertilizante  ap. 275-283.  aResource is Open Access  aThe fruit of the West Indian gherkin is greatly appreciated in Brazilian cuisine, especially in the north and northeast of Brazil. However, it is still considered a secondary crop, and is cultivated using non-technical management. As it is a crop produced mainly by small farmers, any research should be directed towards its cultivation using inputs produced on the farm itself, such as bio-fertilisers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on the yield of two West Indian gherkin cultivars, of different doses of bio-fertiliser consisting of cattle manure and commercial products containing bacteria and enzymes that degrade organic molecules. A completely randomised design was used in a 2 x 4 factorial scheme with four replications. The factors included two cultivars (Do Norte and Liso Gibão) and four doses of bio-fertiliser (0, 8, 16 and 24 m3 ha-1) applied through fertigation. The experiment lasted for 100 days, with six collections being made, for which the following variables were evaluated: number of fruits, fruit weight, production and yield. All the variables were affected by the interaction between the factors under study. The cultivars did not differ as to yield, however the De North cultivar gave the highest number of fruits, while the Liso Gibão cultivar produced fruit of a greater weight. From the results obtained, a dose of 14 m3 ha-1 is recommended for the Liso Gibão cultivar. For the De Norte cultivar, further studies with higher doses of bio-fertiliser are recommended. = Os frutos de maxixeiro são de grande apreciação na culinária brasileira, principalmente nas regiões Norte e Nordeste do Brasil. No entanto, é considerada uma cultura secundária e seu cultivo é realizado sem adoção de manejo tecnificado. Devido o seu cultivo ser realizado, principalmente, por pequenos produtores, as pesquisas empregando insumos produzidos na própria propriedade, como o biofertilizante, na adubação do maxixe são relevantes. Nesse sentido, objetivou-se com este trabalho avaliar o efeito de doses de biofertilizante na produtividade de duas cultivares de maxixe. Utilizou-se o delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em esquema fatorial 2 x 4, com quatro repetições. Os fatores consistiram de duas cultivares (Do Norte e Liso Gibão) e quatro doses de biofertilizante (0; 8; 16 e 24 m3 ha-1), aplicadas via fertirrigação. O experimento foi conduzido durante 100 dias, sendo realizadas seis colheitas, nas quais se avaliou as seguintes variáveis: número de frutos, massa de frutos, produção e produtividade. Todas as variáveis foram afetadas pela interação entre os fatores estudados. As cultivares estudadas não diferiram quanto à produção, no entanto, a cv. Do Norte apresentou maior número de frutos, enquanto a cv. Liso Gibão apresentou frutos mais pesados. A partir dos resultados obtidos, recomenda-se a dose de 14 m3 ha-1 para a cultivar Liso Gibão. Para a cultivar Do Norte, recomenda-se mais estudos com doses mais elevadas de biofertilizante.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCucumis anguria 3abiofertilizers 3acattle manure 3acuisine 3acultivars 3afarms 3afertigation 3afruit weight 3afruits 3aBrazil 0aCucumis anguria L 0aOrganic fertiliser 0aOrganic input1 aFrancisco de Assis de Oliveira1 aBezerra, Francisco Mardones Servulo1 aLima, Luan Alves1 aCosta, Luilson Pereira1 aGuedes, Rodolfo Artur Alves0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2015 Oct., v. 9, no. 3 p.275-283dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v9i3.23813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02522naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012600165520128900291592002801580650000801608650000901616650001101625650003101636650001801667650001301685650001101698650001501709650002401724650001601748653002701764653002301791653002401814653001501838700001601853700001301869700001501882700001901897773009001916856008502006852000902091655001202100IND60749044220221120202719.0211123e20220101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074904422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1217692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Cong10aThermodynamic optimization of the indirect precooled engine cycle using the method of cascade utilization of cold sources  aTo solve the problem of engine performance degradation caused by excessive fuel consumption in the precooled engine cycle, a new optimization method based on the cascade utilization of cold source is proposed, in which the cold sources with different temperature ranges and different working fluids are reasonably matched and adequately utilized. Based on this method, two new optimization cycles are put forward, i.e., the air reheat precooling cycle (ARPC) and the hydrogen reheat precooling cycle (HRPC). To evaluate the performances of these two cycles, a unified model is established. According to the simulation results, the fuel consumption of the HRPC could be reduced by 0–21.04% compared with the traditional precooled engine. Besides, the specific impulse of the HRPC, which can be raised by 16.78% when the heat transfer effectiveness is set to 0.9, is higher than that of the ARPC, which can be increased by 12.64% at most. Moreover, considering the operating constraints, the reduction of the minimum temperature difference of the regenerator and the increase of the pressure recovery coefficient of intake are effective ways to expand the performance boundaries. The results in this paper are beneficial for the performance optimization of the precooled engine cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acold 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aheat transfer 3ahydrogen 3amodels 3aprecooling 3asystem optimization 3atemperature 0aPrecooled engine cycle 0aCycle optimization 0aCascade utilization 0aPropulsion1 aYu, Xuanfei1 aPan, Xin1 aQin, Jiang1 aHuang, Hongyan0 tEnergy.g2022 Jan. 01, v. 238 p.121769-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1217693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013300168300001600301520092500317592002801242650001101270650001201281650001401293650001801307650001101325650001101336650001701347650001601364650001501380650001101395651001701406700002301423773011101446856008201557852000901639655001201648IND60793321020221117104936.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079332102DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078220501652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTretiakov, M.

Climatic, water-balance, and hydrodynamic models were successively applied to evaluate the effect of climatic and anthropogenic changes in the drainage basin of the Ob river estuary on seasonal hydrological processes in the Gulf of Ob. Climate changes along with considerable seasonal redistribution of river runoff in the drainage basin of the Gulf of Ob, mostly due to its increase in winter, were found to cause no significant changes in the seasonal hydrological mouth processes in 1980–2018. Estimates for a period of up to 2050 showed that climate changes under various scenarios will cause an increase in streamflow from the basin, which will reduce the penetration of saltwater into the gulf.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aestuaries 3ahydrodynamics 3arivers 3arunoff 3asaline water 3astream flow 3awatersheds 3awinter 3aArctic Ocean1 aShiklomanov, A.

The physically adsorbed N₂O could be decomposed to N₂ molecule and O atom bonded to Al@GO exothermally (2.33 eV per N₂O molecule), indicating a stronger interaction of the Al cation and O anion of N₂O from that of the reactants. This interaction is enhanced with a positive external electric field, inducing the corresponding higher binding energy and shortened dAₗ–O. The decomposition barrier of N₂O on Al@GO is about 0.50 eV. In particular, due to the elongated dAₗ–O and shortened dO–N₁ in the transition state, the decomposition barrier is also decreased monotonously with increasing electric field. It is remarkable that the N₂O decomposition process becomes almost unimpeded and spontaneous under a positive electric field of 0.50 V Å⁻¹. Al-decorated graphene oxide is expected to be a promising new candidate for N₂O decomposition with enhanced adsorption and easier decomposition process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaluminum 3acations 3aelectric field 3aenergy 3agraphene oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide1 aMo, Huiyu1 aChen, Chi1 aJi, Xiao1 aXu, Kui1 aMiao, Ling1 aJiang, Jianjun0 tRSC advances.g2015 Feb. 12, v. 5, no. 24 p.18761-18766dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra16606j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01848naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245005400160300001800214520089400232592002801126650001201154650002801166650001801194650001501212650001301227650001301240650002001253650001401273700002001287773013401307856007201441852000901513655001201522IND60661296320221118054714.0190829e20100622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066129632DNAL7 a10.1039/b909347h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Masashi10aConducting supramolecular nanofibers and nanorods  ap. 2420-2427.  aRecent progress in the study of electroconducting nanomaterials such as nanofibers, nanorods and other nanostructures based on the supramolecular self-assembly of hexabenzocoronenes, oligo(thiophene)s, tetrathiafulvalenes and perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimides is described in this tutorial review. Conducting nanofibers and nanorods are constructed by doping π-donors or π-acceptors with oxidants or reductants before/after the formation of such nanostructures; however, some nanofibers show electric conductivity without any doping in the neutral state. Although cation radicals and anion radicals seem to be difficult to form nanofibers and nanorods, a limited number of cation radicals produce conducting nanofibers. For nanofibers and nanorods composed of weak π-donors and π-acceptors, their conductivities are measured by time-resolved microwave conductivity techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acations 3aelectrical conductivity 3afree radicals 3ananofibers 3ananorods 3aoxidants 3areducing agents 3athiophene1 aIyoda, Masahiko0 tChemical Society reviews.g2010 June 22, v. 39, no. 7 p.2420-2427dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b909347h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02562naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007600171300001500247520136000262592002801622650001501650650001101665650002701676650002101703650001101724650001301735650000901748650001801757650001401775650001601789650001801805653001901823653002001842653001801862653001701880653001001897700002701907773011001934856008702044852000902131655001202140IND60531219020221120235115.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053121902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.06.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPootao, Sunisa10aEffects of ohmic pretreatment on crude palm oil yield and key qualities  ap. 94-100.  aPretreatment is an important step that can increase the oil yield and improve the extraction efficiency of palm oil production. However, the conventional pretreatment method widely employed in the palm oil industry requires a relatively long time and high energy. In this research, ohmic heating was employed to pretreat oil palm fruit and the effects were studied of heating conditions on the hardness of the oil palm fruit, yield and qualities of the extracted crude palm oil. Oil palm fruits were ohmic heated using various heating conditions (temperature: 60–100 °C; voltage: 0–150 V; heating time: 2–10 min). Crude palm oil was then extracted from the heated samples using a screw extruder and determined for its qualities (free fatty acid, moisture content and deterioration of bleachability index). The results revealed that the voltage, temperature and heating time significantly affected the hardness of the pretreated oil palm fruit. Increasing the voltage, temperature and heating time resulted in an increase in the yield (maximum at 46%w/w) and improved the oil qualities. It was also found that ohmic pretreatment can reduce the heating time to 8 min and decrease the energy consumption of the process to 0.12 kW-h/kg. The results suggested that ohmic heating can be used as an alternative method for oil palm fruit pretreatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3aenergy 3afats and oils industry 3afree fatty acids 3afruits 3ahardness 3aheat 3aohmic heating 3apalm oils 3atemperature 3awater content 0aCrude palm oil 0aFree fatty acid 0aOhmic heating 0aPretreatment 0aYield1 aKanjanapongkul, Kobsak0 tJournal of food engineering.g2016 Dec., v. 190 p.94-100dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2016.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245012900171300001600300520097500316592002801291596006101319596004501380650000801425650001501433650003201448650002101480650001601501650001801517650002801535650001101563650001201574700002601586700006001612773012001672856008301792852000901875655001201884IND60733690120221120210209.0210731e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073369012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00294-020-01134-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenrikus, Sarah S.10aSingle-molecule fluorescence microscopy reveals modulation of DNA polymerase IV-binding lifetimes by UmuD (K97A) and UmuD′  ap. 295-303.  aDNA polymerase IV (pol IV) is expressed at increased levels in Escherichia coli cells that suffer DNA damage. In a recent live-cell single-molecule fluorescence microscopy study, we demonstrated that the formation of pol IV foci is strongly recB-dependent in cells treated with the DNA break-inducing antibiotic ciprofloxacin. The results of that study support a model in which pol IV acts to extend D-loop structures during recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In the present study, we extend upon this work, investigating the UmuD and UmuDʹ proteins as potential modulators of pol IV activity in ciprofloxacin-treated cells. We found that the non-cleavable mutant UmuD(K97A) promotes long-lived association of pol IV with the nucleoid, whereas its cleaved form, UmuDʹ, which accumulates in DNA-damaged cells, reduces binding. The results provide additional support for a model in which UmuD and UmuDʹ directly modulate pol IV-binding to the nucleoid.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPP1165135cNational Health and Medical Research Council  aFL140100027cAustralian Research Council 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aEscherichia coli 3aantibiotics 3aciprofloxacin 3afluorescence microscopy 3amodels 3amutants1 avan Oijen, Antoine M.1 aRobinson, Andrew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3544-09760 tCurrent genetics.g2021 Apr., v. 67, no. 2 p.295-303dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl32278x0172-80837nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-020-01134-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245018100172300001600353500001900369520106700388592002801455650001501483650001601498650001501514650002001529653001701549653001701566653002301583653001801606653001301624700002101637700002201658773017501680856008301855852000901938655001201947IND60726205120221121042851.0210202e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072620512DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.123.1.1472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, William L.14aThe Taxonomy and Nomenclature of Retellia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 and Dictyodes Malloch, 1933, with Notes on Pherbina cayennensis Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 (Diptera: Sciomyzidae)  ap. 147-168.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDictyodes Malloch, 1933 (Diptera: Sciomyzidae) is a new synonym of RetelliaRobineau-Desvoidy, 1830, with Retellia claropunctataRobineau-Desvoidy, 1830 (Tetanocera) serving as the type species of Retellia. Steyskal's (1974) analysis is confirmed, that Malloch (1933) redescribed Tetanocera dictyodesWiedemann, 1830 [as Dictyodes dictyodes] from a specimen that Malloch misidentified as T. dictyodes but which was, in fact, an undescribed species. Retellia platensis (Steyskal, 1974) (Dictyodes) new combination is confirmed as a new synonym of Retellia lacera (Wiedemann, 1830) (Tetanocera) new combination; a lectotype and a paralectotype are designated for the latter species. Steyskal's (1974) designation of Pherbina cayennensisRobineau-Desvoidy, 1830, an unplaced but possibly related species, as a nomen dubium is supported. A key to distinguish species of Retellia from similar-looking species in the Neotropical Region and a key to the two valid species of Retellia are provided.

These measurements indicate that Ga(III) oxide dissolves in significant concentrations in water vapour, and that its solubility depends on fHCl and fH₂O. At low fHCl, the dominant gallium gas species is Ga(OH)₃₍g₎, whereas at high fHCl, Ga(OH)Cl₂₍g₎ predominates. Gallium(III) oxide solubility increases exponentially with increasing pressure at 350 and 400°C due to the formation of the hydrated clusters, GaOHCl₂(H₂O)ₙ ₍g₎, where n=1–7. The logarithms of the dissolution constants for the reaction, 0.5Ga₂O₃₍ₛ₎+1.5H₂O₍g₎=Ga(OH)₃₍g₎, are −7.70±0.30 and −7.93±0.30 at 350 and 400°C, respectively, and for the reaction, 0.5Ga₂O₃₍ₛ₎+2HCl₍g₎=GaOHCl₂₍g₎+0.5H₂O₍g₎, are −0.32±0.29, 0.03±0.20, and −2.59±0.15 at 150, 200, and 400°C, respectively. The data obtained in this study were used to determine the partitioning of Ga between vapour and liquid at temperatures between 150 and 350°C, and a pH for the liquid ranging from 0 to 10. The estimated partition coefficient (Kd) decreases with increasing temperature, and reaches a maximum value of ∼100 at 150°C and ∼25 at 200°C at a pH of ∼4. The values are very similar to those estimated from data for geothermal wells in Iceland and hot springs in the Kamchatka Peninsula.  aPublisher supplied data 3agallium 3ahot springs 3apH 3apartition coefficients 3asolubility 3atemperature 3awater vapor 3awells 3aIceland1 aMigdisov, Art.A.1 aWilliams-Jones, A.E.1 aBychkov, A.Yu.0 tGeochimica et cosmochimica acta.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 119 p.137-148dElsevier Ltdx0016-70377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gca.2013.05.0373Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010600170300001800276520173000294592002802024650002902052650002602081650003702107650001602144650001302160650000902173650001102182650001002193650001202203650001302215650000902228650001202237650000902249650001102258650001102269651000902280700002202289700002102311773011902332856008102451852000902532655001202541IND60440011220221119161426.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044001122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-015-0855-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarenji Sani, Reza10aPrevalence and etiology of subclinical mastitis in dairy ewes in two seasons in Semnan province, Iran  ap. 1249-1254.  aTwenty-one dairy ewe flocks selected by stratified random sampling were subjected to study the prevalence and etiology of subclinical intramammary infections and to assess the influence of parity on the prevalence of intramammary infections. Also, spontaneous cure rates were determined over study period. A total of 1192 milk samples were collected at 2 weeks after lambing until tenth-week postpartum. All flocks had hand milking; those which were classified by bacterial culture and California Mastitis Test (CMT) as positive were deemed to have glands with subclinical mastitis (SCM). Of 1192 halves examined, 791 samples were collected during spring and 401 samples were collected during summer. Prevalence rate of SCM in spring was 14.7 %; and spontaneous cure that occurred in this season was 88.8 %; coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were the most common isolates (66.6 %). Samples collected in spring showed higher prevalence rate of SCM than summer samples. This rate was 8.9 % in summer. Spontaneous cure rate in this season was 69.4 %, and Staphylococcus aureus (72.2 %) was the most common isolates. SCM was seen at significantly lower rates in left half than in right one (p < 0.05). Multiparous ewes had significantly higher (p < 0.05) SCM prevalence rates than primiparous ewes. The incidence of clinical mastitis (defined as number of clinical cases per 100 ewe-months) was 0.21 and 0.74 in spring and summer, respectively. The isolates from clinical cases in spring were fungi and, from summer, were S. aureus. Also, S. aureus SCM cases were not significantly severe than other SCM cases. In conclusion, multiparous ewes were most at risk, and severity of infection was higher in summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalifornia mastitis test 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3adairy sheep 3aetiology 3aewes 3aflocks 3afungi 3alambing 3amastitis 3amilk 3amilking 3arisk 3aspring 3asummer 3aIran1 aMahdavī, ʻAlī,1 aMoezifar, Melika0 tTropical animal health and production.g2015 Oct., v. 47, no. 7 p.1249-1254dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-015-0855-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03342naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002000141245019300161520167300354592002802027650001702055650002502072650002602097650001302123650001602136650001602152650002402168650002202192650002002214650002002234650000902254650002002263650001202283650001302295650002302308650001902331650001602350650001702366650001202383650001602395650002502411650002102436650001802457650001602475700001902491700002002510700001602530700001902546700001802565773012002583856007602703852000902779655001202788IND60766838620221120163512.0220211e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076683862DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120303802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Xiaoqing 10aEffects of Dietary Multienzyme Complex Supplementation on Growth Performance, Digestive Capacity, Histomorphology, Blood Metabolites and Hepatic Glycometabolism in Snakehead (Channa argus)  aThe present study evaluated the impact of dietary multienzyme complex (MEC) supplementation on growth performance, digestive enzyme activity, histomorphology, serum metabolism and hepatopancreas glycometabolism in snakeheads (Channa argus). A total of 600 fish (initial weight, 69.70 ± 0.30 g) were randomly divided into four groups. Four diets were formulated: (1) control (basic diet); (2) E1 (400 U kg⁻¹ amylase, 150 U kg⁻¹ acid protease, 1900 U kg⁻¹ neutral protease and basic diet); (3) E2 (800 U kg⁻¹ amylase, 300 U kg⁻¹ acid protease, 3800 U kg⁻¹ neutral protease and basic diet); and (4) E3 (1200 U kg⁻¹ amylase, 450 U kg⁻¹ acid protease, 5700 U kg⁻¹ neutral protease and basic diet). The results show that the E2 group increased the specific growth rate, weight gain rate and the final body weight, as well as decreasing the blood urea nitrogen, alanine aminotransferase and triglyceride. The mRNA levels and activities of digestive enzymes and key glucose metabolism enzymes in the hepatopancreas were enhanced in snakeheads fed the MEC. Meanwhile, moderate MEC diet (E2 groups) supplementation improved digestive tract morphology, increased the glycogen in the hepatopancreas and the lipids in the dorsal muscle. Moreover, plasma metabolomics revealed differential metabolites mainly involved in amino acid metabolism. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with the MEC improved growth performance, digestive tract morphology, gene expression and the activity of digestive enzymes, enhanced the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis and amino acid metabolism of snakeheads, and the optimal composition of the MEC was group E2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChanna argus 3aalanine transaminase 3aamino acid metabolism 3aamylases 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3adietary supplements 3adigestive enzymes 3adigestive tract 3aenzyme activity 3afish 3agene expression 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3agrowth performance 3ahepatopancreas 3ametabolites 3ametabolomics 3amuscles 3aproteinases 3aspecific growth rate 3atriacylglycerols 3aurea nitrogen 3aweight gain1 aNie, Xinzheng 1 aYuan, Chunchun 1 aJiang, Lai 1 aYeh, Wen-Hsin,1 aQian, Lichun 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120303803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03469naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245008500162506002800247520224000275592002802515506003702543650001602580650000902596650001102605650002102616650002002637650001002657650002202667653002202689653002602711653001202737653001202749700001802761700001902779700001802798700001902816773013502835856008002970852000903050655001203059IND60784803120221207051242.0201109e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078480312DNAL7 a10.15673/fst.v14i3.17852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhygunov, D.10aSubstantiation of the technology of processing wheat grains into wholemeal flour  aResource is Open Access  aThe article presents and briefly discusses the benefits of consuming wholemeal products, including wholemeal flour. The production technologies of wholemeal flour have been classified, and their advantages and disadvantages analysed. The academic community’s research results are contradictory: researchers disagree about whether recombined wholemeal flour is higher in its biological and nutritional value than ordinary flour or not, nor their findings allow definitely recommending this or that technology of its production as effective. Therefore, it is important to develop a new technology of producing wholemeal flour for flour mills. This technology would incorporate the advantages of existing grinding methods and at the same time minimise their negative impact on the gluten complex quality and the nutrient content. The purpose of the study is to give reasons for the structure of the combined technological scheme of milling and the optimum modes of wholemeal flour production. The properties of industrially produced wholemeal flour samples have been studied. The findings allow concluding that the quality of these flour samples varies greatly. This is due to differences in the manufacturing technologies and the vagueness of the very concept of wholemeal flour, which should be defined by regulations along with quality requirements prescribed. Such parameters as ash content and flour particles size (which directly depend on how well the milling scheme is build up and whether all anatomical particles get into the flour) have a significant effect on the baking performance. The laboratory milling was performed following the principle of 100% grinding of grain. Three variants of the combined technological scheme of milling have been studied. The best baking performance resulted from using four roller systems for the primary grinding of the bran products and two millstone systems for the final milling. This allowed obtaining wholemeal flour with smaller particles: the residue on sieve No. 067 was 1.4%, and the outsiftings from sieve No. 38 were 40%. Using more grinding systems is impractical: it will allow obtaining even finer particles, but milling will become too energy-intensive and material-consuming  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aash content 3abran 3agluten 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3awheat 3awhole grain flour 0awholemeal product 0awholemeal wheat flour 0amilling 0aquality1 aKhorenghy, N.1 aVoloshenko, O.1 aZhyhunova, H.1 aMarchenkov, D.0 tHarčova nauka ì tehnologìâ.g2020 Sept., v. 14, no. 3dOdesa National University of TechnologywJournal:27799x2409-70047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15673/fst.v14i3.17853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02159naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245011000183300001600293520097600309592002801285650001601313650001901329650003301348650001801381650001101399650001501410650001201425650001701437651001401454651001801468700002101486700006901507773012701576856008501703852000901788655001201797IND60739286520221122121203.0211009e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073928652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cosust.2021.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbeldaño Zuñiga, Roberto A10aImpact of slow-onset events related to Climate Change on food security in Latin America and the Caribbean  ap. 215-224.  aThis review article assesses evidences published in the past two years on the links among slow-onset events, food security and poverty as well as the strategies focused on reducing specific problems, those implemented in the countries of the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region.

In this study, the authors include the main adaptive strategies they found in the literature reviewed: water improvement as a primary adaptive strategy for agriculture, apart from the ones that use geographic information systems technologies for monitoring vulnerable areas, diversification of cultures, adoption of agroecological practices, reduction of the gender gap in land governance, and implementation of educational strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecology 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental sustainability 3afood security 3agender 3agovernance 3apoverty 3aspatial data 3aCaribbean 3aLatin America1 aLima, Gabriela N1 aGonzález Villoria, Ana M1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1043-81240 tCurrent opinion in environmental sustainability.g2021 June, v. 50 p.215-224dElsevier B.V.wJournal:2237x1877-34357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2021.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02392naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002300136245004800159300001800207520131100225592002801536650002401564650001601588650001101604650001301615650001501628650001801643650001501661650001501676700002201691700001801713700001901731700001901750700002201769700002401791700002001815773011101835856003901946852000901985655001201994IND4467061820221116165651.0120727e20111015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446706182DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.81132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcNamara, James P.10aStorage as a Metric of Catchment Comparison  ap. 3364-3371.  aThe volume of water stored within a catchment, and its partitioning among groundwater, soil moisture, snowpack, vegetation, and surface water are the variables that ultimately characterize the state of the hydrologic system. Accordingly, storage may provide useful metrics for catchment comparison. Unfortunately, measuring and predicting the amount of water present in a catchment is seldom done; tracking the dynamics of these stores is even rarer. Storage moderates fluxes and exerts critical controls on a wide range of hydrologic and biologic functions of a catchment. While understanding runoff generation and other processes by which catchments release water will always be central to hydrologic science, it is equally essential to understand how catchments retain water. We have initiated a catchment comparison exercise to begin assessing the value of viewing catchments from the storage perspective. The exercise is based on existing data from five watersheds, no common experimental design, and no integrated modelling efforts. Rather, storage was estimated independently for each site. This briefing presents some initial results of the exercise, poses questions about the definitions and importance of storage and the storage perspective, and suggests future directions for ongoing activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aexperimental design 3agroundwater 3arunoff 3asnowpack 3asoil water 3asurface water 3avegetation 3awatersheds1 aTetzlaff, Doerthe1 aBishop, Kevin1 aSoulsby, Chris1 aSeyfried, Mark1 aPeters, Norman E.1 aAulenbach, Brent T.1 aHooper, Richard0 tHydrological processes.g2011 Oct. 15, v. 25, no. 21 p.3364-3371dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.8113  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012200164300001400286520186800300592002802168650001902196650001102215650002002226650001502246650002002261650001602281650001202297650002202309650001402331650001302345650002602358650001302384650001902397650001502416650001102431650001102442650002302453650001802476650001502494650001802509650001702527650001802544650001102562651001602573653001602589653002302605653002002628653001402648653001202662653002702674700001802701700002102719700005602740700001502796700001902811773012402830856008302954852000903037655001203046IND60532151720221117061334.0190318e20160916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053215172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPronger, J.10aLow spatial and inter-annual variability of evaporation from a year-round intensively grazed temperate pasture system  ap. 46-58.  aEcosystem scale measurements of evaporation (E) from intensively managed pasture systems are important for informing water resource decision making and validation of hydrologic models and remote sensing methods. We measured E from a year round intensively grazed temperate pasture system in New Zealand using the eddy covariance method for three years (2012⿿2014). Evaporation varied by less than 3% both spatially (770⿿783mm) and temporally (759⿿776mm) at an annual scale. The low spatial and temporal variation largely occurred because E was strongly controlled by net radiation (r2=0.81, p<0.01, daytime, half-hourly), which did not vary much between sites and years. However, E was strongly limited when volumetric moisture content (VMC) declined below permanent wilting point causing a strong reduction in the decoupling coefficient and an increase in the Bowen ratio. Grazing events appeared to have no effect on E during autumn and winter but reduced E by up to 5% during summer and spring while complete removal of vegetation during autumn herbicide application reduced E by ⿼30%. This implied that over the pasture regrowth period soil water evaporation (ES) could provide up to 70% of E relative to a vegetated site (during autumn) and, given that grazing events removed about 60% of leaf area, these findings suggest ES was likely able to compensate for decreased transpiration post-grazing. Agreement between measured E (EEC) and FAO-56 reference crop E (Eo) was good when soil moisture limitation was not occurring. However, during periods of soil moisture limitation Eo exceeded EEC and a correction factor was needed. We trialled the water stress coefficient (Ks) and a simple three bin VMC correction factor (KVMC) and found the KVMC approach worked better at a daily and monthly scale while both approaches worked well at an annual scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aautumn 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aevaporation 3agrazing 3ahydrologic models 3aleaf area 3apastures 3apesticide application 3aregrowth 3aremote sensing 3asoil water 3aspring 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atranspiration 3avegetation 3awater content 3awater stress 3awilting point 3awinter 3aNew Zealand 0aEvaporation 0aEvapotranspiration 0aEddy covariance 0aGrassland 0aGrazing 0aFAO-56 Penman-Monteith1 aCampbell, Di,1 aClearwater, M.J.1 aRutledge, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3818-58831 aWall, A.M.1 aSchipper, L.A.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 Sept. 16, v. 232 p.46-58dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01396naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010000157300001800257520037300275592002800648650001300676650002300689650001500712650001800727650002100745650001100766650001700777650001600794700001600810700001600826773013300842856007400975852000901049655001201058IND60660842120221118215548.0190827e20150305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066084212DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc09835h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, S.

Effective promotion of green concrete incorporating FA is required in order to minimize the environment threat due to FA waste disposal and reduce cement consumption.In this paper, effects of FA addition on the compressive strength fcm and fracture toughness of plain concrete are presented. Fracture toughness tests were carried out according to Mode I (tension at bending) following the RILEM Draft Recommendations. The critical values of stress intensity factors, KIcS have been determined.To assess mechanics parameters compressive strength tests and fracture toughness tests were conducted and the results were evaluated comparing with reference concrete. In modified concretes, cement was replaced by FA by its weight. Three test groups were constituted with the replacement percentages as: 0% (FA-00), 20% (FA-20) and 30% (FA-30). During the tests, the effect of age of concretes modified with the additive of FA on analysed parameters was determined. The experiments were carried out after: 3, 7, 28, 90, 180 and 365 days of curing.Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that, it is possible to make green concrete containing FA with high compressive strength and fracture toughness. The properties of composites with the additive of FA depend on the age of the concrete during tests. 20% additive of FA guarantees high fcm and KIcS in mature concretes. Moreover results of the KIcS and the fcm are convergent qualitatively.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acement 3acompression strength 3aconcrete 3afly ash 3amechanics 3asustainable development 3awaste disposal 0aGreen concrete composite 0afly ash 0aCompressive strength 0aFracture toughness 0aCritical stress intensity factor 0aCuring time0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 20, v. 172 p.218-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245010600175300001600281520149900297592002801796650001801824650001101842650002601853650001201879650002201891650001301913650001101926650001201937650001101949650001701960650001901977650001601996650002602012650002302038650002702061650001002088651001302098653001402111653000902125653001602134653001302150653001502163653001302178700002402191700002002215700002302235700001702258700002602275700002702301773009702328856009002425852000902515655001202524IND60625734820221117062416.0190129e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062573482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.12.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSontigun, Narin10aWing morphometric analysis of forensically important flesh flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) in Thailand  ap. 312-319.  aFlesh flies are insects of forensic importance as the larvae associated with human remains can be used to estimate a minimum post-mortem interval (PMImin) in most cases. And, because life-history traits can vary across species, correct identification is a mandatory step before being used as evidence. Adult flesh flies are extremely similar in general appearance, which causes difficulty in species identification as it is largely based on the morphology of the male genitalia; this also makes it difficult to identify females. Currently, landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis of insect wings has proven to be a valuable tool for species identification. Herein, we applied wing morphometric analysis of 524 flesh fly specimens comprising 12 species from Thailand. The right wing of each specimen was removed, mounted on a microscope slide, photographed, and digitized using 18 landmarks. Wing shape variation among genera and species were analyzed using canonical variate analysis, while wing shape variation between sexes of each species was analyzed using discriminant function analysis. A cross-validation test was used to evaluate the reliability of classification. Results of this study demonstrate wing shape can be used to separate genera and species, and distinguish between sexes of the same species, with high reliability. Therefore, the landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis of wings is a useful additional method for species and sex discrimination of flesh flies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSarcophagidae 3aadults 3adiscriminant analysis 3afemales 3aforensic sciences 3ageometry 3ahumans 3ainsects 3alarvae 3alife history 3amale genitalia 3amorphometry 3amultivariate analysis 3apostmortem changes 3aspecies identification 3awings 3aThailand 0aFlesh fly 0aWing 0aMorphometry 0aForensic 0aEntomology 0aThailand1 aSamerjai, Chutharat1 aSukontason, Kom1 aWannasan, Anchalee1 aAmendt, Jens1 aTomberlin, Jeffery K.1 aSukontason, Kabkaew L.0 tActa tropica.g2019 Feb., v. 190 p.312-319dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.12.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01974naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002400149245015800173300001600331500001900347520065500366592002801021650001501049650001201064650001401076651000901090653001401099653001501113653001701128653001801145653001601163700001901179700002201198700002201220700002101242700002101263773017501284856008301459961001301542852000901555655001201564IND60726205320221121042921.0210202e20210129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072620532DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.123.1.1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez, Erick J.10aDescription of Larvae of Anastrepha amplidentata and Anastrepha durantae with Review of Larval Morphology of the Fraterculus Group (Diptera: Tephritidae)  ap. 169-189.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe describe and illustrate for the first time the third instars of Anastrepha amplidentata Norrbom and Anastrepha durantae Norrbom from Peru.

The clinical outcome of both diseases is under the control of innate and adaptive immunity, and in both cases these progressive diseases are characterized by an impaired host Th1 response. As a consequence, the Th2 cytokine microenvironment occurring in progressive leishmaniasis may potentially promote tumor cell proliferation and vice versa. On the other hand, clinical aspects of subclinical cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis sometimes closely resemble those observed in various neoplasms thus leading to misdiagnosis. In this review, we present recent findings on the association between leishmaniasis and malignant disorders. Our review includes HIV positive, HIV negative subjects and patients whose HIV status has not been established. Leishmaniasis mimicking a malignant disorder was confirmed and extended to unreported neoplastic disorders including squamous cell carcinoma, T-cell and B-cell lymphoma, oral and intranasal tumors and granulomas. Thus, leishmaniasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and course of various cancers in Leishmania endemic areas or in patients with travel history to these areas. We also listed recent reports showing that Leishmania can promote cancer development in immunocompromised as well as in immunocompetent patients. The potential mechanisms supporting this promoting effect are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aLeishmania 3aT-lymphocytes 3aadaptive immunity 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3acytokines 3agranuloma 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atravel 3avisceral leishmaniasis 0aCancer 0aLeishmania 0aTutor-promoting1 aPomares, Christelle1 aMajoor, Alissa1 aBoyer, Laurent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1375-17061 aMarty, Pierre1 aMichel, Grégory,0 tActa tropica.g2019 Sept., v. 197 p.104855-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02147naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011800158300001800276520111200294592002801406650001501434650002301449650002301472650001501495650001301510650002101523650002501544650001901569700001701588773013301605856007401738852000901812655001201821IND60660842220221118215745.0190827e20150305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066084222DNAL7 a10.1039/c4cc09840d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazur, Ursula10aKinetic and thermodynamic processes of organic species at the solution–solid interface: the view through an STM  ap. 4737-4749.  aA focused review is presented on the evolution of our understanding of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors that play a critical role in the formation of well ordered organic adlayers at the solution–solid interface. While the current state of knowledge is in the very early stages, it is now clear that assumptions of kinetic or thermodynamic control are dangerous and require careful confirmation. Equilibrium processes at the solution–solid interface are being described by evolving thermodynamic models that utilize concepts from the thermodynamics of micelles. A surface adsorption version of the Born–Haber cycle is helping to extract the thermodynamic functions of state associated with equilibrium structures, but only a very few systems have been so analyzed. The kinetics of surface phase transformation, especially for polymorphic phases is in an early qualitative stage. Adsorption and desorption kinetics are just starting to be measured. The study of kinetics and thermodynamics for organic self-assembly at the solution–solid interface is experiencing very exciting and rapid growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3adesorption 3amicelles 3aphase transition 3athermodynamic models 3athermodynamics1 aHipps, K.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis was used as infection agent that had an abilitiy to be imunogenicand to lead immune system responsses decreased. Polysaccharides krestin was used as immunopotentiator which had a role to activatemacrophage and stimulate B cell in order to produce antibody. This research involved 30 adult female mice of Mus musculus strain Balb/C in the age of 8 €“10 weeks and in the weight between of 30 €“40 g. Mice were divided into six groups, as follows: group K asa control, was added only aquades; group K+ as positive control, was added only PSK; group K- as negative control, was exposedby M. tuberculosis only; group P1 was added PSK before being exposed by M. tuberculosis; group P2 was added PSK after beingexposed by M. tuberculosis; group P3 was added PSK before and after being exposed by M. tuberculosis. Polysaccharides krestin wasadded by gavage with single dose of 500 Î¼g and M. tuberculosis was exposed intraperitoneally with concentration of 5x108 bacteryper ml. The bioactivity of PSK was observed by formation antibody using indirect ELISA test. The results of research were the averageof OD value of K group was 0,590 ± 0,042, K+ group was 0.641 ± 0.025, K- group was 1.044 ± 0.054, P1 group was 1.032 ± 0.125,P2 group was 1.127 ± 0.042, P3 group was 1.230 ± 0.097. The conclusion of this research showed that the adding of PSK increasedmice formation antibody. The time of adding before and after being exposed M. tuberculosis was the most potential to raise antibodyproduction on mice.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aB-lymphocytes 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aadults 3aantibodies 3abioactive properties 3afemales 3aimmunostimulants 3apolysaccharides 0apolysaccharide krestin (PSK) 0amice 0aantibody 0aindirect ELISA1 aMasitha, Amalia Nur1 aWinarni, Dwi0 tBerkala Penelitian Hayati.g2013 Mar., v. 17, no. 2 p.177-183dIndonesian Biological SocietywJournal:27738x2337-389X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.23869/bphjbr.17.2.201293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003000147245010700177300001800284520135500302592002801657650002501685650002301710650001601733650001901749650001801768650001901786650000901805650001501814650000901829650001801838650002201856650002001878650001301898650002301911650001401934650002201948650001101970650001601981700003801997700003302035700003602068700004302104700003502147700004202182700003902224773011902263856008102382852000902463655001202472IND60440011620221119161306.0151024e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044001162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-015-0864-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silva, Gabriel Santana10aPerformance and carcass yield of crossbred dairy steers fed diets with different levels of concentrate  ap. 1307-1312.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of diets with increasing concentrate levels (170, 340, 510 and 680 g/kg of total dry matter) on dry matter intake, digestibility, performance and carcass characteristics of 25 Holstein-Zebu crossbred dairy steers in a feedlot. A completely randomized design was used, and data were submitted to analysis of variance and regression. The dry matter intake and digestibility coefficients of all nutrients increased linearly. The total weight gain and average daily gain added 1.16 kg and 9.90 g, respectively, for each 10 g/kg increase in concentrate. The empty body weight, hot carcass weight and cold carcass weight responded linearly to increasing concentrate. The hot carcass yield and cold carcass yield, gains in empty body weight and carcass gain were also influenced, as were the efficiencies of carcass deposition and carcass deposition rate. It is concluded that increasing concentrate levels in feedlot diets increase the intake and digestibility of dry matter and other nutrients, improving the feed efficiency, performance and physical characteristics of the carcass. Furthermore and of importance concerning the climate change debate, evidence from the literature indicates that enteric methane production would be reduced with increasing concentrate levels such as those used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acarcass weight 3acarcass yield 3aclimate change 3acold 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adry matter intake 3afeed conversion 3afeedlots 3amethane production 3anutrients 3aphysical activity 3asteers 3aweight gain1 aChaves Véras, Antônia Sherlanea1 ade Andrade Ferreira, Marcelo1 aMoreira Dutra, Wilson, Jr.cJr.1 aMenezes Wanderley Neves, Maria Luciana1 aOliveira Souza, Evaristo Jorge1 aRamos de Carvalho, Francisco Fernando1 ade Lima, Dorgival Morais, Jr.cJr.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2015 Oct., v. 47, no. 7 p.1307-1312dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-015-0864-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02434naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002900141245012000170520127000290592002801560650002301588650002401611650002001635650001801655650002401673650002201697650002301719700002501742700003001767700003101797700002701828700002401855773012001879856007601999852000902075655001202084IND60766838920221120163354.0220211e20220204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076683892DNAL7 a10.3390/ani120303832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcquadro Maran, Daniela 10aAnimal-Assisted Intervention and Health Care Workers’ Psychological Health: A Systematic Review of the Literature  aHealthcare settings have recently increased the use of companion animals in the workplace to provide emotional support to people with disabilities, but there is limited empirical research on the effects of these programs on healthcare workers. However, it is reasonable to speculate that Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAIs) may have positive effects on health care workers (HCWs) by buffering the negative effects of work-related stress and other occupational psychosocial risk factors. The aim of this review was to examine the beneficial effects of AAIs on the psychological well-being of HCWs. A systematic review was conducted in December 2021 to gain insight into the positive effects of pets on HCWs in the workplace. Searches were conducted in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, including studies between 2001 and December 2021, and 12 articles were included in the review. The results indicate that implementing the AAI program in a busy clinic is feasible and that the program is accepted by medical professionals because of the immense psychological benefits it provides. However, the healthcare professionals disliked the experimental design that forced them to leave their workplaces at a certain time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aempirical research 3aexperimental design 3ahealth services 3amental health 3aoccupational stress 3asystematic review 3aworking conditions1 aCapitanelli, Ilaria 1 aCortese, Claudio Giovanni1 aIlesanmi, Olayinka Stephen1 aGianino, Maria Michela1 aChirico, Francesco 0 tAnimals.g2022 Feb. 04, v. 12, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani120303833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03543naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007000148245016600218300001200384520200500396592002802401596006102429650002702490650002002517650000802537650001102545650002702556650000902583650002102592650001102613650001202624650001602636650000902652650002002661650001102681650000902692650001902701650001302720650001002733650001502743651001302758700003002771700002602801773014202827856008302969852000903052655001203061IND60793321620221117104103.0220922e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079332162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-022-05779-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaballero-Gallardo, Karina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8810-341210aMercury Concentrations in Water, Sediments, Soil, and Fish Around Ancestral Afro-Descendant Territories Impacted by Gold Mining in the Cauca Department, Colombia  ap. 393.  aAlthough mercury (Hg) is ubiquitously present in natural ecosystems, human activities have promoted its accumulation and toxicity in the environment. The aim of this study was to assess the concentrations of total Hg (T-Hg) in different environmental matrices from two territories of Afro-descendant communities: Aires of Garrapatero (CCAG) and Cauca River Basin, Micro Basin of the Teta and Mazamorrero Rivers (CCMTM). Total Hg (T-Hg) was quantified using a direct Hg analyzer. The average T-Hg values from water and sediments collected in CCAG (0.86 ± 0.09 µg/L and 0.18 ± 0.02 µg/g) were statistically similar to those from CCMTM (0.65 ± 0.08 µg/L and 1.72 ± 0.64 µg/g). However, high Hg levels were detected in sediments from the Teta River (4.67 ± 1.32 µg/g). Surface soil displayed a pattern similar to that registered in sediments (0.09 ± 0.01 µg/g vs. 0.42 ± 0.14 µg/g). The contamination factor and geo-accumulation index of Hg in soil showed a relatively high degree of pollution with Hg at sites near the Teta River. In most fish species examined (53%), T-Hg concentrations were above the WHO limit (0.5 μg/g), with the highest levels (> 1.0 µg/g) found in Pseudopimelodus bufonius (2.53 µg/g), Saccodon dariensis (1.75 μg/g), and Gilbertolus sp. (1.04 µg/g). The most economically important fish species, Prochilodus magdalenae, registered 0.56 ± 0.06 µg/g. Risk assessment based on Hg exposure from diet suggested that the current Hg levels found in local fish represent considerable health risks for children, pregnant women, and adults. In short, the Teta River is a hotspot for Hg pollution in the territory and requires urgent remediation programs to reduce environmental exposure to this toxic metal. Moreover, fish consumption from species collected in local water bodies represents a health risk to the community. Both educational and monitoring programs are required to reduce adverse effects from Hg exposure.  aPublisher supplied data  a943-2019cMinciencias, Minsalud, University of Cartagena 3aProchilodus magdalenae 3aPseudopimelodus 3aair 3abasins 3aenvironmental exposure 3afish 3afish consumption 3ahumans 3amercury 3aremediation 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3atoxicity 3awater 3awatersheds 3aColombia1 aPalomares-Bolaños, Jenny1 aOlivero-Verbel, Jesus0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2022 Sept., v. 233, no. 9 p.393-393dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-022-05779-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02642naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245018200163300001400345520120000359592002801559650002401587650001501611650002001626650002101646650001501667650001201682650001901694650001101713650001101724650001901735650001301754650001001767653002301777653002101800653001601821653002701837653002701864653002201891653002301913700001701936700001701953773011001970856008302080852000902163655001202172IND60591914220221120212553.0190325e20180630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059191422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2018.02.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXuan, Xing12aA wearable electrochemical glucose sensor based on simple and low-cost fabrication supported micro-patterned reduced graphene oxide nanocomposite electrode on flexible substrate  ap. 75-82.  aIn this study, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-based nanostructured composite working electrode of high quality was successfully microfabricated and micro-patterned on a flexible polyimide substrate using simple low-cost fabrication processes. Gold and platinum alloy nanoparticles were electrochemically deposited onto the microfabricated rGO surface and chitosan-glucose oxidase composites were integrated onto the modified surface of the working electrode to develop a human sweat-based wearable glucose sensor application. The fabricated biosensor exhibited excellent amperometric response to glucose at a detection range of 0–2.4 mM (covers the glucose range in sweat), with a sensitivity of 48 μA/mMcm2, a short response time (20 s), and high linearity (0.99). The detection limit for glucose was calculated as 5 µm. The human sweat/mixing glucose samples initially used for testing indicated acceptable detection performance and stability for low glucose concentrations. These results confirm that the proposed nanostructured composite flexible working electrode and fabrication process are highly promising for application as human sweat-based electrochemical glucose sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloy nanoparticles 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3agraphene oxide 3ahumans 3amixing 3ananocomposites 3aplatinum 3asweat 0aWearable biosensor 0aHigh sensitivity 0aHuman sweat 0aReduced graphene oxide 0aElectrochemical sensor 0aMicro-fabrication 0aFlexible electrode1 aYoon, Hyo S.1 aPark, Jae Y.0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2018 June 30, v. 109 p.75-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.02.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008300171300001600254520087200270592002801142650001401170650002401184650001201208650001201220650001301232650002501245650002801270650001501298650001401313650002101327650001301348650001101361650001901372653002101391653002401412653001301436653001401449700002501463700002601488773011901514856008501633852000901718655001201727IND60568761220221121181806.0170515e20170703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056876122DNAL7 a10.1080/15226514.2016.12784232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarzi, Abolfazl14aThe use of halophytic plants for salt phytoremediation in constructed wetlands  ap. 643-650.  aThis research studied the use of constructed wetlands (CWs) to reduce water salinity. For this purpose, three halophytic species of the Chenopodiaceae family (Salicornia europaea, Salsola crassa , and Bienertia cycloptera) that are resistant to saline conditions were planted in the CWs, and experiments were conducted at three different salinity levels [electrical conductivity (EC)∼2, 6, 10 dS/m]. EC and concentrations of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sodium (Na), and chlorine (Cl) were measured before and after phytoremediation with a retention time of 1 week. The results suggested that these plants were able to grow well and complete their life cycles at all the salinity levels within this study. Moreover, these plants reduced the measured parameters to acceptable levels. Therefore, these plants can be considered good options for salt phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBienertia 3aSalicornia europaea 3aSalsola 3acalcium 3achlorine 3aconstructed wetlands 3aelectrical conductivity 3ahalophytes 3amagnesium 3aphytoremediation 3aplanting 3asodium 3awater salinity 0aphytoremediation 0aconstructed wetland 0asalinity 0ahalophyte1 aBorghei, Seyed Mehdi1 aVossoughi, Manouchehr0 tInternational journal of phytoremediation.g2017 July 3, v. 19, no. 7 p.643-650dTaylor & Francisx1549-78797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2016.12784233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02371naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009800170300001500268520108900283592002801372650001101400650002001411650001101431650001301442650001101455650001501466650002601481650001501507650001101522650002301533650001401556650001301570650001501583650001501598651001401613700002301627700002101650700002201671700002301693773011901716856008101835852000901916655001201925IND60440011820221119161252.0160903e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044001182DNAL7 a10.1007/s11252-006-0014-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaker, Lawrence A.10aEffect of consumption choices on fluxes of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus through households  ap. 97-117.  aHouseholds are an important scale of analysis for human ecosystems because they are a major source of pollutants and could thus be a new focus for pollution management, particularly for education-based source reduction strategies. The household is also a meaningful unit for analysis of human ecosystems, being common to all human cultures. This study develops a Household Flux Calculator (HFC) to compute C, N, and P fluxes for scenarios intended to represent three levels of household consumption: low, typical, and high. All three scenarios were developed for suburban households with two adults and two children in the Minneapolis-St. Paul (Twin Cities) metropolitan area, Minnesota. Calculated ratios of fluxes between high and low consumption households were 3.5:1 for C, 2.7:1 for N and 1.4:1 for P. Results suggest a high level of discretionary consumption that could be reduced without a substantial reduction in standard of living. Thus, modest changes in behavior in high consumption households would greatly reduce fluxes of C, N, and P without major changes in lifestyle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abehavior change 3acarbon 3achildren 3acities 3aecosystems 3ahousehold consumption 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3ahydrofluorocarbons 3alifestyle 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3aMinnesota1 aHartzheim, Paul M.1 aHobbie, Sarah E.1 aKing, Jennifer Y.1 aNelson, Kristen C.0 tUrban ecosystems.g2007 June, v. 10, no. 2 p.97-117dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx1083-81557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11252-006-0014-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167500001900255520164600274592002801920650001601948650001201964650002201976650001801998650001302016650001102029650002102040650000902061650001402070650001302084650002102097653002502118653002102143653002902164653002602193700001602219700001902235773010402254856008502358852000902443655001202452IND60696850620221119065758.0200621e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069685062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1096322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Ji Hui10aKinetic analysis and catalytic pyrolysis of spent medicinal herb over HZSM-5 and HY  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this study, the kinetic analysis on the pyrolysis of a spent medicinal herb, namely spent Achyranthes root, is performed using a thermogravimetric analyzer and a model-free kinetic analysis method, allowing the calculation of activation energy values without the assumption of kinetic model. Owing to the structural change of lignin and elimination of hemicellulose during the decoction of raw Achyranthes root, the thermogravimetric analysis results show a large difference between the derivative thermogravimetry curves of spent and raw Achyranthes roots. The average apparent activation energy value of spent Achyranthes root, obtained from the non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis, are found to be lower than those of raw Achyranthes root. This comes as a result of the much lower content of hemicellulose in spent Achyranthes root caused by the hemicellulose elimination from raw Achyranthes root during the decoction process. The catalytic fast pyrolysis of spent Achyranthes root over HZSM5-30 (HZSM-5 with SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 30) and HY30 (HY with SiO₂/Al₂O₃ = 30) was performed using a two-stage fixed-bed reactor system. The catalytic fast pyrolysis of spent Achyranthes root over both HY30 and HZSM5-30 produced the much larger amount of aromatic hydrocarbons, compared to the non-catalytic fast pyrolysis, with a parallel decrease of oxygen-containing pyrolyzates. Owing to its robust pore structure and high acidity, it was the HZSM5-30 that produced the highest quality oil during the catalytic fast pyrolysis of spent Achyranthes root, having higher selectivity of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons compared to HY30.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAchyranthes 3aacidity 3aactivation energy 3ahemicellulose 3akinetics 3alignin 3amedicinal plants 3aoils 3apyrolysis 3aresearch 3athermogravimetry 0aSpent medicinal herb 0aKinetic analysis 0aCatalytic fast pyrolysis 0aAromatic hydrocarbons1 aPark, Y.-K.1 aKim, Young-Min0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 Aug., v. 187 p.109632-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1096323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100003200156245011800188300001800306520115900324592002801483650002301511650003801534650001401572650001701586650002601603650001401629650001301643650000901656650003301665650002101698650004901719650005201768650006901820650001701889650002201906650003501928650007401963650002402037650003602061650002402097650002102121650005202142653001702194653002302211653001102234653002402245653001902269700003802288700002802326700002602354700003402380700003102414773014702445852000902592856007502601655001202676IND4463108420160905000000.0160905e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446310842DNAL7 a222244012pmid7 a10.1021/jf20374832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores-Céspedes, Francisco10aPreparation and Characterization of Imidacloprid Lignin–Polyethylene Glycol Matrices Coated with Ethylcellulose  ap. 1042-1051.  aImidacloprid, a systemic insecticide that has a water solubility of 610 mg L–¹, has been formulated in lignin–polyethylene glycol matrices by a melting process. This formulation was coated in a Wurster type fluidized-bed equipment using ethylcellulose and dibutyl sebacate. Imidacloprid has been entrapped, with an entrapment efficiency higher than 87% in all cases. Thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy studies indicate the stability and compatibility of polymers and imidacloprid. Scanning electron microscopy images show a homogeneous film of ethylcellulose in coated formulations. From T₅₀ values (the time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released into water), the release rate of imidacloprid is controlled by changing the thickness of the coating film and modifying its surface properties by adding a plasticizer. T₅₀ values, ranging from 3.02 to 168.6 h, allow supplying the appropriate amount of imidacloprid in each specific agronomic practice to increase the efficiency of this bioactive material and minimize the risk of environmental pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aequipment 3aimidacloprid 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3apollution 3apolymers 3arisk 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awater solubility 2aCellulosexanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aDelayed-Action Preparationsxchemical synthesis 2aImidazolesxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aInsecticides 2aLigninxchemistry 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNitro Compoundsxadministration & dosagexadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aChemical Phenomena. 2aPolyethylene Glycolsxchemistry 2aPolymersxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxprevention & control 0aimidacloprid 0acontrolled release 0alignin 0apolyethylene glycol 0aethylcellulose1 aFigueredo-Flores, Cristina Isabel1 aDaza-Fernández, Isabel1 aVidal-Peña, Fernando1 aVillafranca-Sánchez, Matilde1 aFernández Pérez, Manuel,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2012 Feb. 01, v. 60, no. 4 p.1042-1051dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf20374833Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02719naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245012300162300002000285520128600305592002801591650002101619650001301640650001501653650002701668650001501695650001301710650000801723650001301731650000901744650001801753650001301771653001001784653001901794653001801813653001501831653001701846700001401863700001501877700005301892700001701945700005801962773014202020856007802162852000902240655001202249IND60748880920221123020441.0210827e20210811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074888092DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c094912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, Qingqing10aHighly Efficient Self-Repairing Slippery Liquid-Infused Surface with Promising Anti-Icing and Anti-Fouling Performance  ap. 40032-40041.  aSmart slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPSs) have aroused remarkable attention owing to tremendous application foreground in biomedical instruments and industry. However, challenges still remain in fabricating durable SLIPSs. In this work, a fast and highly efficient self-repairing slippery surface (SPU-60M) was fabricated based on a polyurethane membrane and silicone oil. By introducing a great quantity of reversible disulfide bonds into the polymer backbone and hydrogen bonds in the polymer interchain, this SLIPS material could be quickly repaired in 15 min with 97.8% healing efficiency. Moreover, the self-healing efficiency could be maintained at 42.75% after the 10th cutting–healing cycle. Notably, SPU-60M showed excellent self-repairing ability not only in an ambient environment but also in an underwater environment and at ultralow temperatures. Besides, the icing delay time (DT) of SPU-60M could be prolonged to 1182 s at −15 °C, and the ice adhesion strength was only 10.33 kPa at −30 °C. In addition, SPU-60M had excellent anti-fouling performance with BSA adsorption of 2.41 μg/cm² and Escherichia coli CFU counts of 41 × 10⁴. These findings provide a facile way to design highly efficient self-repairing SLIPSs with multifunctionality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadhesion 3aadsorption 3aantifouling activities 3adisulfides 3ahydrogen 3aice 3aindustry 3aoils 3apolyurethanes 3asilicone 0aSLIPS 0aself-repairing 0aself-cleaning 0aanti-icing 0aanti-fouling1 aLu, Yulin1 aSong, Lina1 aHou, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9795-85031 aZhan, Xiaoli1 aZhang, Qinghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1350-63880 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Aug. 11, v. 13, no. 33 p.40032-40041dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c094913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03454naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002100179245015300200300001800353506007600371520222100447592002802668506003702696650001402733650001702747650002102764650002502785650001802810650001302828650002002841650001402861773013602875856007203011852000903083655001203092IND60661296920221207142710.0190829e20090921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066129692DNAL7 a10.1039/b909638h2doi7 aPMC29805012pmcid7 a197713342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerppola, Tom K.10aVisualization of molecular interactions using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis: Characteristics of protein fragment complementation  ap. 2876-2886.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInvestigations of the molecular processes that sustain life must include studies of these processes in their normal cellular environment. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay provides an approach for the visualization of protein interactions and modifications in living cells. This assay is based on the facilitated association of complementary fragments of a fluorescent protein that are fused to interaction partners. Complex formation by the interaction partners tethers the fluorescent protein fragments in proximity to each other, which can facilitate their association. The BiFC assay enables sensitive visualization of protein complexes with high spatial resolution. The temporal resolution of BiFC analysis is limited by the time required for fluorophore formation, as well as the stabilization of complexes by association of the fluorescent protein fragments. Many modifications and enhancements to the BiFC assay have been developed. The multicolor BiFC assay enables simultaneous visualization of multiple protein complexes in the same cell, and can be used to investigate competition among mutually exclusive interaction partners for complex formation in cells. The ubiquitin-mediated fluorescence complementation (UbFC) assay enables visualization of covalent ubiquitin family peptide conjugation to substrate proteins in cells. The BiFC assay can also be used to visualize protein binding to specific chromatin domains, as well as other molecular scaffolds in cells. BiFC analysis therefore provides a powerful approach for the visualization of a variety of processes that affect molecular proximity in living cells. The visualization of macromolecular interactions and modifications is of great importance owing to the central roles of proteins, nucleic acids and other macromolecular complexes in the regulation of cellular functions. This tutorial review describes the BiFC assay, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of this experimental approach. The review will be of interest to scientists interested in the investigation of macromolecular interactions or modifications who need exquisite sensitivity for the detection of their complexes or conjugates of interest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromatin 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3afluorescent proteins 3anucleic acids 3apeptides 3aprotein binding 3aubiquitin0 tChemical Society reviews.g2009 Sept. 21, v. 38, no. 10 p.2876-2886dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b909638h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01780naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245007200160300001800232520063900250592002800889650001500917650001100932650001200943650001300955650001700968650003300985650001101018650003301029650000801062650003701070700001901107700001701126700001901143700001901162773012201181856008201303852000901385655001201394IND60627458420221117021403.0220511e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062745842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-009-3571-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Feng10aCrossed-discs of mesoporous silica SBA-15 and their carbon replicas  ap. 6505-6511.  aCrossed-discs of mesoporous silica SBA-15 were synthesized by using tetramethylorthosilicate (TMOS) as silica source in the presence of Sn²⁺ cations.

Temperature, in conjunction with other environmental factors, controls plant development, including seed germination and its timing, which directly affects seedling survival. Indirectly, seed germination affects recruitment of individuals and hence the genetic dynamics of grasslands communities. Cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.) is a major species growing in temperate and Mediterranean grasslands. Six accessions of D. glomerata, including four natural populations and two commercial varieties were evaluated for their responses to eight constant temperatures, from 5 to 40 ℃, with increases by 5 ℃. Four replicates of one-hundred seeds per accession were put in the dark and counted for germination at variable frequencies and duration that depended on temperature treatments. We estimated maximum germination percentage, maximum germination rate as well as apparent initial time and time when 50% of seed germinate. The F test showed significant difference (P < 0.01) between the response curves of various accessions. At least four types of responses can be distinguished. Temperature for maximum germination ranged from 5 to 25 ℃, depending on accessions. The results of this study reveal the existence of intraspecific genetic variability during germination in D. glomerata for the response to temperature. Such variability could be used to select new varieties adapted to thermal conditions induced by ongoing climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDactylis glomerata 3aclimate change 3agenetic variation 3aintraspecific variation 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3atemperature1 aEscobar-Gutiérrez, Abraham J.0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2022 Nov., v. 44, no. 11 p.117-117dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl33879x0137-58817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-022-03439-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245017300176300001800349500001400367520097200381592002801353650002201381650002201403650001201425650002701437650000701464650001001471650000901481650002801490650001801518650001301536650001401549650001801563650001501581650001601596700003001612700002101642700002801663700002201691700005801713700002701771773012701798856008201925852000902007655001202016IND60704901620221123035155.0200727e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070490162DNAL7 a10.1007/s12649-019-00795-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomínguez-Robles, Juan10aCoagulation–Flocculation as an Alternative Way to Reduce the Toxicity of the Black Liquor from the Paper Industry: Thermal Valorization of the Solid Biomass Recovered  ap. 4731-4742.  aNAL-light  aPulp and paper mills generate a huge amount of wastewater and some of them, especially non-wood paper mills, do not possess recovery systems.

Furthermore, the calorific potential of the solid fraction generated after these treatments was investigated with the aim of enhancing this residue. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), turbidity and total solids (TS) were determined in the supernatants obtained from the different coagulation–flocculation processes. The treatment with poly (ethylene oxide) at pH 2.0 achieved the maximum reduction of TS (66%), COD (75%) and Turbidity (95%) in the black liquor and the precipitated solid fraction with the highest calorific value (19.9 MJ/kg).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum chloride 3aammonium chloride 3abiomass 3achemical oxygen demand 3apH 3apaper 3apulp 3apulp and paper industry 3araw materials 3atoxicity 3aturbidity 3awaste liquors 3awastewater 3awheat straw1 aPalenzuela, Mª del Valle1 aSánchez, Rafael1 aLoaiza, Javier Mauricio1 aEspinosa, Eduardo1 aRosal, Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4726-51991 aRodríguez, Alejandro,0 tWaste and biomass valorization.g2020 Sept., v. 11, no. 9 p.4731-4742dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:6304x1877-26417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12649-019-00795-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03039naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245009200211300001800303506007600321520162300397592002802020506003702048650001402085650001402099650002002113650002002133650001002153650001302163650001402176650001802190650003602208650001602244650003102260700002302291700001902314700006302333773011702396856008302513852000902596655001202605IND60608156720221207113332.0180807e20180523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060815672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b003272doi7 aPMC63705542pmcid7 a297911332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTekel, Stefan J.10aDesign, Construction, and Validation of Histone-Binding Effectors in Vitro and in Cells  ap. 4707-4716.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChromatin is a system of nuclear proteins and nucleic acids that plays a pivotal role in gene expression and cell behavior and is therefore the subject of intense study for cell development and cancer research. Biochemistry, crystallography, and reverse genetics have elucidated the macromolecular interactions that drive chromatin regulation. One of the central mechanisms is the recognition of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on histone proteins by a family of nuclear proteins known as “readers”. This knowledge has launched a wave of activity around the rational design of proteins that interact with histone PTMs. Useful molecular tools have emerged from this work, enabling researchers to probe and manipulate chromatin states in live cells. Chromatin-based proteins represent a vast design space that remains underexplored. Therefore, we have developed a rapid prototyping platform to identify engineered fusion proteins that bind histone PTMs in vitro and regulate genes near the same histone PTMs in living cells. We have used our system to build gene activators with strong avidity for the gene silencing-associated histone PTM H3K27me3. Here, we describe procedures and data for cell-free production of fluorescently tagged fusion proteins, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based measurement of histone PTM binding, and a live cell assay to demonstrate that the fusion proteins modulate transcriptional activation at a site that carries the target histone PTM. This pipeline will be useful for synthetic biologists who are interested in designing novel histone PTM-binding actuators and probes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aactuators 3achromatin 3acrystallography 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahistones 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acids 3apost-translational modification 3aresearchers 3atranscriptional activation1 aBarrett, Cassandra1 aVargas, Daniel1 aHaynes, Karmella A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5975-577X0 tBiochemistry.g2018 May 23, v. 57, no. 31 p.4707-4716dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b003273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04241naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245014200186300001600328500001500344520183900359592002802198650001702226650001502243650002102258650001002279650000802289650001802297650001702315650001002332650001502342650001302357650002002370650002202390650001302412650001402425650002102439650001502460650001002475650000902485650003602494650004302530650003902573650004702612650003702659650004602696650004002742650004002782650001102822650001102833650001602844650002402860650004602884650002602930650003402956650003802990650004303028650001603071653001703087700002103104700002003125700002003145700001603165700001903181700002203200700002103222700001803243773010803261856008103369852000903450655001203459IND4480091920221121095453.0151024e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448009192DNAL7 a229034722pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-012-0715-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzkandera, Joanna10aAnalysis of functional germline polymorphisms for prediction of response to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer  ap. 755-764.  a2019-12-06  aTo elucidate the role of predictive factors on individual’s drug response, based on genetic variation, we examined the association between eight germline polymorphisms in genes involved in protection against oxidative stress, apoptosis, oncogenic transformation, proliferation, immune response and DNA repair (TP53, NQO1, IL6, TLR4 and XRCC1) and the pathological response to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 70 patients with breast cancer. The DNA was genotyped for eight polymorphisms in five genes (TP53, NQO1, IL6, TLR4 and XRCC1) by 5′-exonuclease (TaqMan™) technology. Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the association between genotype, clinicopathological parameters and pathological response. A good pathological response, defined as a pathological complete response or residual isolated invasive tumor cells, was found significantly more frequently for estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative breast carcinomas compared to ER and PR positive and ER or PR positive carcinomas, respectively (43.5 vs. 37.5 and 10.3 %, p = 0.006), and was significantly associated with high tumor grade (G3) (p = 0.002). A non-significant trend towards a good pathological response was shown in patients carrying the Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro TP53 codon 72 gene variant compared to those harboring the Pro/Pro variant (17.6 or 37.9 % vs. 0; p = 0.071). No association was found between NQO1 Pro187Ser, IL6 −174G>C, TLR4 Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile, and XRCC1 Arg194Trp, Arg399Gln and Arg280His and pathological response. The present study shows hormone receptor status and tumor grade as predictors for pathological response to neoadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

We researched the dynamic feature of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its components at different growth stages of winter wheat under different mulching methods, including microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), mineralizable carbon (PCM) and easily oxidized carbon (EOC). The results showed that SOC and its components in different soil layers decreased with an increase of soil layer depth. Compared with CK, the SM treatment increased SOC in the 0–40 cm soil layer by 2.83–8.92%, MBC by 12.09–18.40%, DOC by 3.73–9.79%, PCM by 4.82–12.48% and EOC by 6.01–11.68% during the different periods, and an overall increase was greater in the 0–20 cm soil layer than in the 20–40 cm soil layer. The impact of PM on SOC was less significant compared with CK; MBC and PCM had an overall positive effect, and DOC and EOC behaved differently from year to year. In conclusion, SM can improve SOC and its components content in dryland of northwest China, which is conducive to the sustainable management and efficient utilization of maize straw resources and has significant ecological benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3acorn straw 3afield experimentation 3amicrobial carbon 3aoxidation 3aplastic film 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3awater 3awinter wheat 3aChina1 aCheng, Chipi 1 aWang, Zeyi 1 aZhao, Xia 1 aYang, Yong 1 aHu, Liangliang 1 aLi, Yazhen 1 aMa, Juhua 1 aWang, Longlong 1 aChang, Lei 1 aYe, Yuansheng 1 aZhang, Hengjia 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 27, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141726453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02460naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006300146245005200209300001800261500001900279520115600298592002801454650002501482650001701507650001501524650001201539650000901551650001101560650001201571650001401583650003301597650001301630650002101643650002501664700002001689700002001709700002801729700005701757773013501814856008001949852000902029655001202038IND60728211820210618000000.0210218e20210203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072821182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c109192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBettscheider, Simon1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6068-246X10aBundling of Nanowires Induced by Unbound Ligand  ap. 3590-3598.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report on the dilution-induced agglomeration of ultrathin gold nanowires (AuNWs) into regular bundles. Wires with a metal core diameter of 1.6–1.7 nm surrounded by a ligand shell of oleylamine formed stable colloids in n-hexane and cyclohexane. Dilution with pure solvent induced the self-assembly into bundles with a regular, hexagonal cross-section. Small-angle X-ray scattering and thermogravimetric analysis indicated that bundles formed only if the ligand shell was sufficiently sparse. Dilution with pure solvent shifts the chemical equilibrium and reduces the ligand density, thus enabling agglomeration. We show that agglomeration is driven not by van der Waals forces but by the depletion forces of linearly shaped molecules. Linear solvent molecules or small amounts of unbound ligand align normal to the nanowire if the ligand shell is sparse. The resulting reduction in entropy creates a driving force for the AuNWs to bundle such that the low-entropy domains overlap and the overall entropy is increased. Dilution-induced nanowire bundling is thus explained as a combined effect of ligand desorption and destabilization by depletion.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical equilibrium 3acyclohexanes 3adesorption 3aentropy 3agold 3ahexane 3aligands 3ananowires 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 3asolvents 3athermogravimetry 3avan der Waals forces1 aKuttich, Björn1 aEngel, Lukas F.1 aGonzález-García, Lola1 aKraus, Tobias1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2951-17040 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 03, v. 125, no. 6 p.3590-3598dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c109193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100002200180245009100202300001600293506007600309520109900385592002801484506003701512650002901549650002601578650001201604650001401616650001001630650001101640650002501651650000901676650001901685650001301704650001501717650002401732650001201756700002401768700001801792700002001810700001801830700002601848700002101874700002601895700001901921700002001940700002601960773015301986856007502139852000902214655001202223IND60549362020221207071257.0160908e20120323xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054936202DNAL7 a10.1021/np200797x2doi7 aPMC33136842pmcid7 a223247232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPettit, George R.10aAntineoplastic Agents. 548.

The diiodo series was obtained via 8a and 9c from condensation of 4 and 6, and the iodo sequence involved a parallel pathway. Both series of iodocombstatins were found to display significant to powerful inhibition of the growth of a panel of human cancer cell lines and of the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia cell line. Of the diiodo series, 12a was also found to markedly inhibit growth of pediatric neuroblastoma, and monoiodocombstatin 9a strongly inhibited HUVEC growth. Overall, the strongest activity was found against the breast, CNS, leukemia, lung, and prostate cancer cell lines and the least activity against the pancreas and colon lines.

The use of thermal treatment being discordant with the plastic substrate, the mesoporosity was realized by chemical extraction or infrared annealing. Silver was then introduced in the film porosity in the form of ions by soaking the films into a silver salt. A reversible photochromic behavior was successfully demonstrated after successive cycles of UV and visible laser exposures without degrading the PET substrate. This laser-induced colour changes are based on the reversible growth and dissociation of silver nanoparticles within the titania matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acolor 3adissociation 3aevaporation 3afilms (materials) 3aheat treatment 3aions 3ananocomposites 3ananosilver 3aporosity 3asilver 3asoaking 3atitanium dioxide1 aVocanson, F.1 aChaussy, D.1 aBeneventi, D.1 aReynaud, S.1 aLefkir, Y.1 aDestouches, N.0 tRSC advances.g2014 Nov. 18, v. 4, no. 106 p.61305-61312dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08804b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003500140245011000175300001600285500002000301520156500321592002801886650002601914650002001940650002401960650001401984650002801998700003702026700007002063773011202133856007502245852000902320655001202329IND60786735620221119121742.0220805e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078673562DNAL7 a10.1002/csc2.203342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoreira, Édimo Fernando Alves10aCan statistical learning models make early selection among sugarcane families easier and still efficient?  ap. 456-465.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe selection of genotypes at the early stages is one of the main challenges facing sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) breeding programs. The present work aimed to compare classification techniques, namely, logistic regression (LR), k‐nearest neighbor (KNN), random forests (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) against the selection among families of sugarcane via artificial neural networks (ANN) and via a procrefers to the families incorrectly selected byedure based on the weighing of the plots. The data used in this work were obtained from 110 families. In the families, the number of stalks (NS), stalk diameter (SD), and stalk height (SH) were collected, in addition to the actual yield, expressed in tons of cane per hectare (TCH). We considered the NS, SD, and SH as explanatory variables for the training of the classifiers. The response used was the indicator Y = 0 if the family is not selected via TCH or Y = 1 otherwise. To increase the efficiency in training, we produced synthetic data based on the simulation of NS, SD, SH, and TCH values. Two models were also considered: a full model with all the predictors and a reduced model without the SH. We used the apparent error rate (AER) and the true positive rate (TPR) for the evaluation of the classifiers. All classifiers present low values for the AER and high values for the TPR in both models. The best performance was observed in the SVM. The reduced model should be preferred, since its performance is very close to that of the full model and its operation is more straightforward.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum officinarum 3aearly selection 3aregression analysis 3asugarcane 3asupport vector machines1 aBarbosa, Marcio Henrique Pereira1 aPeternelli, Luiz Alexandre1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7683-05830 tCrop science.g2021 Jan., v. 61, no. 1 p.456-465dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/csc2.203343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011400155520127000269592002801539650001301567650001101580650001801591650001401609650001601623651001001639700001201649700001601661773012701677856007301804852000901877655001201886IND60651881620221120150243.0190712e20161217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065188162DNAL7 a10.3390/su81213352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shaoli10aAnalysis of Aluminum Resource Supply Structure and Guarantee Degree in China Based on Sustainable Perspective  aAluminum is a strategic mineral resource, and China’s aluminum production and consumption is fairly large. However, its supply guarantee is uncertain because of a high dependency on external raw materials. This uncertainty may expand, so finding a way to reduce the uncertainty of aluminum resource supply is especially important. This paper applies the SFA method to analyze the aluminum flows in mainland China from 1996 to 2014, and establishes a supply structure model to measure its supply guarantee degree. The results claim that: (1) China’s aluminum production can satisfy demand and even create a surplus; (2) Domestic self-productive primary and secondary aluminum increased at an annual rate of 12% and 24%; (3) The proportion of self-productive secondary aluminum in the supply structure increased from 7.7% in 1996 to 12.8% in 2014, while that of primary aluminum decreased from 79.6% to 42.8%; (4) The total supply guarantee degree decreased from 87.3% to 55.6% in this period. These results provide a feasible way to solve this plight: the proportion of secondary aluminum in the supply structure should be enhanced, and an efficient aluminum resource recycling system needs to be established as soon as possible to ensure its sustainable supply.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3amodels 3araw materials 3arecycling 3auncertainty 3aChina1 aLi, Xin1 aWang, Minxi0 tSustainability.g2016 Dec. 17, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su81213353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245009500171300001400266520087000280592002801150650002301178650001001201650001101211650001801222650001601240650001001256650001601266650001101282650001301293650001101306650001801317650001301335650001901348650002001367650001901387653003001406653001201436653001501448653002501463653001801488653001101506653001401517653001301531700001901544700002501563700002001588773009801608856008701706852000901793655001201802IND60526099420221117013010.0190402e20161201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052609942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTippel, Janine10aInterfacial properties of Quillaja saponins and its use for micellisation of lutein esters  ap. 35-42.  aNatural food colourants, colouring foods and bioactive food ingredients need to be solubilised for their incorporation in food. Aim of the present study was to investigate the micelle-forming properties of saponins from Quillaja saponaria Mollina (QS) in order to solubilise a lutein ester extract for its incorporation in food matrices. QS showed a high surface activity and functionality with respect to micellisation as derived from interfacial tension measurements and subsequent data fitting to the classical Frumkin model. The composition of the aqueous phase affected the lutein ester incorporation as revealed by particle size, zeta potential and colour measurements. In terms of morphology of lutein ester loaded saponin micelles (LMS), cryo-TEM micrographs showed depending on the composition of the medium both, spherical and elongated branched micelles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja saponaria 3acolor 3aesters 3afood coloring 3afood matrix 3afoods 3aingredients 3alutein 3amicelles 3amodels 3aparticle size 3asaponins 3asolubilization 3asurface tension 3azeta potential 0aQuillaja saponaria Molina 0aSaponin 0aCarotenoid 0aLutein ester extract 0aMicellisation 0aColour 0aStability 0aCryo-TEM1 aLehmann, Maren1 avon Klitzing, Regine1 aDrusch, Stephan0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Dec. 01, v. 212 p.35-42dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02332naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245010100156300001600257520076600273592002801039650002101067650002501088650001801113650002001131650001801151650001201169650001101181650004301192650002301235650002101258650001101279650001101290650001301301650002001314650001701334650001301351653001601364653001801380653001601398653001601414653003001430653003101460700001501491700001801506700001601524700001801540773015901558856007601717852000901793655001201802IND60681661720221119165941.0200117e20180930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068166172DNAL7 a10.3920/QAS2018.12642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomas, M.10aEffect of dietary fibre addition in tomato sauce on the in vitro bioaccessibility of carotenoids  ap. 277-283.  aThe effect of inulin addition (5 and 10%) on the total antioxidant capacity, α-tocopherol and carotenoid contents, and in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of tomato sauces was investigated.

Plant growth before floral initiation was evaluated and plants were allowed to progress to flowering to evaluate seed production. A wide range of response was observed among entries ranging from no germination or plant death early in development to vigorous growth. Carrot grown under optimal conditions in the greenhouse served as a useful control to estimate tolerance indices in the field. New sources of heat and drought tolerance in subsp. carota and subsp. capillifolius accessions were identified with similar performance in both countries. Ecogeographic analysis demonstrated that environmental parameters at the collection location of germplasm were associated with heat and drought tolerance observed in field trials. Plants evaluated for tolerance were allowed to flower and seed was produced on selected plants with abiotic stress tolerance to develop populations or breeding pools and to initiate the development of carrot better adapted to climatic abiotic stress.  aPublisher supplied data  aGS14014cGlobal Crop Diversity Trust 3acarrots 3adeath 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aflowering 3agermination 3agermplasm 3agreenhouses 3aheat 3aplant growth 3asalt stress 3astress tolerance 3aBangladesh 3aPakistan1 aRolling, William R.1 aSenalik, Douglas1 aBolton, Adam.

Cerium sulfate, if formed during combustion, was below detection limits. Ceria nanoparticles were agglomerated within the soot matrix, with a mean aerodynamic diameter near 100 nm. The dissolution of cerium from the dried ceria catalyst in synthetic soft water was extremely small (<0.0006% or <0.2 µg Ce/L), with particles being highly agglomerated (<450 nm). Agglomeration was reduced in the presence of humic acid. In the combusted samples, soot was dominant, and the solubility of cerium in soft water showed an almost 100‐fold increase in the <1 nm fraction compared to that before combustion. It appeared that the nano‐CeO₂remained agglomerated within the soot matrix and would not be present as dispersed nanoparticles in aquatic or soil environments. Despite the increased dissolution, the solubility was not sufficient for the combusted ceria to represent a risk in aquatic ecosystems. The predicted environmental concentrations were still orders of magnitude below the predicted no effects concentration of near 1 mg/L. In the soil environment, any cerium released from soot materials would interact with natural colloids, decreasing cerium concentrations in soil solutions and further minimizing the potential risk to soil organisms.

Covering with non-woven polypropylene and perforated film was found to increase the yield of spring garlic cv ‘Jarus’ by 24.5% in comparison to open-field cultivation (control). Nevertheless the film type covered plants were higher, produced more leaves and longer leaves what resulted in higher weight per plant. On the other hand the leaves of garlic grown in open field contained significantly higher amount of dry matter and vitamin C compared to covered ones. Marketable yield of garlic was also considerably dependent of clove sowing rate. The highest yield was observed while 20x2 cm density was applied. However, significantly longest leaves and highest weight per plant were obtained at 20x4 cm sowing rate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aascorbic acid 3achemical composition 3acloves 3acrop yield 3agarlic 3aleaves 3apolyethylene film 3apolypropylenes 3asowing 3aspring 0aspring garlic 0atype of covers 0aplanting density 0acultivated for bundle-harvest 0ayield1 aSkupień, Katarzyna0 tJournal of Fruit and Ornamental Plant Research.g2007 Jan. 01, v. 66, no. 1 p.17-24dVersitawJournal:21649x1231-09487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10032-007-0003-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010200171300001600273520193500289592002802224650002802252650001602280650002302296650001202319650002102331650001502352650001502367650001402382650002702396650001202423650001002435650001502445651001102460653002102471653002002492653001802512700001902530700001602549700002002565773012702585856008802712852000902800655001202809IND60534502020221119065328.0190318e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053450202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBronner, Anne13aAn optimal cut-off point for the calving interval may be used as an indicator of bovine abortions  ap. 386-390.  aThe bovine abortion surveillance system in France aims to detect as early as possible any resurgence of bovine brucellosis, a disease of which the country has been declared free since 2005. It relies on the mandatory notification and testing of each aborting cow, but under-reporting is high. This research uses a new and simple approach which considers the calving interval (CI) as a “diagnostic test” to determine optimal cut-off point c and estimate diagnostic performance of the CI to identify aborting cows, and herds with multiple abortions (i.e. three or more aborting cows per calving season). The period between two artificial inseminations (AI) was considered as a “gold standard”. During the 2006–2010 calving seasons, the mean optimal CI cut-off point for identifying aborting cows was 691 days for dairy cows and 703 days for beef cows. Depending on the calving season, production type and scale at which c was computed (individual or herd), the average sensitivity of the CI varied from 42.6% to 64.4%; its average specificity from 96.7% to 99.7%; its average positive predictive value from 27.6% to 65.4%; and its average negative predictive value from 98.7% to 99.8%. When applied to the French bovine population as a whole, this indicator identified 2–3% of cows suspected to have aborted, and 10–15% of herds suspected of multiple abortions. The optimal cut-off point and CI performance were consistent over calving seasons. By applying an optimal CI cut-off point to the cattle demographics database, it becomes possible to identify herds with multiple abortions, carry out retrospective investigations to find the cause of these abortions and monitor a posteriori compliance of farmers with their obligation to report abortions for brucellosis surveillance needs. Therefore, the CI could be used as an indicator of abortions to help improve the current mandatory notification surveillance system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial insemination 3abeef cattle 3abovine brucellosis 3acalving 3acalving interval 3acompliance 3adairy cows 3adatabases 3ademographic statistics 3afarmers 3aherds 3amonitoring 3aFrance 0aCalving interval 0aBovine abortion 0aCut-off point1 aMorignat, Eric1 aGay, Emilie1 aCalavas, Didier0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 121, no. 3-4 p.386-390dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245007600211300001200287506007600299520128000375592002801655506003701683650001201720650001701732650002101749650001501770650004301785650003501828700002601863700002101889700002301910700002101933700002301954700002101977700002001998700002302018700002002041700002102061700002002082773011602102856008202218852000902300655001202309IND60590402920221207055333.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059040292DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-017-1197-x2doi7 aPMC57515752pmcid7 a292973262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJatayev, Satyvaldy10aAdvantages of Amplifluor-like SNP markers over KASP in plant genotyping  ap. 254.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: KASP (KBioscience Competitive Allele Specific PCR) and Amplifluor (Amplification with fluorescence) SNP markers are two prominent technologies based upon a shared identical Allele-specific PCR platform. METHODS: Amplifluor-like SNP and KASP analysis was carried out using published and own design of Universal probes (UPs) and Gene-specific primers (GSPs). RESULTS: Advantages of the Amplifluor-like system over KASP include the significantly lower costs and much greater flexibility in the adjustment and development of ‘self-designed’ dual fluorescently-labelled UPs and regular GSPs. The presented results include optimisation of ‘tail’ length in UPs and GSPs, protocol adjustment, and the use of various fluorophores in different qPCR instruments. The compatibility of the KASP Master-mix in both original and Amplifluor-like systems has been demonstrated in the presented results, proving their similar principles. Results of SNP scoring with rare alleles in addition to more frequently occurring alleles are shown. CONCLUSIONS: The Amplifluor-like system produces SNP genotyping results with a level of sensitivity and accuracy comparable to KASP but at a significantly cheaper cost and with much greater flexibility for UPs with self-designed GSPs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agenotyping 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aKurishbayev, Akhylbek1 aZotova, Lyudmila1 aKhasanova, Gulmira1 aSerikbay, Dauren1 aZhubatkanov, Askar1 aBotayeva, Makpal1 aZhumalin, Aibek1 aTurbekova, Arysgul1 aSoole, Kathleen1 aLangridge, Peter1 aShavrukov, Yuri0 tBMC plant biology.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no.

However, less attention has been given to competition between female kin and co-residents. It has been argued that reproductive conflict between generations explains the evolution of menopause in cooperatively breeding species where females disperse, and that older females are related to the offspring of younger females through their sons, whereas younger, incoming females are unrelated to older females. This means the pattern of help will be asymmetric, so older females lose in reproductive conflict and become ‘sterile helpers'. Here, we seek evidence for female reproductive competition using longitudinal demographic data from a rural Gambian population, and examine when women are helping or harming each other's reproductive success. We find that older women benefit and younger women suffer costs of reproductive competition with women in their compound. But the opposite is found for mothers and daughters; if mother and daughter's reproductive spans overlap, the older woman reduces her reproduction if the younger woman (daughter) reproduces, whereas daughters' fertility is unaffected by their mothers' reproduction. Married daughters are not generally co-resident with their mothers, so we find not only competition effects with co-resident females, but also with daughters who have dispersed. Dispersal varies across human societies, but our results suggest reproductive conflict could be influencing reproductive scheduling whatever the dispersal pattern. A cultural norm of late male marriage reduces paternal grandmother/daughter-in-law reproductive overlap almost to zero in this population. We argue that cultural norms surrounding residence and marriage are themselves cultural adaptations to reduce reproductive conflict between generations in human families.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abreeding 3adaughters 3aevolution 3afemales 3ahumans 3amarriage 3amenopause 3amothers 3arural families 3asons 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aFamilyxpsychology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Mortality 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aMenopause 2aMiddle Aged 2aMothers 2aNuclear Family 2aReproductive Behaviorxpsychology 2aResidence Characteristics 2aRural Population 2aSocial Behavior 2aWomenxpsychology 2aYoung Adult 3aGambia 0aGambia1 aAlvergne, Alexandra0 tProceedings.g2012 June 7, v. 279, no. 1736 p.2219-2227dRoyal Societyx0962-84527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2011.2424  aDNAL 7aarticle03369naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016900169500001900338520172000357592002802077650002502105650002902130650001202159650002202171650002302193650001802216650001802234650001102252650001302263650000702276650002102283650001702304650000902321653001802330653001902348653004102367653003602408700001402444700001702458700001402475700001902489700001802508700001402526700005702540700005502597773010302652856008702755852000902842655001202851IND60699768920221121004242.0210114e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069976892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Xiaoyang10aProgrammed antibacterial and mineralization therapy for dental caries based on zinc-substituted hydroxyapatite/ alendronate-grafted polyacrylic acid hybrid material  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe domination of cariogenic bacteria in dental plaque biofilms is the primary cause of dental caries. In view of this, for the purpose of an effective treatment of dental caries, it is of great importance to inhibit the activity of acidogenic bacteria and promote the remineralization of damaged teeth simultaneously. However, the expensive antibacterial agents and poor mineralization ability of materials limit the practical applications. Biomineralization regulated by non-collagenous proteins (NCPs) gives hints to combine the remineralization ability of NCPs with accessible antibacterial property effectively. In this work, we propose a programmed antibacterial and remineralization strategy for the therapy of dental caries based on zinc-substituted hydroxyapatite/ alendronate-grafted polyacrylic acid hybrid nanoneedles (ZHA@ALN-PAA). This hybrid material dissolves in the acidic caries environment and regulate the pH to nearly neutral (6.5). Abundant calcium/ phosphate ions are supplemented and the ALN-PAA embedded in it has also been released, which assists the biomineralization on tooth defect. It has been revealed that the inhibition ratio of ZHA@ALN-PAA against Streptococcus mutans is the highest (11.25 folds that of HA), which originates from the highest zinc ions released (132.9 mg/L). Besides, the interspace of etched enamel is fully filled with regenerated nanorods and the surface microhardness (SMH) is significantly improved (3.68 folds that of etched enamel) after only 3 days of mineralization in vitro. This strategy developed here is simple and cost-effective, which can be referred to design the effective anti-caries materials applied for clinic treatment and daily oral care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptococcus mutans 3aantibacterial properties 3abiofilm 3abiomineralization 3acost effectiveness 3adental caries 3adental plaque 3aenamel 3ananorods 3apH 3apolyacrylic acid 3atherapeutics 3azinc 0aAntibacterial 0aMineralization 0aAlendronate-grafted polyacrylic acid 0aZinc-substituted hydroxyapatite1 aWang, Nan1 aWu, Mingzhen1 aWang, Jie1 aWang, Dingqian1 aChen, Zhuoxin1 aXie, Jing1 aDing, Chunmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7399-34591 aLi, Jianshu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1522-73260 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct., v. 194 p.111206-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002500169245015300194300001800347520186300365592002802228650001402256650001402270650001702284650001302301650002402314650002502338650002002363650001402383650001702397650001102414650001402425650001302439650001402452650001202466650002402478650001102502650002702513650002002540650003702560650003502597650004002632650005202672700002502724700002102749773009202770856008402862990002302946852000902969655001202978IND60087405120221121220714.0141102e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008740512DNAL7 a226591792pmid7 a10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRosenzweig, Derek H.10aFunctionalization of dynamic culture surfaces with a cartilage extracellular matrix extract enhances chondrocyte phenotype against dedifferentiation  ap. 3333-3341.  aCulture on silicone rubber surfaces has been shown to partially overcome the chondrocyte dedifferentiation characteristic of standard culture on rigid polystyrene. These methods typically involve functionalization of culture surfaces with proteins. Collagen type I is often used, but more cartilage-specific proteins may be more appropriate for chondrocytes. To explore this hypothesis, a twofold experimental design was applied. First, chondrocytes were cultured in rigid Petri dishes coated with silicone rubber (“static silicone” or SS culture) functionalized with either cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) extract or collagen type I. Second, chondrocytes were cultured on monotonically expanded high extension silicone rubber dishes (“continuous expansion” or CE culture) functionalized with ECM extract and compared to cells grown in SS culture. There were no differential effects of surface functionalization with the ECM extract vs. collagen type I on chondrocyte morphology, viability, proliferation or apoptosis in SS culture. However, chondrocyte growth on the ECM extract was associated with significantly reduced collagen types I and X gene expression and significantly increased glycosaminoglycan (GAG) secretion. After 3 passages (P3) on ECM-coated SS culture, chondrocyte phenotype and GAG secretion was enhanced compared to cells passaged on collagen type I. Pellet cultures from P3 SS culture displayed enhanced collagen type II content when ECM extract was used for functionalization rather than collagen type I. In CE culture with ECM functionalization, chondrocyte dedifferentiation was significantly inhibited vs. SS cultures, as evidenced by both gene expression and pellet cultures. Functionalization of extendable culture surfaces with cartilage ECM extract therefore supports enhanced preservation of chondrocyte phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3acollagen 3aexperimental design 3aextracellular matrix 3agene expression 3aphenotype 3apolystyrenes 3arubber 3asecretion 3asilicone 3aviability 2aAnimals 2aCartilagexcytology 2aCattle 2aCell Dedifferentiation 2aCells, Cultured 2aExtracellular Matrixxmetabolism 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction1 aSolar-Cafaggi, Sofia1 aQuinn, Thomas M.0 tActa biomaterialia.g2012 Sept., v. 8, no. 9 p.3333-3341dElsevier Ltdx1742-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2012.05.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245011000163300001400273520118100287592002801468650001401496650001601510650001101526650001901537650001501556650001201571650001701583650002401600651001201624651001101636653003301647653003301680653003401713700002001747700001701767700002001784700002601804700002001830773012601850856007901976852000902055655001202064IND60480737420221121035226.0160706e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048073742DNAL7 a10.3138/jvme.35.1.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLloyd, James W.10aSatellite Teaching Hospitals and Public–Private Collaborations in Veterinary Medical Clinical Education  ap. 43-47.  aVeterinary teaching hospitals (VTHs) are facing more and greater challenges than at any time in the past. Changes in demand, expanding information, improving technology, an evolving workforce, declining state support, and an increasingly diverse consumer base have combined to render many traditional VTH modes of operation obsolete. In pursuit of continued success in achieving their academic mission, VTHs are exploring new business models, including innovative collaborations with the private sector. This report provides details on existing models for public–private collaboration at several colleges and schools of veterinary medicine, including those at Kansas State University, Purdue University, the University of Florida, and Tufts University. Although each of these institutions’ models is unique, several commonalities exist, related to expansion of the case load available for teaching, the potential positive impact on recruitment and retention of clinical faculty, and the potential for easing financial pressures on the associated VTH.

We then compared two wild bradyrhizobium with the commercial strain for their ability to fix nitrogen and promote biomass production on plants in a glasshouse experiment. Ten mungbean nodules were collected from each of four plants, from each of two sites in the Burdekin region. One site had been treated with commercial bradyrhizobium inoculum strain CB1015, the other had never been treated with commercial inoculum. Protein analysis of the nodules using matrix assisted desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) showed a total of eight different strains of bradyrhizobia, distinctly different to CB1015, were present in the nodules of these plants. Of these eight strains, two strains dominated, one at each of the two collection sites. On the other hand, mungbean plants grown in soils from Millmerran, on the Darling Downs, hosted only CB1015 where inoculated, and did not nodulate when not inoculated. The two dominant wild bradyrhizobia were cultured from nodules from these field collected plants, and used in a controlled glasshouse experiment. In the glasshouse experiment, two mungbean cultivars and one black gram (Vigna mungo (L.)) cultivar were: (i) not inoculated and not supplied with nitrogen, (ii) not inoculated and supplied with nitrogen, (iii) inoculated with the commercial bradyrhizobia strain CB1015, (iv) inoculated with the dominant wild bradyrhizobia strain from Site 1, or (v) inoculated with the dominant wild bradyrhizobia strain from Site 2. Cultivars inoculated with either of the two dominant wild bradyrhizobia strains were similar in biomass and fixed a similar amount of nitrogen, to those inoculated with CB1015. There was no significant difference between the three inoculated treatments for shoot biomass nor nodule biomass per plant. Nodule number did not differ significantly from CB1015 for either of the wild bradyrizobia treatments. For root biomass per plant, the two mungbean cultivars did not differ between the three inoculated treatments, but the black gram had significantly less root biomass compared to the CB1015 treatment for one of the two wild bradyrhizobia treatments. For nitrogen fixed per plant, none of the cultivars showed significant difference between inoculated treatments. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that in some parts of Queensland some wild bradyrhozobia may be as effective as commercial inoculum for mungbean and black gram, potentially abrogating the need for artificial inoculation, and perhaps offering new options for the future development of better adapted commercial inoculum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradyrhizobium 3aVigna mungo 3aVigna radiata 3abiomass production 3ablack gram 3acultivars 3adesorption 3adry matter accumulation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ainoculum 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3amung beans 3anitrogen 3asoil 3aQueensland 0aeBLUEs 0aLSD 0aMALDI-TOF MS 0aPCA 0aREML 0aSARAMIS™ 0a%Ndfa 0aBlack gram 0aMungbean 0aNitrogen fixation 0aVigna mungo 0aVigna radiata 0aWild bradyrhizobia1 aMacdonald, Bethany1 aYeates, Stephen1 aZiegler, Dominik1 aSeymour, Nicole0 tApplied soil ecology.g2018 Mar., v. 124 p.88-94dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.11.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245022200166300001800388520094800406592002801354650003301382650002301415650003101438650002501469650001701494650004101511650001501552650001201567650001801579650002201597650001701619650001201636650002101648650000901669650001201678650002101690653002301711653002301734653001501757653001501772653002101787653002201808700002201830700001701852700001901869700001801888700001801906700001801924700001901942700002001961773014801981856008202129852000902211655001202220IND60566219320221120151848.0170405e20170405xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056621932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.7b005012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoung, Woo-Jae10aEnzymatic Synthesis of a Novel Kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-α-d-glucopyranoside Using Cyclodextrin Glucanotransferase and Its Inhibitory Effects on Aldose Reductase, Inflammation, and Oxidative Stress  ap. 2760-2767.  aKaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (astragalin, AS), a major flavonoid that exists in various plants, exerts antioxidant, antitumor, anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and anti-inflammatory effects. However, the low water solubility of AS limits its use. In this study, we used cyclodextrin glucanotransferase (CGTase) with maltose (G2) as a donor molecule to enzymatically modify AS to improve its water solubility and physiochemical properties. We isolated the glycosylated astragalin (G1-AS) and identified the structure of G1-AS as kaempferol-3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-O-α-d-glucopyranoside, where one glucose residue was transferred to AS. G1-AS retained the antioxidative activity of the original AS compound; however, the solubility of G1-AS was 65-fold higher than that of AS. In addition, G1-AS showed enhanced anti-inflammatory effects and aldose reductase inhibitory activity compared to AS when applied to rat lenses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aaldehyde reductase 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acyclomaltodextrin glucanotransferase 3aflavonoids 3aglucose 3aglycosylation 3aimmunosuppression 3ainflammation 3amaltose 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aviruses 3awater solubility 0aglucanotransferase 0atransglycosylation 0aastragalin 0asolubility 0aaldose reductase 0aanti-inflammatory1 aHwang, Seung Hwan1 aKo, Dam-Seul1 aKim, Set Byeol1 aKim, Seo Hyun1 aJeon, Sung Ho1 aChoi, Hee-Don1 aLim, Soon Sung1 aShim, Jae-hoon,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2017 Apr. 05, v. 65, no. 13 p.2760-2767dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jafc.7b005013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02247naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245010000166300001600266520101200282592002801294650001301322650001601335650001201351650001301363650002501376650001201401650001801413650002301431650002501454651001701479651001801496653002001514653002601534653001601560653001201576653002701588653001001615700001601625773007801641856008501719852000901804655001201813IND60573658220221122222700.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057365822DNAL7 a10.1080/03031853.2017.13023492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavids, T.10aPrice formation and competitiveness of the South African broiler industry in the global context  ap. 123-138.  aIn light of its recent classification by the Department of Trade and Industry as an industry in distress, this paper undertakes a comprehensive evaluation of the competitiveness of South African broiler production in the global context. A qualitative review of industry structure revealed a great deal of similarity to market leaders globally. Price formation within broiler production contracts in South Africa utilizes the same tournament pricing used successfully in the USA, resulting in high levels of technical efficiency, however economic efficiency is lacking. Univariate time series analysis confirmed that the domestic price of chicken is more elastic to changes in the import parity price than changes in feed costs. Feed remains crucial to economic efficiency and while declining protein meal prices in the future is plausible given recent investment into the industry, marketing strategies that optimize the returns from an entire carcass could aid effective competition with imported products.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3afeed prices 3aimports 3aindustry 3amarketing strategies 3amarkets 3aparity prices 3apoultry production 3atime series analysis 3aSouth Africa 3aUnited States 0aCompetitiveness 0aSouth African poultry 0acontracting 0apricing 0aerror correction model 0aQ 1101 aMeyer, F.H.0 tAgrekon.g2017 Apr. 3, v. 56, no. 2 p.123-138dRoutledgex2078-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03031853.2017.13023493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011200158300002000270520108900290592002801379650001701407650001401424650002601438650001501464650002301479650001501502650002401517650001701541650003201558650001201590650001901602650001401621650001901635650001301654650001201667700001801679700001601697700001701713700001801730700001801748700002001766700001701786700001901803773012401822856007401946852000902020655001202029IND60666834720221118064501.0190919e20141008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066683472DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra08810g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Hong-Yan10aDesign, synthesis and biological evaluation of shikonin thio-glycoside derivatives: new anti-tubulin agents  ap. 49796-49805.  aA novel series of acetyl-β-d-thio-glycoside modified shikonin derivatives were designed and synthesized and investigated for inhibition of cell proliferation against MG63, MCF-7, B16-F10, HepG2, MDA-231, L02, VERO and MCF-10A cell lines. The biological study showed that most single, di- and tri-substituted shikonin derivatives exhibited better anti-proliferative activities against the five cancer cell lines but lower cytotoxic activity against normal cells than shikonin itself. Notably, compared to shikonin, IIb displayed much stronger anti-proliferative effect among them. Furthermore, the inhibition of tubulin polymerization results indicated that IIb showed the most potent anti-tubulin activity (IC₅₀ = 4.67 ± 0.433 μM), which was compared with shikonin (IC₅₀ = 16.8 ± 0.625 μM) and colchicine (IC₅₀ = 3.83 ± 0.424 μM). Docking simulation, confocal microscopy and western bolt results further confirmed that IIb can cause cell arrest in G2/M phase and induce cell apoptosis via binding to the active site of tubulin and inhibiting tubulin polymerization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aapoptosis 3abiological assessment 3acell lines 3acell proliferation 3acolchicine 3aconfocal microscopy 3acytotoxicity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amitosis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3apolymerization 3ashikonin 3atubulin1 aHan, Hong-Wei1 aBai, Li-Fei1 aQiu, Han-Yue1 aYin, De-Zheng1 aQi, Jin-Liang1 aWang, Xiao-Ming1 aGu, Hong-Wei1 aYang, Yong-Hua0 tRSC advances.g2014 Oct. 08, v. 4, no. 91 p.49796-49805dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra08810g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01674naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245011300157300001600270520076500286592002801051650002901079650002801108650001101136650001201147650001201159650001301171650001201184700001601196773009501212856004401307852000901351655001201360IND50089212120221116172310.0140502e200012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008921212DNAL7 a10.1007/s0028400101562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOda, Yuji10aCharacterization of a Mutant from Lactobacillus amylovorus JCM 1126ᵀ with Improved Utilization of Sucrose   ap. 392-395.  aA strain YF43, which can grow on sucrose as rapidly as glucose, was isolated by mutation from Lactobacillus amylovorus JCM 1126, the type strain defective in sucrose utilization. Exogenous sucrose stimulated the production of invertase by strains YF43 and JCM 1126 simultaneously. In a medium containing fructooligosaccharide as the sole carbon source, the cells of strain YF43 showed high invertase activity in spite of poor growth. The two invertases produced in the cells grown on sucrose and fructooligosaccharide were an identical β-fructofuranosidase, as judged from properties of partially purified enzymes. These observations indicated that strain YF43 is a mutant improved for permeation of sucrose and not derepressed for the synthesis of invertase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus amylovorus 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbon 3aglucose 3amutants 3amutation 3asucrose1 aIto, Miyuki0 tCurrent microbiology.g2000 Dec., v. 41, no. 6 p.392-395dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s002840010156  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003400152245015600186300001600342520096200358592002801320650000801348650001201356650001501368650001101383650001901394650003401413650001401447650002101461650001301482650001001495650001701505650001601522650002101538653000801559653000701567653000801574653000801582653001201590653000701602653000801609653000701617653000701624653001101631653001001642653001001652653000801662653000801670653002201678653000901700653002201709653001001731653001201741653001501753653001401768653003201782700002001814700003101834700001901865700002301884700002001907700002601927773010001953856008702053852000902140655001202149IND60526099720221117012655.0190402e20161115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052609972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarrasco-Del Amor, Ana María10aImpact of packaging atmosphere, storage and processing conditions on the generation of phytoprostanes as quality processing compounds in almond kernels  ap. 869-875.  aThe thermal processing of almond kernels implies the use of techniques that produce chemical changes such as oxidation. Phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) are considered biomarkers of the oxidative stress in plants. We studied the PhytoP profile in kernels of almond cultivars under different conditions, in relation to packaging, temperature and time of storage and processing. The most abundant PhytoP was the F1t series. The PhytoP levels increased significantly with the time of storage (3 and 6months) and the total PhytoP concentration was higher under air than in a vacuum packaging atmosphere. Storage at 24°C raised the concentrations of individual PhytoPs and the total sum of PhytoPs. The frying and roasting processes led to a strong reduction of the original concentration of most PhytoPs and promoted the synthesis of specific PhytoPs that were not detected in raw kernels and thus could be biomarkers of the degree of oxidative degradation of almonds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aalmonds 3abiomarkers 3afrying 3aheat treatment 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aroasting 3aseeds 3astorage time 3atemperature 3avacuum packaging 0aALA 0aAA 0aBHA 0aETo 0aGC–MS 0aIS 0aMRM 0aOS 0aPG 0aPhytoP 0aPUFAs 0aMUFAs 0aROS 0aSPE 0aUHPLC–QqQ-MS/MS 0aNuts 0aα-Linolenic acid 0aFried 0aRoasted 0aBiomarkers 0aOxidation 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids1 aAguayo, Encarna1 aCollado-González, Jacinta1 aGuy, Alexandre1 aGalano, Jean-Marie1 aDurand, Thierry1 aGil-Izquierdo, Ángel0 tFood chemistry.g2016 Nov. 15, v. 211 p.869-875dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2016.05.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245012500171500001900296520164000315592002801955650000901983650001001992650003402002650001802036650001302054650000902067650001902076650001802095650002202113650001702135650002302152650001802175650001702193650001202210650002002222650001102242650001902253653002902272653001402301653002102315653001702336653002002353700002002373700002302393700006002416773010302476856008702579852000902666655001202675IND60699769120221120024824.0210114e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069976912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Azza A.10aRevitalizing the local anesthetic effect of Mebeverine hydrochloride via encapsulation within ethosomal vesicular system  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMebeverine hydrochloride (MBH) is an antispasmodic drug that holds the potential to exert a local anesthetic action via blocking voltage operated sodium channels. However, its local anesthetic activity was not yet exploited due its poor skin permeability. Nanocarriers have emerged as efficient vehicles for delivering both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs through the stratum corneum. In this study, therefore, the efficacy of ethosomes for delivering MBH via skin for local anesthetic effect was investigated. The ethosomes were formulated, optimized and characterized for particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency and in vitro permeation studies. Then, the optimized formula was incorporated into Carbopol 940® gel and evaluated for skin irritation and in vivo local anesthetic action. Ethosomes were spherical in shape with vesicle sizes varied from 308.2 ± 18.2 nm to 78.8 ± 8.6 nm and entrapment efficiencies of 18–65%. In vitro drug permeation across rabbit ear skin revealed enhanced drug permeation and higher transdermal flux with ethosomal formulations, compared to aqueous drug solution. In addition, an ethosomal gel of optimized formula showed a potent local anesthetic effect as manifested by a 2.3-fold increase in the area under the efficacy curve (AUEC) of MBH loaded ethosomal gel, compared to the MBH gel. Furthermore, skin irritation experiments demonstrated that MBH ethosomal gel induced neither erythema nor edema upon application to rabbit skin. Collectively, MBH loaded ethosomal vesicles might represent a promising delivery vehicle for safe and efficient local anesthetic effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aears 3aedema 3aelectric potential difference 3aencapsulation 3aerythema 3agels 3ahydrophilicity 3alipophilicity 3alocal anesthetics 3ananocarriers 3aparasympatholytics 3aparticle size 3apermeability 3arabbits 3askin irritation 3asodium 3azeta potential 0aMebeverine hydrochloride 0aEthosomes 0aLocal anesthesia 0aCarbopol gel 0aTail-flick test1 aSamir, Rasha M.1 aAbu-Zaid, Samir S.1 aAbu Lila, Amr S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7385-868X0 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Oct., v. 194 p.111208-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2020.1112083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002600188245011200214300001200326506007600338520196900414592002802383506003702411650002202448650002102470650002202491650002602513650001302539650002202552650001402574650002002588650001702608650001802625650001202643650001102655650001902666650001402685650001002699650001602709650001402725650001802739650001102757650001602768650002002784651001102804700001902815700002402834700002002858700002102878773011602899856008203015852000903097655001203106IND60590403120221207060950.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059040312DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-017-1196-y2doi7 aPMC57517712pmcid7 a292973292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aĆilerdžić, Jasmina10aPotential of selected fungal species to degrade wheat straw, the most abundant plant raw material in Europe  ap. 249.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Structural component of plant biomass, lignocellulose, is the most abundant renewable resource in nature. Lignin is the most recalcitrant natural aromatic polymer and its degradation presents great challenge. Nowadays, the special attention is given to biological delignification, the process where white-rot fungi take the crucial place owing to strong ligninolytic enzyme system. However, fungal species, even strains, differ in potential to produce high active ligninolytic enzymes and consequently to delignify plant biomass. Therefore, the goals of the study were characterization of Mn-oxidizing peroxidases and laccases of numerous mushrooms as well as determination of their potential to delignify wheat straw, the plant raw material that, according to annual yield, takes the first place in Europe and the second one in the world. RESULTS: During wheat straw fermentation, Lentinus edodes HAI 858 produced the most active Mn-dependent and Mn-independent peroxidases (1443.2 U L⁻¹ and 1045.5 U L⁻¹, respectively), while Pleurotus eryngii HAI 711 was the best laccase producer (7804.3 U L⁻¹). Visualized bends on zymogram confirmed these activities and demonstrated that laccases were the dominant ligninolytic enzymes in the studied species. Ganoderma lucidum BEOFB 435 showed considerable ability to degrade lignin (58.5%) and especially hemicellulose (74.8%), while the cellulose remained almost intact (0.7%). Remarkable selectivity in lignocellulose degradation was also noted in Pleurotus pulmonarius HAI 573 where degraded amounts of lignin, hemicellulose and cellulose were in ratio of 50.4%:15.3%:3.8%. CONCLUSIONS: According to the presented results, it can be concluded that white-rot fungi, due to ligninolytic enzymes features and degradation potential, could be important participants in various biotechnological processes including biotransformation of lignocellulose residues/wastes in food, feed, paper and biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGanoderma lucidum 3aLentinula edodes 3aPleurotus eryngii 3aPleurotus pulmonarius 3abiofuels 3abiotransformation 3acellulose 3adelignification 3afermentation 3ahemicellulose 3alaccase 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3amushrooms 3apaper 3aperoxidases 3aphytomass 3araw materials 3awastes 3awheat straw 3awhite-rot fungi 3aEurope1 aGalić, Milica1 aVukojević, Jelena,1 aBrčeski, Ilija1 aStajić, Mirjana0 tBMC plant biology.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no.

Still, the lack of mechanistic understanding of the reaction impedes a knowledge-based catalyst design for improved selectivity and stability. In this study, we employed X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) to obtain structural information on a titania-supported palladium (Pd) catalyst under H₂O₂ synthesis conditions. The study focuses on the effect of the liquid-phase H₂:O₂ ratio between 0.67 and 3 and solvent composition under industrially relevant conditions, that is ethanol with and without H₂SO₄ and NaBr as selectivity enhancers at 40 bar. The X-ray near-edge structure of the absorption spectra (XANES) and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) revealed that ethanol fully reduces Pd nanoparticles, even when saturated with oxygen. Oxygen presence at the Pd surface could only be suspected based on its small contribution to the EXAFS signal. A palladium hydride phase is detected under stoichiometric conditions due to lattice expansion. Addition of H₂SO₄ causes Pd lattice expansion and an increased yield at stoichiometric conditions. Further addition of bromide did not lead to any significant change in catalyst state and activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray absorption spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aethanol 3ahydrides 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ananocatalysts 3aoxygen 3apalladium 3asodium bromide 3asolvents 3astoichiometry1 aDoronkin, Dmitry E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3930-32041 aSheppard, Thomas L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8891-985X1 aZimina, Anna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3111-77411 aGrunwaldt, Jan-Dierk1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3606-09561 aDittmeyer, Roland1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3110-69890 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 04, v. 125, no. 6 p.3451-3462dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c112463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245013700170300001300307520170900320592002802029650001502057650001702072650001902089650001302108650001102121650001502132650000902147650002002156650001002176650002202186650002202208650002702230650001402257700002102271700001802292700002102310700002002331700001802351700001802369700002302387700002402410700001902434700002002453773009902473856008302572990002302655852000902678655001202687IND60098149320221118014012.0141104e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009814932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAoyagi, Yasuyuki10aFibrin glue is a candidate scaffold for long-term therapeutic protein expression in spontaneously differentiated adipocytes in vitro  ap. 8-15.  aAdipose tissue is expected to provide a source of cells for protein replacement therapies via auto-transplantation. However, the conditioning of the environment surrounding the transplanted adipocytes for their long-term survival and protein secretion properties has not been established. We have recently developed a preparation procedure for preadipocytes, ceiling culture-derived proliferative adipocytes (ccdPAs), as a therapeutic gene vehicle suitable for stable gene product secretion. We herein report the results of our evaluation of using fibrin glue as a scaffold for the transplanted ccdPAs for the expression of a transduced gene in a three-dimensional culture system. The ccdPAs secreted the functional protein translated from an exogenously transduced gene, as well as physiological adipocyte proteins, and the long viability of ccdPAs (up to 84days) was dependent on the fibrinogen concentrations. The ccdPAs spontaneously accumulated lipid droplets, and their expression levels of the transduced exogenous gene with its product were maintained for at least 56days. The fibrinogen concentration modified the adipogenic differentiation of ccdPAs and their exogenous gene expression levels, and the levels of exogenously transduced gene expression at the different fibrinogen concentrations were dependent on the extent of adipogenic differentiation in the gel. These results indicate that fibrin glue helps to maintain the high adipogenic potential of cultured adipocytes after passaging in a 3D culture system, and suggests that once they are successfully implanted at the transplantation site, the cells exhibit increased expression of the transduced gene with adipogenic differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3adroplets 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3agels 3agene expression 3agenes 3aprotein secretion 3aprotein synthesis 3atranslation (genetics) 3aviability1 aKuroda, Masayuki1 aAsada, Sakiyo1 aTanaka, Shigeaki1 aKonno, Shunichi1 aTanio, Masami1 aAso, Masayuki1 aOkamoto, Yoshitaka1 aNakayama, Toshinori1 aSaito, Yasushi1 aBujō, Hideaki,0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 318, no. 1 p.8-15dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.0073Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008400177300001600261520179800277592002802075650002502103650001602128650001402144650001102158650001202169650002102181650001802202650000902220650002602229650001202255650000802267650001102275650001602286650001102302650001602313651001802329651001602347653001602363653001302379653001402392653002602406653002402432653001702456700002802473773010502501856008502606852000902691655001202700IND60616288120221120094935.0190411e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061628812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.seares.2018.09.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDvoretsky, Vladimir G.10aMesozooplankton in the Kola Transect (Barents Sea): Autumn and winter structure  ap. 125-131.  aThe spatial distribution of mesozooplankton was investigated in relation to environmental conditions along the Kola Transect (69°30′–79°00′N, 33°30′E) during autumn (September 2011) and early winter (mid-November 2012). Mesozooplankton abundance averaged 964 and 740 individuals m−3 and biomass averaged 55 and 32 mg dry mass m−3 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Cluster analysis showed good accordance of the mesozooplankton assemblages with the three main types of water masses present in the region. The first assemblage, dominated by Calanus finmarchicus and Oithona similis, but including neritic taxa, was associated with Murmansk Coastal Water. The second assemblage, with Calanus spp. contributing the majority of the total mesozooplankton biomass, was connected with Atlantic waters. The third assemblage, dominated by Calanus glacialis, was associated with cold Arctic waters. Redundancy analysis revealed that the explanatory factors significantly influencing the community structure of mesozooplankton were surface and bottom temperature, and depth of the sampling layer. Almost 64% of the total mesozooplankton fluctuations could be explained by changes in these environmental variables. Inter-seasonal changes in the structure of mesozooplankton were associated with higher abundances of Calanus hyperboreus, Copepoda nauplii, Microsetella norvegica, Aglantha digitale, Oikopleura vanhoeffenni, and Mertensia ovum and lower numbers of Oithona atlantica and young stages of Paraeuchaeta spp. in September 2011. Regional and seasonal comparisons of the total mesozooplankton biomass observed in the present study with sample data from the summer of 2003–2012 suggest that the mean values were higher in autumn season of 2011 due to differences in sampling layers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanus finmarchicus 3aCola nitida 3aMertensia 3aautumn 3abiomass 3acluster analysis 3acoastal water 3acold 3aenvironmental factors 3anauplii 3aova 3asummer 3atemperature 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArctic region 3aBarents Sea 0aZooplankton 0aCopepods 0aCommunity 0aEnvironmental control 0aRedundancy analysis 0aArctic shelf1 aDvoretsky, Alexander G.0 tJournal of sea research.g2018 Dec., v. 142 p.125-131dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12050x1385-11017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.seares.2018.09.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008900155520134100244592002801585650001501613650001101628650002001639650001001659650001301669650001301682650001801695650001701713650001501730650001001745700001801755700001601773700001901789700002001808773012001828856007401948852000902022655001202031IND60792769220221119182035.0220908e20220823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079276922DNAL7 a10.3390/w141725952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wenjie 10aSimultaneous Removal of Nitrate and Tetracycline by an Up-Flow Immobilized Biofilter  aThe removal of nitrate (NO₃⁻-N) and antibiotics in aquaculture tail water is urgent and necessary.

The denitrification and TC removal performance of the I-BF reactor was investigated under different TC concentrations (0, 10, 50, 100 mg·L⁻¹), carbon/nitrogen (C/N) ratio (2, 4, 5, 6) and hydraulic retention times (HRT) (4, 8, 12 h). Simultaneous removal of nitrogen and TC was achieved by the I-BF reactor. Low TC concentration (≤50 mg·L⁻¹) had little effect on nitrogen removal. The denitrification performance of the I-BF reactor was inhibited at high TC load, which may be attributed to the damage of cell membranes and the inhibition of the intracellular denitrification enzymes’ activities. The optimal C/N ratio and HRT were 5 h and 8 h with almost complete denitrification and high TC removal efficiency (73.46%) at influent NO₃⁻-N and TC concentrations of 100 mg·L⁻¹ and 50 mg·L⁻¹, respectively. The I-BF reactor proposed in this study has promising applications such as the treatment of piggery wastewater, aquaculture tail water and pharmaceutical wastewater co-contaminated with nitrate and antibiotics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilters 3acarbon 3adenitrification 3afoams 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3apolyurethanes 3atetracycline 3awastewater 3awater1 aLuo, Minghan 1 aLu, Xinyue 1 aYe, Zhengfang 1 aJeong, Taeseop 0 tWater.g2022 Aug. 23, v. 14, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w141725953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03027naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003400113040001800147100001900165245009300184300001800277500000900295520162300304592002801927650001601955650001001971650002001981650001402001650001502015650001402030650001802044650001202062650002302074650002202097650003602119651001802155651001102173700001602184700001302200700001702213773012402230852000902354856011202363856008102475961001302556655001202569IND2332805220221119003632.0191228e200209  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233280522DNAL7 a10113/114742hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2002.15042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYaklich, R.

Merr.] an important crop. Reports have been published that the oil concentration and recently the protein concentration of U.S. soybean has been decreasing with respect to other exporting countries. The objective of this study was to utilize 51 yr of two data sets, The Uniform Soybean Tests, Northern Region and Southern Region to determine long-term trends in these constituents. Oil and protein composition data of lines from Regional Summaries of Maturity Groups OO through VIII were used for the analysis. Mean oil concentration was higher in the Southern Region compared with the Northern Region (209 and 206 g kg⁻¹, respectively), as was protein concentration (411 and 407 g kg⁻¹, respectively). Maturity group means for oil and protein concentration ranged from 198 to 212 g kg⁻¹ and 404 to 414 g kg⁻¹, respectively. Oil concentration increased in both data sets to 1973 and abruptly decreased in 1974 (21 g kg⁻¹) to a low in 1982 (184 g kg⁻¹) to higher than average values in 1983 (217 g kg⁻¹) and by linear regression analysis, decreasing in the Northern Region since then. Analysis of lines evaluated from 1973 to 1974 and from 1982 to 1983 indicated that genetics was not the cause of the change in oil concentrations. Temporal protein concentrations were not as distinct as those of oil but indicated groups of years when protein concentration was above or below the mean. The data indicate that oil concentrations of soybean has been erratic and decreasing since 1974 because of unknown factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aseeds 3aprotein content 3aseed oils 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3adata analysis 3ahistory 3atemporal variation 3agenetic variation 3achemical constituents of plants 3aUnited States 3aCanada1 aVinyard, B.1 aCamp, M.1 aDouglass, S.0 tCrop science.g2002 Sept., v. 42, no. 5 p.1504-1515dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/114743Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2002.15043Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03326naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245017300175300001600348520191200364592002802276650002302304650002502327650002802352650001602380650001802396650001302414650002602427650002302453650002102476650001502497650001402512650002802526650001102554700002802565700002402593700002302617700002202640700002302662773011702685856008102802852000902883655001202892IND60572421220221116232346.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057242122DNAL7 a10.1007/s11240-017-1169-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpinoso-Castillo, J.

The use of adequate doses of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), formulated as Argovit™, is an alternative to reduce the contamination indices and promote development in plants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial and hormetic effects of Argovit on in vitro regeneration of vanilla (Vanilla planifolia) using a TIS. In vitro regenerated shoots were grown in Murashige and Skoog (MS) liquid medium with Argovit at five different concentrations (0, 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg/l) using a temporary immersion bioreactor system (RITA®). At 30 days of culture, contamination percentage was evaluated and shoot regeneration and length were used to determine the hormetic response. Analysis of macro and micronutrient contents was performed. In addition, the effect of Argovit on total phenolic content (TPC), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, antioxidant capacity (ORAC) and lipid peroxidation (LP-MDA) was determined. Results showed that bacterial contamination was reduced at 50, 100 and 200 mg/l of Argovit. Growth stimulation was observed at 25 and 50 mg/l of Argovit, while significant inhibition was detected at 100 and 200 mg/l of Argovit. Mineral nutrient analysis revealed changes in macro and micronutrient concentrations exerted by Argovit. Moreover, the presence of Argovit induced the production of ROS and increased total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and lipid peroxidation with a dose-dependent effect. Results suggested that the production of ROS and mineral nutrition are key mechanisms of AgNPs-induced hormesis for vanilla. Therefore, the addition of 50 mg/l of Argovit in the culture media had an antimicrobial and hormetic effect. Use of Argovit could be an efficient strategy for commercial micropropagation of vanilla and other species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVanilla planifolia 3aantioxidant activity 3abacterial contamination 3abioreactors 3aculture media 3ahormesis 3ain vitro regeneration 3alipid peroxidation 3amicropropagation 3ananosilver 3anutrition 3areactive oxygen species 3ashoots1 aChavez-Santoscoy, R.

With a marked increase of jellyfish populations worldwide, understanding the dynamics of the polyp (scyphistoma) stage of their life-cycle is becoming increasingly important. In-situ studies of polyp population dynamics are scarce due to small size of the polyps and tedious manual work required to annotate and count large numbers of items in underwater photographs. We devised an experiment which shows a large variance between human annotators, as well as in annotations made by the same annotator. We have tackled this problem, which is present in many areas of marine biology, by developing a method for automated detection and counting. Our polyp counter (PoCo) uses a two-stage approach with a fast detector (Aggregated Channel Features) and a precise classifier consisting of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network and a Support Vector Machine. PoCo was tested on a year-long image dataset and performed with accuracy comparable to human annotators but with 70-fold reduction in time. The algorithm can be used in many marine biology applications, vastly reducing the amount of manual labor and enabling processing of much larger datasets.

Willingness to pay was tested empirically using survey data from 333 inhabitants of Sciacca, a fishing community in Sicily, Italy, which has the island’s second largest fishing fleet. People’s attitudes towards climate change, their degree of involvement in the issue, and their concerns about this phenomenon’s potential impact on the marine environment are the key factors affecting their willingness to pay. It was further found that respondents are willing to pay an average of €6.81 per month to support mitigation policies in the fishing industry. The originality of this study is related to its contribution in expanding the body of knowledge on citizens’ willingness to pay for the protection of fish resources, using a conceptual framework based on the Construal Level Theory and the Theory of Reasoned Action to explain inhabitants’ behaviour. The latter is one of the implications of this study on the theoretical point of view. In addition, this study provides insights and hints to policy makers to define tools, shared by the community, that contribute to the mitigation of climate change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate change 3afish 3afisheries 3afisheries management 3aissues and policy 3amarine environment 3amotivation 3apeople 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 3aItaly 3aSicily 0aWillingness to pay 0aCoastal population 0aMitigation policies 0aTheory of reasoned action 0aConstrual level theory1 aCrescimanno, Maria1 aVrontis, Demetris1 aGalati, Antonino1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0753-29340 tFisheries research.g2020 Jan., v. 221 p.105374-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2019.1053743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02174naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245011500213300001600328520102700344592002801371650001401399650002101413650001701434650001101451650001201462650001301474700002401487700002301511700002501534700002301559773010301582856008301685990002301768852000901791655001201800IND60098149420221118014048.0141104e20120115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009814942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.0102doi7 aPMC32307132pmcid7 a220366482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapierre, Lynne A.10aCoordinated regulation of caveolin-1 and Rab11a in apical recycling compartments of polarized epithelial cells  ap. 103-113.  aRecent studies have identified caveolin-1, a protein best known for its functions in caveolae, in apical endocytic recycling compartments in polarized epithelial cells. However, very little is known about the regulation of caveolin-1 in the endocytic recycling pathway. To address this question, in the current study we compared the relationship between compartments enriched in sub-apical caveolin-1 and Rab11a, a well-defined marker of apical recycling endosomes, using polarized MDCK cells as a model. We show that caveolin-1-containing vesicles define a compartment that partially overlaps with Rab11a, and that the distribution of subapical caveolin-1 and Rab11a shows a similar dependence on microtubule disruption. Mutants of the Rab11a effector, Rab11-FIP2 also altered the localization of caveolin-1. These findings indicate that caveolin-1 is coordinately regulated with Rab11a within the apical recycling system of polarized epithelial cells, suggesting that the two proteins are components of the same pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendosomes 3aepithelial cells 3amicrotubules 3amodels 3amutants 3aproteins1 aDucharme, Nicole A.1 aDrake, Kimberly R.1 aGoldenring, James R.1 aKenworthy, Anne K.0 tExperimental cell research.g2012 Jan. 15, v. 318, no. 2 p.103-113dElsevier Inc.x0014-48277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2011.10.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02500naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001200151245011700163300001400280520112200294592002801416650002101444650001101465650001301476650001801489650002001507650001701527650001701544650001301561650001601574650001701590650001501607653003001622653001701652653001101669653002201680653002101702700001801723700001501741700002101756700001801777700001801795700001201813773009801825856008601923852000902009655001202018IND60562877220221122235545.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056287722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2017.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xia10aInvestigation of collagen hydrolysate used as carbon and nitrogen source in the fermentation of Bacillus pumilus  ap. 11-16.  aThis study explored the possible application of collagen hydrolysate (CH) in the fermentation process using Bacillus pumilus as probe bacterial strain. When CH acted as an only source of carbon and nitrogen in the culture medium, B. pumilus was observed to show normal characterizations during its growing process. Meanwhile, the utilization degree of CH by B. pumilus could be enhanced when wheat bran was added (used as carbon source) in the fermentation process. It was found that the highest alkaline protease activity was 325U/mL when only CH was used, while it was increased to 620U/mL with the addition of wheat bran. Besides, with different combination of soybean meal and CH, it was found that the ability using CH to produce alkaline protease is comparable to that of soybean meal in the presence of wheat bran. Moreover, the growth behaviors of the strain were not affected by inoculation concentrations, but the time of producing alkaline protease was greatly saved as reducing loading volume. Present investigation suggested that CH can be used as carbon and nitrogen sources in the fermentation process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus pumilus 3acarbon 3acollagen 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3afermentation 3ahydrolysates 3anitrogen 3aproteinases 3asoybean meal 3awheat bran 0aCollagen hydrolysate (CH) 0aFermentation 0aGrowth 0aAlkaline protease 0aBacillus pumilus1 aZeng, Wei-Cai1 aZhu, De-Yi1 aFeng, Jiang-Ling1 aTian, Cui-Cui1 aLiao, Xue-Pin1 aShi, Bi0 tProcess biochemistry.g2017 Apr., v. 55 p.11-16dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2017.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245019700175300001600372520139600388592002801784650002501812650001401837650001901851650002001870650001401890650001501904650001401919650001601933650001401949650003101963650001101994650002402005650002102029650002002050650000902070650001702079650001302096650002002109650002402129650003302153650001402186650001002200650001602210650002402226653002402250653001702274653002002291653001102311653002202322700002002344700001802364700001702382700003002399700002102429700003202450773011602482856008702598852000902685655001202694IND60590776420221117160827.0190202e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059077642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChandra Sekhar, S.10aBiodiesel production process optimization from Pithecellobium dulce seed oil: Performance, combustion, and emission analysis on compression ignition engine fuelled with diesel/biodiesel blends  ap. 141-154.  aProduction of methyl esters from Pithecellobium dulce seed oil (PDSO) is carried out through transesterification process. As free fatty acid (FFA) content in PDSO is 2.12%, alkaline based potassium hydroxide (KOH) catalyst is used for yielding methyl ester from PDSO. The effect of four process variables, such as molar ratio (oil: methanol), reaction temperature, catalyst loading and reaction time on the maximum yield of Pithecellobium dulce seed oil methyl ester (PDSOME) is studied and process optimization has been executed using response surface methodology (RSM) based Box-Behnken design (BBD). An optimized PDSOME yield of 93.24% is achieved at 1:6 molar ratio, 60 °C reaction temperature, 0.8 wt.% catalyst and reaction time of 90 min. The estimated fuel properties of PDSOME met with the ASTM D6751 standards. Engine tests were conducted for PDSOME, its blends (20, 40, 60 and 80 vol.%) and compared with diesel. The drop in cylinder pressure, heat release rate (HRR) and exhaust gas temperature (EGT) were observed for the PDSOME and its blends. Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is increased and consequent reduction in brake thermal efficiency (BTE) is found for PDSOME and its blends. The exhaust emissions of CO, HC and NOx were decreased while CO2 and smoke intensity were increased with increase in PDSOME blending percentage in comparison with diesel fuel.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPithecellobium dulce 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acombustion 3acylinders 3adiesel fuel 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3aesters 3aexperimental design 3afree fatty acids 3afuel production 3aheat 3ahydrocarbons 3amethanol 3anitrogen oxides 3apotassium hydroxide 3aresponse surface methodology 3aseed oils 3asmoke 3atemperature 3atransesterification 0aTransesterification 0aOptimization 0aFuel properties 0aEngine 0aExhaust emissions1 aKaruppasamy, K.1 aVedaraman, N.1 aKabeel, A.E.1 aSathyamurthy, Ravishankar1 aElkelawy, Medhat1 aAlm ElDin Bastawissi, Hagar0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 161 p.141-154dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245013300167300002000300520106600320592002801386650002401414650001301438650001101451650002301462650001601485650002101501650001601522650001401538650002101552650001801573650001101591650004401602650002101646650001201667650002501679650001401704700001901718700002401737700001801761700002401779773013601803856007501939852000902014655001202023IND60537413620221121235853.0160809e20121031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053741362DNAL7 a10.1021/ie301687c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLebga-Nebane, Janice

The chemical structures of the cations (ammonium vs imidazolium) and anions (mesylate vs triflate) were found to strongly govern properties such as density, viscosity, ionic conductivity, thermal and electrochemical stability, and phase transition behaviors. Structure–property relations were analyzed on the basis of charge delocalization, cation π-stacking, van der Waals interactions of alkyl tails, and hydrogen bonding interactions between cations and anions. The diffusion coefficients of the free proton, the cation, and the anion were determined by using NMR spectroscopy, and were used to differentiate between the vehicular and Grotthuss mechanisms of diffusion of protons. A correlation, based on the Sutherland–Einstein equation, was developed to predict ionic conductivity by using the room temperature molar volume and the VFT equation for viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonium 3aanions 3achemical structure 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aengineering 3aequations 3ahydrogen bonding 3aionic liquids 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphase transition 3aprotons 3avan der Waals forces 3aviscosity1 aRock, Simon E.1 aFranclemont, Joshua1 aRoy, Dipankar1 aKrishnan, Sitaraman0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Oct. 31, v. 51, no. 43 p.14084-14098dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie301687c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245016000207300001600367506007600383520187600459592002802335506003702363650001902400650002202419650001502441650001602456650001502472650002702487650001302514650001302527650001202540650002602552650001202578650001602590650001202606650002002618650001402638650001102652650000802663650002302671700002002694773010602714856008102820852000902901655001202910IND60523400020221207140150.0170811e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052340002DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-016-0279-52doi7 aPMC49098072pmcid7 a269940042pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilkova, O.

The absence of a strict pachytene checkpoint in plants presents an opportunity to study meiosis in polyhaploid organisms. In the present study, we demonstrate that meiosis is coordinated in hybrids between disomic wheat–rye substitution lines 1Rv(1A), 2R(2D), 5R(5D), 6R(6A) and rye (Triticum aestivum L. × Secale cereale L., 4x = 28, ABDR). By using in situ hybridization with a centromere pAet6-09 probe and immunostaining with H3Ser10ph-, CENH3-, and α-tubulin-specific antibodies, we distinguished four chromosome behaviour types. The first one is a mitotic-like division that is characterized by mitotic centromere architecture, robust bipolar spindle, one-step loss of arm and centromere cohesion, and sister chromatid separation in the first and only meiotic division. The second type involves a monopolar spindle formation, which appears as a hat-shaped group of chromosomes moving in one direction, wherein MT bundles are co-oriented polewards. It prevents chromosome segregation in meiosis I, with a bipolar spindle distributing sister chromatids to the poles in meiosis II. These events subsequently result in the formation of unreduced microspores. The other two meiotic-like chromosome segregation patterns known as reductional and equational plus reductional represent stand-alone types of cell division rather than intermediate steps of meiosis I. Only sterile pollen is produced as a result of such meiotic-like chromosome behaviours. Slightly variable meiotic phenotypes are reproducibly observed in hybrids under different growth conditions. The 2R(2D)xR genotype tends to promote reductional division. In contrast, the genotypes 1Rv(1A)xR, 5R(5D)xR, and 6R(6A)xR promote equational chromosome segregation and monopolar spindle formation in addition to reductional and equational plus reductional division types.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSecale cereale 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantibodies 3acentromeres 3achromatids 3achromosome segregation 3acohesion 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ain situ hybridization 3ameiosis 3amicrospores 3amitosis 3apachytene stage 3aphenotype 3apollen 3arye 3asubstitution lines1 aLoginova, D.

In humans the infection is characterized by a febrile disease; ruminants may abort and reduce their milk yield, causing serious production losses for the farmer. In India, the disease has been known to be present since the 1970s, but little is known about the epidemiology in most states. In this cross-sectional survey in the two states of Assam and Bihar, 520 households were interviewed for risk factors, and serum samples from 744 dairy animals were analyzed using ELISA as well as PCR.Out of the farms, 17.4% had at least one seropositive animal, with significantly higher seroprevalence in Bihar (27.1%) than Assam (5.8%); and significantly more sero-positive farms in urban areas (23.1%) than rural (12.2%). On an individual animal level, 14.1% were seropositive, with higher prevalence among buffaloes than cows (28.0% versus 13.6%). Out of the seropositive animals, 10.6% had aborted during the last three years, and 37.5% had experienced problems with repeat breeding: both higher than in non-seropositive animals.In conclusion, this study indicates that coxiellosis is potentially an important cause of reproductive failures and production losses in dairy animals. The high prevalence, especially in urban areas, is a public health risk. Further research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology and identify mitigation options that could work in the different settings of different Indian states.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoxiella burnetii 3aQ fever 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3abreeding 3abuffaloes 3acows 3across-sectional studies 3adairy animals 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3amilk yield 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3aticks 3aurban areas 3azoonoses 3aIndia 0aCoxiella burnetti 0aSeroepidemiology 0aDairy production 0aZoonosis1 aDeka, Ram Pratim1 aMilesh, Ligi1 aSahay, Swati1 aGrace, Delia1 aLindahl, Johanna F.0 tActa tropica.g2019 June, v. 194 p.41-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.03.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002000188245008900208300001600297506007600313520132500389592002801714506003701742650001701779650001501796650001201811650002001823650001901843650001101862650001701873650001601890650001301906650002301919700002001942773010601962856008102068852000902149655001202158IND60523400120221207140145.0170811e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052340012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00497-016-0280-z2doi7 aPMC49098122pmcid7 a270163592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jhun-Chen14aThe long pollen tube journey and in vitro pollen germination of Phalaenopsis orchids  ap. 179-188.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE : Pollen biology in P. aphrodite. Orchids have a distinct reproductive program. Pollination triggers ovule development and differentiation within flowers, and fertilization occurs days to months after pollination. It is unclear how pollen tubes travel through the developing ovaries during ovule development and when pollen tubes arrive at the mature embryo sac to achieve fertilization. Here, we report a robust staining protocol to image and record the timing of pollen germination, progressive growth of pollen tubes in ovaries, and arrival of pollen tubes at embryo sacs in Phalaenopsis aphrodite. The pollen germinated and pollen tubes entered the ovary 3 days after pollination. Pollen tubes continued to grow and filled the entire cavity of the ovary as the ovary elongated and ovules developed. Pollen tubes were found to enter the matured embryo sacs at approximately 60–65 days after pollination in an acropetal manner. Moreover, these temporal changes in developmental events such as growth of pollen tubes and fertilization were associated with expression of molecular markers. In addition, we developed an in vitro pollen germination protocol, which is valuable to enable studies on pollen tube guidance and tip growth regulation in Phalaenopsis orchids and possibly in other orchid species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPhalaenopsis 3aembryo sac 3aflowers 3agenetic markers 3aimage analysis 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apollination 3astaining 3atemporal variation1 aFang, Su-Chiung0 tPlant reproduction.g2016 June, v. 29, no. 1-2 p.179-188dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-016-0280-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02076naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245008100166300001600247520054700263536032400810592002801134650002301162650001701185650001201202650001901214650001301233650002201246653004701268653001401315653002101329653002501350700001401375700001601389700001801405700002001423773014001443856008601583852000901669655001201678IND60738060120221120043201.0220730e20210603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073806012DNAL7 a10.1080/10286020.2021.19102402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Feng10aNeolignan and phenylpropanoid compounds from the resin of Styrax tonkinensis  ap. 527-535.  aA new neolignan compound, tonkinensisin A (1), and two phenylpropanoid compounds, tonkinensisin B (2) and tonkinensisin C (3), were isolated from the resin of Styrax tonkinensis (Pierre) Craib ex Hartw.

Thus, with the objective of further clarifying this issue, maize plants were subjected to densities from 30,000 to 90,000 plants ha&minus;1, and the plant growth, soluble sugars and starch contents, invertase and sucrose synthase activities, and plant production were evaluated. We found that the stalk is more sensitive to the increasing plant density than leaves and kernels. The dry weight of the stalk and leaves per single plant decreased more drastically from low to intermediate plant densities, while grain production was reduced linearly in all plant density ranges, leading to higher values of harvest index in intermediate plant densities. The sucrose concentration did not change in leaves, stalk, or kernels of plants subjected to increasing plant densities at the R4 stage. Also, the specific activity of soluble invertase, bound invertase, and sucrose synthase did not change in leaf, stalk, or kernels of plants subjected to increased plant density. The productivity was increased with the increase in plant density, using narrow row (0.45 m) spacing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acorn 3acrops 3aenzyme activity 3aharvest index 3aleaves 3aplant density 3aplant growth 3aseeds 3astarch 3asucrose 3asucrose synthase1 aRevoredo, Marcos  D.0 tAgronomy.g2018 Nov. 02, v. 8, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy81102433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245015500171300001500326520173500341592002802076650001502104650002402119650001102143650001802154653001102172653001502183653002102198653001902219653001702238653001902255700002202274700001802296773011502314856008702429852000902516655001202525IND60590776820190202000000.0190202e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059077682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.0802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShokati, Naser12aA comprehensive exergoeconomic analysis of absorption power and cooling cogeneration cycles based on Kalina, Part 2: Parametric study and optimization  ap. 74-103.  aA comprehensive exergoeconomic comparison of the absorption power and cooling cogeneration cycles based on Kalina is investigated in this study. After thermodynamic and exergoeconomic simulation of the double effect absorption refrigeration/Kalina as well as the first and second configurations of simple absorption refrigeration/Kalina cogeneration cycles, in this part, a widespread parametric study is done and the effects of the simultaneous variations of all studied cogeneration cycles operating parameters are examined on the thermodynamic and exergoeconomic performance of the cogeneration cycles. Also, for a better comparison of the considered cycles, the optimization is done and the considered cogeneration cycles are comprised regarding to five objective functions including the minimum unit cost of products, maximum energy and exergy efficiencies, minimum unit cost of produced exergy and minimum the sum of exergy destruction and capital investment cost rates. Finally, the payback period of the studied cogeneration cycles is calculated in all optimum states. The results show that the minimum unit cost of products for the first configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle is 16.46% and 9.27% less than the corresponding values for the DEAR/Kalina cycle and the second configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle, respectively. Also, the value of ĊD+Ż parameter for the first configuration of SAR/Kalina cogeneration cycle is 28.32% and 33.12% less than the corresponding values for the second configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle and DEAR/Kalina cycle, respectively. Also, in all optimum states except for the minimum unit cost of produced exergy, the first configuration of SAR/Kalina cycle has the lowest amount of payback period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aeconomic investment 3aexergy 3arefrigeration 0aKalina 0aAbsorption 0aParametric study 0aExergoeconomic 0aOptimization 0aPayback period1 aRanjbar, Faramarz1 aYari, Mortaza0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 161 p.74-103dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.0803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245015300161300001600314520134900330592002801679650002501707650002701732650002801759650001801787650002601805650002901831650002401860650001601884650002601900650001001926650002001936650001601956650001801972650003001990650001502020650002502035650001102060650002202071650000902093650001302102650001202115650001502127650002102142653002402163653002702187653002502214653002802239653001202267653001502279700001802294700001902312700001802331700002002349700001902369773012802388856007802516852000902594655001202603IND60650140920221116140346.0190804e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065014092DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2018.43292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Woo Jin10aAntiobesity Effects of Lactobacillus plantarum LMT1-48 Accompanied by Inhibition of Enterobacter cloacae in the Intestine of Diet-Induced Obese Mice  ap. 560-566.  aThe gut microbiota is the most important environmental factor that plays a role in inducing obesity. The gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacter cloacae strains, recently identified in obese mice are considered to be pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Probiotics are important members of the gut microbiota and exert beneficial effects, including inhibiting the growth of potential pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, we isolated a total of 230 lactic acid bacteria from traditional, Korean fermented foods and fecal samples from newborn infants, including Lactobacillus plantarum LMT1-48, which exhibited maximal antimicrobial activity against E. cloacae. We next investigated the functional antiobesity effects of L. plantarum LMT1-48 in an E. cloacae-induced high-fat diet (HFD)-fed animal obesity model. To this end, the L. plantarum LMT1-48 showed antiobesity effects, including body weight loss and reduction of abdominal fat volume, which was accompanied by a decrease in leptin and total cholesterol levels in E. cloacae-induced HFD-fed mice. Notably, gut microbiota diversity also increased after long-term ingestion of L. plantarum LMT1-48, resulting in amelioration of obesity in E. cloacae-induced HFD-fed mice. Accordingly, results suggest that dietary intake of L. plantarum LMT1-48 protects against the onset of E. cloacae-induced obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aabdominal fat 3aanimal disease models 3aantimicrobial properties 3abody weight changes 3acholesterol 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3afermented foods 3afood intake 3ahigh fat diet 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestines 3alactic acid bacteria 3aleptin 3along term effects 3amice 3aneonates 3aobesity 3aprobiotics 3avirulent strains 0aanti-obesity effect 0aantimicrobial activity 0aEnterobacter cloacae 0aLactobacillus plantarum 0aobesity 0aprobiotics1 aDong, Hye Jin1 aJeong, Hyun Uk1 aJung, Hyun Ho1 aKim, Yeung-Hyen1 aKim, Tai-hoon,0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2019 June 01, v. 22, no. 6 p.560-566dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2018.43293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200217 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004200099040001800141100001900159245008300178300001600261520135900277592002801636650001701664773010901681852000901790856008901799655001201888991633299540742620221118141706.0181002e197804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7890964982DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-197804000-000022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBRESLER, ESHEL10aTheoretical modeling of mixed-electrolyte solution flows for unsaturated soils  ap. 196-203.  aA mixed salt solution with ions that interact with the soil matrix are important in field problems involving the simultaneous flow of water and mixed Na-Ca salts in unsaturated soils. Governing partial differential equations describing transient, one-dimensional, simultaneous transfer of mixed anions, cations, and water are formulated, taking into account physicochemical interaction between mono and divalent ions and the soil matrix. Effects of convection, diffusion, mechanical dispersion, anion exclusion, cation exchange and adsorption, and coupling phenomena are considered jointly. Soil-interacting and coupling parameters are estimated theoretically from mixed-ion diffuse double-layer theory, taking into account tactoids, capillarity, and hydrodynamic considerations. The coupling-interacting parameters include: osmotic efficiency coefficient, anion exclusion, cation exchange equilibria, soil water retentivity, and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and their dependence on soil water content and soil solution concentration and composition. A finite difference approach that eliminates numerical dispersion is used to approximate the nonlinear partial differential equations and the boundary conditions appropriate to infiltration, redistribution, drainage, and evaporation of soil water. A brief computational scheme concludes the paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil science0 tSoil science.g1978 Apr., v. 125, no. 4 p.196-203dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-197804000-000023Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02351naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245014200174300001600316500001500332520087900347592002801226650002401254650002401278650001101302650001101313650004201324650001401366650001201380650001301392651001101405653001701416700002701433700003301460700003701493700002801530700003001558700002501588700002101613700002301634700002801657700002401685773008201709856008101791852000901872655001201881IND60481746220221121032701.0160209e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048174622DNAL7 a10.1007/s11262-015-1266-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCibulski, Samuel Paulo10aUngulate copiparvovirus 1 (bovine parvovirus 2): characterization of a new genotype and associated viremia in different bovine age groups  ap. 134-137.  a2019-12-06  aA novel bovine parvovirus 2 (BPV2) genotype comprising 5394 nt was identified by next generation sequencing from sera of healthy cattle at different age groups farmed in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed similar clustering with two previously described bovine BPV2 within the genus Copiparvovirus. No significant differences (P ≥ 0.05) were detected in the distribution of BPV2 infection in cattle at different age groups.

Recent beer proteome analyses have suggested that barley dimeric α-amylase inhibitor-1 (BDAI-1) and avenin-like protein-a (ALP) derived from barley are important for beer foam stability. In this study, BDAI-1 and ALP were purified from a Japanese commercial beer sample using salt precipitation and column chromatography. The purification level was verified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and database searches. Purified BDAI-1 and ALP were added to a beer sample to compare the foam stability to that of a control beer sample. As a result, beer foam stability was significantly improved by BDAI-1 but not by ALP, thereby suggesting that BDAI-1 affects beer foam stability whereas ALP does not.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-amylase 3abarley 3abeers 3achromatography 3adatabases 3afoams 3amass spectrometry 3aproteome 3atwo-dimensional gel electrophoresis 0aBeer 0aFoam stability 0aBarley dimeric α-amylase inhibitor-1 0aAvenin-like protein-a1 aKihara, Makoto1 aSato, Kazuhiro1 aOgushi, Kensuke0 tFood chemistry.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 172 p.257-264dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.09.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010800169300001600277520109000293592002801383650001301411650001301424650002401437650002101461653002901482653002801511653002901539653002401568700005601592700002201648773011601670856008701786852000901873655001201882IND60590777020221121200341.0190202e20180401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059077702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.0822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Moucun10aEnd losses minimization of linear Fresnel reflectors with a simple, two-axis mechanical tracking system  ap. 284-293.  aIn order to compensate for end losses in linear solar concentrators (which can account for 33% of the optical losses), a mechanically simple two-axis tracking system was designed and analyzed. In the proposed system, a standard linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) with east-west rotational tracking was placed on north-south rails and driven by a linear actuator. By keeping the receiver fixed, end losses can be eliminated when the reflector slides along the rails. The relative optical efficiency improvement of this design was studied in detail though a combination of theory, numerical simulation, and experimentation. The results show that the annual average optical efficiency of an LFR can be improved by 8–50%, depending on the normalized collector length and local latitude. The optimal sliding distance limit, ds,lim, and the LFR geometries where this design is most techno-economically beneficial were also investigated. It was found that the proposed tracking system is most applicable to solar-driven, industrial process heat systems where rooftop or ground space is limited.  aPublisher supplied data 3ageometry 3alatitude 3amathematical models 3asolar collectors 0aLinear Fresnel reflector 0aEnd losses minimization 0aTwo-axis tracking system 0aOptical performance1 aZhu, Yuezhao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1076-46641 aTaylor, Robert A.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Apr. 01, v. 161 p.284-293dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2018.01.0823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03612naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245018100165300001600346520195800362592002802320650002502348650003002373650001202403650001802415650001802433650001102451650001502462650002602477650003302503650001702536650003302553650001202586653002502598653003102623653002002654653003002674653002602704653001202730700002702742700003302769700002502802700001902827700001902846700003202865773011802897856008203015852000903097655001203106IND60715097520221119015933.0220914e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071509752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2020.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaah, Charles10aExamining the correlations between stakeholder pressures, green production practices, firm reputation, environmental and financial performance: Evidence from manufacturing SMEs  ap. 100-114.  aDiscovering the motivations behind the adoption of green production practices and its impact on firm performance from the perspective of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) have become crucial for both scholars and practitioners. However, there exists a substantial unexplored research gap regarding how stakeholder pressures motivate and influence the adoption of green production practices and the performance of SMEs in the context of developing countries. Drawing on the institutional theory, stakeholder theory and the natural resource-based view, this study explores the framework through which organizational and regulatory stakeholder pressures influence the adoption of green production practices, firm reputation, environmental and financial performance. The study employed a quantitative approach and partial least square structural equation modelling technique in making data analysis and interpretations due to its appropriateness for predictive research models. Using a survey research design, data were collected from owners and managers of manufacturing SMEs. The findings revealed that whiles regulatory stakeholder pressures positively and significantly influenced the adoption of green production practices, firm reputation, financial and environmental performance, organizational stakeholder pressures positively and significantly influenced the adoption of green production practices, firm reputation, and environmental performance. Green production practices also proved significant and positive in influencing firm reputation and environmental performance. The findings particularly exposed that organizational stakeholder pressures and green production practices had a negative yet significant influence on financial performance. The study highlights the significance of stakeholder pressures in making green production initiatives mandatory for organizational growth while also guiding policymakers, managers and scholars.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental performance 3afinance 3aleast squares 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3amotivation 3aquantitative analysis 3asmall and medium enterprises 3astakeholders 3astructural equation modeling 3asurveys 0aStakeholder pressure 0aGreen production practices 0aFirm reputation 0aEnvironmental performance 0aFinancial performance 0aPLS-SEM1 aOpoku-Agyeman, Douglas1 aAcquah, Innocent Senyo Kwasi1 aAgyabeng-Mensah, Yaw1 aAfum, Ebenezer1 aFaibil, Daniel1 aAbdoulaye, Farid Abdel Moro0 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2021 July, v. 27 p.100-114dElsevier LtdwJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2020.10.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010100168300001600269520099900285592002801284650003901312650001401351650001801365650002401383650001801407650002601425653001201451653001801463653001901481653001901500700001501519700001801534700002001552700001801572700005801590773010601648856008701754852000901841655001201850IND60553190920221121222416.0180830e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055319092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.0522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Mintae10aUniform and stable hydrogel-filled liposome-analogous vesicles with a thin elastomer shell layer  ap. 544-549.  aThis study introduces a new type of uniform liposome-analogous vesicle with a highly stable shell structure in which water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion drops fabricated in a capillary-based microfluidic device are used as templates. The vesicles developed in this work consist of a poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel core surrounded by a polyurethane (PU) film between 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) layers. Subjecting the double emulsion templates to UV irradiation leads to the formation of a PU elastomer film between the DPPC layers. The presence of a thin PU film sandwiched between the DPPC layers is confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. The thicknesses of the PU films are measured to be approximately ⿼4μm. Further study reveals the incorporation of the PU film between the DPPC layers remarkably improves the shell impermeability. Our vesicle system is expected to be useful for regulating the permeation of small molecules through lipid-based vesicular films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aemulsions 3ahydrocolloids 3apolyethylene glycol 3apolyurethanes 3aultraviolet radiation 0aVesicle 0aMicrofluidics 0aElastomer film 0aImpermeability1 aByun, Aram1 aShim, Jongwon1 aChoi, Hong Sung1 aLee, Youngbok1 aKim, Jin Woong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2823-88250 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 146 p.544-549dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.0523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009000154300002000244520176800264592002802032650004402060650002202104650002302126650001402149650001702163650001602180650001902196650000902215650001602224650001202240650002002252650001202272650001102284650002102295650002202316650001402338650001602352650002102368650001602389700001702405700001802422773012502440856007402565852000902639655001202648IND60669270020221122220524.0190920e20151014xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066927002DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra15655f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYao, Bing10aNovel photoluminescent chiral liquid crystalline oligomers containing lanthanide ions  ap. 87069-87076.  aNovel photoluminescent chiral liquid crystalline oligomers with lanthanide ions (Ln-LCOs) exhibiting excellent liquid crystalline properties and unique fluorescence properties were prepared using poly(methylhydrogeno)siloxane, cholesteric LC M₁, carboxyl-containing LC M₂ and anhydrous lanthanide chlorides. The chemical structures and liquid-crystalline behaviors of Ln-LCOs were characterized by various experimental techniques. The introduction of low content of lanthanide ions endowed the oligomers with significant luminescence properties. All the oligomers were chiral. The lanthanide ions did not change the liquid crystalline textures of the oligomers which were confirmed by X-ray diffraction. Fourier transform infrared imaging study indicated that the lanthanide ions were evenly distributed in the oligomers, which avoided the fluorescence quenching caused by the aggregation of lanthanide ions. A binary complex model with lanthanide ions acting as central ions and chiral liquid crystalline oligomers acting as ligands was established to express the interaction and distribution of the components. The Ln-LCOs showed reversible mesomorphic phase transitions, wide mesophase temperature ranges, and high thermal stabilities. The thermogravimetric analysis results displayed that the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of all Ln-LCOs were greater than 300 °C. The Ln-LCOs can emit red light or green light when being excited. Luminescence intensities of the Ln-LCOs gradually increased with an increase of lanthanide ions from 1 to 4 mol%. The temperature dependence of luminescent intensity was studied, where the fluorescence intensities of Ln-LCOs decreased monotonically with an increase of temperature in liquid crystalline phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3achemical structure 3achlorides 3afluorescence 3agreen light 3aimage analysis 3aions 3alanthanides 3aligands 3alight intensity 3aliquids 3amodels 3aphase transition 3aphotoluminescence 3ared light 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry 3aweight loss1 aCong, Yuehua1 aZhang, Baoyan0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 14, v. 5, no. 106 p.87069-87076dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra15655f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245006300165300002000228500001900248520107600267592002801343650001501371650001601386650002301402650002501425650001801450650001901468700002401487773012401511856007401635852000901709655001201718IND60737227920221121060601.0210514e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073722792DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01138c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlias, Lola Gonzalez10aMicrobial fuel cells for in-field water quality monitoring  ap. 16307-16317.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe need for water security pushes for the development of sensing technologies that allow online and real-time assessments and are capable of autonomous and stable long-term operation in the field.

This review focuses on the progress of the technology in real scenarios and in-field applications and discusses the technological bottlenecks that must be overcome for its success. An overview of the most relevant findings and challenges of MFC sensors for practical implementation is provided. First, performance indicators for in-field applications, which may diverge from lab-based only studies, are defined. Progress on MFC designs for off-grid monitoring of water quality is then presented with a focus on solutions that enhance robustness and long-term stability. Finally, calibration methods and detection algorithms for applications in real scenarios are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acalibration 3acost effectiveness 3amicrobial fuel cells 3awater quality 3awater security1 aDi Lorenzo, Mirella0 tRSC advances.g2021 May 04, v. 11, no. 27 p.16307-16317dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra01138c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02781naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001300145245011300158300001600271520133500287592002801622650002101650650002701671650002801698650001201726650001401738650001701752650001001769650002001779650003101799650001001830650001101840650001101851650001201862650002201874650001801896650001201914650003001926650001001956650001401966650001101980700001901991700001402010700001202024700001902036700001402055700001802069773010702087856004802194852000902242655001202251IND4473377920221116190527.0120315e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447337792DNAL7 a10.1007/s11105-011-0357-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJie, Sun10aPurification, Characterization, and Expression Analysis of a Putative Lectin in Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.)  ap. 413-420.  aA lactose-specific lectin (named Arachis hypogaea L Lectin (AHL)) was purified from the seed of the peanut Arachis hypogaea L. by single-step affinity chromatography using lactose-coupled agarose. AHL showed strong hemagglutinating activity to human A/B/O erythrocytes (RBC) treated with neuraminidase. The results of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF MS) analysis indicated that the protein AHL shared high homology with the peanut lectin chain A protein (gi|1942899). The AHL has binding activity to some Gram-negative bacteria and fungi spores which caused disease in peanut. Transcripts of AHL were detected in different peanut tissues, and the expression profile of the AHL gene changed in different parts of the plants. The variation in the mRNA transcript level in seeds was quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction during different growth periods. The expression profile of the AHL gene changed greatly in samples collected in different days after pegging. We explored the variation in AHL mRNA expression in six cultivars of peanut; the expression level observed in Lu Hua 12 was the highest. The data we described can provide us with clues to know more properties about peanut seed lectins at the biology chemistry and molecular biology level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aaffinity chromatography 3aagarose 3acultivars 3aerythrocytes 3afungi 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3alasers 3alectins 3amass spectrometry 3amessenger RNA 3apeanuts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3asialidase 3aspores1 aChu-shu, Zhang1 aLi-na, Yu1 aJie, Bi1 aShao-fang, Liu1 aFeng, Zhu1 aQing-li, Yang0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2012 Apr., v. 30, no. 2 p.413-420dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-011-0357-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010900163300001800272520119900290592002801489650001501517650001001532650001101542650001201553650001201565650001601577650000901593650002201602650002601624650002701650650001701677650002101694650001101715653002901726653002101755653002701776653002501803653003501828700005601863700001801919700001901937700005501956700005902011773013902070856007802209852000902287655001202296IND60682006220221120170522.0200122e20191226xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068200622DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b195862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yun Hyeok10aPhoto-Patternable Quantum Dots/Siloxane Composite with Long-Term Stability for Quantum Dot Color Filters  ap. 3961-3968.  aIncorporation of quantum dots (QDs) into color filters (CFs) are desired for less energy loss and wider viewing angle compared to a conventional display. However, aggregation and vulnerability to heat, moisture, and chemicals in the photo-patternable matrix are critical issues of the QD-CFs with high QDs concentration. Herein, we fabricated red (10 wt %) and green (20 wt %) QD-CFs using photolithography of QD/siloxane ink containing secondary thiol monomer. Ligand-exchanged QDs were chemically incorporated in methacrylate oligosiloxane resin. QD/siloxane composite showed superior stability under harsh heat and moisture (85 °C/5% RH and 85 °C/85% RH) conditions and chemicals (EtOH, HCl, and NaOH) compared to conventional QD/PR (commercial negative photoresist). QD-CFs (10 μm thick) effectively converted blue light emitted from LED chip into red and green light, and the obtained white PL through QD-CF showed wide color gamut, which was 108% relative to NTSC. From these advantages, QD/siloxane composite will be beneficial as color-conversion photoresists are to be used as color filters in liquid crystal displays, micro light-emitting diodes, and organic light-emitting diodes.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablue light 3acolor 3aenergy 3aethanol 3afilters 3agreen light 3aheat 3ahydrochloric acid 3alight emitting diodes 3aliquid crystal display 3aquantum dots 3asodium hydroxide 3athiols 0aquantum dot color filter 0asiloxane hybrids 0asol−gel condensation 0aphoto-patternability 0athermal and chemical stability1 aKoh, Sungjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5640-42991 aLee, Hyunhwan1 aKang, Seung-Mo1 aLee, Doh C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3489-61891 aBae, Byeong-Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9424-18300 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 26, v. 12, no. 3 p.3961-3968dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b195863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013800157300002000295520092000315592002801235650001701263650002201280650001601302650002301318700001301341700001601354700001501370700001701385700002101402773012501423856007401548852000901622655001201631IND60669270320221122220628.0190920e20151007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066927032DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra15658k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Dong-Li10aNew insights into electrolyte-component biased and transfer- and transport-limited charge recombination in dye-sensitized solar cells  ap. 84959-84966.  aWe carried out a time-resolved charge extraction (TRCE) study on the charge recombination dynamics of open-circuit dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by examining the temporal evolution of electron density with varying the concentration of the electrolyte component tert-butylpyridine (TBP). The charge recombination dynamics extracted from TRCE results exhibit distinctly different temporal behavior depending on the photovoltage or electron density. We proposed a theoretical model of electron density dependent charge recombination, which unifies the transport- and transfer-limited charge recombination mechanisms. This model, as rationalized by transient photovoltage (TPV) kinetics, can account well for the TRCE results. The relevance between electron transport and charge transfer in the recombination process was unraveled, and the electron density dependent pathway of charge recombination was elucidated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrolytes 3aelectron transfer 3asolar cells 3atheoretical models1 aWang, Yi1 aZhang, Ping1 aFu, Limin,1 aAi, Xi-Cheng1 aZhang, Jian-Ping0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 07, v. 5, no. 103 p.84959-84966dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra15658k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009600166300001800262520039500280592002800675650002700703650002300730650001500753650002000768650001500788650001900803650001300822650001800835650001100853700003000864700002600894773013400920856007401054852000901128655001201137IND60660088120221117225633.0190823e20140128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066008812DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc48741e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammer, Brenton A.

A.10aEffect of Temperature on the Deliquescence Properties of Food Ingredients and Blends  ap. 9241-9250.  aDeliquescence is a first-order phase transformation of a crystalline solid to a saturated solution that is triggered at a defined relative humidity (RH), RH₀. Previous studies demonstrated that the RH₀ of an inorganic substance with a positive heat of solution (ΔH) will decrease with increases in temperature. In this study, the relationships between ΔH, solubility, and deliquescence RH for single-ingredient and multicomponent systems were investigated. The deliquescence RHs of inorganic and organic crystalline solids and their mixtures were measured at temperatures ranging from 20 to 40 °C using a water activity meter and various gravimetric moisture sorption analyzers. The deliquescence behavior as a function of temperature for organic food ingredients was thermodynamically modeled and followed similar trends to those of the previously investigated inorganic ingredients. Furthermore, the models can be used as a predictive approach to determine physical stability and deliquescence RHs of deliquescent ingredients and blends if the storage temperature and ingredient ΔH and solubility are known.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood quality 3aingredients 3aorganic foods 3aphase transition 3arelative humidity 3asolubility 3astorage temperature 3awater activity 2aFood Analysis 2aFood Handling 2aHumidity 2aPowdersxchemistry 2aSolubility 2aTemperature 2aThermodynamics 2aWater 0adeliquescence 0athermodynamics 0aheat of solution 0asolubility 0atemperature dependence 0apowder mixture1 aLi, Na1 aSchmidt, Shelly J.1 aTaylor, Lynne S.1 aMauer, Lisa J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2013 Sept. 25, v. 61, no. 38 p.9241-9250dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjf402585t3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02455naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009400168520128400262592002801546650001101574650001901585650001601604650000901620650002201629650001901651650002001670650001701690650001901707650001901726650001701745650001201762650001401774650001601788650001701804700002601821773012201847856007901969852000902048655001202057IND60646941220221118000448.0190614e20181201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064694122DNAL7 a10.3390/agronomy81202872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiuta, Nyasha  E.10aResponse of Yellow Quality Protein Maize Inbred Lines to Drought stress at Seedling Stage  aThis study seeks to evaluate the response of 17 yellow Quality Protein Maize (QPM) inbred line seedlings to drought stress (DS), using different morphophysiological traits (plant height (PH), chlorophyll content (CC), stem diameter (SD), proline content (Pro), photochemical efficiency of photosystem II (PS II), canopy temperature (CT) and substomatal carbon dioxide concentration (Ci). The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and replicated three times in a growth chamber. The seedlings were exposed to DS treatment by growing them at 20% field capacity. The control/well-watered (WW) treatments were kept at 80% field capacity throughout the experiment. Highly significant differences (p < 0.001) were observed for PH, SD, and Pro across environments. On the other hand, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed for CC and PS II, while DS had no significant effects on Ci and CT. Proline content increased under DS compared to WW conditions. Inbred lines L34, L7, L5, L2, L16, and L6 had approximately equal or more Pro than the drought tolerant check (ZM1523). As such, these lines were regarded as drought tolerant.

This paper compares four classification algorithms performed in pixel- and object-based analyses. To increase the spectral and spatial resolution of the standard QB image, three different pansharpened images were obtained based on variations in the weight of the red and near infrared bands. The results showed slight differences between classifiers. Maximum Likelihood algorithm yielded the highest results in pixel-based classifications with an average overall accuracy (OA) of 94.2%. In object-based analyses, Maximum Likelihood and Decision Tree classifiers offered the highest precisions with average OA of 95.3% and 96.6%, respectively. Between pixel- and object-based analyses no clear difference was observed, showing an increase of average OA values of approximately 1% for all classifiers except Decision Tree, which improved up to 4.5%. The alteration of the weight of different bands in the pansharpen process exhibited satisfactory results with a general performance improvement of up to 9% and 11% in pixel- and object-based analyses, respectively. Thus, object-based analyses with the DT algorithm and the pansharpened imagery with the near-infrared band altered would be highly recommended to obtain accurate maps for site-specific management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOlea europaea 3aalgorithms 3acanopy 3adecision support systems 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis0 tAgronomy.g2018 Dec. 02, v. 8, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12361x2073-43957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy81202883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03450naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245011300185300001600298520181900314536020602133592002802339596007302367650001502440650002602455650001502481650001402496650001102510650003302521650002802554650002302582653001302605653002602618653001302644653003302657653001602690700003502706700004202741700003002783773010802813856008602921852000903007655001203016IND60650141420221116140438.0200515e20190703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065014142DNAL7 a10.1080/01916122.2018.14490282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMezzonato-Pires, Ana Carolina10aPollen morphology of Barteria and Paropsia: implications for the systematics of Passifloraceae sensu stricto  ap. 373-382.  aThe objective of the present study was to characterise the pollen morphology of the African genera Paropsia and Barteria (Passifloraceae sensu stricto, tribe Paropsieae), with the aim of identifying characters diagnostic of the genera. The pollen grains of nine species (two of Barteria and seven of Paropsia) were acetolysed, measured, described and illustrated using light and scanning electron microscopy. The pollen grains of Barteria are apolar with five pores, while those of Paropsia are isopolar and six-colporate with six endoapertures, one endoaperture for each ectoaperture. The endoapertures of Paropsia vary among the species and can be lolongate, lalongate or circular. The ornamentation of the sexine of Barteria is echinate-granulate, which proved important for distinguishing this genus from Paropsia, which has a reticulate sexine. Multivariate analysis based on quantitative data revealed two groups: Cluster 1, formed by species of Barteria; and Cluster 2, formed by species of Paropsia. The present work found the studied genera to be closely associated with Passiflora, the most well-known genus of Passifloraceae sensu stricto. Paropsia and Passiflora subg. Astrophea are closely related phylogenetically, as supported by their palynological affinity observed in the present study. However, the two taxa do differ in the arrangement of their apertures, with Paropsia having six ectoapertures and six endoapertures while species of Passiflora subg. Astrophea have six ectoapertures and three endoapertures. Because Passiflora subg. Astrophea is more derived, it is hypothesised that it experienced fusion of endoapertures during its evolutionary history. The results reported here are significant to the initial understanding of the evolution of pollen grains in Passifloraceae sensu stricto.  aAll of the authors are grateful for funding from FAPERJ (APQ1-E26/111,214/2014), and thank Marcelo Sales (Light and Scanning Microscopy Lab., Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro) for the SEM images.  aPublisher supplied data  aAPQ1-E26/111,214/2014cFAPERJdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004586 3aPassiflora 3amultivariate analysis 3apalynology 3aphylogeny 3apollen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ascientific illustration 3ataxon descriptions 0aBarteria 0amultivariate analysis 0aParopsia 0aPassifloraceae sensu stricto 0asystematics1 aSousa, Hian Carlos Ferreira de1 aMendonça, Cláudia Barbieri Ferreira1 aGonçalves-Esteves, Vania0 tPalynology.g2019 July 3, v. 43, no. 3 p.373-382dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4184753x1558-91887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01916122.2018.14490283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02648naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245018900180300001600369500001900385520100500404592002801409650002701437650002501464650002201489650001201511650001201523650002501535650001901560650002201579650000901601650001301610650001301623650001301636650001401649653001801663653003001681653003401711653001901745700002501764700002901789700002701818700002201845700002601867700002601893773012901919856008502048852000902133655001202142IND60738060920221120043113.0210520e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073806092DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2021.18738672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStanojević, Ljiljana P.14aThe influence of natural deep eutectic solvent glyceline on the yield, chemical composition and antioxidative activity of essential oil from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) leaves  ap. 247-255.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEssential oil from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) leaves was isolated by conventional hydrodistillation using hydromodulus of 1/15 m/v and by distillation after the plant material pretreatment with 10% v/v aqueous solution of natural deep eutectic solvent glyceline. Qualitative and quantitative composition of the oil was determined by GC/MS and GC/FID analyses, while its antioxidant activity was investigated by DPPH assay. The yield of the essential oil was higher after the pretreatment of the leaves. The distillation method affected the quantitative composition of essential oil, but not its qualitative composition. The essential oil from the pretreated leaves had a higher content of camphor, verbenone and borneol (33.3%, 12.2% and 8.3%, respectively) and better antioxidant activity than the oil obtained by classical hydrodistillation. The advantage of the pretreatment method is the effective improvement of the extraction efficiency of rosemary essential oil from rosemary leaves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aantioxidant activity 3aaqueous solutions 3aborneol 3acamphor 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3ahydrodistillation 3aoils 3aresearch 3arosemary 3asolvents 3averbenone 0aEssential oil 0aRosmarinus officinalis L. 0anatural deep eutectic solvent 0aGC/MS analysis1 aTodorović, Zoran B.1 aStanojević, Katarina S.1 aStanojević, Jelena S.1 aTroter, Dragan Z.1 aNikolić, Ljubiša B.1 aĐorđević, Biljana,0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2021 May 04, v. 33, no. 3 p.247-255dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl43444x2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2021.18738673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02858naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245011000165300001800275520139600293592002801689650001201717650001501729650002201744650001101766650001201777650001401789650001301803650001701816650001901833650003101852653001101883653002401894653002101918653002301939653001401962700001201976700001801988700001102006700001602017700001502033700001502048700001902063700005602082773013902138856007802277852000902355655001202364IND60682006520221122031522.0200122e20191219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068200652DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b197062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenshuang10aUltrafine Tungsten Oxide Nanowires: Synthesis and Highly Selective Acetone Sensing and Mechanism Analysis  ap. 3755-3763.  aBy using WCl₆ as a precursor and absolute ethanol as a solvent, ultrafine W₁₈O₄₉ nanowires (UFNWs) were synthesized by a one-pot solution-phase method and used as gas sensing materials. Their crystal structure, morphology, and specific surface area can be regulated by controlling precisely the content of the WCl₆ precursor in the solution. It has been found that, when the content of the precursor is 4 mg/mL, the formed products are UFNWs with a diameter of about 0.8 nm, only one crystal plane [010] is exposed, and the specific surface area is 194.72 m²/g. After the gas sensing test, we found that they have excellent selectivity to acetone. The response of 50 ppm acetone reaches 48.6, the response and recovery times are 11 and 13 s, respectively. In order to evaluate the interaction between W₁₈O₄₉ surfaces and different volatile organic compound (VOC) molecules, we simulated and calculated the adsorption energy (EAdₛ) among different W₁₈O₄₉ surfaces and different VOCs by DFT. The calculated results are in agreement with the experimental results, further confirming the ultrahigh selectivity of W₁₈O₄₉ UFNWs to acetone. The above results demonstrate that the high selectivity of W₁₈O₄₉ UFNWs to acetone is due to the exposure of its single crystal plane [010]. This work has practical significance for better detection of acetone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aadsorption 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3aethanol 3ananowires 3asolvents 3asurface area 3atungsten oxide 3avolatile organic compounds 0aW18O49 0aultrafine nanowires 0ahigh selectivity 0aacetone gas sensor 0amechanism1 aFan, Yu1 aYuan, Tongwei1 aLu, Bo1 aLiu, Yiming1 aLi, Zhixin1 aLi, Gaojie1 aCheng, Zhixuan1 aXu, Jiaqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4214-85320 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 19, v. 12, no. 3 p.3755-3763dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b197063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02766naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002400176245009400200300001500294520136100309592002801670650002701698650003401725650002201759650002101781650001801802650002401820650001701844650001201861650001701873650001401890650002001904650001801924700002201942700001901964773015101983856006902134856009702203990002302300852000902323655001202332IND60643454120221119105455.0190510e20131224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064345412DNAL7 a10.3791/507822doi7 aPMC41093002pmcid7 a244305102pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamachandra, Renuka10aIdentification of specific sensory neuron populations for study of expressed ion channels  ap. e50782.  aSensory neurons transmit signals from various parts of the body to the central nervous system. The soma for these neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia that line the spinal column. Understanding the receptors and channels expressed by these sensory afferent neurons could lead to novel therapies for disease. The initial step is to identify the specific subset of sensory neurons of interest. Here we describe a method to identify afferent neurons innervating the muscles by retrograde labeling using a fluorescent dye DiI (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate). Understanding the contribution of ion channels to excitation of muscle afferents could help to better control excessive excitability induced by certain disease states such as peripheral vascular disease or heart failure. We used two approaches to identify the voltage dependent ion channels expressed by these neurons, patch clamp electrophysiology and immunocytochemistry. While electrophysiology plus pharmacological blockers can identify functional ion channel types, we used immunocytochemistry to identify channels for which specific blockers were unavailable and to better understand the ion channel distribution pattern in the cell population. These techniques can be applied to other areas of the nervous system to study specific neuronal groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3acentral nervous system 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrophysiology 3afluorescent dyes 3aheart failure 3aimmunocytochemistry 3aion channels 3amuscles 3aperchlorates 3areceptors 3asensory neurons 3aspine (bones)1 aMcGrew, Stephanie1 aElmslie, Keith0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Dec. 24, , no. 82 p.e50782-e50782dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/507823Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50782/identification-specific-sensory-neuron-populations-for-study  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100005700144245009400201300001800295520160400313592002801917650001301945650001301958650001901971650002101990650001502011650001502026650001902041650002502060653002402085653002502109653002702134653002702161653003402188700001402222700001702236700001902253700002402272700001702296700001802313700005802331773013902389856007802528852000902606655001202615IND60682006720221120181154.0200122e20191227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068200672DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b197252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shihao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9233-516310aUltrastrong π-Bonded Interface as Ductile Plastic Flow Channel in Nanostructured Diamond  ap. 4135-4142.  aA combinational effect of nanostructured crystallites and π-bonded interfaces is much attractive in solving the conflict between strength/hardness and toughness to design extrinsically superhard materials with enhanced fracture toughness and/or other properties such as tunable electronic properties. In the present work, taking the experimentally observed π-bonded interfaces in nanostructured diamond as the prototype, we theoretically investigated their stabilities, electronic structures, and mechanical strengths with special consideration of the size effect of nanocrystallites or nanolayers. It is unprecedentedly found that the π-bonded interfaces exhibit tunable electronic semiconducting properties, superior fracture toughness, and anomalously large creep-like plasticity at the cost of minor losses in strength/hardness; such unique combination is uncovered to be attributed to the ductile bridging effect of the sp² bonds across the π-bonded interface that dominates the localized plastic flow channel. As the length scale of nanocrystallites/nanolayers is lower than a critical value, however, the first failure occurring inside nanocrystallites/nanolayers features softening and embrittling. These findings not only provide a novel insight into the unique strengthening and toughening origin observed in ultrahard nanostructured diamonds consisting of nanotwins, nanocomposites, and nanocrystallites but also highlight a unique pathway by combining the nanostructured crystallites and the strongly bonded interface to design the novel superhard materials with superior toughness.  aPublisher supplied data 3adiamonds 3ahardness 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystallites 3aplasticity 3aprototypes 3asemiconductors 3astrength (mechanics) 0aπ-bonded interface 0aplastic flow channel 0ananostructured diamond 0astrength and toughness 0amolecular dynamics simulation1 aZhang, Qi1 aLiu, Zhaorui1 aLegut, Dominik1 aGermann, Timothy C.1 aVeprek, Stan1 aZhang, Haijun1 aZhang, Ruifeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9905-72710 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 27, v. 12, no. 3 p.4135-4142dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b197253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007600165300001600241520230700257592002802564650002502592650001602617650002102633650002202654650001602676650001602692650001102708650002702719650001702746650001802763650002902781650002102810650001602831650001502847650002002862650001302882650002402895650001802919650002302937650001502960650001002975650001302985651001002998700002103008700002203029773013203051856008103183852000903264655001203273IND60481747120221121032909.0170726e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048174712DNAL7 a10.1007/s11367-016-1034-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordes, Hanna10aEvaluating the carbon footprint of Chilean organic blueberry production  ap. 281-292.  aPURPOSE: Chile is the second largest blueberry producer and exporter worldwide. At the global level, there is a lack of information by means of field data about greenhouse gas emissions from organic cultivation of this fruit. This study obtains a resource use inventory and assesses the cradle-to-farm gate carbon footprint (CF) of organic blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) production in the main cultivation area of Chile in order to identify CF key factors and to provide improvement measures. METHODS: The method used in this study follows the ISO 14040 framework and the main recommendations in the PAS 2050 guide as well as its specification for horticultural products PAS 2050-1. Primary data were collected for three consecutive production seasons from five organic Chilean blueberry orchards and calculations conducted with the GaBi 4 software. Agricultural factors such as fertilizers, pesticides, fossil fuels, electricity, materials, machinery, and direct land use change (LUC) are included. Only three orchards present direct LUC. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The direct LUC associated with the conversion from annual crops to perennial crops is a key factor in the greenhouse gas removals from the orchards. When accounting for direct LUC, the CF of organic blueberry production in the studied orchards ranges from removals (reported as negative value) of −0.94 to emissions of 0.61 kg CO₂-e/kg blueberry. CF excluding LUC ranges from 0.27 to 0.69 kg CO₂-e/kg blueberry. The variability in the results of the orchards suggests that the production practices have important effects on the CF. The factors with the greatest contribution to the greenhouse emissions are organic fertilizers followed by energy use causing, on average, 50 and 43 % of total emissions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The CF of the organic blueberry orchards under study decreases significantly when taking into account removals related to LUC. The results highlight the importance of reporting separately the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from LUC. The CF of blueberry production could be reduced by optimizing fertilizer application, using cover crops and replacing inefficient tractors and large irrigation pumps. The identification of improvement measures would be a useful guide for changing grower practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium corymbosum 3ablueberries 3acarbon footprint 3acomputer software 3acover crops 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3afertilizer application 3afossil fuels 3afruit growing 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ainventories 3airrigation 3aland use change 3aorchards 3aorganic fertilizers 3aorganic foods 3aorganic production 3apesticides 3apumps 3atractors 3aChile1 aIriarte, Alfredo1 aVillalobos, Pablo0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2016 Mar., v. 21, no. 3 p.281-292dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-016-1034-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157300002000274520107500294592002801369650002201397650003701419650001901456650001201475650001901487650002001506650001401526650002301540650002201563650001501585650001301600650002001613650001301633650001401646650001301660650001401673700001201687700001801699773012601717856007401843852000901917655001201926IND60669270920221122220530.0190920e20150928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066927092DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra15675k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAznárez, A.10aPerformance of palladium and platinum supported on alumina pillared clays in the catalytic combustion of propene  ap. 82296-82309.  aThe effect that the metal content of various pillared-clay-supported catalysts may have on the oxidation of propene was studied in this work. For this purpose, an alumina pillared montmorillonite (Al-PILC) was used as a support for palladium and platinum. The catalysts, with metal loadings of between 0 and 2 wt%, were characterized by chemical analysis, nitrogen physisorption at −196 °C, carbon dioxide physisorption at 0 °C, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), CO and H₂ chemisorption at 35 °C, NH₃ chemisorption at 70 °C and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Bulk PdO, Pd, and palladium–alumina structures were detected for the palladium catalysts. Likewise, bulk PtO₂ and small PtO₂ particles, which partially interact with the support, were observed for the Pt/Al-PILC catalysts. The results obtained suggest that the propene oxidation over Pd/Al-PILC and Pt/Al-PILC is a structure sensitive reaction as the turnover frequencies are affected by metal dispersion and the structure of the surface catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3aammonia 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical analysis 3acombustion 3ahydrogen 3amontmorillonite 3anitrogen 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3apropylene1 aGil, A.1 aKorili, S.

DNA supercoiling is catalyzed by a strand-passage mechanism, in which a T-segment of DNA is passed through the gap in a transiently cleaved G-segment. Strand passage requires the coordinated closing and opening of three protein interfaces in gyrase, the N-gate, DNA-gate, and C-gate. We show here that DNA binding to the DNA-gate of gyrase and wrapping of DNA around the C-terminal domains of GyrA induces a narrowing of the N-gate. This half-closed state prepares capture of a T-segment in the upper cavity of gyrase. Subsequent N-gate closure upon binding of ATP then poises the reaction toward strand passage. The N-gate reopens after ATP hydrolysis, allowing for further catalytic cycles. DNA binding, cleavage, and wrapping and N-gate narrowing are intimately linked events that coordinate conformational changes at the DNA and the N-gate.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDNA topoisomerase (ATP-hydrolysing) 3aadenosine triphosphate1 aKlostermeier, Dagmar0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 Aug. 23, v. 108, no. 34 p.14085-14090dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11021001083Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02788naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245009800217300001400315520124100329592002801570650001601598650002001614650001001634650001901644650001301663650001201676650002201688650001901710650002001729650001201749650001001761650000901771650002501780650002501805650002001830650002301850653002701873653001901900653000801919653001601927653001401943700002001957700002601977700002102003700002202024700002002046773009702066856008602163852000902249655001202258IND60633453620221120171731.0190509e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063345362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittaker, Danielle J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3491-564210aChemical profiles reflect heterozygosity and seasonality in a tropical lekking passerine bird  ap. 67-75.  aMany lekking systems exhibit highly skewed male reproductive success, but traits preferred by females are not always evident. In the lance-tailed manakin, Chiroxiphia lanceolata, male reproductive success is correlated with age, experience and heterozygosity, but mechanisms by which females might detect these qualities are unknown. Avian chemical signals, such as volatile compounds present in preen oil secreted by the uropygial gland, have been shown to predict reproductive success, correlate with genetic diversity and indicate body condition and immune function in temperate passerines. Here we tested whether preen oil volatile compounds contain information about individual characteristics related to mate choice in male and female lance-tailed manakins, including social and breeding status, heterozygosity and age. In males, preen oil volatile profiles reflected heterozygosity but not social status or age. In females, we found a relationship between volatile profiles and age but not breeding status or heterozygosity. Volatile compounds covaried with sampling date in both sexes. The information reflected in manakin volatile profiles suggests that they have the potential to serve as mate assessment cues in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroxiphia 3aanimal behavior 3abirds 3abody condition 3abreeding 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aimmune response 3alekking 3amales 3aoils 3areproductive success 3asocioeconomic status 3auropygial gland 3avolatile compounds 0achemical communication 0aheterozygosity 0alek 0amate choice 0apasserine1 aKuzel, Meredith1 aBurrell, Mikayla J.E.1 aSoini, Helena A.1 aNovotny, Milos V.1 aDuVal, Emily H.0 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 May, v. 151 p.67-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002700176245011800203300001500321520132000336592002801656650002401684650002801708650001301736650001301749650001501762700002501777700001801802700001701820700002401837700002301861700001401884773015101898856006902049856010502118990002302223852000902246655001202255IND60643454220221119105604.0190510e20140212xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064345422DNAL7 a10.3791/507832doi7 aPMC40894032pmcid7 a245617192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahmoradian, Sarah H.10aPreparation of primary neurons for visualizing neurites in a frozen-hydrated state using cryo-electron tomography  ap. e50783.  aNeurites, both dendrites and axons, are neuronal cellular processes that enable the conduction of electrical impulses between neurons. Defining the structure of neurites is critical to understanding how these processes move materials and signals that support synaptic communication. Electron microscopy (EM) has been traditionally used to assess the ultrastructural features within neurites; however, the exposure to organic solvent during dehydration and resin embedding can distort structures. An important unmet goal is the formulation of procedures that allow for structural evaluations not impacted by such artifacts. Here, we have established a detailed and reproducible protocol for growing and flash-freezing whole neurites of different primary neurons on electron microscopy grids followed by their examination with cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). This technique allows for 3-D visualization of frozen, hydrated neurites at nanometer resolution, facilitating assessment of their morphological differences. Our protocol yields an unprecedented view of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurites, and a visualization of hippocampal neurites in their near-native state. As such, these methods create a foundation for future studies on neurites of both normal neurons and those impacted by neurological disorders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectron microscopy 3anervous system diseases 3aneurites 3asolvents 3atomography1 aGaliano, Mauricio R.1 aWu, Chengbiao1 aChen, Shurui1 aRasband, Matthew N.1 aMobley, William C.1 aChiu, Wah0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2014 Feb. 12, , no. 84 p.e50783-e50783dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/507833Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50783/preparation-primary-neurons-for-visualizing-neurites-frozen-hydrated  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245003300175300001600208520141100224592002801635650001301663650002501676650003001701650001401731650001101745650002201756653002301778653002101801653001801822653002101840653002701861653002101888653001201909653001301921653001201934653002701946773009901973856008602072852000902158655001202167IND60633453720221120171706.0190509e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063345372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuberbühler, Klaus10aEvolutionary roads to syntax  ap. 259-265.  aSyntax is habitually named as what sets human language apart from other communication systems, but how did it evolve? Comparative research on animal behaviour has contributed in important ways, with mainly three sets of data. First, animals have been subjected to artificial grammar tasks, based on the hypothesis that human syntax has evolved through advanced computational capacity. In these experiments humans generally outperform animals, but there are questions about validity, as experimental stimuli are (deliberately) kept devoid of semantic content. Second, animal communication has been compared in terms of the surface structures with the aim of developing a typology of animal syntax, based on the hypothesis that syntax is an evolutionary solution to the constraints of small signal repertoires. A wide range of combinatorial phenomena has been described, mainly in nonhuman primates, but there is little support for the hypothesis that syntax has emerged due to repertoire size constraints. A third way of studying the evolution of syntax is to compare how animals perceive and communicate about external events, the mental deep structure of syntax. Human syntax is closely aligned with how we perceive events in terms of agency, action and patience, each with subsidiary functions. The event perception hypothesis has been least explored in animals and requires a serious research programme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrimates 3aanimal communication 3acommunications technology 3aevolution 3ahumans 3aresearch programs 0aargument structure 0acombinatoriality 0acommunication 0acompositionality 0acomputational capacity 0aevent perception 0agrammar 0alanguage 0ameaning 0arepertoire constraints0 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 May, v. 151 p.259-265dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01935naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009100157300002000248500001900268520076000287592002801047650000801075650003601083650001001119650001301129650001401142650001101156650001401167700001501181700001701196700001601213700001801229700001901247700001901266700001401285700001901299773012401318856007401442852000901516655001201525IND60737228920221121040300.0210514e20210504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073722892DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra01226f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Meimei10aLight-driven selective aerobic oxidation of (iso)quinoliniums and related heterocycles  ap. 16246-16251.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSelective C1–H/C4–H carbonylation of N-methylene iminium salts, catalyzed by visible-light photoredox and oxygen in the air, has been reported.

Despite efforts to understand the influence of maternal traits (e.g. age, size, body condition) on reproductive effort, much less is known about how maternal traits and environment influence the behaviour of offspring and ultimately, how offspring behaviour may influence the efficiency of the translation of maternal investment into offspring growth. Offspring of capital breeders, such as the northern elephant seal, Mirounga angustirostris, are nursed exclusively from maternal body reserves and investment is limited by the resources acquired prior to parturition. Combined new and previously published milk energy intake and offspring storage data (N=38) suggest impacts of maternal age on growth efficiency that are independent of rates of energy delivery. To determine the mechanisms underlying this effect of maternal age, behavioural data were collected from pups of 46 known-age females, from parturition to weaning, across 6 years and three different sites along the central California coast, representing 3954 seal-hours of observation. Pup behaviours were divided into five mutually exclusive categories that potentially impacted pup energetics. The offspring of older females spent more time resting, while offspring of younger females spent more time locomoting and distant from their mother. As pups developed, they spent more time suckling and locomoting and less time resting. Pup behaviour showed strong diel patterns, with activity decreasing over the day. The magnitude of these relationships varied between rookeries, suggesting influences of harem size, topography or environmental features on pup behaviour. Together these findings suggest direct impacts of maternal age and breeding experience on pup behaviour and growth efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMirounga angustirostris 3aanimal behavior 3abody condition 3abreeding 3acoasts 3aenergy intake 3afemales 3amaternal effect 3amilk 3aparturition 3aprogeny 3apups 3asuckling 3atopography 3aweaning 3aCalifornia 0abreeding experience 0adevelopment 0agrowth efficiency 0amaternal effects 0aoffspring behaviour1 aBerger, Ryan W.1 aRubin, Lovisa S.1 aMcDonald, Birgitte I.1 aCrocker, Daniel E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7940-80110 tAnimal behaviour.g2019 May, v. 151 p.121-130dElsevier LtdaThe Association for the Study of Animal BehaviourwJournal:jnl45841x0003-34727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2019.03.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02031naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245014200172300001600314500001900330520068600349592002801035650002501063650002201088650002601110650001901136650001001155650001601165650001301181653002301194653002901217653001801246653001501264653001501279700002601294700002501320700001501345700002201360773013201382856008601514852000901600655001201609IND60738478920221121065301.0210524e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073847892DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4576.2021.00018.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, P.

Most of non-LTR retrotransposons contain two open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1 codes for a gag-like protein, while the ORF2 codes for a reverse transcriptase (RT). We cloned two constructs based on Jockey-like non-LTR retrotransposon from genome Chironomus thummi (NLR1Cth). The retroposition assay performed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells demonstrated genome integrations of both constructs. The finding that the insect mobile element NLR1Cth is functional in mammalian cells demonstrates that this element possess universal enzymatic machinery allowing for active propagation in the genome of distant taxa. This suggests that the NLR1Cth transposon system may represent a useful tool for genetic analysis and manipulation in vertebrate cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3amidges 3aRNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aproteins 3aretrotransposons 3aRNA 3aopen reading frames 3agenome 3ahosts 3aChironomus riparius 3areverse transcription 3atransposition (genetics) 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aterminal repeat sequences 3aChinese hamsters 3atransposons 0aovaries1 aPapusheva, E.1 aPonimaskin, E.1 aBlinov, A.0 tRussian journal of genetics.g2011 June, v. 47, no. 6 p.682-690dSpringer-Verlagx1022-79547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1022795411060147  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014600165300001800311520107600329592002801405650002701433650005701460650002001517650002001537650003201557650001701589650004301606650002801649650001801677650002101695650004301716650001201759700001501771700001501786700001401801700001901815700001901834773011601853856008201969852000902051655001202060IND60583441320221120045347.0180619e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058344132DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-017-3468-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Guoqing12aA betabaculovirus DNA polymerase cannot substitute for the DNA polymerase of the alphabaculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus  ap. 3487-3492.  aDNA polymerase (DNApol) is present in all baculoviruses and plays a crucial role in viral DNA replication. Previously we showed that the DNApol of the alphabaculovirus group II Spodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus (SpltNPV) could partially substitute for the DNApol of a group I alphabaculovirus, Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). However, it is not known if a betabaculovirus DNApol could subsititute for the alphabaculovirus DNApol in AcMNPV. In this report, DNApol of the betabaculovirus Pieris rapae granulovirus (PiraGV) was inserted into a dnapol-null AcMNPV bacmid, creating Bac-AcΔpol:PrPol. The repair virus did not spread to neighboring cells; virus growth curve and real-time PCR revealed that the PiraGV dnapol substitution abrogated AcMNPV DNA replication and virus production. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that PiraGV DNApol could be expressed and localized to the nucleus. Collectively, our results suggested that the alphabaculovirus AcMNPV DNApol could not be replaced by a DNApol from the betabaculovirus, PiraGV.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAutographa californica 3aAutographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus 3aBetabaculovirus 3aDNA replication 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aPieris rapae 3aSpodoptera litura nucleopolyhedrovirus 3afluorescence microscopy 3agrowth curves 3amicrobial growth 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses1 aFang, Yang1 aWu, Lijuan1 aYan, Qing1 aKrell, PeterJ.1 aFeng, Guozhong0 tArchives of virology.g2017 Nov., v. 162, no. 11 p.3487-3492dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-017-3468-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02198naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245008000170300001600250520092000266592002801186650002601214650001301240650001601253650001701269650004401286650003101330653003501361653001401396653001101410653004601421700001801467700001601485700001801501700001701519700001501536700002401551700001401575773009201589856008601681852000901767655001201776IND60605226720221121213646.0200830e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060522672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2018.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Shengjun10aDetection and differentiation of Cys, Hcy and GSH mixtures by 19F NMR probe  ap. 513-519.  aSimultaneous detection and differentiation of biomolecules is of significance in biological research. Biothiols such as cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), and glutathione (GSH) play an important role in regulating the vital functions of living organisms. However, existing methods for simultaneous detection and differentiation of Cys, Hcy, and GSH are still challenging because of their similarity in structure and chemical properties. Herein we report a probe that simultaneously detects and discriminates between mixtures of Cys, Hcy and GSH using ¹⁹F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This ¹⁹F NMR probe responds rapidly to biothiols through the Michael addition reaction and subsequent intramolecular cyclization reaction allowing differentiation between Cys, Hcy and GSH through ¹⁹F NMR chemical shift. We demonstrate that this ¹⁹F NMR probe is a powerful method for analysis of complex mixtures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclization reactions 3acysteine 3aglutathione 3ahomocysteine 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphysicochemical properties 0a19F nuclear magnetic resonance 0aBiothiols 0aProbes 0aThiol-addition/intramolecular cyclization1 aZeng, Qingbin1 aGuo, Qianni1 aChen, Shizhen1 aLiu, Hongbin1 aLiu, Maili1 aMcMahon, Michael T.1 aZhou, Xin0 tTalanta.g2018 July 01, v. 184 p.513-519dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2018.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245012800163300001400291520121200305592002801517650002801545650001601573650002701589650001801616650000901634650001801643650001301661650001501674650001101689650001301700650001801713650002701731653001701758653001401775653001501789653001901804653001901823700001701842700001501859700001701874700001501891700001401906773011901920856008302039852000902122655001202131IND60530255420221121145344.0180904e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053025542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpb.2016.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Meijie10aConserved elements in the nanos3 3′UTR of olive flounder are responsible for the selective retention of RNA in germ cells  ap. 66-72.  aIn teleost fish, primordial germ cells (PGCs) are specified very early during embryogenesis and migrate to the site that gonads are formed. A previous study indicated that nanos3 is specifically expressed in PGCs, and the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of nanos3 is responsible for the localization of mRNA in these cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional regions of nanos3 3′UTR in olive flounder using truncated and mutated nanos3 3′UTRs fused to chimeric RNAs and microinjected into fertilized zebrafish eggs. The results indicated that a 68-bp functional element in the nanos3 3′UTR of olive flounder played important roles in the protection and degradation of RNA. Within this element, a U-rich region was identified to be responsible for the protection of RNA in PGCs and two GCAC sites for the degradation of RNA in somatic cells. The first GCAC was located adjacently to the U-rich region and the second GCAC within the U-rich region. Overall, we concluded that the two GCACs were the binding sites of miR-430, a microRNA that suppresses translation, whereas the U-rich region was the binding site of Dnd, a protein that antagonizes the miR-430-mediated silencing of mRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3' untranslated regions 3aDanio rerio 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3abinding sites 3aeggs 3aembryogenesis 3aflounder 3agerm cells 3agonads 3amicroRNA 3asomatic cells 3atranslation (genetics) 0aChimeric RNA 0aGCAC site 0aGerm plasm 0aMicroinjection 0aU-rich regions1 aTan, Xungang1 aSui, Yulei1 aJiao, Shuang1 aWu, Zhihao1 aYou, Feng0 tComparative biochemistry and physiology.g2016 Aug., v. 198 p.66-72dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12506x1096-49597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpb.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006700139245019700206500001100403520140400414592002801818596007701846596028401923650002302207650001102230650002002241650003002261650001202291650002102303650001602324650001202340650001902352650002202371650001802393650002002411650004302431650001302474650002002487650003102507650002202538650002202560650002802582650001702610650002402627700003102651700006402682700002202746700002002768773011702788856007302905852000902978655001202987IND60693367720221120124715.0200506e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069336772DNAL7 a10.1111/obr.130072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAcosta‐Manzano, Pedro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4494-235310aBeyond general resistance training. Hypertrophy versus muscular endurance training as therapeutic interventions in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: A systematic review and meta‐analysis  aREVIEW  aResistance training (RT) is a powerful first‐line intervention for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nonetheless, the effects of the most frequent RT (hypertrophy training [HT] and muscular endurance training [MERT]) employed for the management of T2DM, and which type of RT might exert superior effects, remain elusive. Thus, this review aims to assess the effects of HT and MERT on glycaemic control, physical fitness, body composition, lipid profile, blood pressure, C‐reactive protein, and quality of life in patients with T2DM; to analyse which particular RT is more effective; to assess the effects of general RT; and to identify RT components, characteristics of patients, and medications that could mediate the effects of RT. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and non‐RCT (RT≥ 4 weeks) in adults with T2DM were selected. Both HT and MERT improved HbA1c, insulin levels and sensitivity, muscle strength, body mass index, waist circumference, and fat mass. Additionally, HT improved glucose, cardiorespiratory fitness, fat percentage, lean body mass, lipid profile, systolic blood pressure, and C‐reactive protein, and MERT improved weight. Overall, HT and MERT exert beneficial effects well comparable with aerobic training. Both types of RT can be used as potent therapeutic interventions for the management of T2DM depending on patients' limitations/preferences.  aPublisher supplied data  aInternational mobility program for PhD candidatescUniversity of Granada  aSOMM17/6107/UGRcUniversity of Granada, Plan Propio de Investigación 2016, Excellence actions: Unit of Excellence on Exercise and Health (UCEES), and the Junta de Andalucía, Consejería de Conocimiento, Investigación y Universidades, European Regional Development Funds (ERDF) 3aC-reactive protein 3aadults 3abody mass index 3acardiorespiratory fitness 3aglucose 3aglycemic control 3ahypertrophy 3ainsulin 3alean body mass 3alipid composition 3ameta-analysis 3amuscle strength 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aquality of life 3arandomized clinical trials 3astrength training 3asystematic review 3asystolic blood pressure 3atherapeutics 3awaist circumference1 aRodriguez‐Ayllon, María1 aAcosta, Francisco M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4792-09691 aNiederseer, David1 aNiebauer, Josef0 tObesity reviews.g2020 June, v. 21, no. 6 p.e13007-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949851x1467-78817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/obr.130073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245012900207300001800336520238000354592002802734650001702762650001402779650001802793650001202811650002302823650001902846700001702865700006002882700002302942700002402965773017102989856008103160852000903241655001203250IND60781561820220629000000.0220629e20220616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078156182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.1c045072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarayanan, Harini1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4545-488510aHybrid Models Based on Machine Learning and an Increasing Degree of Process Knowledge: Application to Cell Culture Processes  ap. 8658-8672.  aIn this work, we aim to introduce the concept of the degree of hybridization for cell culture process modeling. We propose that a family of hybrid models can be created with varying fractions of process knowledge explicitly encoded in the model, defined as the degree of hybridization, with the two extremes being fully data-driven (0%) and fully mechanistic (100%) models. Subsequently, the aim is to compare the different models based on different metrics: model accuracy, the experimental effort for model development, extrapolation capability, the capability of generating new process understanding, and ease of utilization in practice, and to demonstrate that this could provide an additional degree of freedom for model selection. We could quantitatively demonstrate that for the cell culture process, either extreme has limitations. The major drawback of the data-driven model is the poor performance at low data availability as well as poor extrapolation capability, inability to provide process understanding, and subsequently inefficient practical application. On the other hand, the mechanistic model has poor accuracy due to the addition of excessive knowledge that then biases the models. Moving from data-driven to mechanistic models, the performance of the models improves progressively, as long as the knowledge added is not too biased. We show that the choice of the hybrid models to be used is based on the goal of model development. For instance, hybrid models including mass balances on each species show better performance in transferring models across different modes of operation. On the other hand, models with a higher degree of hybridization allow for more process interpretation possibilities. For modeling accuracy, amount of training data, extrapolation, and practical applications, the Hybrid Rate (HR) model is found to have the optimal degree of hybridization. This is likely due to the compromise between adding process knowledge and increasing the model parameters achieved by the HR model. The HR model features the incorporation of mass balance and channels the data-driven modeling to cell-specific rates, and thus these two pieces of information appear to be the most crucial ones. Finally, we believe that the concept will be instrumental in progressively developing and testing hypotheses about complex processes such as cell cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell culture 3achemistry 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3amechanistic models 3aprocess design1 aLuna, Martin1 aSokolov, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8396-40991 aButté, Alessandro1 aMorbidelli, Massimo0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 June 16, v. 61, no. 25 p.8658-8672dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.1c045073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010000170300001600270500001900286520052900305592002800834650002500862650001200887650001300899650001300912653001400925653001500939653002300954653001400977700001600991700001801007773013201025856008601157852000901243655001201252IND60738479220221122053012.0210524e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073847922DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4576.2021.00021.92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJamalli, Omid10aFeeding inhibition of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) larvae to bioformulations on tomato leaves  ap. 135-140.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe present investigation was undertaken to assess the feeding inhibition (FI) with different natural products viz., Brahmastra, Neemastra and Agniastra against the third to sixth instar larvae of H. armigera under laboratory conditions.

Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the strain is closely related to Nocardioides alpinus Cr7-14ᵀ and Nocardioides furvisabuli DSM 18445ᵀ with 98.5 and 98.1% similiarity, respectively. Growth was observed at 4–28 °C in R2A medium (optimum at 25 °C), at 10–30 °C in YMA and LB medium (optimum in both at 28 °C) and at pH 5.0–10.0 in R2A medium (optimum at pH 7.0–8.0). The cell wall peptidoglycan was found to contain LL-diaminopimelic acid as the principal diamino acid and MK-8(H4) was identified as the predominant menaquinone. The major polar lipids were identified as phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, two unidentified glycolipids and two unidentified polar lipids. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C₁₆:₀ (32.8%) and C₁₈:₁ ω9c (15.1%). The DNA G+C content of strain HH06ᵀ was determined to be 71.4 mol%. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic properties and DNA–DNA relatedness, it is concluded that strain HH06ᵀ represents a novel species of the genus Nocardioides, for which the name Nocardioides astragali sp. nov. is proposed.

The particles deposited in the ECSs could negatively affect the performance of the airplanes. In addition, particles that penetrate into the aircraft cabin could adversely impact the health of passengers and crew members. This investigation conducted simultaneous measurements of particle mass concentration and size distribution inside and outside the cabin during 64 commercial flights of Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 aircraft departing from or arriving at Tianjin Airport in China. The results showed that the PM2.5 mass concentration deposition in the ECSs of these airplanes ranged from 50% to 90%, which was much higher than that measured in an airplane with a ground air-conditioning unit. The average deposition rates of particles with diameters of 0.5–1 μm, 1–2 μm, 2–5 μm, 5–10 μm, and >10 μm were 89 ± 8%, 85 ± 13%, 80 ± 13%, 73 ± 15%, and 80 ± 14%, respectively. The in-flight measurement results indicated that the particle concentration in the breathing zone was higher than that in the air-supply zone, which implies a significant contribution by particles in the interior of the cabin. Such particles come from human emissions or particle resuspension from interior surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair conditioning 3aair pollution 3aairplanes 3aairports 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abreathing 3amonitoring 3aparticulate emissions 3aparticulates 3aChina 0aParticulate matter 0aDeposition 0aAir-conditioning system 0aFiltration 0aParticle mass 0aParticle number1 aXu, Qiuyu1 aLiu, Wei1 aLin, Chao-Hsin1 aWei, Daniel1 aBaughcum, Steven1 aNorris, Sharon1 aChen, Qingyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3204-94880 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Apr., v. 154 p.118-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245009800168300001600266500001900282520105200301592002801353650001401381650001301395650002201408651000901430653002301439653001801462653003001480700001601510700001501526700001701541700002201558773013201580856008601712852000901798655001201807IND60738479420221122185854.0210524e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073847942DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4576.2021.00023.22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKassiri, H.12aA review on the removal methods of organophosphate insecticide malathion from the environment  ap. 145-152.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis review study was done by searching the keywords related to malathion, decomposition, physicalchemical methods and biological methods within the sites related to valid medical and health journals and reliable bases, such as, Web of Science, Ovid, PubMed, Systematic Review , SID and Google Scholar. Totally, 140 references were reviewed and eventually 88 references concentrating on the studies in Iran and the world were selected. This study showed that the removal amount of Malathion in physical-chemical methods was higher than 90% in 68% of the articles while in 32%, it was less than 90%. In the biological methods, in 46% of the articles, the removal amount of Malathion was higher than 90% while in the other 54%, it was less than 90%. The most applied method for removing Malathion was biological methods. Among the used methods, using bacteria was applied more than other methods. Due to the low cost, high efficiency and eco-friendliness of biological methods, using biological methods was better than the physical-chemical methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3amalathion 3aresearch 3asystematic review 3aIran 0aBiological methods 0aDecomposition 0aPhysical-chemical methods1 aRabbani, D.1 aMohebi, F.1 aDehghani, R.1 aTakhtfiroozeh, S.0 tJournal of entomological research.g2021 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.145-152dMalhotra Publishing HousewJournal:2033x0974-45767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5958/0974-4576.2021.00023.23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03211naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010700172300001800279520172300297592002802020650002802048650001202076650001302088650001302101650001802114650001602132650001402148650001002162650002502172650000702197650001402204650003002218650001402248650001802262650001802280650002202298651000902320700002302329700002102352700002302373700002502396700001602421700002602437700001502463773013702478856008102615852000902696655001202705IND60596527420221119085734.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059652742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-018-1018-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVahed, SepidehZununi10aHalomonas tabrizica sp. nov., a novel moderately halophilic bacterium isolated from Urmia Lake in Iran  ap. 1139-1148.  aA novel moderately halophilic, Gram-stain negative and aerobic bacterium, designated strain TBZ21ᵀ, was isolated from a water sample of Urmia Lake, Iran. Cells were observed to be non-motile rods with no flagellum, showing positive catalase and oxidase reactions. Strain TBZ21ᵀ was found to grow at 10–40 °C (optimum, 30 °C), at pH 7–10 (optimum, pH 8) and in the presence of 1–22% (optimum, 10%). The major fatty acids were identified as C₁₉:₀ cyclo ω8c, C₁₆:₀, Summed features 3 (C₁₃:₀ 3-OH and/or iso-C₁₅:₁ H) and 8 (C₁₈:₁ ω7c and/or C₁₈:₁ ω6c) and C₁₂:₀ 3-OH. The major polar lipids were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phosphoaminolipid. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain TBZ21ᵀ was determined to be 63.3 mol%. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain TBZ21ᵀ belongs to the genus Halomonas, and shows high sequence similarities to Halomonas fontilapidosi 5CRᵀ (99.43%), Halomonas ventosae AL12ᵀ (98.64%), Halomonas sediminicola CPS11ᵀ (98.63%) and Halomonas aestuarii Hb3ᵀ (98.08%), and has low similarities (below 98.0%) with other members of the genus. The values of DNA–DNA relatedness between strain TBZ21ᵀ and the closely related strains H. fontilapidosi LMG 24455ᵀ and H. ventosae LMG 26187ᵀ were 42 ± 11% and 54 ± 16%, respectively. On the basis of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular characteristics, strain TBZ21ᵀ is concluded to represent a novel species of the genus Halomonas, for which the name Halomonas tabrizica sp. nov. is proposed.

By using spray drying, phytosterols microparticles were formulated and developed in this work. Arabic gum, maltodextrin and one of two different surfactants were thoroughly studied as wall materials. Increasing concentrations of Tween 20 (T20) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SDS), from 0.1 to 2.65% w/v, were evaluated. The feed suspension characteristics (viscosity, interfacial properties and particle size distribution), process yield (PY), encapsulation efficiency (EE), phytosterols retention (R) and size of the microparticles were analyzed. The presence of surfactants in the suspension to be spray dried has significant effects on the studied responses. T20 led to process yields around 65% (2% w/v surfactant concentration). On the other hand, the microparticles obtained using 2% w/v of SDS were the best in terms of EE (about 50%), R (close to 40%) and particle size (5.89μm), being the PY acceptable (almost 55%). According to the open literature, which indicates that average particle sizes lower than 25μm favor the phytosterols bioavailability, the microparticles obtained in this work are promising for phytosterols delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3afood matrix 3agum arabic 3ahydrophobicity 3amaltodextrins 3amicroencapsulation 3amicroparticles 3aparticle size 3aparticle size distribution 3aphytosterols 3apolysorbates 3apowders 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3aspray drying 3asurfactants 3aviscosity 0aPS 0aAG 0aMD 0aHLB 0aSDS 0aT20 0aPSD 0aPY 0aEE 0aTP 0aFP 0aR 0aD[3,2] 0aDSC 0aXRD 0aPhytosterol 0aEncapsulation 0aSpray-drying 0aSodium lauryl sulfate 0aPolysorbate Tween 201 aConstenla, Diana1 aRamírez-Rigo, María Verónica1 aPiña, Juliana0 tPowder technology.g2015 Dec., v. 286 p.193-201dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2015.08.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02802naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245019800154300002000352520140300372592002801775650002201803650001801825650002001843650002401863650001301887650001101900650002501911650001801936650001601954650002401970650003301994650001802027650002202045650000902067650001802076700001702094700003102111700002002142773012302162856007402285852000902359655001202368IND60640646920221121123028.0190504e20160525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064064692DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra07724b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Mina10aEnhanced production of extracellular proteolytic enzyme excreted by a newly isolated Bacillus subtilis FBL-1 through combined utilization of statistical designs and response surface methodology  ap. 51270-51278.  aAn extracellular protease producing strain FBL-1 was newly isolated from soil, and it was identified as Bacillus subtilis through 16S rDNA sequence analysis. B. subtilis FBL-1 was used for extracellular protease production, and culture conditions were optimized by statistical methods. Three statistical approaches such as Plackett–Burman design, steepest ascent path analysis, and Box–Behnken design were successfully combined to optimize protease production, which resulted in significant enhancement of production. Through Plackett–Burman experimental design, fructose and yeast extract were screened as the significant components for the production of extracellular protease. The center points of each parameter were predetermined by the steepest ascent method. Based on the results obtained by Box–Behnken experimental design, the optimized level of significant parameters for protease production was determined by multiple regression analysis. The optimized levels of parameters were fructose 32.42 g L⁻¹, yeast extract 15.02 g L⁻¹, and incubation time 35.78 h. Protease activity predicted by the quadratic model developed in this work was 578.55 U mL⁻¹, which was only 2.67% different from the experimental protease activity obtained by verification studies. The protease activity was significantly enhanced by 7.0-fold compared with the activity obtained from basal medium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aculture media 3aenzyme activity 3aexperimental design 3afructose 3amodels 3anucleotide sequences 3apath analysis 3aproteinases 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asoil 3ayeast extract1 aSi, Jin-Beom1 aReddy, Lebaka Veeranjaneya1 aWee, Young-Jung0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 25, v. 6, no. 56 p.51270-51278dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra07724b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03483naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002000144245010900164300001800273520197200291592002802263650001402291650002402305650002002329650001902349650001602368650002302384650002902407650001602436650001802452650002502470650001402495650001702509650001602526650001702542650002302559650002902582650001502611653002002626653002902646653002202675653001102697700001902708700002002727773015402747856007902901852000902980655001202989IND60556478220221123031132.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055647822DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-116922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Curtis W.14aThe effect of spray-drying parameters on the flavor of nonfat dry milk and milk protein concentrate 70%1  ap. 9598-9610.  aUnit operations during production influence the sensory properties of nonfat dry milk (NFDM) and milk protein concentrate (MPC). Off-flavors in dried dairy ingredients decrease consumer acceptance of ingredient applications. Previous work has shown that spray-drying parameters affect physical and sensory properties of whole milk powder and whey protein concentrate. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of inlet temperature and feed solids concentration on the flavor of NFDM and MPC 70% (MPC70). Condensed skim milk (50% solids) and condensed liquid MPC70 (32% solids) were produced using pilot-scale dairy processing equipment. The condensed products were then spray dried at either 160, 210, or 260°C inlet temperature and 30, 40, or 50% total solids for NFDM and 12, 22, or 32% for MPC70 in a randomized order. The entire experiment was replicated 3 times. Flavor of the NFDM and MPC70 was evaluated by sensory and instrumental volatile compound analyses. Surface free fat, particle size, and furosine were also analyzed. Both main effects (30, 40, and 50% solids and 160, 210, and 260°C inlet temperature) and interactions between solids concentration and inlet temperature were investigated. Interactions were not significant. In general, results were consistent for NFDM and MPC70. Increasing inlet temperature and feed solids concentration increased sweet aromatic flavor and decreased cardboard flavor and associated lipid oxidation products. Increases in furosine with increased inlet temperature and solids concentration indicated increased Maillard reactions during drying. Particle size increased and surface free fat decreased with increasing inlet temperature and solids concentration. These results demonstrate that increasing inlet temperatures and solids concentration during spray drying decrease off-flavor intensities in NFDM and MPC70 even though the heat treatment is greater compared with low temperature and low solids.  aPublisher supplied data 3acardboard 3aconsumer acceptance 3adried skim milk 3aheat treatment 3aingredients 3alipid peroxidation 3amilk protein concentrate 3aoff flavors 3aparticle size 3aprocessing equipment 3askim milk 3aspray drying 3atemperature 3atotal solids 3avolatile compounds 3awhey protein concentrate 3awhole milk 0anonfat dry milk 0amilk protein concentrate 0aprocess parameter 0aflavor1 aStout, Mark A.1 aDrake, MaryAnne0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.9598-9610dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-116923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03441naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001500144245012000159500002000279520132200299592002801621596009101649596005901740596009501799596006801894650002001962650002001982650002202002650001602024650001102040650001502051650001002066650001602076650002002092650003102112650001002143650001602153650002002169650001702189650003002206650002102236650002102257650001702278650000902295650001502304650002102319650005302340650005302393650000902446650001902455650001802474700001602492700001302508700001402521700005502535773013802590856007802728852000902806655001202815IND60693368320221120124641.0200506e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069336832DNAL7 a10.1002/mnfr.2019011052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min10aPork Meat Proteins Alter Gut Microbiota and Lipid Metabolism Genes in the Colon of Adaptive Immune‐Deficient Mice  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSCOPE: Excessive consumption of processed meat has been linked to an increasing risk of gut diseases. It is investigated how pork meat proteins affect colon homeostasis between normal and immune‐compromised mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: Immune‐deficient mice (Rag1⁻/⁻) and wild‐type mice are fed a diet that contains 20% casein or protein isolated from cooked pork or dry‐cured pork for 3 months. Rag1⁻/⁻ mice show greater variations in transcriptome responses and higher microbial diversity than wild‐type mice after consumption of the pork meat protein diets. Intake of pork meat protein diets also increases body weight and induces colonic oxidative stress, low‐grade inflammation, and gene expression involved in immune function, cell cycle, and migration. Key genes like Hmox1, Ppara, and Pparg are highly upregulated by pork meat protein. These changes are associated with decreased abundances of Blautia, Bifidobacterium, and Alistipes and increased abundances of Akkermansia muciniphila and Ruminococcaceae. CONCLUSION: Pork meat proteins affect colon health in both wild‐type and Rag1⁻/⁻ mice by altering the microbiome profile under the complex interaction with adaptive immunity. The findings herein give a new insight into the understanding of meat intake, immunity, and gut health.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐35cMinistry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China  a31530054cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a10000 Talent ProjectcMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China  aB14023cMinistry of Education of the People's Republic of China 3aBifidobacterium 3aRuminococcaceae 3aadaptive immunity 3abody weight 3acasein 3acell cycle 3acolon 3acured meats 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aimmune response 3ainflammation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alipid metabolism 3ameat consumption 3ameat protein 3amice 3amicrobiome 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3apork 3aprocessed meat 3atranscriptome1 aZou, Xiaoyu1 aZhao, Di1 aZhao, Fan1 aLi, Chunbao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4764-19940 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2020 May, v. 64, no. 9 p.e1901105-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938472x1613-41257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.2019011053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01531naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245015600167300001800323520052900341592002800870650000800898650002300906650002300929650001800952650002200970700002000992700001801012773010501030856008501135852000901220655001201229IND60579389020221122090521.0170817e20170407xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057938902DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b004792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chunxia10aNickel-Catalyzed Aminoxylation of Inert Aliphatic C(sp3)–H Bonds with Stable Nitroxyl Radicals under Air: One-Pot Route to α-Formyl Acid Derivatives  ap. 1690-1693.  aNickel-catalyzed aminoxylation of an unactivated C(sp³)–H bond with a stable nitroxyl radical has been accomplished for the first time to offer various N-alkoxyamine derivatives, which further enables a one-pot approach to α-formyl acid derivatives.

However, both species can be opportunistic pathogens and cause disease in nosocomial settings. These infections can be difficult to treat because of the frequency of antibiotic resistance among these strains. Bacteriophages are often suggested as an alternative therapeutic agent against these infections. In this study, E. faecalis and S. mitis strains were isolated from female patients with urinary tract infections. Bacteriophages active against these strains were isolated from sewage water from the Mtkvari River. Two phages, designated vB_EfaS_GEC-EfS_3 (Syphoviridae) and vB_SmM_GEC-SmitisM_2 (Myoviridae), were specific for E. faecalis and S. mitis, respectively. Each phage's growth patterns and adsorption rates were quantified. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light and temperature was determined, as was host range and serology. The S. mitis bacteriophage was found to be more resistant to ultraviolet light and exposure to high temperatures than the E. faecalis bacteriophage, despite having a much greater rate of replication. While each phage was able to infect a broad range of strains of the same species as the host species from which they were isolated, they were unable to infect other host species tested.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterococcus faecalis 3aMyoviridae 3aStreptococcus mitis 3aadsorption 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteriophages 3across infection 3afemales 3agastrointestinal system 3ahost range 3ahumans 3apathogens 3apatients 3arivers 3aserology 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 3aurinary tract diseases 3awastewater 0aEnterococcus faecalis 0aStreptococcus mitis 0ainfectious disease 0anosocomial infection 0abacteriophage therapy1 aTchgkonia, Irina1 aJgenti, Darejan1 aDvalidze, Teona1 aCarpino, James1 aGoderdzishvili, Marina0 tCanadian journal of microbiology.g2012 Nov. 6, v. 59, no. 1 p.18-21dNRC Research Pressx1480-32757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2012-03853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245014100175300001600316500001900332520070200351592002801053650002601081650001601107650001501123650001501138650002301153650001301176650002501189653001401214653003101228653002501259653001901284653001001303653001801313653001001331773013201341856008601473852000901559655001201568IND60738479920221122212735.0210524e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073847992DNAL7 a10.5958/0974-4576.2021.00028.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMinh, Nguyen Phuoc10aEffectiveness of frozen-thawed pretreatment combined pressing on physicochemical quality of mangrove apple (Sonneratia caseolaris) juice  ap. 175-178.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis research evaluated the frozen-thawed pretreatment combined three-round pressing to the physicochemical quality attributes of mangrove apple juice. Results showed that there were significant influence of the frozen-thawed pretreatment on yield, total soluble solid, total phenolic content, flavonoid content compared to the pressing alone. There was not significant difference between the two-round and three round pressing. Therefore this research concluded that mangrove apple pulp should be initially frozen at -20 ± 2°C, thawed at 28 ± 2°C and finally pressed in two cycles.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis which inflicts around one third of the global population, contains three IclR family transcriptional factors, namely Rv1719, Rv1773c and Rv2989. In this study, MSMEG_2386, the homolog of Rv2989 in Mycobacterium smegmatis, was deleted by homologous recombination and complemented. The gene did not affect the growth in conventional culture. However, the growth of deletion mutants upon isoniazid (INH) exposure was severely delayed. This growth defect is specific to INH and not observed in other antibiotics tested, including rifampicin, capreomycin, norfloxacin and ethionamide. The transcription of katG and enzymatic activity of its encoding product catalase were elevated in the MSMEG_2386 deleted M. smegmatis mutants. The survival of MSMEG_2386 deletion mutant within U937 macrophages was markedly reduced compared with the wild type strain. These results improve our understanding of the role of IclR family transcriptional factors in INH resistance in mycobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium smegmatis 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3abacteria 3acapreomycin 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahomologous recombination 3aisoniazid 3amacrophages 3amutants 3anorfloxacin 3arifampicin 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atuberculosis1 aFu, Tiwei1 aLi, Chunyan1 aFan, Xiangyu1 aXie, Jianping0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 07, v. 6, no. 60 p.54661-54667dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra07733a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02689naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245011000207300001800317500001500335520119800350592002801548650001901576650001801595650002001613650002601633650003101659650001801690650002201708650001401730650001101744650001001755650003301765650001001798650001001808650002101818650001101839650003201850650001601882651001501898653002001913700002101933700002601954773013701980856008102117852000902198655001202207IND60596527720221119084248.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059652772DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-018-1028-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumov, GennadiI.1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0026-190810aDescription of Komagataella mondaviorum sp. nov., a new sibling species of Komagataella (Pichia) pastoris  ap. 1197-1207.  a2019-12-06  aFive methylotrophic strains (UCDFST 71-1024ᵀ, UCDFST 54-11.16, UCDFST 54-11.141, UCDFST 68-967.1 and UCDFST 74-1030) from the Phaff Yeast Culture Collection (University of California Davis, USA) that were originally designated as Pichia pastoris were found to represent a novel Komagataella species.

Total RNA was extracted from this sample, and RNA-Seq analysis was conducted. Putative infecting viruses were detected by mapping the obtained reads to the full-length viral genome sequences available in the GenBank database (7457 sequences) and the de novo-assembled contigs. RNA-Seq analysis detected polerovirus, begomovirus, and amalgavirus sequences, and the polerovirus-like sequences showed strong similarity to those of previously reported pepper vein yellows viruses (PeVYVs). The complete viral genome sequence obtained by RT-PCR had a length of 6023 nt, had the typical genome organization of a polerovirus and showed a high degree of sequence similarity to PeVYV-2 from Israel. Moreover, the predicted amino acid sequence of the P0 protein of the Indonesian isolate was 85.1% to 88.8% identical to those of other PeVYVs. In accordance with the polerovirus species demarcation criteria, this isolate should be assigned to a new polerovirus species, and we propose the name “pepper vein yellows virus 9” (PeVYV-9) for this virus.  aPublisher supplied data  aBilateral programcJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a19H02950cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  aBilateral programcDirectorate General of Resources for Science Technology and Higher Education 3aAmalgavirus 3aBegomovirus 3aCapsicum annuum 3aPepper vein yellows virus 3aRNA 3agenetic databases 3agenome 3ahot peppers 3aleaves 3alength 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence homology 3avirology 3aviruses 3aIndonesia 3aIsrael1 aHomma, Kanami1 aKamitani, Mari1 aNagano, Atsushi J.1 aTaniguchi, Marina1 aPohan, Nadya1 aKesumawati, Elly0 tArchives of virology.g2020 Dec., v. 165, no. 12 p.3017-3021dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04838-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001600189245013000205300001400335520124700349592002801596653002801624653001001652653002201662653002101684653002201705700001901727700001901746700002101765700002501786700001601811700002101827700001201848700002101860700002101881700002601902700002401928700002101952700001801973700001601991700001902007773009902026856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60561979820221119155442.0170325e20170317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056197982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.omtn.2016.11.0082doi7 aPMC53634172pmcid7 a283253022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Sorah10aAptamer-Drug Conjugates of Active Metabolites of Nucleoside Analogs and Cytotoxic Agents Inhibit Pancreatic Tumor Cell Growth  ap. 80-88.  aAptamer-drug conjugates (ApDCs) have the potential to improve the therapeutic index of traditional chemotherapeutic agents due to their ability to deliver cytotoxic drugs specifically to cancer cells while sparing normal cells. This study reports on the conjugation of cytotoxic drugs to an aptamer previously described by our group, the pancreatic cancer RNA aptamer P19. To this end, P19 was incorporated with gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), or conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and derivative of maytansine 1 (DM1). The ApDCs P19-dFdCMP and P19-5FdUMP were shown to induce the phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser139 (γ-H2AX) and significantly inhibited cell proliferation by 51%–53% in PANC-1 and by 54%–34% in the gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line AsPC-1 (p ≤ 0.0001). P19-MMAE and P19-DM1 caused mitotic G2/M phase arrest and inhibited cell proliferation by up to 56% in a dose-dependent manner when compared to the control group (p ≤ 0.001). In addition, the cytotoxicity of P19-MMAE and P19-DM1 in normal cells and the control human breast cancer cell line MCF7 was minimal. These results suggest that this approach may be useful in decreasing cytotoxic side effects in non-tumoral tissue.  aPublisher supplied data 0aaptamer-drug conjugates 0aApDCs 0anucleoside analog 0acytotoxic agents 0apancreatic cancer1 aHuang, Kai-Wen1 aReebye, Vikash1 aSpalding, Duncan1 aPrzytycka, Teresa M.1 aWang, Yijie1 aSwiderski, Piotr1 aLi, Lin1 aArmstrong, Brian1 aReccia, Isabella1 aZacharoulis, Dimitris1 aDimas, Konstantinos1 aKusano, Tomokazu1 aShively, John1 aHabib, Nagy1 aRossi, John J.0 tMolecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids.g2017 Mar. 17, v. 6 p.80-88dElsevier Inc.x2162-25317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.omtn.2016.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02508naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245010000163300001800263520104200281592002801323596012801351596009401479650001901573650001401592650002001606650001901626650001901645650001301664700005501677700001301732700005801745700005501803700001501858773017101873856008102044852000902125655001202134IND60781562520221119192543.0220629e20220615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078156252DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c005232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBao, Xuebing10aGas-Particle Flows in a Two-Stage Integrated Bubbling-Transport Fluidized Bed for CO₂ Capture  ap. 8973-8981.  aIntegrated bubbling-transport fluidized bed is a potential reactor for CO₂ capture with solid sorbents. The gas-particle flows in the reactor greatly influence the capture efficiency. This paper studied the gas-particle flow behaviors in this reactor, focusing on the particle circulation and gas entrainment. The results show that the particle circulation rate is mainly limited by the particle-returning capacity of loop seals. Both the particle circulation rate and the gas entrainment rate increase with the total static bed height, fluidization velocity, and central gas velocity. The particle circulation rate is the most sensitive to the fluidization velocity, whereas the gas entrainment rate is the most sensitive to the total static bed height. When keeping the total static bed height constant, the particle circulation rate and the gas entrainment rate increase with the bed height of stage II. Synthesizing the above analysis, fine sorbents are recommended when applying this reactor for CO₂ capture with solid sorbents.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017YFB0603300cMinistry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002855  a2021M691551cChina Postdoctoral Science Foundationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100002858 3acarbon dioxide 3achemistry 3afluid mechanics 3afluidized beds 3aprocess design 3asorbents1 aMa, Jiliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1704-65691 aWu, Ying1 aChen, Xiaoping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3776-82111 aLiu, Daoyin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1746-22041 aLiang, Cai0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 June 15, v. 61, no. 25 p.8973-8981dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c005233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04787naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003200134024001200166040001800178100002200196245009000218300002000308506017300328520246600501592002802967650001602995650001103011650002003022650000903042650001703051650001903068650002003087650001203107650001003119650001903129650001603148650000903164650001803173650001303191650001803204650001903222650002503241650001103266650001903277650002403296650001103320650001403331651001803345653001403363653001703377700002203394700002603416700002003442700002103462700002303483700002203506700002103528700002203549773015603571856007903727856011403806956014703920961001304067852000904080655001204089IND60556478420221214223812.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055647842DNAL7 a3307722aris7 a10113/55647842hdl7 a10.3168/jds.2016-117272doi8 ans11911  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Corwin D.10aVitamin D status of dairy cattle: Outcomes of current practices in the dairy industry  ap. 10150-10160.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aThe need for vitamin D supplementation of dairy cattle has been known for the better part of the last century and is well appreciated by dairy producers and nutritionists. Whether current recommendations and practices for supplemental vitamin D are meeting the needs of dairy cattle, however, is not well known. The vitamin D status of animals is reliably indicated by the concentration of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] metabolite in serum or plasma, with a concentration of 30ng/mL proposed as a lower threshold for sufficiency. The objective of this study was to determine the typical serum 25(OH)D concentrations of dairy cattle across various dairy operations. The serum 25(OH)D concentration of 702 samples collected from cows across various stages of lactation, housing systems, and locations in the United States was 68±22ng/mL (mean ± standard deviation), with the majority of samples between 40 and 100ng/mL. Most of the 12 herds surveyed supplemented cows with 30,000 to 50,000 IU of vitamin D3/d, and average serum 25(OH)D of cows at 100 to 300 DIM in each of those herds was near or above 70ng/mL regardless of season or housing. In contrast, average serum 25(OH)D of a herd supplementing with 20,000 IU/d was 42±15ng/mL, with 22% below 30ng/mL. Cows in early lactation (0 to 30d in milk) also had lower serum 25(OH)D than did mid- to late-lactation cows (57±17 vs. 71±20ng/mL, respectively). Serum 25(OH)D of yearling heifers receiving 11,000 to 12,000 IU of vitamin D3/d was near that of cows at 76±15ng/mL. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations of calves, on the other hand, was 15±11ng/mL at birth and remained near or below 15ng/mL through 1mo of age if they were fed pasteurized waste milk with little to no summer sun exposure. In contrast, serum 25(OH)D of calves fed milk replacer containing 6,600 and 11,000 IU of vitamin D2/kg of dry matter were 59±8 and 98±33ng/mL, respectively, at 1mo of age. Experimental data from calves similarly indicated that serum 25(OH)D achieved at approximately 1mo of age would increase 6 to 7ng/mL for every 1,000 IU of vitamin D3/kg of dry matter of milk replacer. In conclusion, vitamin D status of dairy cattle supplemented with vitamin D3 according to typical practices, about 1.5 to 2.5 times the National Research Council recommendation, is sufficient as defined by serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Newborn calves and calves fed milk without supplemental vitamin D3, however, are prone to deficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3acalves 3acholecalciferol 3acows 3adairy cattle 3adairy industry 3aearly lactation 3aheifers 3aherds 3alate lactation 3ametabolites 3amilk 3amilk replacer 3aneonates 3anutritionists 3apasteurization 3astatistical analysis 3asummer 3avitamin status 3avitamin supplements 3awastes 3ayearlings 3aUnited States 0avitamin D 0adairy cattle1 aLippolis, John D.1 aReinhardt, Timothy A.1 aSacco, Randy E.1 aPowell, Jessi L.1 aDrewnoski, Mary E.1 aO’Neil, Matthew1 aBeitz, Donald C.1 aWeiss, William P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.10150-10160dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-117273Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/55647843Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Vitamin%20D%20status%20of%20dairy%20cattle%20Outcomes%20of%20current.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002300112245008200135300001600217520232200233592002802555650002302583650002402606650001502630650002502645650002202670650001402692650001902706650000902725650002002734650001002754650001902764650002402783650001402807650001202821650002002833650002602853650001602879650001602895650001802911650002002929650001302949650001602962700002102978700003202999773010803031852000903139655001203148IND60614067020221118135806.0181002e198905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061406702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRUGGIERO, PACIFICO10aDetoxification of 2,4-dichlorophenol by a laccase immobilized on soil or clay  ap. 361-370.  aWe investigated the ability of an immobilized fungal laccase from Trametes versicolor to transform 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP), an intermediate of pesticide degradation. Immobilization supports were a silt loam soil and several clays, kaolinite, and two types of smectite, referred to as montmorillonite 1 and montmorillonite 2. The majority of the added laccase activity was immobilized to these supports, using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and glutaraldehyde. The catalytic properties of these laccase-clay and laccase-soil complexes toward the substrate, 2,4-DCP, were assessed using radiolabeled tracer and chromatographic techniques. Incubation of 2,4-DCP with laccase caused the formation of oligomers, which are insoluble in aqueous solutions and can, therefore, be removed. The efficiency of the laccase immobilized on kaolinite and soil to remove 2,4-DCP from solution was similar to that of the free enzyme (approximately 95% of the added C-2,4-DCP was removed) and greater than that of the enzyme immobilized on montmorillonites 1 and 2 (69 and 42%, respectively). For these last two supports, however, enzymatic removal may not have been responsible for the entire loss of 2,4-DCP, as adsorption on montmorillonites 1 and 2 also contributed to the observed decreases in 2,4-DCP. A noteworthy advantage of the immobilized laccase over the free enzyme was that it could be separated from the reaction mixture and used repeatedly. After repeated 2-h incubation cycles of the immobilized enzyme with C-2,4-DCP, the laccase-kaolinite, laccase-montmorillonite 1, and laccase-soil complexes exhibited only a slight decrease in the ability to remove 2,4-DCP. The possibility of nonenzymatic removal of 2,4-DCP was excluded in experiments performed under anaerobic conditions, in which laccase activity was completely inhibited. The effect of a proteolytic enzyme on the free and immobilized laccase was also tested, and, as a result of their resistance to proteolysis, the immobilized enzyme catalyzed the removal of greater amounts of 2,4-DCP than the free enzyme. This stability and certain other characteristics, such as their reusability and their ability to transform xenobiotics as efficiently as the soluble enzyme, should make these laccase complexes useful catalysts of detoxification reactions in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aadsorption 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3achromatography 3aclay 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3aglutaraldehyde 3aimmobilized enzymes 3akaolinite 3alaccase 3amontmorillonite 3apesticide degradation 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3aradiolabeling 3asilt loam soils 3asmectite 3axenobiotics1 aSARKAR, JAWED M.1 aBollag, J.-M.q(Jean-Marc),0 tSoil science.g1989 May, v. 147, no. 5 p.361-370dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012000166300001600286520092700302592002801229650002001257650001201277650001901289650001001308700002201318773012001340856008201460852000901542655001201551IND60618917420221119031118.0181030e197810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061891742DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517578048010092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKimura, Satoo10aWeft Insertion by Water JetbPart I : Flow Velocity and Configuration of the Jet in the Vicinity of the Nozzle Exit  ap. 604-609.  aFor the final purpose of making clear a mechanism of weft yarn insertion in a water-jet loom, the flow and configuration of the jet in the vicinity of the nozzle exit have been analyzed by utilizing the matched asymptotic expansion technique. Since in the present analysis the flow field, the nozzle profile, and the weft profile have been idealized, the results cannot indicate the actual phenomena in a strict sense. However, the following results have been obtained. The flow is per turbed by using the small parameter (the reciprocal of the cube root of the Reynolds number). The decreases of the radius of the core-flow region, the jet-radius, and the acceleration of the flow velocity near the free boundary of the jet have been calculate as a function of the distance from the nozzle exit. In order to calculate in detail the weft-insertion force, the other region near the weft surface is to be taken into account.  aPublisher supplied data 3aReynolds number 3afabrics 3atextile fibers 3ayarns1 aIemoto, Yoshiyuki0 tTextile research journal.g1978 Oct., v. 48, no. 10 p.604-609dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517578048010093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003500152245009300187300001400280520071700294592002801011650002101039650001201060650001101072650001301083650001601096650001201112650001601124650001101140651001001151653002701161653001901188653001701207653001601224653002101240653002101261773014301282856008601425852000901511655001201520IND60738480220221122155030.0210524e20201019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073848022DNAL7 a10.5958/2231-1750.2020.00003.72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanganath, Karanjalker Gourish12aA Review on Physical-Biochemical Characterization and Breeding Aspects of the Mango Peel  ap. 21-29.  aMango (Mangifera indica L.) is the most important fruit crop grown extensively in India.

These base oils/stocks are a significant and growing part of the commercial market, with improved viscosity-vs-temperature stability over traditional Group I base oils/stocks. Built and tested using a data set of over 200 Group II and Group III commercial and research base oils and base stocks, or their subfractions produced by various methods, the model achieves a root-mean squared error and root mean squared relative error of 0.8 cSt and 6.9% on the training set and 0.3 cSt and 4.2% on the validation set, respectively, and within the validation set is able to reproduce process variable trends with respect to such variables as feed quality and process conversion severity. When fitting the model, we constrained it such that the model follows known KV100/molecular structure relationships, namely, that at a given carbon number increased alkyl branching lowers KV100 while increased naphthene ring count increases KV100. This ensures that final model predictions obey physical trends and behavior as a function of composition, which is critical when incorporating the model into manufacturing models to explore questions related to process configurations, processing conditions, and feed selection. To our knowledge, this is the first KV model for hydrocarbons that incorporates such requirements in its construction. Next steps include creation of a companion model for kinematic viscosity at 40 °C (KV40), which in turn enables predictions of viscosity index (VI), a key performance property used to classify base oils/stocks into different groups as part of the American Petroleum Institute (API) categorization system.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adata collection 3afeed quality 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprocess design 3aviscosity0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 June 10, v. 61, no. 25 p.9087-9098dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c005763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245004000185300001400225520166100239592002801900650001501928650001001943650001201953650001701965650002101982650001802003650002302021650001002044650001402054650000902068650001102077650001902088650001602107650002002123650002202143650001202165650002202177650003302199650002902232700001502261700001702276773009802293856004802391852000902439655001202448IND50072837920221118070750.0140210e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007283792DNAL7 a121115352pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-002-0571-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNatesan, Arjun10aRhythm and soul in the avian pineal  ap. 35-45.  aThe avian pineal gland, like that of mammals, displays a striking circadian rhythm in the synthesis and release of the hormone melatonin. However, the pineal gland plays a more prominent role in avian circadian organization and differs from that in mammals in several ways. One important difference is that the pineal gland in birds is relatively autonomous. In addition to making melatonin, the avian pineal contains photoreceptors and a circadian clock (thus, an entire circadian system) within itself. Furthermore, avian pineals retain their circadian properties in organ or dispersed cell culture, making biochemical components of regulatory pathways accessible. Avian pinealocytes are directly photosensitive, and novel candidates for the unidentified photopigments involved in the regulation of clock function and melatonin production, including melanopsin, pinopsin, iodopsin, and the cryptochromes, are being evaluated. Transduction pathways and second messengers that may be involved in acute and entraining effects, including cyclic nucleotides, calcium fluxes, and protein kinases, have been, and continue to be, examined. Moreover, several clock genes similar to those found in Drosophila and mouse are expressed, and their dynamics and interactions are being studied. Finally, the bases for acute and clock regulation of the key enzyme in melatonin synthesis, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (AA-NAT), are described. The ability to study entrainment, the oscillator itself, and a physiological output in the same tissue at the same time makes the avian pineal gland an excellent model to study the bases and regulation of circadian rhythms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3abirds 3acalcium 3acell culture 3acircadian rhythm 3acryptochromes 3acyclic nucleotides 3agenes 3amelatonin 3amice 3amodels 3aphotoreceptors 3apineal body 3aprotein kinases 3asecond messengers 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxphysiology 2aCircadian Rhythmxphysiology 2aPineal Glandxphysiology1 aGeetha, L.1 aZatz, Martin0 tCell and tissue research.g2002 July, v. 309, no. 1 p.35-45dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-002-0571-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02753naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001200144245008700156300001800243520134800261592002801609650002501637650001201662650001901674650001701693650001801710650002301728650000901751650001301760650002001773650000701793650003301800650002001833650001301853650001601866651001001882653001301892653003401905653001601939653001601955700001101971700001101982700001201993700001202005773015402017856007902171852000902250655001202259IND60556478720221123031147.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055647872DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-106552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, P.10aEstablishment and application of milk fingerprint by gel filtration chromatography  ap. 9493-9501.  aRaw milk adulteration frequently occurs in undeveloped countries. It not only reduces the nutritional value of milk, but it is also harmful to consumers. In this paper, we focused on investigating an efficient method for the quality control of raw milk protein. A gel filtration chromatography (GFC) fingerprint method combined with chemometrics was developed for fingerprint analysis of raw milk. To optimize the GFC conditions, milk fat was removed by centrifugation, and GFC analysis was performed on a Superdex 75 10/300GL column (Just Scientific, Shanghai, China) with 0.2 M NaH2PO4-Na2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.0) as the mobile phase. The flow rate was 0.5mL/min, and the detection wavelength was set at 280 nm. Ten batches of 120 raw milk samples were analyzed to establish the GFC fingerprint under optimal conditions. Six major peaks common to the chromatogram of each raw milk sample were selected for fingerprint analysis, and the characteristic peaks were used to establish a standard chromatographic fingerprint. Principal component analysis was then applied to classify GFC information of adulterated milk and raw milk, allowing adulterated samples to be effectively screened out from the raw milk in principal component analysis scores plot. The fingerprint method demonstrates promising features in detecting milk protein adulteration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3abuffers 3acentrifugation 3achemometrics 3adairy protein 3agel chromatography 3amilk 3amilk fat 3anutritive value 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3araw milk 3awavelengths 3aChina 0araw milk 0agel filtration chromatography 0afingerprint 0aapplication1 aLi, J.1 aLi, Z.1 aHao, J.1 aZan, L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.9493-9501dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-106553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011500157300001800272520103900290592002801329650002301357650000901380650001301389650001001402650001401412650001001426650000901436650001301445650001501458650002601473650001801499650001001517650001601527653001301543653002401556653001901580653002301599653002101622700001101643700001601654700001401670700001301684700001301697700001401710773015401724856007901878852000901957655001201966IND60556478820221123015424.0190318e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055647882DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2015-107392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Q.10aProteomics method to quantify the percentage of cow, goat, and sheep milks in raw materials for dairy products  ap. 9483-9492.  aFraud in milk and dairy products occurs when cow milk is added to sheep and goat milk for economic reasons. No reliable, selective, and sensitive method exists for quantifying the milk percentage of different species. This work reports the development and validation of a proteomics-based method for the qualitative detection and quantitative determination of cow, sheep, and goat milks in the raw materials used for dairy products. β-Lactoglobulin was selected as the protein marker because it is a major protein in milk and whey powder. The tryptic peptides LSFNPTQLEEQCHI and LAFNPTQLEGQCHV were used as signature peptides for cow milk and for sheep and goat milks, respectively. The winged peptides LKALPMHIRLSFNPTQL*EEQCHI* and LKALPMHIRLAFNPTQL*EGQCHV* were designed and synthesized as internal standards. Validation of the method showed that it has good sensitivity, specificity, reproducibility, precision, and accuracy. This method is easily applicable in routine laboratory analysis without intensive proteomics background.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeta-lactoglobulin 3acows 3aewe milk 3afraud 3agoat milk 3agoats 3amilk 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3aquantitative analysis 3araw materials 3asheep 3awhey powder 0acow milk 0agoat and sheep milk 0aquantification 0asignature peptides 0aβ-lactoglobulin1 aKe, X.1 aZhang, J.S.1 aLai, S.Y.1 aFang, F.1 aMo, W.M.1 aRen, Y.P.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2016 Dec., v. 99, no. 12 p.9483-9492dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-107393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245014800166300001800314520127400332592002801606650001601634650002701650650001501677650001601692650001001708650001001718650001001728650002501738650001401763650001401777650001801791650001801809650002201827650002001849650001301869651001201882700002101894700002101915700002201936700002901958700001901987700001902006700001902025700002802044773013702072856008102209852000902290655001202299IND60596528320221118143227.0180619e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059652832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10482-018-1032-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSenghor, Bruno10aSediminibacillus massiliensis sp. nov., a moderately halophilic, Gram-positive bacterium isolated from a stool sample of a young Senegalese man  ap. 1225-1236.  aA Gram-positive, moderately halophilic bacterium, referred to as strain Marseille-P3518ᵀ, was isolated from a stool sample with 2% NaCl concentration from a healthy 15-year-old male living in Dielmo, a village in Senegal. Cells are aerobic, rod-shaped and motile and display endospore formation. Strain Marseille-P3518ᵀ can grow in a medium with 0–20% (w/v) sodium chloride (optimally at 5–7.5% w/v). The major fatty acids were 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (45.8%), 13-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (26.9%) and 12-methyl-tridecanoic acid (12.8%). The genome is 4,347,479 bp long with 42.1% G+C content. It contains 4282 protein-coding and 107 RNA genes. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that strain Marseille-P3518ᵀ is a member of the Bacillaceae family and is closely related to Sediminibacillus albus (97.4% gene sequence similarity). Strain Marseille-P3518ᵀ was clearly differentiated from its phylogenetic neighbors on the basis of phenotypic and genotypic features. Strain Marseille-P3518ᵀ is, therefore, considered to be a novel representative of the genus Sediminibacillus, for which the name Sediminibacillus massiliensis sp. nov. is proposed, and the type strain is Marseille-P3518ᵀ (CSUR P3518T, DSM69894).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillaceae 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aendospores 3afatty acids 3afeces 3agenes 3amales 3anucleotide sequences 3aphenotype 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence homology 3asodium chloride 3avillages 3aSenegal1 aBassène, Hubert1 aKhelaifia, Saber1 aRobert, Catherine1 aFournier, Pierre-Edouard1 aRuimy, Raymond1 aSokhna, Cheikh1 aRaoult, Didier1 aLagier, Jean-Christophe0 tAntonie van Leeuwenhoek.g2018 July, v. 111, no. 7 p.1225-1236dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl28287x0003-60727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10482-018-1032-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02547naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245009100159300001800250520115700268592002801425650001601453650002201469650001701491650002101508650001401529650001301543650002401556650002201580650002001602650001901622650001301641650001901654650001301673700001501686700005401701700005701755700005201812773017101864856008102035852000902116655001202125IND60781563220221119192557.0220629e20220610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078156322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.2c007342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Jie10aMesomorphic Polymer Hydrogel Stabilizing Ionic Surfactant Self-Assembly for Fuel Cells  ap. 8792-8799.  aLyotropic self-assembly of ionic surfactants benefits the construction of ion-conductive pathways but suffers from poor mechanical stability owing to the intrinsic fluidity. Here, a novel mesomorphic polymer hydrogel, featuring a porous network of the cross-linked polymer trapping lyotropic self-assembly of ionic surfactants, is presented for fuel cells. The mesomorphic hydrogel, which is facilely derived from radical polymerization of an acrylamide monomer and a cross-linker in an aqueous solution of 1-tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate, exhibits not only a lamellar lyotropic liquid crystal phase but also reversible tensile, compressive, and shear deformations. Macroscopic alignment of the mesomorphic hydrogel is achieved by low-frequency shear, and ionic conductivity is promoted to 166 mS cm–¹ by virtue of the aligned ion-conductive channels. A hydrogen fuel cell is fabricated from the mesomorphic polymer hydrogel, and a peak power density of 48 mW cm–² is achieved. Overall, this work provides a strategy to endow functional lyotropic self-assembly with mechanical strengths for diverse electrochemical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aaqueous solutions 3acrosslinking 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrogels 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen fuel cells 3aionic surfactants 3aliquid crystals 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprocess design 3asulfates1 aYang, Qing1 aTan, Shuai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6413-44761 aWang, Caihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6808-37091 aWu, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4754-27900 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2022 June 10, v. 61, no. 25 p.8792-8799dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.2c007343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02390naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007600164300001800240500001900258500001100277520098900288592002801277596004301305596004301348596007301391596003301464596004601497596003301543650001601576650001701592650003101609650001501640650001201655650002101667700003301688700006001721773011601781856007401897852000901971655001201980IND60693369220221120124633.0200506e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069336922DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.152382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrailey, Phillip M.10aNKT cells and the regulation of intestinal immunity: a two‐way street  ap. 1686-1699.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aThe mammalian gastrointestinal compartment is colonised by millions of microorganisms that have a central influence on human health. Intestinal homeostasis requires a continuous dialogue between the commensal bacteria and intestinal immune cells. While interactions between host and commensal bacteria are normally beneficial, allowing training and functional tuning of immune cells, dysregulated immune system–microbiota crosstalk can favour the development of chronic inflammatory diseases, as it is the case for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Natural killer T (NKT) cells, which recognise CD1‐restricted microbial and self‐lipids, contribute to the regulation of mucosal immunity by controlling intestinal homeostasis and participating in the development of IBD. Here, we provide an overview of the recently identified pathways underlying the crosstalk between commensal bacteria and NKT cells and discuss the effect of these interactions in intestinal health and disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aMR/L008157/1cMedical Research Council  aMR/N013700/1cMedical Research Council  aBB/S005560/1cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aFC001002cCancer Research UK  aFC001002cThe UK Medical Research Council  aFC001002cThe Wellcome Trust 3ahomeostasis 3ahuman health 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3aintestines 3amammals 3amucosal immunity1 aLebrusant‐Fernandez, Marta1 aBarral, Patricia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4324-89730 tFEBS journal.g2020 May, v. 287, no. 9 p.1686-1699dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.152383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04110naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001800163245012700181300001600308520150100324536011901825592002801944650002801972650003102000650001302031650001302044650001602057650001002073650001002083650001002093650002402103650001702127650001702144650000902161650001302170650003002183650001802213650002202231650002002253650002502273650001202298650002102310650004002331650004102371650002502412650003402437650002702471650005002498650003502548650005202583650005102635650002302686650004202709650002702751650005702778650006802835650004702903653001602950653001902966653002802985653001603013700001803029700001703047700001703064700001203081700002003093700001903113773010603132852000903238856008103247655001203328IND4440528320221118074954.0181003e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444052832DNAL7 a204668602pmid7 a10.1177/03009858103645142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSledge, D. G.10aOutbreak of Neonatal Diarrhea in Farmed Mink Kits (Mustella vison) Associated With Enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus delphini  ap. 751-757.  aAn outbreak of diarrhea on a large commercial mink farm affected 5,000 of 36,000 neonatal mink kits, with 2,000 dying within a 2-week period. Affected kits were severely dehydrated, and their furcoats and paws were covered with yellow- to green-tinged mucoid feces. On necropsy, the small intestines of examined animals were markedly distended by serous to mucoid fluid. Microscopically, there was prominent colonization of the intestinal villar epithelium by gram-positive bacterial cocci in the absence of inflammation and morphologic changes in villous enterocytes. The colonizing bacteria were phenotypically identified as belonging to the Staphylococcus intermedius group of bacteria. This was confirmed by nucleic acid sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Further nucleic acid sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons from the superoxide dismutase gene and the heat shock protein 60 gene differentiated the isolate as Staphylococcus delphini. Production of staphylococcal enterotoxins A and E was demonstrated with a commercial ELISA-based immunoassay. Sequencing of PCR amplicons confirmed the presence of the enterotoxin E gene, but PCR amplification of the enterotoxin A, B, C, or D genes was not successful. Although direct causation was not confirmed in this study, the authors postulate that the observed hypersecretory diarrhea in these mink kits was the result of colonization of the small intestine by S delphini and subsequent production of enterotoxin.  aThe authors declared that they received no financial support for their research and/or authorship of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStaphylococcus delphini 3aStaphylococcus intermedius 3abacteria 3adiarrhea 3aenterocytes 3afarms 3afeces 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aimmunoassays 3ainflammation 3amink 3anecropsy 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3asmall intestine 3asuperoxide dismutase 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aChaperonin 60xchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDiarrheaxveterinary 2aDisease Outbreaksxveterinary 2aEnterotoxinsxanalysis 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aHistocytochemistryxveterinary 2aIntestine, Smallxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmissionxveterinary 2aMinkxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStaphylococcal Infectionsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aStaphylococcusxenzymologyxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexchemistryxgenetics. 0aenterotoxin 0amink enteritis 0aStaphylococcus delphini 0asticky kits1 aDanieu, P.

The SCN is anatomically and functionally organized into two subdivisions: (1) a core that lies adjacent to the optic chiasm, comprises predominantly neurons producing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) colocalized with GABA and receives dense visual and midbrain raphe afferents, and (2) a shell that surrounds the core, contains a large population of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-producing neurons in its dorsomedial portion, and a smaller population of calretinin (CAR)-producing neurons dorsally and laterally, colocalized with GABA, and receives input from non-visual cortical and subcortical regions. In this paper, we present a detailed quantitative analysis of the organization of the SCN core and shell in the rat and place this in the context of the functional significance of the subdivisions in the circadian control of regulatory systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine vasopressin 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3agastrin-releasing peptide 3ahypothalamus 3aneurons 3aquantitative analysis 3arats 3asleep 3avasoactive intestinal peptide1 aSpeh, Joan C.1 aLeak, Rehana K.0 tCell and tissue research.g2002 July, v. 309, no. 1 p.89-98dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-002-0575-2  aDNAL 7aarticle01212naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245005500166300001800221520026800239592002800507650001400535650002300549650002700572650001100599650001200610650003000622650001200652700001700664773013400681856007400815852000900889655001200898IND60660085520221119071013.0190823e20140417xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066008552DNAL7 a10.1039/c3cc48642g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarsen, Anders Foller10aDirect N⁹-arylation of purines with aryl halides  ap. 4997-4999.  aAn efficient method for N-arylation of purines is reported.

However, the minimum feature size that can be achieved using this approach is constrained by wetting and liquid bridge phenomena at the deposition region. We hypothesize that pattern resolution and process control can be improved by co-depositing a support fluid to stabilize the pattern. Electrically conductive poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is slot die-coated in parallel stripes on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrate, without wettability-enhancing dopants or substrate pretreatment. A miscible liquid phase, polyvinyl alcohol, is used as the support material. Feature size performance and conductivity of PEDOT:PSS stripe regions are evaluated across a range of process conditions. Narrow PEDOT:PSS stripes produced using our technique range from 400 to 850 μm and exhibit conductivity approaching 1.5 S cm–¹. This electrical performance falls within the upper range expected prior to standard conductivity-enhancing post-treatments. Significantly, dewetting effects normally present with undoped PEDOT:PSS on the plastic substrate are fully mitigated with our deposition technique. These results indicate high ease of processing and good feature size performance, with few inherent drawbacks to the functional properties of the patterned films.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3afunctional properties 3aliquids 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3aprocess control 3asulfonates 0aprinted electronics 0aflexible 0aroll-to-roll 0aslot die coating 0aPEDOT:PSS 0afeature size1 aHarris, Tequila A.

A variety of factors play roles in regulating the adhesion. Here we report the influence of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ in artificial seawater on attachment and colonization of Bacillus sp., Chlorella and Phaeodactylum tricornutum on silicon wafer. Extra addition of the typical divalent cations in culturing solution gives rise to significantly enhanced adhesion of the microorganisms. Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ affect the adhesion of Bacillus sp. presumably by regulating aggregation and formation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). The ions alter quantity and types of the proteins in EPS, in turn affecting subsequent adhesion. However, it is noted that Mg²⁺ promotes adhesion of Chlorella likely by regulating EPS formation and polysaccharide synthesis. Ca²⁺ plays an important role in protein expression to enhance the adhesion of Chlorella. For Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Ca²⁺ expedites protein synthesis for enhanced adhesion. The results shed some light on effective ways of utilizing divalent cations to mediate formation of biofilms on the marine structures for desired performances.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aChlorella 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aadhesion 3aalgae 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3abiofouling 3acalcium 3acations 3acolloids 3amagnesium 3amarine environment 3apolysaccharides 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteins 3aseawater 3asilicon 0aBiofilm 0aDivalent cations 0aAdhesion 0aProtein expression 0aPolysaccharide synthesis1 aWang, Jinpeng1 aAbdoli, Leila1 aLi, Hua0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 146 p.289-295dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03684naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100002200176245008000198300001500278520213500293592002802428650002102456650001302477650001502490650001002505650001502515650001502530650001202545650002202557650002202579650001602601650001602617650000902633650001202642650001302654650001702667650001702684650001402701650001102715650002002726650001802746650001702764700002102781773015102802856006902953856010003022990002303122852000903145655001203154IND60643452520221119105454.0190510e20131125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064345252DNAL7 a10.3791/507592doi7 aPMC39920112pmcid7 a243008982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSocha, Matthew J.10aIsolation of microvascular endothelial tubes from mouse resistance arteries  ap. e50759.  aThe control of blood flow by the resistance vasculature regulates the supply of oxygen and nutrients concomitant with the removal of metabolic by-products, as exemplified by exercising skeletal muscle. Endothelial cells (ECs) line the intima of all resistance vessels and serve a key role in controlling diameter (e.g. endothelium-dependent vasodilation) and, thereby, the magnitude and distribution of tissue blood flow. The regulation of vascular resistance by ECs is effected by intracellular Ca2+ signaling, which leads to production of diffusible autacoids (e.g. nitric oxide and arachidonic acid metabolites)1-3 and hyperpolarization4,5 that elicit smooth muscle cell relaxation. Thus understanding the dynamics of endothelial Ca2+ signaling is a key step towards understanding mechanisms governing blood flow control. Isolating endothelial tubes eliminates confounding variables associated with blood in the vessel lumen and with surrounding smooth muscle cells and perivascular nerves, which otherwise influence EC structure and function. Here we present the isolation of endothelial tubes from the superior epigastric artery (SEA) using a protocol optimized for this vessel. To isolate endothelial tubes from an anesthetized mouse, the SEA is ligated in situ to maintain blood within the vessel lumen (to facilitate visualizing it during dissection), and the entire sheet of abdominal muscle is excised. The SEA is dissected free from surrounding skeletal muscle fibers and connective tissue, blood is flushed from the lumen, and mild enzymatic digestion is performed to enable removal of adventitia, nerves and smooth muscle cells using gentle trituration. These freshly-isolated preparations of intact endothelium retain their native morphology, with individual ECs remaining functionally coupled to one another, able to transfer chemical and electrical signals intercellularly through gap junctions6,7. In addition to providing new insight into calcium signaling and membrane biophysics, these preparations enable molecular studies of gene expression and protein localization within native microvascular endothelium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarachidonic acid 3aarteries 3abiophysics 3ablood 3ablood flow 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acalcium signaling 3aendothelial cells 3aendothelium 3ametabolites 3amice 3amuscles 3amyotubes 3anerve tissue 3anitric oxide 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3askeletal muscle 3asmooth muscle 3avasodilation1 aSegal, Steven S.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2013 Nov. 25, , no. 81 p.e50759-e50759dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/507593Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/50759/isolation-microvascular-endothelial-tubes-from-mouse-resistance  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007200163300001400235500001900249520144200268592002801710650002101738650001901759650001201778650002001790650001701810650000901827650000901836650001101845650001401856650000901870650001201879650002001891650001501911650001401926650000901940650001101949650001501960650000901975700001801984700002202002700002002024700002302044700002502067700001802092700001502110700001702125773009002142856008202232852000902314655001202323IND60715095420221119015818.0201223e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071509542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nfs.2020.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCosta, Sara10aEvaluation of Tenebrio molitor larvae as an alternative food source  ap. 57-64.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEdible insects have gained an increasing interest as a food product in recent years. They may represent an alternative source of protein and micronutrients compared to conventional meat sources. Thus the objective of this work was to determine the nutritional value as well as the chemical and microbiological contamination for a better evaluation of the risk/benefit of yellow mealworm larvae consumption. These larvae have a nutritional value (10.4% of fat and 13.7% of protein) similar to conventional meat sources. Their main fatty acids were oleic (37.8%) and linoleic (33.2%). The results showed these larvae fulfill the requirements for essential amino acids (all were above 100% of the daily contribution), with the exception of lysine. Our findings also showed that T. monitor larvae are an excellent source of minerals like phosphorus, magnesium and zinc (114%, 109 to 128% and 117% above RDI). In spite of having a low contribution of potassium and iron (16–17% and 20% of RDI), the lower sodium content is an advantage in terms of human health since high intake increases blood pressure. Mercury and lead values were below the detection limit and cadmium level was 0.10 mg/kg. Yellow mealworm larvae had high bacterial loads but no pathogenic bacteria were detected. Starvation for eight days at 5 °C reduced the total counts of all microorganisms, specially yeasts and total mesophilic anaerobic spore-forming bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTenebrio molitor 3ablood pressure 3acadmium 3adetection limit 3ahuman health 3airon 3alead 3alysine 3amagnesium 3ameat 3amercury 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3apotassium 3arisk 3asodium 3astarvation 3azinc1 aPedro, Sónia1 aLourenço, Helena1 aBatista, Irineu1 aTeixeira, Bárbara1 aBandarra, Narcisa M.1 aMurta, Daniel1 aNunes, Rui1 aPires, Carla0 tNFS journal.g2020 Nov., v. 21 p.57-64dElsevier GmbHwJournal:23304x2352-36467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nfs.2020.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245010600170300001600276520096200292592002801254650001301282650001601295650001501311650002001326650001201346650001901358650001201377650001101389653000901400653000901409653000801418653000801426653000701434653000801441653000801449653000701457653000801464653000901472653000801481653000801489653000901497653000801506653000801514653002701522653002901549653001701578653002401595653001601619700001901635700002001654700002001674700001701694773010701711856008701818961001301905852000901918655001201927IND60524698620221119113637.0190409e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052469862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2016.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Sun-Min,10aImprovement of sugar yields from corn stover using sequential hot water pretreatment and disk milling  ap. 706-713.  aEfficient pretreatment is essential for economic conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into monosaccharides for biofuel production. To realize high sugar yields with low inhibitor concentrations, hot water or dilute acid pretreatment followed by disk milling is proposed. Corn stover at 20% solids was pretreated with hot water at 160–200°C for 4–8min with and without subsequent milling. Hot water pretreatment and disk milling acted synergistically to improve glucose and xylose yields by 89% and 134%, respectively, compared to hot water pretreatment alone. Hot water pretreated (180°C for 4min) and milled samples had the highest glucose and xylose yields among all hot water pretreated and milled samples, which were comparable to samples pretreated with 0.55% dilute acid at 160°C for 4min.

The samples were characterized by SEM, XRD, XPS and PL. The 2% C/BiOBr composite material showed a noticeable adsorption and photocatalysis synergistic effect to remove CIP. The adsorption rate and degradation rate were 1.45 times and 1.8 times that of BiOBr. The adsorption kinetics and isotherms of CIP on C/BiOBr were analyzed with the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir models. The degradation efficiency was 96.8% after 60 min of irradiation. High stability and degradability were still maintained after four cycles. The Bi–O–C bond accelerated electron transition and inhibited the rapid photogenerated electron pair recombination. In the degradation process of CIP, ˙O₂⁻ and h⁺ played a significant role. Experiments proved that C/BiOBr is practical and feasible for the degradation of CIP under the synergistic effect of adsorption and photocatalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3aciprofloxacin 3acomposite materials 3airradiation 3aphotocatalysis 3astraw 3asynergism1 aZhao, Jianghua1 aXie, Xiuhong1 aLiu, Wang1 aLiu, Shuxia1 aChang, Haibo1 aWang, Chengyu0 tRSC advances.g2021 Apr. 26, v. 11, no. 25 p.15369-15379dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra00941a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02404naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245006900213300001600282520101600298592002801314650001501342650002901357650001301386650002301399650001401422650002201436650001301458650001701471650001501488650001501503650002101518650001701539653001801556653002601574653001201600653001901612653002301631700002401654700002001678700001501698700001901713773010601732856008701838852000901925655001201934IND60553188920221121231958.0180830e20161001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055318892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenschen, Jonatan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6263-840310aContact-active antibacterial aerogels from cellulose nanofibrils  ap. 415-422.  aThe use of cellulose aerogels as antibacterial materials has been investigated by applying a contact-active layer-by-layer modification to the aerogel surface. Studying the adsorption of multilayers of polyvinylamine (PVAm) and polyacrylic acid to aerogels comprising crosslinked cellulose nanofibrils and monitoring the subsequent bacterial adhesion revealed that up to 26mgPVAmgaerogel⿿¹ was adsorbed without noticeably affecting the aerogel structure. The antibacterial effect was tested by measuring the reduction of viable bacteria in solution when the aerogels were present. The results show that >99.9% of the bacteria adhered to the surface of the aerogels. Microscopy further showed adherence of bacteria to the surfaces of the modified aerogels. These results indicate that it is possible to create materials with three-dimensional cellulose structures that adsorb bacteria with very high efficiency utilizing the high specific surface area of the aerogels in combination with their open structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibacterial properties 3abacteria 3abacterial adhesion 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acolloids 3acrosslinking 3amicroscopy 3amonitoring 3apolyacrylic acid 3asurface area 0aAntibacterial 0aCellulose nanofibrils 0aAerogel 0aContact active 0aPolymer adsorption1 aIllergård, Josefin1 aLarsson, Per A.1 aEk, Monica1 aWågberg, Lars0 tColloids and surfaces.g2016 Oct. 01, v. 146 p.415-422dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11946x0927-77657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03252naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133040001800169100002100187245012600208300001600334506007600350520150500426592002801931506003701959650001601996650001102012650001402023650001302037650001602050650002802066650002102094650003402115650001802149650002402167650001102191650002602202650001602228650001502244650001002259650001002269650002802279650001802307650001102325650002102336650002102357650002202378650001102400650002002411700002202431700001802453773011202471856008202583852000902665655001202674IND4459111220221207045840.0141110e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445911122DNAL7 a215364962pmid7 aPMC31188542pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jneb.2010.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWelsh, Ericka M.10aExamining the Relationship Between Family Meal Frequency and Individual Dietary Intake: Does Family Cohesion Play a Role?  ap. 229-235.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To confirm previously reported associations between family meal frequency and dietary intake, and to examine family cohesion as a potential mediator of this relationship. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. Data collected at baseline via questionnaire. SETTING: Randomized, controlled household weight gain prevention trial. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 152 adults and 75 adolescents from 90 community households. VARIABLES MEASURED: Family meal frequency assessed with a single question. Perceived family cohesion measured by the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scale-III. Usual intake of targeted food items assessed with modified food frequency questionnaire. ANALYSIS: Hierarchical linear regression with mediation analysis. Statistical significance set at α-level .05. RESULTS: Family meal frequency was associated with intake of fruits and vegetables in adults, and sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages in adolescents. Family meal frequency was positively correlated with perceived family cohesion (r = 0.41, P < .01). Partial mediation by family cohesion was observed for family meal frequency and sweets intake in adolescents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that family cohesion is not a consistent mediator of relationship between family meal frequency and individual dietary intake. Future studies should assess additional plausible mediators of this relationship in order to better understand the effect of family meals on dietary intake.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aadults 3abeverages 3acohesion 3acorrelation 3across-sectional studies 3afamily relations 3afood frequency questionnaires 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 3asweets 3avegetable consumption 3aweight gain 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnergy Intake 2aFamily 2aFamily Relations 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHumans 2aSocial Behavior1 aFrench, Simone A.1 aWall, Melanie0 tJournal of nutrition education and behavior.g2011 , v. 43, no. 4 p.229-235dElsevier Inc.x1499-40467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jneb.2010.03.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04472naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245019200173300001800365520217400383592002802557650001602585650001002601650001502611650001802626650001902644650002502663650002402688650002302712650002002735650002002755650001902775650001702794650003902811650003502850650001502885650002002900650002402920650001102944650001902955650002002974650001402994650001403008650002203022650001303044650003003057650000903087650001703096650003103113650002303144650001503167650001703182650001903199650001303218653002603231653002303257653001703280653002403297653002103321700006403342700006903406700002503475700002403500773013903524856007803663852000903741655001203750IND60682004220221120201220.0200122e20191225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068200422DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b190542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChetty, Shashank Shankar10aHuman Umbilical Cord Wharton’s Jelly-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Labeled with Mn²⁺ and Gd³⁺ Co-Doped CuInS₂–ZnS Nanocrystals for Multimodality Imaging in a Tumor Mice Model  ap. 3415-3429.  aMesenchymal stem cell (MSCs) therapy has recently received profound interest as a targeting platform in cancer theranostics because of inherent tumor-homing abilities. However, the terminal tracking of MSCs engraftment by fluorescent in situ hybridization, immuno-histochemistry, and flow-cytometry techniques to translate into clinics is still challenging because of a dearth of inherent MSCs-specific markers and FDA approval for genetic modifications of MSCs. To address this challenge, a cost-effective noninvasive imaging technology based on multifunctional nanocrystals (NCs) with enhanced detection sensitivity, spatial–temporal resolution, and deep-tissue diagnosis is needed to be developed to track the transplanted stem cells. A hassle-free labeling of human umbilical cord Wharton’s Jelly (WJ)-derived MSCs with Mn²⁺ and Gd³⁺ co-doped CuInS₂−ZnS (CIS-ZMGS) NCs has been demonstrated in 2 h without requiring an electroporation process or transfection agents. It has been found that WJ-MSCs labeling did not affect their multilineage differentiation (adipocyte, osteocyte, chondrocyte), immuno-phenotypes (CD44⁺, CD105⁺, CD90⁺), protein (β-actin, vimentin, CD73, α-SMCA), and gene expressions. Interestingly, CIS-ZMGS-NCs-labeled WJ-MSCs exhibit near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence with a quantum yield of 84%, radiant intensity of ∼3.999 × 10¹¹ (p/s/cm²/sr)/(μW/cm²), magnetic relaxivity (longitudinal r₁ = 2.26 mM–¹ s–¹, transverse r₂ = 16.47 mM–¹ s–¹), and X-ray attenuation (78 HU) potential for early noninvasive multimodality imaging of a subcutaneous melanoma in B16F10-tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice in 6 h. The ex vivo imaging and inductively coupled plasma mass-spectroscopy analyses of excised organs along with confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence of tumor results also significantly confirmed the positive tropism of CIS-ZMGS-NCs-labeled WJ-MSCs in the tumor environment. Hence, we propose the magnetofluorescent CIS-ZMGS-NCs-labeled WJ-MSCs as a next-generation nanobioprobe of three commonly used imaging modalities for stem cell-assisted anticancer therapy and tracking tissue/organ regenerations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aactin 3aadipocytes 3aanimal models 3acancer therapy 3acell differentiation 3aconfocal microscopy 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aelectroporation 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agadolinium 3agene expression 3agenetic engineering 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3alight intensity 3amagnetism 3amanganese 3amass spectrometry 3amelanoma 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amice 3ananocrystals 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aprecision medicine 3astem cells 3atransfection 3aumbilical cord 3avimentin 0amultimodality imaging 0astem cell labeling 0aCuInS2−ZnS 0amicrowave refluxing 0ain vivo tracking1 aPraneetha, Selvarasu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8443-93331 aVadivel Murugan, Arumugam1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4601-96151 aGovarthanan, Kavitha1 aVerma, Rama Shanker0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2019 Dec. 25, v. 12, no. 3 p.3415-3429dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b190543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245008700166300001800253520141700271592002801688650001501716650002301731650001401754650001301768650001701781650002201798650001301820650000901833650002501842650001501867650001101882650001101893650000701904650001301911650001801924650002401942650001201966650002201978650002002000653001802020653002602038653002102064653001402085700001302099700002802112700005002140700001902190700006302209700005702272773013902329856007802468852000902546655001202555IND60682004320200401000000.0200122e20200108xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068200432DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.9b190972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahim, Md.

Herein, a sorbent system derived from physically cross-linked polyphenolic networks using tannic acid and Zrᴵⱽ ions has been explored for high-affinity, broad-spectrum metal sequestration. The network formation step (gelation) of the sorbent is complete within 3 min and requires no special apparatus. The key to this system design is the formation of a highly stable coordination network with an optimized metal–ligand ratio (1.2:1), affording access to a major fraction of the chelating sites in tannic acid for capturing diverse metal ions. This system is stable over a pH range of 1–9, thermally stable up to ∼200 °C, and exhibits a negative surface charge (at pH 5). The sorbent system effectively sequesters 28 metals in single- and multielement model wastes, with removal efficiencies exceeding 99%. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that this system can be processed as membrane coatings, thin films, or wet gels to capture metal ions and that both the sorbent and captured metal ions can be regenerated or directly used as composite catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acrosslinking 3afilms (materials) 3agelation 3agels 3aindustrial effluents 3ametal ions 3ametals 3amodels 3apH 3asorbents 3asurface water 3asystems engineering 3atannins 3athermal stability 3awater pollution 0asequestration 0ametal−phenolic gels 0ametal pollutants 0acatalysis1 aLin, Gan1 aTomanin, Pietro Pacchin1 aJu, Yi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0103-12071 aBarlow, Anders1 aBjörnmalm, Mattias1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9876-70791 aCaruso, Frank1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0197-497X0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Jan. 08, v. 12, no. 3 p.3746-3754dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.9b190973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02861naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009200166506011700258506007600375520126800451592002801719506003701747650002301784650001901807650001301826650001401839650002201853650001801875650001501893650001701908650000901925650002501934651001001959653001301969653001901982653003502001653002802036700001602064700002002080700001402100700001302114700001402127700001602141773011602157856008502273852000902358655001202367IND60770891620221207135137.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077089162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2022.1052702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLong, Jiang12aA switching dynamic model based on phased COVID-19 data in Chongqing and its evaluation  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough COVID-19 has been controlled in China, the risk of invasion of imported cases remains. We aimed to characterize the impact of the number of imported cases and the implementation of first-level emergency response (FLER) policy. A SCQIHR switching model was constructed and verified by the complete phased data of COVID-19 in Chongqing in 2020. Then it was used to investigate the impact of the number of imported cases and the timing of FLER. Lastly, it was evaluated by three actual scenarios in Chongqing in 2021. The proposed model can fit the multidimensional time series well. After the implementation of FLER, the mean effective reproduction number, contact rate and misdetection rate were decreased significantly, but the quarantine rate for close contacts and isolation rate for non-hospitalized infectious cases were increased significantly. The peaks of quarantined close contacts and hospitalized infectious cases increased linearly with the increase of the number of imported cases and the lag of FLER time, which was verified by three actual scenarios in Chongqing in 2021. These findings can provide guidance for local public health policy-making and allocation of medical resources, reduce the impact of COVID-19 on the local population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adynamic models 3agenetics 3ainfection 3aissues and policy 3apublic health 3aquarantine 3areproduction 3arisk 3atime series analysis 3aChina 0aCOVID-19 0aImported cases 0aFirst-level emergency response 0aSwitching dynamic model1 aDai, Chenxi1 aKuang, Shanshan1 aZhao, Han1 aLiu, Dan1 aLuo, Qing1 aWang, Kaifa0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2022 June, v. 100 p.105270-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2022.1052703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245015200174300001600326500001100342520193900353592002802292650001302320650001202333650001502345650002502360650001302385650001802398650001302416650001402429650002202443650002502465650002202490650000902512700002002521700002802541700002002569700002902589700001902618700002202637773013402659856008302793852000902876655001202885IND60771051420221119033921.0220322e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077105142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-022-01630-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLata, Jean-Christophe14aThe causes of the selection of biological nitrification inhibition (BNI) in relation to ecosystem functioning and a research agenda to explore them  ap. 207-224.  aReview  aBiological nitrification inhibition (BNI) has already led to several studies mainly focused on underlying molecular mechanisms and applications to agriculture. We argue that it is also important to study BNI more systematically from the ecological and evolutionary points of view to understand its implications for plants and soil nitrifiers as well as its consequences for ecosystems. Therefore, we propose here a dedicated research agenda identifying the most critical research questions: (1) How is BNI distributed across plant phylogeny and why has it been selected? (2) What are the costs-to-benefits balance of producing BNI compounds and the relative impacts on BNI evolution? (3) Can we understand the evolutionary pressures leading to BNI and identify the environmental conditions favorable to BNI plants? (4) How has BNI coevolved with plant preference for ammonium vs. nitrate? (5) Diverse BNI compounds and various inhibition mechanisms have been described, but implications of this diversity are not understood. Does it allow inhibition of various groups of nitrifiers? (6) Does this diversity of BNI compounds increase the efficiency, spatial extension, and duration of BNI effect? (7) What are the impacts of BNI compounds on other soil functions? (8) Can field experiments, coupled to scanning of the diversity of BNI capabilities within plant communities, evaluate whether BNI influences plant-plant competition and plant coexistence? (9) Can field quantification of various nitrogen (N) fluxes assess whether BNI lead to more efficient N cycling with lower losses and hence increased primary production? (10) Can the impact of BNI on N budgets and climate (through its impact on N₂O emissions and its indirect impact on carbon budget) be evaluated at the regional scale? We discuss why implementing this research program is crucial both for the sake of knowledge and to develop applications of BNI for agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3aclimate 3aecosystems 3aglobal carbon budget 3anitrates 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3aphylogeny 3aplant competition 3aprimary productivity 3aresearch programs 3asoil1 aLe Roux, Xavier1 aKoffi, Kouamé Fulgence1 aYé, Lambiénou1 aSrikanthasamy, Tharaniya1 aKonaré, Sarah1 aBarot, Sébastien0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2022 Apr., v. 58, no. 3 p.207-224dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl37530x0178-27627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-022-01630-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009600167506011700263506007600380520179400456592002802250506003702278650003202315650001802347650001102365650001402376650002102390650001102411650001302422650001502435650001402450650001602464650002502480650002202505650001002527653000802537653000902545653001802554653002202572700001402594700001502608700001702623700001302640700001302653700001802666700001702684700001802701773011602719856008502835852000902920655001202929IND60770891720221207135128.0220614e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077089172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meegid.2022.1052732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Qingqing10aIdentification of two novel ephemeroviruses in pigs infected by classical swine fever virus  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEphemeroviruses are arthropod-borne rhabdoviruses within Ephemerovirus genus and have been isolated exclusively from cattle and haematophagous arthropods (mosquitoes and biting midges) without any member detected or isolated up to date from pigs, although some serological surveys have indicated that pigs may be a silent host for ephemerovirus infection. Here, many viral reads annotated to, but genetically distinct from, the existing members within the Ephemerovirus genus have been identified in the meta-transcriptomic data of two clinical classical swine fever virus (CSFV)-infected samples (HeN10 and GDMM7). The nearly complete genome sequences of the two novel ephemeroviruses have been obtained through contig assembly, specific RT-PCR and sequencing, therefore named as porcine ephemeroviruses (PoEVs). Genome nucleotide sequence analysis showed that PoEV strains HeN10 and GDMM7 have similar genome organization and 66.5% genomic identity to each other, but both are genetically distant from all members of the Ephemerovirus genus with identity being only 51.1–59.6%. Furthermore, comparison of the most conserved ephemeroviral proteins N and L indicated that PoEV strains HeN10 and GDMM7 share a high sequence identity to each other (N: 78.1%; L: 70.7%), but are diverged from the known ephemeroviruses (N: 43.4–60.7%; L: 47.6–58.5%). The genetic distance is significantly beyond the criteria for demarcation of viruses assigned to different ephemerovirus species. Thereby, two novel viruses named as PoEV1 (strain HeN10) and PoEV2 (strain GDMM7) are identified and these appear to represent two new species within the Ephemerovirus genus. The present study showed the first genome evidence of pig ephemeroviruses, likely expanding the known host range of ephemerovirus.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClassical swine fever virus 3aEphemerovirus 3acattle 3aevolution 3agenetic distance 3agenome 3agenomics 3ahost range 3ainfection 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3asequence analysis 3aswine 0aPig 0aCSFV 0aEphemerovirus 0aGenetic diversity1 aYang, Zhe1 aLu, Zongji1 aMi, Shijiang1 aFeng, Ye1 aHe, Biao1 aZhu, Guoqiang1 aGong, Wenjie1 aTu, Changchun0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2022 June, v. 100 p.105273-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2022.1052733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02426naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002200146245011600168300001600284520141400300592002801714650000901742650001101751650001801762650002001780650002401800650001201824700002201836700002601858700002701884773009801911856008202009852000902091655001202100IND4481901020221116183322.0141111e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448190102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2011.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvin, Hannah E.10aGrowing old gracefully—Behavioral changes associated with “successful aging” in the dog, Canis familiaris  ap. 313-320.  aAging is associated with behavioral and cognitive changes in all mammals. Unlike most clinical presentations, changes associated with aging do not always reflect an underlying pathology and therefore baselines for normality can be difficult to establish. Using data from a large cross-sectional survey of older dog owners, we aimed to identify normative behavioral changes associated with “successful aging” in dogs, and the rate of deterioration that could be expected over a 6-month period. Binary logistic regression identified significant age group effects from 18 items (difference in reported item incidence across age group: 4.5%-30.3%, P < 0.001-0.038). Significant age group effects on the percentage of dogs deteriorating over the preceding 6 months were evident in 21 items (difference in item deterioration across age group: 3.5%-25.7%, P < 0.001-0.033). The modal frequency of problem behaviors and abnormal ingestive or locomotory items was found to be low and the effect on memory and learning was minimal. Despite this, more than half of the items were reported to have shown a greater than 10% incidence of deterioration. In particular, activity and play levels, response to commands, and fears and phobias showed considerable deterioration. These findings represent the first steps toward the development of baseline values for normal behavioral changes in “successfully aging” dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3amemory 3anormal values 3aplay activities 3aregression analysis 3asurveys1 aMcGreevy, Paul D.1 aSachdev, Perminder S.1 aValenzuela, Michael J.0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2011 , v. 6, no. 6 p.313-320dElsevier Inc.x1558-78787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2011.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03040naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245007500173300001600248520155600264592002801820650002601848650002301874650002201897650001501919650001901934650001701953650002401970650001201994650001402006650001302020650001302033650001402046650001702060650001802077650002102095650002002116650002002136653001602156653001402172653001802186653001902204653001002223700002202233700002202255700001702277700002102294773009602315856009002411852000902501655001202510IND60633451220221120182258.0190410e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063345122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoelee, Eline10aWater and health: From environmental pressures to integrated responses  ap. 217-226.  aThe water-related exposome is a significant determinant of human health. The disease burden through water results from water-associated communicable and non-communicable diseases and is influenced by water pollution with chemicals, solid waste (mainly plastics), pathogens, insects and other disease vectors. This paper analyses a range of water practitioner-driven health issues, including infectious diseases and chemical intoxication, using the conceptual framework of Drivers, Pressures, State, Impacts, and Responses (DPSIR), complemented with a selective literature review. Pressures in the environment result in changes in the State of the water body: chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the presence of vectors. These and other health hazards affect the State of human health. The resulting Impacts in an exposed population or affected ecosystem, in turn incite Responses. Pathways from Drivers to Impacts are quite divergent for chemical pollution, microbiological contamination and the spread of antimicrobial resistance, in vectors of disease and for the combined effects of plastics. Potential Responses from the water sector, however, show remarkable similarities. Integrated water management interventions have the potential to address Drivers, Pressures, Impacts, and State of several health issues at the same time. Systematic and integrated planning and management of water resources, with an eye for human health, could contribute to reducing or preventing negative health impacts and enhancing the health benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3aat-risk population 3aburden of disease 3aecosystems 3ahealth hazards 3ahuman health 3ainfectious diseases 3ainsects 3apathogens 3aplanning 3aplastics 3apoisoning 3asolid wastes 3asurface water 3awater management 3awater pollution 3awater utilities 0aHealth risk 0aPollution 0aContamination 0aPlastic debris 0aDPSIR1 aGeerling, Gertjan1 avan der Zaan, Bas1 aBlauw, Anouk1 aVethaak, A.

Global warming is predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather phenomena such as heat waves thereby posing a major threat for crop productivity and food security. The yield in case of most crop species is dependent on the success of reproductive development. Pollen development has been shown to be highly sensitive to elevated temperatures while the development of the female gametophyte as well as sporophytic tissues might also be disturbed under mild or severe heat stress conditions. Therefore, assessing pollen thermotolerance is currently of high interest for geneticists, plant biologists and breeders. A key aspect in pollen thermotolerance studies is the selection of the appropriate heat stress regime, the developmental stage that the stress is applied to, as well as the method of application. Literature search reveals a rather high variability in heat stress treatments mainly due to the lack of standardized protocols for different plant species. In this review, we summarize and discuss experimental approaches that have been used in various crops, with special focus on tomato, rice and wheat, as the best studied crops regarding pollen thermotolerance. The overview of stress treatments and the major outcomes of each study aim to provide guidelines for similar research in other crops.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiologists 3acrops 3afemales 3afood security 3agametophytes 3ageneticists 3aglobal warming 3aguidelines 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3apollen 3areproductive success 3arice 3asporophytes 3atemperature 3atissues 3atomatoes 3aweather 3awheat1 aIannacone, Rina1 aPiron, Nurit,1 aFragkostefanakis, Sotirios0 tPlant reproduction.g2016 June, v. 29, no. 1-2 p.93-105dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-016-0281-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002800155245013200183300001600315520164400331592002801975650002702003650000902030650002802039650002502067650001302092650002002105650002502125650001202150650001102162650001002173650001102183650001502194650001202209650001002221650000902231650001402240650000902254650001902263650001902282650000902301650001802310650001502328651000902343653001402352653001402366653002502380653002302405700002302428700002702451773009602478856009002574852000902664655001202673IND60633451320221122145243.0190410e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063345132DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.03.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaghlaninezhad, Raheleh10aAnalysis of knowledge and attitudes related to parasitic infections among inhabitants of Ahvaz County, Khuzestan Province, Iran  ap. 211-216.  aParasitic diseases are among the major health problems of various societies, especially people in developing countries, causing high economic and mortality burdens. Many researchers have reported that awareness and knowledge of a disease are effective in preventing and controlling the disease. The aim of the present study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes on parasitic diseases of the population in Ahvaz County, southwestern Iran. This community-based cross-sectional study was carried out in 2017 on 3500 subjects above 15 years old of Ahvaz County. First, participants were provided the necessary information regarding the study, and then data were collected using a constructed questionnaire. Of the 3500 participants, 1732 (49.5%) were female and 1768 (50.5%) were male, 348 (9.9%) said that they had been infected with a parasitic disease at least once in their lifetime. Almost half of the participants (42.8%) knew malaria was a parasitic disease and 50.2%, 48.9%, and 41.5% were aware of the possible transmission of parasitic diseases through uncooked meat, dirty hands, and close contact with animals.Regarding clinical symptoms, 73.2% and 32.6% of the respondents knew diarrhea and abdominal pain respectively were clinical symptoms of intestinal parasitic diseases. However, only 31.3% were aware of the close contact with cats and the risk of human toxoplasmosis and possible abortion in pregnant women. The findings reveal that the attitude of most participants toward treatment was positive (93.9%), but only 47.5% of believed that disinfecting fruits and vegetables could prevent intestinal parasitic infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acats 3across-sectional studies 3adeveloping countries 3adiarrhea 3adisease control 3adisease transmission 3afemales 3afruits 3ahands 3ahumans 3aintestines 3amalaria 3amales 3ameat 3amortality 3apain 3apregnant women 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3atoxoplasmosis 3avegetables 3aIran 0aKnowledge 0aAttitudes 0aParasitic infections 0aKhuzestan Province1 aBeiromvand, Molouk1 aVeisi, Mohammad Salehi0 tActa tropica.g2019 May, v. 193 p.211-216dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2019.03.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245017800158300002000336520125700356592002801613650002501641650001901666650001401685650001001699650001901709700001201728700001401740700001701754700001601771700001301787700001801800700001401818773012501832856007401957852000902031655001202040IND60669268320221123022923.0190920e20151023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066926832DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra15611d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Shaozheng10aConstruction of g-C₃N₄/S-g-C₃N₄ metal-free isotype heterojunctions with an enhanced charge driving force and their photocatalytic performance under anoxic conditions  ap. 90750-90756.  aIn heterojunction catalysts, the potential difference is the main driving force for efficient charge separation and transfer. The slight difference in the electronic band structure of the isotype heterojunction catalysts causes a poor driving force, leading to a dissatisfactory charge separation efficiency. In this work, g-C₃N₄/S-g-C₃N₄ metal-free isotype heterojunction catalysts (GCN–SCN) with an enhanced charge driving force were prepared by a two step calcination method. Anoxic photocatalytic degradation of RhB under visible light was used to evaluate the performance of the as-prepared g-C₃N₄ catalysts. The results indicate that this two step calcination method can markedly improve the charge driving force of the as-prepared isotype heterojunctions, leading to a more efficient charge-carrier migration. GCN–SCN displays the highest reaction rate constant of 0.0228 min⁻¹, which is 3.5 and 2.9 times higher than that of GCN/SCN(1) and GCN/SCN(2) prepared by a one step calcination method. A linear relationship is observed between the VB driving force and RhB degradation rate. This paper provides a new perspective to prepare isotype heterojunctions with an improved charge driving force and photocatalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3acarbon nitride 3acatalysts 3alight 3aphotocatalysis1 aMa, Lin1 aLi, Fayun1 aFan, Zhiping1 aWang, Qiong1 aBai, Jin1 aKang, Xiaoxue1 aWu, Guang0 tRSC advances.g2015 Oct. 23, v. 5, no. 110 p.90750-90756dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra15611d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245014800164300001800312520101400330592002801344650002501372650001301397650000901410650001301419650003301432650000901465650001101474650002001485700001501505700001601520773009201536856008501628852000901713655001201722IND4457017620221119154156.0141111e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445701762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeng, L.Y.10aRheological and textural studies of fresh and freeze-thawed native sago starch–sugar gels.

Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to evaluate the potential interactive and quadratic effects between these variables. Sago starch and sugar levels both increased gel stiffness and viscoelasticity. Shearing, on the other hand, reduced gel stiffness and viscoelasticity. Ridge analysis was performed to estimate the values of these variables which maximised and minimised the textural parameters of hardness, gumminess, resilience, cohesiveness, and springiness. Pearson correlations among various rheological and textural properties of gels were studied. The processing conditions that contributed to an optimum gel setting were found at sago starch of level of 7.69%, sugar of 30.29%, and shearing speed of 45.86rpm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalysis of variance 3acohesion 3agels 3ahardness 3aresponse surface methodology 3asago 3asugars 3aviscoelasticity1 aChin, N.L.1 aYusof, Y.A.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2011 Aug., v. 25, no. 6 p.1530-1537dElsevier Ltdx0268-005X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2011.02.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245016800183300001800351520134500369592002801714650000801742650002301750650003701773650001001810650001001820650001601830650002501846650002601871650001401897650004001911650002801951650002401979650003902003700002802042700002002070700002702090773008702117856004802204852000902252655001202261IND4479417320221116183046.0120727e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447941732DNAL7 a220863742pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-011-9615-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibeiro, Tiago10aIsolation and characterization of a new repetitive DNA family recently amplified in the Mesoamerican gene pool of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., Fabaceae)  ap. 1135-1142.  aThe common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the most important crop plants. About 50% of its genome is composed of repetitive sequences, but only a little fraction was isolated and characterized so far. In this paper, a new repetitive DNA family from the species, named PvMeso, was isolated and characterized in both gene pools of P. vulgaris (Andean and Mesoamerican) and related species. Two fragments, 1.7 and 2.3 kb long, were cloned from BAC 255F18, which has previously shown a repetitive pattern. The subclone PvMeso-31 showed a terminal block in chromosome 7. This subclone contains a 1,705 bp long, AT-rich repeat with small internal repeats and shares a 1.2 kb region with PvMeso-47, derived from the 2.3 kb fragment. The presence of this repetitive block was restricted to Mesoamerican accessions of the common bean. In P. acutifolius, P. leptostachyus and Andean P. vulgaris, only a faint, 2.3 kb fragment was visualized in Southern experiments. Moreover, in Mesoamerican accessions, two other fragments (1.7 kb and 3.4 kb) were strongly labelled as well. Taken together, our results indicate that PvMeso is a recently emerged, repeat family initially duplicated in chromosome 11, on ancestral Mesoamerican accession, and later amplified in chromosome 7, after the split of the two major gene pools of the common bean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abeans 3acrops 3amajor genes 3arepetitive sequences 2aDNA, Plantxchemistry 2aGene Pool 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhaseolusxgenetics 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid1 ados Santos, Karla G.

Pollen is particularly sensitive to environmental conditions that disturb protein homeostasis, such as higher temperatures. Their survival is dependent on subcellular stress response systems, one of which maintains protein homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Disturbance of ER proteostasis due to stress leads to the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) that mitigates stress damage mainly by increasing ER-folding capacity and reducing folding demands. The UPR is controlled by ER membrane-associated transcription factors and an RNA splicing factor. They are important components of abiotic stress responses including general heat stress response and thermotolerance. In addition to responding to environmental stresses, the UPR is implicated in developmental processes required for successful male gametophyte development and fertilization. Consequently, defects in the UPR can lead to pollen abortion and male sterility. Several UPR components are involved in the elaboration of the ER network, which is required for pollen germination and polar tube growth. Transcriptome and proteome analyses have shown that components of the ER-folding machinery and the UPR are upregulated at specific stages of pollen development supporting elevated demands for secretion. Furthermore, genetic studies have revealed that knockout mutants of UPR genes are defective in producing viable or competitive pollen. In this review, we discuss recent findings regarding the importance of the UPR for both pollen development and stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA splicing 3aabortion (plants) 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aenvironmental factors 3agametophytes 3agenes 3aheat shock response 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahomeostasis 3aknockout mutants 3amale fertility 3amales 3apollen 3apollen germination 3aproteome 3asecretion 3astress tolerance 3atemperature 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptome 3aunfolded protein response1 aMesihovic, Anida1 aHu, Yangjie1 aSchleiff, Enrico0 tPlant reproduction.g2016 June, v. 29, no. 1-2 p.81-91dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2194-79537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00497-016-0276-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03743naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245013200167300001600299520223400315592002802549650001002577650002102587650002102608650001602629650000902645650001202654650001202666650001702678650001002695650001102705650002302716650001002739650001102749650002102760650002002781650003102801650002502832650001802857650001102875650001202886650002602898650001802924700001702942700001702959700002202976700001702998773011003015856007903125852000903204655001203213IND50088768020221117232459.0150206e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008876802DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2656.121682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEckhardt, Michael10aPollen mixing in pollen generalist solitary bees: a possible strategy to complement or mitigate unfavourable pollen properties?  ap. 588-597.  aGeneralist herbivorous insects, which feed on plant tissue that is nutritionally heterogeneous or varies in its content of secondary metabolites, often benefit from dietary mixing through more balanced nutrient intake or reduced exposure to harmful secondary metabolites. Pollen is similarly heterogeneous as other plant tissue in its content of primary and secondary metabolites, suggesting that providing their offspring with mixed pollen diets might be a promising strategy for pollen generalist bees to complement nutrient imbalances or to mitigate harmful secondary metabolites of unfavourable pollen. In the present study, we compared larval performance of the pollen generalist solitary bee species Osmia cornuta (Megachilidae) on five experimental pollen diets that consisted of different proportions of unfavourable pollen diet of Ranunculus acris (Ranunculaceae) and favourable pollen diet of Sinapis arvensis (Brassicaceae). In addition, we microscopically analysed the pollen contained in the scopal brushes of field‐collected females of O. cornuta and three closely related species to elucidate to what degree these pollen generalist bees mix pollen of different hosts in their brood cells. In striking contrast to a pure Ranunculus pollen diet, which had a lethal effect on most developing larvae of O. cornuta, larval survival, larval development time and adult body mass of both males and females remained nearly unaffected by the admixture of up to 50% of Ranunculus pollen diet to the larval food. Between 42% and 66% of all female scopal pollen loads analysed contained mixtures of pollen from two to six plant families, indicating that pollen mixing is a common behaviour in O. cornuta and the three related bee species. The present study provides the first evidence that the larvae of pollen generalist bees can benefit from the nutrient content of unfavourable pollen without being negatively affected by its unfavourable chemical properties if such pollen is mixed with favourable pollen. We conclude that the widespread pollen mixing by females of pollen generalist bees should also be considered as a possible strategy to exploit flowers with unfavourable pollen and to optimize larval food quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOsmia 3aRanunculus acris 3aSinapis arvensis 3abrood cells 3adiet 3afemales 3aflowers 3afood quality 3afoods 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amales 3amixing 3anutrient content 3anutrient intake 3aphysicochemical properties 3aphytophagous insects 3aplant tissues 3apollen 3aprogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3asolitary bees1 aHaider, Mare1 aDorn, Silvia1 aMüller, Andreas,1 aIngs, Thomas0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2014 May, v. 83, no. 3 p.588-597dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.121683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02131naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245005300187300001500240520116600255650001101421650001501432650006401447650001101511700001601522700001801538700001701556773010301573852000901676856007601685930003301761946001101794655001201805IND4386922420221118064832.0070116e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438692242DNAL7 a172984152pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2006.01308.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumbert, M.10aAsthma control or severity: that is the question  ap. 95-101.  aIn the first National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines, the level of symptoms and airflow limitation and its variability allowed asthma to be subdivided by severity into four subcategories (intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent, and severe persistent). It is important to recognize, however, that asthma severity involves both the severity of the underlying disease and its responsiveness to treatment. Thus, the first update of the GINA guidelines defined asthma severity depending on the clinical features already proposed as well as the current treatment of the patient. In addition, severity is not a fixed feature of asthma, but may change over months or years, whereas the classification by severity suggests a static feature. Moreover, using severity as an outcome measure has limited value in predicting what treatment will be required and what the response to that treatment might be. Because of these considerations, the classification of asthma severity is no longer recommended as the basis for treatment decisions, a periodic assessment of asthma control being more relevant and useful. 3aasthma 3aguidelines 2aAsthmaxclassificationxdrug therapyxprevention & control. 2aHumans1 aHolgate, S.1 aBoulet, L.-P.1 aBousquet, J.0 tAllergy.g2007 Feb., v. 62, no. 2 p.95-101dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2006.01308.x3electronic resource  a20070116b20070202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03333naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245009500188300001800283520151300301650001101814650001701825650001001842650005301852650005601905650001901961650002801980650002302008650001102031650002902042650001902071650001102090650000902101650006002110650001502170650003202185650003402217650001702251650003002268650001502298651002602313653003002339653003002369653001002399653001402409700001802423700001602441700001902457700001502476773010702491852000902598856009202607930003302699946001102732655001202743IND4394751120221118064831.0070906e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439475112DNAL7 a178455832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01467.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVianna, E.O.10aAsthma definitions, relative validity and impact on known risk factors in young Brazilians  ap. 1146-1151.  aAn asthma score was proposed in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS) framework, as dichotomous definitions could be less appropriate in the study of chronic diseases. The aims of this study were to assess the value of this asthma score in comparison with other definitions of asthma in another population setting, using as criteria bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine and diagnosed asthma, and the association of these definitions to known risk factors of asthma. We used the ECRHS questionnaire on 2063 Brazilians, aged 23-25 years, and measured their BHR. We assessed the positive and negative likelihood ratios (PLR and NLR) of the asthma score (0-8), a three question score (ECRHS definition) and single asthma symptoms in relation to BHR and diagnosed asthma. The PLR were relatively low for all asthma definitions with odd ratios varying from 1.47 for asthma score to 5.50 for wheeze and waking with breathlessness without a cold. The NLR were near 1. The PLR were lower for assessments using the score than for dichotomous assessments or the ECRHS definition. The PLR increased with asthma scores, but the prevalence with higher scores was too low for useful analysis. The asthma score was slightly better for identifying associations from a set of known risk factors than the other two approaches. Our study provided little support for a greater validity of this asthma score over other asthma definitions, and only marginal advantage for identifying risk factors. 3aasthma 3aepidemiology 2aAdult 2aAsthmaxclassificationxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aBronchial Hyperreactivityxdiagnosisxepidemiology. 2aCohort Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDyspneaxdiagnosis 2aFemale 2aForced Expiratory Volume 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMethacholine Chloridexadverse effectsxdiagnostic use. 2aPrevalence 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRespiratory Soundsxdiagnosis 2aRisk Factors 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aSkin Tests 0aBrazilxepidemiology. 0anegative likelihood ratio 0apositive likelihood ratio 0ascore 0askin test1 aGarcía, C.A.1 aBettiol, H.1 aBarbieri, M.A.1 aRona, R.J.0 tAllergy.g2007 Oct., v. 62, no. 10 p.1146-1151dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01467.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02900naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002300171245010900194300001600303520155800319650001401877650001701891650001001908650002401918650003801942650005201980650001102032650003702043650001502080653001902095700001902114700001602133700001802149700001602167700001602183700001802199773010402217852000902321856009202330930003302422946001102455655001202466IND4392452420221118064824.0070617e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439245242DNAL7 a175737262pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01411.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReinikka-Railo, H.10aLatex allergy: the sum quantity of four major allergens shows the allergenic potential of medical gloves  ap. 781-786.  aAssessment of allergenic potential of medical devices made of natural rubber latex (NRL) requires the measurement of concentrations of specific allergenic proteins or polypeptides eluting from rubber. Four NRL allergens (Hev b 1, 3, 5, and 6.02) were quantified in all medical glove brands marketed in Finland in 1999, 2001, and 2003 (n = 208) by a capture enzyme immunoassay. The results were compared with those obtained from previous nationwide market surveys, using a skin prick test-validated human IgE-based ELISA-inhibition method. A high overall correlation (r = 0.87, 95% CI 0.83-0.90) emerged between the sum values of the four allergens(μg/g glove) and IgE-ELISA inhibition (allergen units, AU/ml, 1 : 5 diluted glove extract). The sum of four allergens when set at 0.15 μg/g discriminated 'low allergenic' (<10 AU/ml) from 'moderate- to high-allergenic' (>=10 AU/ml) gloves at a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) and specificity of 0.90 (95% CI 0.83-0.94). When the sum was below the detection limit (0.03 μg/g) all gloves belonged to the previously defined low-allergen category. By comparing the sum concentration of four selected NRL allergens with results obtained in human IgE-ELISA inhibition, it was possible set a cut-off level (0.15 μg/g) below which virtually all gloves contain low or insignificant amounts of allergens, and can be considered as low allergenic. At different cut-off-points, one could calculate the likelihood of a given glove to belong to the previously defined low, moderate or high allergen categories. 3aallergens 3aimmunoassays 3alatex 2aAllergensxanalysis 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGloves, Protectivexadverse effectsxstandards. 2aHumans 2aLatex Hypersensitivityxetiology 2aSkin Tests 0amedical gloves1 aKautiainen, H.1 aAlenius, H.1 aKalkkinen, N.1 aKulomaa, M.1 aReunala, T.1 aTurjanmaa, K.0 tAllergy.g2007 July, v. 62, no. 7 p.781-786dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01411.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070617b20070702c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03014naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245008700187300001600274520150100290650001801791650003501809650004301844650003101887650001601918650004601934650001101980650001801991650001502009650005302024650003302077650004102110653002202151653002302173653002002196653004002216653003502256700001502291773010502306852000902411856009202420930003302512946001102545655001202556IND4393780020221118064847.0070805e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439378002DNAL7 a176861012pmid7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01440.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMösges, R.10aToday's allergic rhinitis patients are different: new factors that may play a role  ap. 969-975.  aMost of today's patients suffering from allergic rhinitis (AR) are sensitized to more than one trigger and suffer from persistent and moderate/severe symptoms, which severely impair their quality of life (QOL). The objective of this article was to review the data on the effect of increased air pollution, changes in indoor environment/lifestyle/affluence, exposure to new allergens and psychologically stressful lifestyles, as also to explore their potential in the development of this more 'aggressive' form of disease. Increased fossil fuel-generated air pollution may increase the risk of allergic sensitization, airway responsiveness to allergens, and allergenicity and the bioavailability of airborne allergens. Changes in indoor environment/lifestyle/affluence appear to have led to more time being spent indoors and resulted in perennial exposure to indoor allergens, changes in sensitization patterns, and polysensitization to a variety of novel cross-reacting exotic food and pet allergens. Although evidence suggests an association between psychological stress and increased risk for atopy and allergic disease, further studies are required to demonstrate this unequivocally. The more persistent and moderate/severe nature of the disease suggests a need for modification of current treatment strategies and advocacy of the use from the outset of agents, which are both efficacious and safe in managing severe and persistent AR symptoms and in improving the QOL of affected individuals. 3aair pollution 2aAir Pollutionxadverse effects 2aAir Pollution, Indoorxadverse effects 2aAllergensxadverse effects 2aEnvironment 2aHistamine H1 Antagonistsxtherapeutic use 2aHumans 2aImmunotherapy 2aLife Style 2aRespiratory Hypersensitivityxetiologyxtherapy. 2aRhinitisxetiologyxtherapy. 2aStress, Psychologicalxcomplications 0aallergic rhinitis 0aindoor environment 0anovel allergens 0apsychologically stressful lifestyle 0asevere and persistent symptoms1 aKlimek, L.0 tAllergy.g2007 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.969-975dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01440.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02099naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245010300169300001600272500001500288520094700303650001201250650000901262650002501271650001401296650001901310650001701329650001701346650001001363651001101373653001401384653001001398653002701408653001501435773011601450852000901566856005701575930003301632945001301665946001101678655001201689IND2041168120221118064451.0940729e199407  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204116812DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1994.tb00987.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWest, D.A.10aUnimodal Batesian polymorphism in the neotropical swallowtail butterfly Eurytides lysithous (Hbn.)  ap. 197-224.  a2019-12-05  aThe Brazilian swallowtail Eurytides lysithous is evidently a Batesian mimic of several Parides species. It is polymorphic for mimetic patterns in both sexes. Various populations contain from one to three major forms, and these seem to depend on two unlinked loci or supergenes. Samples from natural populations, and one reared brood, suggest that one locus controls two white-marked forms, with incomplete dominance producing a third heterozygous form. The heterozygotes are everywhere deficient from Hardy-Weinberg expectations. The second putative locus has an allele epistatic to the first locus which converts the white-marked forms to black, but epistasis is apparently incomplete in heterozygotes. The incomplete dominance and epistasis result in extraordinarily variable polymorphic populations and would allow a genetic analysis for comparison with those already done in the classic Batesian polymorphic swallowtails of the Old World. 3aalleles 3aloci 3aincomplete dominance 3aepistasis 3aheterozygosity 3aPapilionidae 3apolymorphism 3awings 3aBrazil 0adominance 0agenes 0aanatomy and morphology 0asupergenes0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1994 July, v. 52, no. 3 p.197-224wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1994.tb00987.x  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01903naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245008000174300001600254520079400270650002601064650001901090650001601109650001701125650001601142650001501158650002401173650001401197650001601211653001701227700001701244700001701261773011601278852000901394856005701403930003301460945001301493946001101506655001201517IND2047788420221118064421.0950916e199507  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204778842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1995.tb01062.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeintraub, J.D.10aLithinine moths on ferns: a phylogenetic study of insect-plant interactions  ap. 239-250.  aWe examine host association patterns in pteridophagous moths of the tribe Lithinini (Lepidoptera: Geometridae).

Split application was effective only at soil nitrogen level of 200 kg N/ha. Plant height increased whereas the number of senescent leaves decreased with higher N-levels. Increased nitrogen fertilization resulted in darker colour, higher chlorophyll content and undesired elongation of sprouts. Specific gravity, dry matter, total sugars and vitamin C content decreased with N-levels. 3aBrassica oleracea var. gemmifera 3acultivars 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acrop yield 3acrop quality 3aapplication rate 3aPoland1 aRumpel, J.1 aElkner, K.0 tActa horticulturae.g1996 Apr., , no. 407 p.353-359x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02331naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011900126300001600245500013000261520143300391650002201824650001901846650003601865700001301901773007301914852000901987930003301996945001302029946001102042655001202053IND2061943320221118064554.0980219e199604  be |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206194332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, D.10aProtein and mineral concentration of Portuguese kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) related to soil composition  ap. 269-276.  aPaper presented at the ISHS Symposium on Brassica / Ninth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, November 15-19, 1994, Lisbon, Portugal.  aPrimitive cultivars of Portuguese kale, which are well adapted to impoverished soils and adverse climatic conditions in the country, assume an important role in the total production and consumption of vegetables. Information concerning the quality of kales in response to various soil characteristics is lacking. The objective of this study was to determine if the mineral concentration in leaves, lamina and petioles, was related to soil chemical characteristics. Primitive cultivars of kale were established in the field in March/April 1992, in the region of Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro, north of Portugal, and harvested in September. For this survey samples were analyzed from the laminae and petioles for N, Ca, Mg, K, and P and from the soil for pH, Ca, Mg, K, Na, A1, P, acidity, cation exchange capacity and base saturation. Portuguese kales were found to have higher levels of protein, Ca, and Mg, than the reported values in Table 1. The mineral concentration in leaves was related to soil composition (accessed by routine analysis), by linear multivariate models. Only about 50% of the total variance in leaf composition was explained by soil characteristics. Calcium concentrations in laminae and K in petioles were even less dependent on soil characteristics. This study emphasizes the complexity of relationships between soil and plant composition and the necessity for further research under controlled conditions. 3aBrassica oleracea 3asoil chemistry 3achemical constituents of plants1 aRosa, E.0 tActa horticulturae.g1996 Apr., , no. 407 p.269-276x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02243naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008800130300001600218500013000234520129700364650001301661650003201674650002201706650001001728700001701738700001501755700002001770773007301790852000901863930003301872945001301905946001101918655001201929IND2061938020221118064707.0980219e199604  be |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206193802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJorgensen, R.B.10aSpontaneous hybridization between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and weedy relatives  ap. 193-200.  aPaper presented at the ISHS Symposium on Brassica / Ninth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, November 15-19, 1994, Lisbon, Portugal.  aFrequencies of spontaneous hybridization between oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and weedy B. campestris (B. rapa) were measured in agricultural fields. The interspecific hybridization was from 9% to 93% depending on the experimental design. Hybrid seed germinated in the field and adult hybrids were observed in the next growing season. The pollen fertility of the hybrids was reduced to 35% on an average, and they produced 102 seeds/hybrid in spontaneous backcrosses with the parental species. The inheritance of 17 oilseed rape specific markers was analyzed in selected backcross plants. The production of spontaneous hybrids was confirmed in field experiments with mixtures of transgenic, herbicide tolerant oilseed rape and B. campestris. The interspecific hybrids were herbicide tolerant and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) confirmed the presence of the transgene construct. The spontaneous backcrossing to B. campestris was likewise confirmed in field experiments with mixed populations of B. campestris and interspecific hybrids with the transgene construct. In the interspecific combination B. juncea x B. napus a frequency of 3% spontaneous hybridization was observed in the field. Our results suggest that transgenes could be dispersed from oilseed rape to related Brassica species. 3aBrassica 3ainterspecific hybridization 3atransgenic plants 3aweeds1 aAndersen, B.1 aLandbo, L.1 aMikkelsen, T.R.0 tActa horticulturae.g1996 Apr., , no. 407 p.193-200x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02328naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006100123300001400184500013000198520146800328650001301796650001501809650001301824700001301837700001701850700002201867773007101889852000901960930003301969945001302002946001102015655001202026IND2061927420221118064605.0980219e199604  be |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206192742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, K.10aGenome variation and evolution of Brassica amphidiploids  ap. 35-44.  aPaper presented at the ISHS Symposium on Brassica / Ninth Crucifer Genetics Workshop, November 15-19, 1994, Lisbon, Portugal.  aGenome variation among natural and synthetic Brassica amphidiploid species have been studied by RFLP analyses. Large genetic diversity was found among and within the three cultivated amphidiploid species. Based on genetic diversity, B. napus seems to be the most ancient amphidiploid, followed by B. juncea and B. carinata. Two major factors are responsible for the genetic diversity within amphidiploids: one is multiple hybridizations between different diploid parents, and the other is genome modifications after polyploidization. A good example for multiple hybridizations was found in B. napus. Four cytoplasmic types were observed in a group of representative B. napus accessions, which matched with different parental diploid cytoplasms. Direct evidence for genome changes after polyploidization were obtained from synthetic amphidiploids. Genome changes, madly involving loss and/or gain of parental fragments and novel fragments, were observed in the early generations of four synthetic amphidiploids. The frequency of genome change and the direction of genome evolution in the synthetics appeared to be associated with the genome divergence between the parental diploid species. Rapid genome changes resulted in fast genetic divergence among the derivatives of synthetic amphidiploids, which, by providing raw materials for selection, might have played an important role in the evolutionary success of Brassica amphidiploids and many polyploid lineages. 3aBrassica 3apolyploidy 3agenomics1 aTang, K.1 aOsborn, T.C.1 aLu, Ponzy,d1942-0 tActa horticulturae.g1996 Apr., , no. 407 p.35-44x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdRAE  aNon-US 7aarticle02443naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245006500171300001800236500001500254520078500269650001201054650002301066650001701089650001601106650002701122650001901149650002001168650002201188650001301210650002201223650001101245650001601256650001801272650002501290650002801315650002401343650001001367650002501377650002201402650002001424650002301444650002101467650001501488650001001503653002601513653001101539700001401550700002701564773010501591852000901696856007701705930003301782945001301815946001301828655001201841IND2327487020221118064436.0020611e20020313dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232748702DNAL7 a118790132pmid7 a10.1021/jf01064462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeon, A.E.10aUtilization of enzyme mixtures to retard bread crumb firming  ap. 1416-1419.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of enzyme mixtures containing amylase and lipase activities on straight dough bread staling was studied. Amylopectin retrogradation, crumb firming, amylose-lipid complexes, and dextrin production were analyzed in bread samples supplemented with two enzyme mixtures. The addition of enzyme mixtures to bread formula causes a beneficial effect on bread keeping properties and the formation of a more thermostable amylose-lipid complex than the one found in control bread. Amylopectin retrogradation was inhibited by the use of the enzyme; the effect was accompanied by reduced crumb-firming rates. The enzymatically generated water-soluble dextrins (maltose and DP3, DP4, DP5, and DP6 dextrins) are the most effective in preserving crumb softness during bread storage. 3atexture 3achemical reactions 3afood storage 3aamylopectin 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3afood additives 3astorage quality 3aRhizopus arrhizus 3adextrins 3aBacillus subtilis 3abreads 3aAspergillus 3aalpha-amylase 2aAmylasesxmetabolism 2aAmylopectinxmetabolism 2aAmylosexmetabolism 2aBread 2aDextrinsxmetabolism 2aFood Preservation 2aFood Technology 2aLipasexmetabolism 2aLipid Metabolism 2aSolubility 2aWater 0astarch retrogradation 0astarch1 aDuran, E.1 aBenedito de Barber, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Mar. 13, v. 50, no. 6 p.1416-1419x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01064463Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02318naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245003700150300001300187520107100200650002301271650000901294650001501303650001801318650001901336650001301355650002001368650000901388650001201397650002701409650000901436650002101445650001601466650003801482650001701520650002401537700001401561700001401575700002001589700001901609700001801628700002101646773008901667852000901756930003301765945001301798946001301811655001201824IND2040392120221118064532.0940621e199401  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204039212DNAL7 a79073012pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoldsworthy, T.L.10aTransgenic animals in toxicology  ap. 8-19.  aRecent advances have been made in the characterization of a number of transgenic animal models.

The goal of this symposium was to introduce the development of transgenic animals and the utilization of transgenics in toxicology research focusing on understanding tissue-specific mutation, chemical effects, and cancer. The production of transgenic animals, including gene insertions and gene knockouts, and the utilization of transgenic technology for studying multistage carcinogenesis and tumor suppressor genes are described. Data on the application and implications of transgenics as a genetic endpoint are also discussed. The use of transgenic animals in toxicology should improve our understanding of the role of specific genetic alterations in the carcinogenic process and lead to improved estimations of human health risks. 3atransgenic animals 3amice 3atoxicology 3aanimal models 3acarcinogenesis 3amutation 3arisk assessment 3arisk 2aAnimals 2aGenes, p53xphysiology 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aMutagenesis 2aNeoplasms, Experimentalxgenetics 2aRisk Factors 2aToxicologyxmethods1 aRecio, L.1 aBrown, K.1 aDonehower, L.A.1 aMirsalis, J.C.1 aTennant, R.W.1 aPurchase, I.F.H.0 tFundamental and applied Toxicology.g1994 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.8-19x0272-05907nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02654naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245019500164300001600359520118100375650001501556650001601571650001001587650002001597650002201617650002501639650001201664650002201676650001801698650001001716650002701726650002301753650001401776650000901790650003201799650000901831650001501840651001201855653002001867653002701887773013201914852000902046856008502055930003302140946001102173655001202184IND4437517820221118064456.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443751782DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-009-0334-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHartley, Matt 10aQualitative risk assessment of the role of the feral wild boar (Sus scrofa) in the likelihood of incursion and the impacts on effective disease control of selected exotic diseases in England  ap. 401-410.  aA qualitative risk assessment was undertaken to analyse the likelihood of the incursion of selected exotic infectious disease into England's small populations of feral boar and the potential impacts these animals could have on effective disease control. In order to identify the exposure pathways, it was necessary to consider not only the epidemiology of the pathogens but also to understand how the ecology and behaviour of wild boar would affect disease transmission. It was concluded that the greatest risks of exotic disease incursion into the UK were associated with disease entering through the consumption of infected pork meat or meat products by either wild boar or domestic swine and thus the diseases of highest risk are classic swine fever, foot and mouth disease and Trichinella sp. It should be noted that much of the peer review publications used as the scientific evidence base for this assessment describes disease outbreaks in boar populations in countries which have the disease endemically or have been previously exposed to the disease. In the UK, disease may act differently as the UK population of boar will be naïve to the exotic notifiable diseases. 3aSus scrofa 3aTrichinella 3aboars 3adisease control 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease transmission 3aecology 3aexposure pathways 3aferal animals 3afever 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3anotifiable disease 3apathogens 3apork 3aqualitative risk assessment 3arisk 3awild boars 3aEngland 0aFeral wild boar 0aTransmissible diseases0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2010 June, v. 56, no. 3 p.401-410dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-009-0334-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03271naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245012300181300001600304520123400320650001201554650002501566650005001591650002101641650001301662650001501675650001401690650001001704650002401714650001001738650001401748650005501762650005801817650002601875650002301901650006101924650003601985650004202021650004402063650002102107650005702128650005302185650003602238650001702274650005702291653001002348653002002358700002002378700001802398773012702416852000902543856008502552930003302637946001102670655001202681IND4437518920221118064558.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443751892DNAL7 a203869242pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-010-0540-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKõiv, Viia 10aAepA of Pectobacterium is not involved in the regulation of extracellular plant cell wall degrading enzymes production  ap. 541-549.  aPlant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDE) are the major virulence determinants in phytopathogenic Pectobacterium, and their production is controlled by many regulatory factors. In this study, we focus on the role of the AepA protein, which was previously described to be a global regulator of PCWDE production in Pectobacterium carotovorum (Murata et al. in Mol Plant Microbe Interact 4:239-246, 1991). Our results show that neither inactivation nor overexpression of aepA affects PCWDE production in either Pectobacterium atrosepticum SCRI1043 or Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum SCC3193. The previously published observation based on the overexpression of aepA could be explained by the presence of the adjacent regulatory rsmB gene in the constructs used. Our database searches indicated that AepA belongs to the YtcJ subfamily of amidohydrolases. YtcJ-like amidohydrolases are present in bacteria, archaea, plants and some fungi. Although AepA has 28% identity with the formamide deformylase NfdA in Arthrobacter pascens F164, AepA was unable to catalyze the degradation of NdfA-specific N-substituted formamides. We conclude that AepA is a putative aminohydrolase not involved in regulation of PCWDE production. 3aArchaea 3aArthrobacter pascens 3aPectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum 3aamide hydrolases 3abacteria 3acell walls 3adatabases 3afungi 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3avirulence 2aAmidohydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEnzymesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aExtracellular Spacexmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aPectobacteriumxenzymologyxgeneticsxpathogenicity. 2aPlantsxchemistryxmicrobiologyxultrastructure. 2aSolanum tuberosumxmicrobiology 2aTransfection 2aVirulence Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolismxphysiology. 0aPCWDE 0aAmidohydrolases1 aAndresen, Liis 1 aMäe, Andres 0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2010 June, v. 283, no. 6 p.541-549dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-010-0540-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03549naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245013700186300001600323520137700339650003001716650001201746650001901758650001001777650001001787650002201797650001201819650002501831650003001856650002401886650001501910650002001925650002101945650002001966650001401986650006802000650003002068650004202098650001302140650002302153650004402176650003602220650003702256650003602293650001502329650004502344653002002389653002402409653002302433653003002456700002302486700002002509700002202529700001802551700001802569700002302587773012702610852000902737856008502746930003302831946001102864655001202875IND4437519220221118064651.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443751922DNAL7 a204370572pmid7 a10.1007/s00438-010-0542-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlüsener, Sonja 10aProteomic and transcriptomic characterization of a virulence-deficient phosphatidylcholine-negative Agrobacterium tumefaciens mutant  ap. 575-589.  aPhosphatidylcholine (PC) is the most abundant phospholipid in eukaryotic membranes, whereas only a limited number of bacteria are able to synthesize PC. Intriguingly, many of the bacteria with PC-containing membranes interact with eukaryotic hosts. PC is one of the major membrane lipids in the phytopathogenic bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The presence of PC is critical for diverse cellular processes like motility, biofilm formation, stress resistance, and virulence. The exact role of PC in these processes is unknown. Here, we examined the global consequences of the complete loss of PC at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels. Both strategies validated the impaired virulence gene induction responsible for the virulence defect of the PC-deficient mutant. In addition, the proteomic approach revealed a limited subset of proteins with altered abundance including the reduced flagellar proteins FlaA and FlaB, which explains the motility defect of the PC mutant. At the whole-genome level, the loss of PC was correlated with altered expression of up to 13% of all genes, most encoding membrane or membrane-associated proteins and proteins with functions in the extracytoplasmic stress response. Our integrated analysis revealed that A. tumefaciens dynamically remodels its membrane protein composition in order to sustain normal growth in the absence of PC. 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3abiofilm 3agene induction 3agenes 3ahosts 3amembrane proteins 3amutants 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aplant pathogenic bacteria 3aprotein composition 3aproteomics 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atranscriptomics 3avirulence 2aAgrobacterium tumefaciensxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathogenicity. 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenomics 2aModels, Biological 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aOrganisms, Genetically Modified 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxmetabolism 2aProteomexanalysisxmetabolism. 2aProteomics 2aVirulence Factorsxdeficiencyxgenetics. 0aMembrane lipids 0aPhosphatidylcholine 0aα-Proteobacterium 0aPlant-microbe interaction1 aHacker, Stephanie 1 aTsai, Yun-Long 1 aBandow, Julia E. 1 aGust, Ronald 1 aLai, Erh-Min 1 aNarberhaus, Franz 0 tMolecular genetics and genomics.g2010 June, v. 283, no. 6 p.575-589dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1617-46157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00438-010-0542-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01527naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245006500129300001400194520064600208650003400854650002400888650002200912650001500934650002200949653001200971653002600983653002101009653002101030700001701051773007801068852000901146939003301155946001301188655001201201IND9001129020221118064726.0900319e198811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900112902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, D.E.12aA stronger profession through appropriate teacher incentives  ap. 74-78.  aThe common objective of recent governmental policies affecting the teaching profession is to improve the quality of teaching in the nation's schools.

Nine microsatellite loci and sequence data from the mitochondrial (mtDNA) control region were analyzed. Eighteen unique mtDNA haplotypes were found with no evidence of geographic population structure. Using nine microsatellite loci, significant heterogeneity was detected between Aleutian Island Pacific halibut and fish from the other two regions (F ST range = 0.007-0.008). Significant F ST values represent the first genetic evidence of divergent groups of halibut in the central and western Aleutian Archipelago. No significant genetic differences were found between Pacific halibut in the Gulf of Alaska and the Bering Sea leading to questions about factors contributing to separation of Aleutian halibut. Previous studies have reported Aleutian oceanographic conditions at deep inter-island passes leading to ecological discontinuity and unique community structure east and west of Aleutian passes. Aleutian Pacific halibut genetic structure may result from oceanographic transport mechanisms acting as partial barriers to gene flow with fish from other Alaskan waters. 3aHippoglossus stenolepis 3acommunity structure 3agene flow 3ahalibut 3ahaplotypes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation structure 3aAleutian Islands 3aBering Sea 3aGulf of Alaska 0aPacific halibut1 aGraziano, Sara L. 1 aSeitz, Andrew C. 0 tConservation genetics.g2010 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.999-1012dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-009-9943-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02293naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245014500162300001800307520099000325650001101315650001201326650002001338650002201358650001901380650002701399650000901426650002701435650001001462651001601472651001101488653002301499653002601522700002201548700002001570700002801590773011501618852000901733856008501742930003301827946001101860655001201871IND4437510020221118064736.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443751002DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-009-9905-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVila, Marta 10aCharacterization of ten polymorphic microsatellite markers for the protected Spanish moon moth Graellsia isabelae (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae)  ap. 1151-1154.  aTen polymorphic microsatellite loci were developed for Graellsia isabelae. Polymorphism was assessed for 20 individuals from a Spanish population (Els-Ports-de-Beseit, Catalonia) and 39 more individuals from one population in the French Alps and six other Spanish localities. Overall, the number of alleles per locus ranged from 5 to 24. Els-Ports-de-Beseit showed an average number of alleles per locus of 9.80 (SD = 4.32), observed heterozygosity was 0.71 (SD = 0.226), and expected heterozygosity was 0.788 (SD = 0.146). Genotypic frequencies conformed to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the Catalonian population, and no evidence for linkage disequilibrium was observed. Multilocus genotypes resulting from this set of markers will be useful to determine genetic diversity and differentiation within and among populations of this highly protected moth. Several loci amplified and resulted polymorphic in two related species: two loci in Actias neidhoeferi, and three loci in A. luna. 3aActias 3aalleles 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3alinkage disequilibrium 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amoths 3aAlps region 3aFrance 0aGraellsia isabelae 0aConservation genetics1 aMarí-Mena, Neus 1 aYen, Shen-Horn 1 aLopez-Vaamonde, Carlos 0 tConservation genetics.g2010 June, v. 11, no. 3 p.1151-1154dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1566-06217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-009-9905-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03382naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245011100171300001600282520188200298650002402180650003102204650002402235650003002259650002302289650001402312650003102326650001602357650001102373650001702384650002202401650001002423650001102433650002002444650002202464653002402486653002602510653002202536700002202558700003002580700001902610700001902629773010202648852000902750856008502759930003302844946001102877655001202888IND4437505220221118064708.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443750522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10526-009-9258-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMesselink, Gerben J. 10aPest species diversity enhances control of spider mites and whiteflies by a generalist phytoseiid predator  ap. 387-398.  aTo test the hypothesis that pest species diversity enhances biological pest control with generalist predators, we studied the dynamics of three major pest species on greenhouse cucumber: Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande), greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood), and two-spotted spider mites, Tetranychus urticae Koch in combination with the predator species Amblyseius swirskii Athias-Henriot. When spider mites infested plants prior to predator release, predatory mites were not capable of controlling spider mite populations in the absence of other pest species. A laboratory experiment showed that predators were hindered by the webbing of spider mites. In a greenhouse experiment, spider mite leaf damage was lower in the presence of thrips and predators than in the presence of whiteflies and predators, but damage was lowest in the presence of thrips, whiteflies and predators. Whitefly control was also improved in the presence of thrips. The lower levels of spider mite leaf damage probably resulted from (1) a strong numerical response of the predator (up to 50 times higher densities) when a second and third pest species were present in addition to spider mites, and (2) from A. swirskii attacking mobile spider mite stages outside or near the edges of the spider mite webbing. Interactions of spider mites with thrips and whiteflies might also result in suppression of spider mites. However, when predators were released prior to spider mite infestations in the absence of other pest species, but with pollen as food for the predators, we found increased suppression of spider mites with increased numbers of predators released, confirming the role of predators in spider mite control. Thus, our study provides evidence that diversity of pest species can enhance biological control through increased predator densities. 3aAmblyseius swirskii 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aTetranychus urticae 3aTrialeurodes vaporariorum 3abiological control 3acucumbers 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aleaves 3amite control 3amite infestations 3apests 3apollen 3apredatory mites 3aspecies diversity 0aAmblyseius swirskii 0aFood web interactions 0aPest interactions1 aVan Maanen, Roos 1 aVan Holstein-Saj, Renata 1 aSabelis, M.

This species is an autochthonous member of marine ecosystems that can behave as an opportunistic pathogen for fish and mammals. All strains tested (i) were able to grow under the restricted conditions imposed by the iron chelators transferrin (Tf) and EDDHA, (ii) secreted siderophores of hydroxamic type, other than aerobactin and desferal, that were able to stimulate the growth of the auxotroph mutant Arthrobacter favescens JG9, and (iii) expressed common iron-regulated outer membrane proteins (IROMPs). No change in LPS patterns was observed in response to iron restriction. Results from the assays with transferrin suggest that these siderophores could be utilized to sequester iron from Tf, a protein for which no surface receptor was detected in any strain. In summary, the overall data demonstrate that V. damsela expresses siderophore-mediated iron-uptake systems. These systems are probably involved in the survival of the species in the different environments that it can colonize, i.e. water and several vertebrate hosts. 3aArthrobacter 3aPhotobacterium damselae subsp. damselae 3aavirulent strains 3achelating agents 3adeferoxamine 3afish 3ahosts 3airon 3amammals 3amarine ecosystems 3amutants 3aouter membrane proteins 3apathogens 3asiderophores 3atransferrin 3avirulence1 aBiosca, E.G.1 aAmaro, C.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1997 Feb., v. 82, no. 2 p.157-167x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.1997.tb03568.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01849naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010300170300001400273520087900287653002001166653001901186700002201205700002201227700002401249700002201273773012801295852000901423856006901432930003301501946001301534655001201547IND4388742420221118064550.0070311e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438874242DNAL7 a10.1007/s10694-006-0001-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManzello, Samuel L. 13aAn Experimental Determination of a Real Fire Performance of a Non-Load Bearing Glass Wall Assembly  ap. 77-89.  aA glass wall assembly was exposed to an intense real-scale compartment fire. The wall assembly consisted of four glass sections, two of which were fitted with tempered double-pane glass and the other two sections were fitted with tempered single-pane glass. At each glass section, temperatures were measured at the exposed face and the unexposed face. Total heat flux gauges were used to measure both the temporal variation of the energy incident on the glass wall and the transmitted energy rate detected through two of the glass sections. Visual and infrared cameras were used to image the unexposed face of each wall assembly during the fire exposure. Results of glass breakage and subsequent glass fall out were compared to studies in the literature for glass sections exposed to compartment fires. The behavior of the glass wall assembly under a fire load is presented. 0aglass partition 0aglass breakage1 aGann, Richard G. 1 aKukuck, Scott R. 1 aPrasad, Kuldeep R. 1 aJones, Walter W. 0 tFire technology.g2007 Mar., v. 43, no. 1 p.77-89dNew York : Kluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum Publishersx0015-26847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10694-006-0001-53electronic resource  a20070311b20070402c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle04062naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245015600188300001600344520210100360650003802461650001602499650002302515650002002538650001002558650002502568650000902593650001602602650002502618650002502643650002402668650001102692650002502703650001402728650001002742650001202752650001702764650005902781650002502840650001402865650001402879650003302893650004202926650002402968650003202992650001803024651001503042651001503057653001203072653002403084653003103108653002003139653001603159773010903175852000903284856008503293930003303378946001303411655001203424IND4437479220221118064747.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443747922DNAL7 a203548542pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9464-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl Mamun, Abdullah.10aUnderstanding the Value of Local Ecological Knowledge and Practices for Habitat Restoration in Human-Altered Floodplain Systems: A Case from Bangladesh  ap. 922-938.  aWorldwide there is a declining trend in natural fish catch (FAO, The state of world fisheries and aquaculture. http://www.fao.org/documents/show_cdr.asp?url_file=/docrep/007/y5600e/y5600e00.htm, 2002) and Bangladesh is no exception. The vast inland fisheries of Bangladesh have been declining over the years, largely a result of human alteration of the aquatic habitats arising from human interventions in the floodplain systems such as the establishment of water control structures which favor agricultural production but reduce fish habitats. It can be assumed that conventional management measures are not adequate to conserve natural fisheries and exploring alternative knowledge systems to complement existing management is warranted. This paper focuses on local ecological knowledge and several other local practices held by fishers engaging directly with floodplain ecosystems. These knowledge systems and practices may be valuable tools for understanding ecosystems processes and related changes and developing local level responses to avert negative consequences of such changes. This may help in devising alternatives to ecosystem management and the conservation of floodplain fish habitats of Bangladesh and elsewhere in the world. This study was conducted in a natural depression (locally called beel) and its surrounding floodplain system located in north central Bangladesh which has become highly degraded. The results of the study indicate that the fishers and local users of the floodplain ecosystems are rich in local ecological knowledge concerning the hydrology of the floodplains and small lakes, the habitat preferences of fish, the role of agricultural crops on fish habitats, and the impact of habitat human interventions in aquatic ecosystems. Given the apparent inadequacy of the present management regime, this article argues for an inclusion of local knowledge and practices into habitat management as a more holistic approach to floodplain habitat restoration and conservation that encourages multi-level cooperation and which builds on diversified knowledge systems. 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aaquaculture 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aaquatic habitat 3acrops 3aecosystem management 3afish 3afloodplains 3afreshwater fisheries 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitat preferences 3ahumans 3ahydraulic structures 3ahydrology 3alakes 2aAnimals 2aBiodiversity 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxeconomicsxmethods. 2aCooperative Behavior 2aEcosystem 2aFisheries 2aFishesxgrowth & development 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSocial Values 3aBangladesh 0aBangladesh 0aFishers 0aHabitat degradation 0aLocal ecological knowledge 0aLocal practices 0aSanctuaries0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.922-938dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9464-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02127naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002300186245018400209300001800393520093600411650001301347650001601360653003801376653001501414653001101429653001101440700002201451700002401473700002301497773010501520852000901625856008501634930003301719946001301752655001201765IND4437482920221118064640.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443748292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11095-010-0113-y2doi7 aPMC38830522pmcid7 a203729952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDominiak, Kristin 10aCritical Need for Clinical Trials: An Example of a Pilot Human Intervention Trial of a Mixture of Natural Agents Protecting Lymphocytes Against TNF-α Induced Activation of NF-κB  ap. 1061-1065.  aHumans typically consume “natural agents” that are believed to be chemoprotective and are known to decrease inflammation biomarker NF-κB in vitro; however, no intervention studies in humans have been done to date. This commentary documents the in vivo results as a powerful example for supporting the superiority of a complex mixture of natural agents. Human volunteers consumed two 500 mg capsules (BID) containing a mixture of natural agents for a period of 2 weeks, and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. The purified lymphocytes were subjected to ex-vivo exposure to TNF-α or kept as untreated control. The mean NF-κB DNA binding activity was increased upon TNF-α treatment in pre-intervention samples; however, TNF-α was unable to induce NF-κB in post-intervention samples, suggesting that the mixture of four important natural agents could be useful to protect humans against oxidative stress. 3acurcumin 3aresveratrol 0aepigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) 0aisoflavone 0aNF-κB 0aTNF-α1 aMcKinney, Jaclyn 1 aHeilbrun, Lance K. 1 aSarkar, Fazlul H. 0 tPharmaceutical research.g2010 June, v. 27, no. 6 p.1061-1065dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-010-0113-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01021naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143072001700161100001800178245003500196300001600231520021400247650003700461650001100498773011600509852000900625856005700634930003300691945000800724946001100732655001200743991628418650742620221118064652.0720401e197109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7290292262DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1971.tb00192.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Rainfall was measured by an accumulating gauge and, at a nearby station, the number of rainy days recorded. Annually recurrent floral cycles were displayed by only ten species. In these and in 11 additional species, foliar cycles were also circannual. Gregarious flowering, apparently in response to drought, occurred in many species in 1963 and 1968. In other years, interspecific differences in periodicity maintained a minimal incidence of flowering at 44%, and fruiting at 27% of species in the sample. Despite specific variations in phenology, the community as a whole exhibited regular seasonality, with single annual peaks of flowering and fruiting and a double peak of leaf production. 3aMalaysia0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1972 June, v. 4, no. 2 p.117-146wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1972.tb00692.x  a00000000b19730201c00000000  aIND 7aarticle02793naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245006400183300001800247500001500265520104900280650001101329650001101340650001901351650002101370650002001391650001901411650001601430650002701446650008501473650006801558650002601626650002601652650002401678650001101702650001201713650001701725650002301742650008701765650001201852651001001864651001001874653001601884653001901900653001801919700001901937700002001956773011101976852000902087856008502096930003302181946001302214655001202227IND4437478420221118064757.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443747842DNAL7 a202290672pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9461-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenció, Anna 10aAnalyzing Hydrological Sustainability Through Water Balance  ap. 1175-1190.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) is to assist in the development of management plans that will lead to the sustainable use of water resources in all EU member states. However, defining the degree of sustainability aimed at is not a straightforward task. It requires detailed knowledge of the hydrogeological characteristics of the basin in question, its environmental needs, the amount of human water demand, and the opportunity to construct a proper water balance that describes the behavior of the hydrological system and estimates available water resources. An analysis of the water balance in the Selva basin (Girona, NE Spain) points to the importance of regional groundwater fluxes in satisfying current exploitation rates, and shows that regional scale approaches are often necessary to evaluate water availability. In addition, we discuss the pressures on water resources, and analyze potential actions, based on the water balance results, directed towards achieving sustainable water management in the basin. 3abasins 3ahumans 3awater analysis 3awater management 3awater resources 3aEuropean Union 3agroundwater 2aAgriculturexstandards 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethodsxtrends. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethods. 2aGeological Phenomena. 2aGovernment Regulation 2aIndustryxstandards 2aRivers 2aSeasons 2aUrbanization 2aWater Purification 2aWater Supplyxlegislation & jurisprudencexstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aWeather 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aSelva basin 0aSustainability 0awater balance1 aFolch, Albert 1 aMas-Pla, Josep 0 tEnvironmental management.g2010 May, v. 45, no. 5 p.1175-1190dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0364-152X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-010-9461-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01897naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245006300170300001600233500015200249500001500401520063500416650001501051650001401066650002301080650001901103650002201122650002301144653002301167653002301190653001601213653001001229653002301239773011401262852000901376856005701385930003301442945001301475946001101488655001201499IND2039771920221118064701.0940524e199401  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203977192DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1994.tb00952.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiscock, K.10aMarine communities at Lundy--origins, longevity and change  ap. 183-188.  aPaper presented at the "Workshop on Evolution and Change in the Bristol Channel and Severn Estuary," April 12-16, 1989, Nettlecombe Court, England.  a2019-12-05  aThe rich marine communities around Lundy, which include several species rarely encountered as far north as Britain, together with the isolated position of the island, led to its establishment as Britain's first statutory Marine Nature Reserve. Management of the reserve depends, in part, on knowledge about recruitment and longevity in the species of conservation importance. Preliminary results suggest many of the most interesting species are very long-lived, but recruit intermittently. Overall trends in their abundance are downwards. Whether this is part of a long-term pattern or a temporary downturn requires further study. 3amacroalgae 3alongevity 3amarine environment 3amarine science 3acommunity ecology 3aconservation areas 0asouth west england 0anorthwest atlantic 0arecruitment 0aalgae 0aalgae and seaweeds0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1994 , v. 51, no. 1/2 p.183-188wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1994.tb00952.x  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04759naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245014500191300001600336500001500352520251400367650001702881650001202898650005202910650003802962650005103000650006303051650006803114650004703182650004803229650002403277650001103301650005703312650000903369650002403378650001503402650005003417650003103467650004803498650002503546650003703571650003703608653001703645653001603662653000903678653001603687653001003703653002403713700002303737700002203760700002403782700002303806700002103829773013103850852000903981856008503990930003304075946001304108655001204121IND4437475520221118064709.0100522e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443747552DNAL7 a199045372pmid7 a10.1007/s00280-009-1160-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujimoto-Ouchi, Kaori 10aPreclinical study of prolonged administration of trastuzumab as combination therapy after disease progression during trastuzumab monotherapy  ap. 269-276.  a2019-12-04  aPurpose The clinical relevance of prolonged trastuzumab administration in combination therapy beyond progressive disease (PD) has been suggested. Here, we examined whether trastuzumab treatment is effective in combination after failing to show antitumor activity as monotherapy in HER2-positive human breast cancer xenograft models. Methods We established trastuzumab PD models with HER2-positive breast cancer xenograft models and compared the antitumor activity of trastuzumab in combination with a taxane versus monotherapy with a taxane in the models subsequent to tumor progression under trastuzumab monotherapy. Results We established trastuzumab PD model using the HER2-positive human breast cancer line MDA-MB-361 and KPL-4 in in vivo. In these models, trastuzumab at the same dose as the initial treatment showed no significant antitumor activity at 3 weeks after start of treatment. Re-inoculated tumor tissues showing PD regained sensitivity to trastuzumab. In the trastuzumab PD models, the HER2 status of the tumor tissues did not decrease. Also, the pAKT level continued to decrease, as with the initial treatment, and IGF-1R was not found to be up-regulated. Instead, differences were observed in the gene-expression profiles of the tumor tissues showing PD. Trastuzumab in combination with G-CSF, which is expected to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), showed significant antitumor activity, even though the single agents alone showed no antitumor activity in the PD model. In the MDA-MB-361 trastuzumab PD model, the combination of trastuzumab with paclitaxel showed significantly more potent antitumor activity compared with paclitaxel or docetaxel monotherapy. In the KPL-4 trastuzumab PD model as well, trastuzumab showed significant antitumor activity in combination with taxanes or capecitabine after PD had developed in response to trastuzumab monotherapy. Conclusion We established in vivo trastuzumab PD models, in which trastuzumab monotherapy ceases to have antitumor activity during the treatment. The mechanisms of PD with trastuzumab are considered to involve both reversible changes in the gene expression profiles in tumor tissues and a decrease of ADCC activity in the host. Our present results demonstrated that trastuzumab showed antitumor activity in combination with taxanes or capecitabine even though it showed no antitumor activity as a monotherapy, suggesting a clinical relevance of treatment with trastuzumab as a combination therapy beyond PD. 3adrug therapy 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxadministration & dosage 2aAntibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxadministration & dosage 2aAntineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocolsxtherapeutic use 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxpathology. 2aColony-Stimulating Factorsxtherapeutic use 2aDisease Progression 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Nude 2aOncogene Protein v-aktxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aReceptor, ErbB-2xgenetics 2aReceptor, IGF Type 1xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteins 2aTaxoidsxadministration & dosage 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays 0achemotherapy 0aTrastuzumab 0aADCC 0aCombination 0aG-CSF 0aProgressive disease1 aSekiguchi, Fumiko 1 aYamamoto, Kaname 1 aShirane, Masatoshi 1 aYamashita, Yoriko 1 aMori, Kazushige 0 tCancer chemotherapy and pharmacology.g2010 July, v. 66, no. 2 p.269-276dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0344-57047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00280-009-1160-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100522b20100605c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02149naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009900172300001600271520091800287650002501205650002201230650002201252650001301274650001101287650001401298650001401312650001401326650004701340650001301387650001101400650001401411650002101425700001601446700001801462773008901480852000901569856009201578930003301670945001301703946001101716655001201727IND2205500220221118064637.0000628e199911  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220550022DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00922.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGatesoupe, F.J.10aPathogenicity of Vibrio splendidus strains associated with turbot larvae, Scophthalmus maximus  ap. 757-763.  aTurbot larvae were challenged with eight strains of Vibrio splendidus isolated from diseased larvae, plus a ninth strain pathogenic to scallop larvae (A515; Nicolas et al. 1996). Six strains caused heavy mortality but the scallop pathogen and the other two strains did not. All the strains shared a large number of phenotypic traits, and an attempt was made to relate virulence to genotype and phenotype. Five of the six pathogenic strains were very similar, as shown by RAPD fingerprinting and phenotypic characteristics. The relatedness of the other strains was intermediate between the main pathogenic group and V. splendidus ATCC 33125, but the DNA-DNA homology between the pathogenic group and the reference strain was still high (78% of reassociation rate). The non-pathogenic isolates may be a useful tool for determining the possible virulence factors, as all the isolates differed by few characteristics. 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aVibrio splendidus 3aavirulent strains 3agenotype 3alarvae 3amortality 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascallops 3aturbot 3avirulence 3avirulent strains1 aLambert, C.1 aNicolas, J.L.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1999 Nov., v. 87, no. 5 p.757-763x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00922.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02452naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013500167300001600302520094200318650002701260650001501287650001201302650001601314650001801330650001301348650002801361650001201389650001301401650003901414650003001453650001401483650002101497653004501518653004301563700001601606700001901622700002001641700001801661700001401679700001801693773008901711852000901800856009201809930003301901945001301934946001101947655001201958IND2205497520221118064648.0000628e199911  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220549752DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00863.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorcar, M.10aIdentification and characterization of the new Bacillus thuringiensis serovars pirenaica (serotype H57) and iberica (serotype H59)  ap. 640-648.  aTwo new Bacillus thuringiensis strains have been classified by the H antigen of the cells and differentiated by their morphological biochemical and molecular characteristics.

Further characterization of these strains, by means of SDS-PAGE, Western inmunodetection, plasmid profile and cry-gene identification by polymerase chain reaction, confirmed the originality of the two novel serotypes. Toxicity tests carried out against several insect species belonging to the orders Lepidoptera, Diptera and Coleoptera showed no detectable insecticidal activity for either of the B. thuringiensis strains. 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aColeoptera 3aDiptera 3aLepidoptera 3aagglutination 3aantigens 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsects 3aplasmids 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aserotypes 3atoxicity testing 0abacillus thuringiensis serovar pirenaica 0abacillus thuringiensis sevovar iberica1 aIriarte, J.1 aDumanoir, V.C.1 aFerrandis, M.D.1 aLecadet, M.M.1 aFerre, J.1 aCaballero, P.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g1999 Nov., v. 87, no. 5 p.640-648x1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2672.1999.00863.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03998naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245010500184300001800289520182500307650002702132650001702159650002502176650002602201650002102227650001502248650002302263650001502286650003502301650001102336650003302347650001602380650001902396650002402415650001902439650001202458650002302470650001702493650011702510650002902627650001102656650002602667650001102693650002002704650000902724650001502733650001802748650001902766650003202785650003002817650002602847650001702873651001002890651001002900653003002910653002802940653002302968653003002991700001603021773011103037852000903148856008503157930003303242946001303275655001203288IND4437477520221118064751.0100522e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443747752DNAL7 a203548522pmid7 a10.1007/s00267-010-9478-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wendy Y. 10aResident Motivations and Willingness-to-Pay for Urban Biodiversity Conservation in Guangzhou (China)  ap. 1052-1064.  aThe monetary assessment of biodiversity measures the welfare damages brought by biodiversity losses and the cost-benefit analysis of conservation projects in a socio-economic context. The contingent valuation method could include motivational factors to strengthen economic analysis of nature conservation. This study analyzed Guangzhou residents' motivations and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for an urban biodiversity conservation program in the National Baiyun Mountain Scenic Area (BMSA). The peri-urban natural site, offering refuge to some endemic species, is under increasing development pressures for recreational and residential use. A questionnaire survey was conducted in the Guangzhou metropolitan area during June to October 2007. We interviewed face-to-face 720 stratified sampled households to probe residents' attitudes towards the city's environmental issues, motivations for urban nature conservation, and WTP for biodiversity conservation. Principal component analysis identified five motivational factors, including environmental benefit, ecological diversity, nature-culture interaction, landscape-recreation function, and intergenerational sustainability, which illustrated the general economic values of urban nature. Logistic regression was applied to predict the probability of people being willing to pay for the urban biodiversity conservation in BMSA. The significant predictors of WTP included household income and the factor nature-culture interaction. The median WTP estimated RMB149/household (about US$19.5/household) per year and an aggregate of RMB291 million (approximately US$38.2 million) annually to support the urban conservation project. Including public motivations into contingent valuation presents a promising approach to conduct cost-benefit analysis of public projects in China. 3aattitudes and opinions 3abiodiversity 3acontingent valuation 3acost benefit analysis 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3aindigenous species 3amotivation 3anatural resources conservation 3apeople 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprobability 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asocioeconomics 3asurveys 3awillingness to pay 2aBiodiversity 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxeconomicsxlegislation & jurisprudencexmethodsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFemale 2aFinancing, Government 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aMotivation 2aPolicy Making 2aPublic Opinion 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aResidence Characteristics 2aSocioeconomic Factors 2aUrbanization 3aChina 0aChina 0aBiodiversity conservation 0aConservation motivation 0aUrban natural area 0aUrban nature conservation1 aJim, C.

The most primitive members of both families are idiobiont ectoparasitoids of hosts concealed in plant tissue. Idiobiont ectoparasitic braconids are all still primarily associated with such hosts, but idiobiont ectoparasitic ichneumonids have radiated to attack hosts in other situations, such as in aculeate nests or in cocoons. A shift in emphasis between the behavioural steps, host habitat location and host location, is envisaged as being important in such evolutionary change. Idiobiont endoparasitism is postulated as having arisen amongst ectoparasitoids attacking cocooned hosts, as an adaptation that allows them to exploit pupae and puparia in relatively exposed positions; it is a fairly common strategy in the Ichneumonidae, but virtually unknown in the Braconidae. Koinobiosis is perceived as having evolved in association with hosts which feed in a relatively weakly concealed position, but pupate in a more secluded and safe location. The strategy is advantageous as it allows a parasitoid to oviposit on an easily discoverable host, but to use the host's pupation concealment to complete its own development. The evolution of koinobiosis has allowed parasitoids to exploit hosts that feed in exposed positions, and to attack hosts at a younger and numerically more common stage in the host's life cycle. Koinobiont ectoparasitism is envisaged, in some braconid and ichneumonid groups, to occupy an evolutionary transitional position between idiobiosis and endoparasitic koinobiosis; only in the Ichneumonidae have large radiations of koinobiont ectoparasitoids occurred. Endoparasitic koinobiosis is hypothesized as having arisen in the Braconidae in association with lepidopterous/coleopterous hosts, whilst in the major lineage of endoparasitic koinobiont ichneumonids, this habit is hypothesized as having arisen in association with symphytan hosts. The great majority of braconids are koinobiont endoparasitoids, but only about 50% of the Ichneumonidae have this habit. Very few koinobiont braconids develop as endoparasitoids of hymenopterous hosts, although many endoparasitic ichneumonids attack Hymenoptera. However, lineages of the Braconidae have radiated to exploit adult insects and exopterygote nymphs; ichneumonids do not utilize such hosts. 3aparasitism 3aparasites 3aHymenoptera 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aphylogeny 0aevolution 0aparasites of insect pests 0aecology0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1988 Dec., v. 35, no. 4 p.351-377wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1988.tb00476.x  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02498naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010900168300001600277520105900293650001401352650002501366650002901391650001501420650001201435650001901447650001001466650001401476650001201490650001201502650002301514650001701537650001301554650001201567650001501579650001301594650000701607650001601614650001101630651001901641653002501660700002601685700002301711773012001734852000901854856008501863930003301948946001101981655001201992IND4426854720221118064728.0091002e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442685472DNAL7 a10.1007/s10811-008-9384-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdams, Jessica M. 10aFermentation study on Saccharina latissima for bioethanol production considering variable pre-treatments  ap. 569-574.  aClimate change, fuel security and economics are creating a requirement for alternative, renewable fuels. Bioethanol is currently produced from land-based crops but in future marine biomass could be used as an alternative biomass source for bioethanol production. Macroalgae such as Laminaria spp. grow in abundance around the United Kingdom, reaching >4 m in length and containing up to 55% dry weight of the carbohydrates laminarin and mannitol. Using enzymes, these can be hydrolysed and converted to glucose and fructose, which in turn can be utilised by yeasts to produce ethanol. In previous studies on ethanol production from macroalgae, pre-treatment was at 65°C, pH 2 for 1 h prior to fermentation. This paper shows that these pre-treatments are not required for the fermentations conducted, with higher ethanol yields being achieved in untreated fermentations than in those with altered pH or temperature pre-treatments. This result was seen in fresh and defrosted macroalgae samples using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 1 U kg⁻¹ laminarinase. 3aLaminaria 3aSaccharina latissima 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3aclimate change 3acrops 3aeconomics 3aenzymes 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afructose 3aglucose 3amacroalgae 3amannitol 3apH 3atemperature 3ayeasts 3aUnited Kingdom 0aSaccharina latissima1 aGallagher, Joseph A. 1 aDonnison, Iain S. 0 tJournal of applied phycology.g2009 Oct., v. 21, no. 5 p.569-574dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0921-89717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10811-008-9384-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20091002b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02474naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245011600166300001800282520147600300653002201776653001201798653002201810653002301832700001901855700001701874700001701891773010701908852000902015856009202024930003302116946001102149655001202160IND4395829820221118064602.0071007e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439582982DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01492.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, J.10aInteractions between mature Der p 1 and its free prodomain indicate membership of a new family of C1 peptidases  ap. 1302-1309.  aStudies in vivo have shown that the cysteine peptidase activity of group 1 house dust mite allergens contributes to their allergenicity. These allergens are synthesized initially as proenzymes and removal of the propiece is necessary to unmask their proteolytic activity. In related C1 family cysteine peptidases of enzyme clan CA, liberated propieces continue to inhibit the mature peptidase as tight binding inhibitors. As it is not known whether mite peptidase allergens behave similarly, our objective was to investigate the effect of the Der p 1 propiece on the catalytic activity of Der p 1 and Der f 1. Enzymatic activity of natural Der p 1 and Der f 1 was assessed using a specific substrate and the effect of the recombinant propiece on its enzyme kinetics defined. The integrity of the propiece during these interactions was studied functionally and by analysis of the reaction mixtures. Der p 1 propiece was a potent competitive inhibitor of Der p 1 and Der f 1. In contrast to other cysteine peptidase prodomains, which are cognate tight binding inhibitors, the Der p 1 propiece behaves as a substrate and is fully degraded during this interaction. Mature Der p 1-prodomain interactions differ from other C1 family cysteine peptidases, suggesting that group 1 mite allergens are a new subgroup among C1 family cysteine peptidases. The rapid inactivation of Der p 1 prodomain is a newly identified mechanism that may contribute to the potency of this allergen. 0acysteine protease 0aDer p 1 0adust mite allergy 0apeptidase allergen1 aHamilton, J.M.1 aGarrod, D.R.1 aRobinson, C.0 tAllergy.g2007 Nov., v. 62, no. 11 p.1302-1309dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01492.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071007b20071102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02775naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245009600172300001800268520166400286651001001950653000901960653002001969653002201989653002102011700001602032700001802048700001602066700001702082700001602099700001702115700001702132773010702149852000902256856009202265930003302357946001102390655001202401IND4393779020221118064624.0070805e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439377902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01470.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntonicelli, L.10aRelationship between ARIA classification and drug treatment in allergic rhinitis and asthma  ap. 1064-1070.  aThe Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) guidelines provide a stepwise treatment to rhinitis, which classifies the disease according to its duration and severity. The aim of the study was to verify whether these variables influence drug prescriptions for rhinitis and asthma. A multi-centre cross-sectional pharmaco-epidemiological survey was carried out on 1610 allergic rhinitis patients and the relationship between the clinical features of rhinitis and drug therapy for rhinitis and asthma was evaluated. A total of 1321 adult patients were enrolled. Mild intermittent rhinitis was diagnosed in 7.7%of the patients, moderate/severe intermittent in 17.1%, mild persistent in 11.6%, and moderate/severe persistent in 63.6%. A high level of rhinitis-asthma comorbidity (616/1321 = 46.6%) was found. The majority of patients [1060 (80.24%)] were treated. Significant associations between the severity of rhinitis and the presence of therapy (P = 0.008), the use of oral antihistamines (P < 0.001), topical nasal steroids (P = 0.020) and systemic steroids (P = 0.005) were found. A weak association was found between the features of rhinitis and the therapy for asthma, and vice versa the comorbidity with asthma increases the prescription of inhalant (P < 0.001) and oral steroids (P = 0.015) to treat rhinitis. The severity of rhinitis influences patient request for rhinitis therapy and the type of medication more than the duration. These features of rhinitis seem to poorly influence asthma therapy. As the ARIA classification is able to reveal a relevant impairment notwithstanding therapy, its role in treated patients merits further study. 3aItaly 0aARIA 0aallergic asthma 0aallergic rhinitis 0arhinitis therapy1 aMicucci, C.1 aVoltolini, S.1 aSenna, G.E.1 aDi Blasi, P.1 aVisonà, G.1 aDe Marco, R.1 aBonifazi, F.0 tAllergy.g2007 Sept., v. 62, no. 9 p.1064-1070dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-45387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01470.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070805b20070902c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02750naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245011100167300001600278520168800294653001801982653003602000653001902036653002202055653003502077653003002112700001402142700001302156773011002169852000902279856009202288930003302380946001102413655001202424IND4420475820221118064533.0090515e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442047582DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2303.2008.00556.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, D.E.10aCytomorphological changes after ultrasound-guided percutaneous ethanol injection in benign thyroid nodules  ap. 183-187.  aTo characterize the cytomorphological changes after percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) in benign thyroid nodules, we compared the cytological features of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) samples before and after PEI. Fifty-five cases diagnosed with adenomatous goitre (group 1, 35 cases) or cystic changes only (group 2, 20 cases) were included. In all cases, FNACs were performed by the pathologists before and after PEI. PEI was performed in all cases by a diagnostic radiologist according to the ultrasound guidelines. The following cytological features were evaluated by two pathologists: cellularity of follicular epithelial cells, background, cellular pleomorphism, nuclear/cytoplasmic (N/C) ratio, chromatin pattern, presence of nucleoli, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and mitosis. In group 1, 19 cases (54%) showed changes in cellularity after PEI, with reduced cellularity in 13 cases (37%) and increased cellularity in six cases (17%). No necrotic background was observed before PEI; however, 14 cases (40%) developed necrotic background after PEI (P < 0.0001). Multinucleated giant cells were observed in 18 cases (51%) after PEI, which is in contrast to four cases (11%) before PEI (P = 0.001). In group 2, necrotic background was seen in 11 cases (55%, P < 0.0001) and multinucleated giant cells were observed in four cases (20%) after PEI. Necrotic background and presence of multinucleated giant cells are indicative of tissue damage caused by PEI in the FNAC specimens of benign thyroid nodules. In contrast to other modalities including chemotherapy or radiation treatment for malignant tumour, no unusual cytological change is observed after PEI. 0acytodiagnosis 0afine needle aspiration cytology 0athyroid nodule 0aultrasound-guided 0apercutaneous ethanol injection 0acytomorphological changes1 aKim, Y.M.1 aGong, G.0 tCytopathology.g2009 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.183-187dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0956-55077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2303.2008.00556.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090515b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02902naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245016000167300001600327520159400343650002001937650001101957650001201968650002501980650001302005650001502018650001502033650002102048650001102069650001102080650001002091650002502101651001002126651001802136653001002154700002402164700001902188773012302207852000902330856008502339930003302424946001102457655001202468IND4437488020221118064603.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443748802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11273-010-9174-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsumba, J.

Above-ground papyrus biomass was determined. Biomass varied with site. Site had no effect on regeneration potential, but monthly harvesting reduced papyrus biomass regeneration potential among sites. However, seasonal (6-monthly) harvesting did not appear to affect papyrus biomass regeneration potential. Exponential and polynomial trend analyses revealed a consistent downward trend for monthly harvest biomass, and the polynomial trend was more linear (F = 97.913; P < 0.001) than periodic (F = 9.617; P < 0.05). The polynomial trend scenario indicated how papyrus biological dynamics are likely to behave as monthly harvests are repeated. This suggests that regeneration potential is significantly reduced with successive monthly harvest, leading to weak spatial connectivity, papyrus stand fragmentation, and increased landscape patchiness. A 6-month harvest regime can be established to regenerate more biomass between harvests than is currently the case, with positive implications for wetland conservation and carbon sequestration. Papyrus harvesters can be kept off the swamps by establishing a riparian buffer zone of agro forestry trees and shrubs which can substitute for the papyrus as it is left to mature. However, while the information presented is useful for papyrus wetland management strategies, it is recognized that the study period was too short to permit a generalized recommendation. 3aCyperus papyrus 3abasins 3abiomass 3acarbon sequestration 3aforestry 3aharvesting 3alandscapes 3ariparian buffers 3ashrubs 3aswamps 3atrees 3awetland conservation 3aKenya 3aLake Victoria 0aWinam1 aOkeyo-Owuor, J.

Typically, grapevine breeders use midwinter bud hardiness measures as the descriptive phenotype for cold tolerance. Historical practices of bud cutting and more modern day differential thermal analysis of low temperature exotherms allows for an accurate, quantitative measure of bud hardiness. In our recent studies we have examined the relationship between cold hardiness and dormancy requirements, and our results preliminarily suggest a geographic pattern associated with dormant tissue temperature response and midwinter hardiness in Vitis riparia. The data presented here represent two years of hardiness measures for different Vitis riparia and Vitis vinifera genotypes. 3aVitis riparia 3aVitis vinifera 3abreeding 3aclimate 3acold tolerance 3acultivars 3acutting 3adormancy 3agenotype 3aphenotype 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3awinter1 aMartinson, T.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Apr. 30, , no. 1082 p.299-304dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1082.41  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245013000187300001600317500002400333500001500357520130000372650002201672650001701694650003301711650002601744650001701770650002201787650002101809650001601830650003001846650003101876650002501907650002101932650002101953650003001974650001402004650001002018650004202028650005602070650002202126650003302148650003302181653002702214700001502241700001802256773009202274852000902366856004802375655001202423IND4393036320221118064640.0070715e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439303632DNAL7 a171861402pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-006-9181-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDanielsson, Jesper10aProtection of Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus) Toward Fungal Pathogens by Strains of Plant-associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens  ap. 134-140.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn this report, four Bacillus strains were tested for effects on plant fitness and disease protection of oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The strains belonged to newly discovered plant-associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and a recently proposed species, Bacillus endophyticus. The fungal pathogens tested represented different infection strategies and included Alternaria brassicae, Botrytis cinerea, Leptosphaeria maculans, and Verticillium longisporum. The B. amyloliquefaciens strains showed no or a weak plant growth promoting activity, whereas the B. endophyticus strain had negative effects on the plant as revealed by phenological analysis. On the other hand, two of the B. amyloliquefaciens strains conferred protection of oilseed rape toward all pathogens tested. In vitro experiments studying the effects of Bacillus exudates on fungal growth showed clear growth inhibition in several but not all cases. The protective effects of Bacillus can therefore, at least in part, be explained by production of antibiotic substances, but other mechanisms must also be involved probably as a result of intricate plant-bacteria interaction. The protective effects observed for certain Bacillus strains make them highly interesting for further studies as biocontrol agents in Brassica cultivation. 3aprotective effect 3aplant growth 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aBacillus endophyticus 3aVerticillium 3aPlenodomus lingam 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aantibiotics 3abiological control agents 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aAlternaria brassicae 3amicrobial growth 3ain vitro studies 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3apathogens 3afungi 2aBacillusxclassificationxphysiology. 2aBrassica napusxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aFungixphysiology 2aImmunity, Innatexphysiology 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 0aLeptosphaeria maculans1 aReva, Oleg1 aMeijer, Johan0 tMicrobial ecology.g2007 July, v. 54, no. 1 p.134-140dSpringer-Verlagx0095-36287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-006-9181-2 7aarticle04116naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245017000176300001600346500002400362520207600386650001002462650002302472650000902495650002802504650000902532650001602541650002702557650001602584650001002600650001302610650001902623650004402642650001702686650002302703650001702726650002002743650001102763650001102774650001802785650002602803650004702829650001202876650003502888650003302923650002102956650003102977650001803008650000903026650002003035650003003055650002403085700001703109700002003126700001803146700001803164700001603182700001703198773013703215852000903352856008103361655001203442IND4449793520221118064704.0110225e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444979352DNAL7 a210976872pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2010-31872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, B.D.10aEffects of high-oil corn on feedlot performance, carcass characteristics, fatty acid profiles, beef palatability, and retail case life traits of beef top loin steaks  ap. 809-816.  aIncludes references  aOur objective was to compare the effects of feeding steam-flaked, high-oil corn with normal steam-flaked corn to which yellow grease was added to equalize dietary fat on performance and carcass characteristics of finishing beef steers, and palatability, retail case life, and fatty acid composition of strip loins. Angus steers (n = 120; initial BW = 288 kg) were allotted to dietary treatments consisting of 1) normal mill-run, steam-flaked corn plus added fat (NMR) or 2) high-oil, steam-flaked corn (HOC) and assigned randomly to pens (12 pens/treatment with 5 steers/pen). Performance (ADG, DMI, and G:F) was measured over time, and cattle were shipped to a commercial abattoir for collection of carcass data after 165 d on feed. Carcass data were collected at 48 h postmortem on all carcasses, and 2 carcasses from each pen were selected randomly for collection of strip loins (IMPS #180A). At 14 d postmortem, 4 steaks (2.54 cm thick) were removed for retail display, trained sensory panel analysis, Warner-Bratzler shear force determination, and fatty acid analysis. Daily BW gain was greater (P = 0.03) and G:F was increased 8.4% (P = 0.01) for steers fed NMR compared with HOC, but DMI was not affected (P > 0.10) by treatment. No treatment differences were observed (P > 0.10) for HCW, 12th-rib fat, KPH, and yield grade. Marbling scores were greater (P = 0.01) for NMR than for HOC, and LM area tended (P = 0.07) to be greater in NMR than in HOC carcasses. The proportion of carcasses grading USDA Choice did not differ (P = 0.77) between treatments, but a greater (P = 0.04) proportion of carcasses graded in the upper two-thirds of Choice for NMR vs. HOC. Trained sensory panel traits and Warner-Bratzler shear force values did not differ between treatments (P > 0.10), and no differences (P > 0.10) were detected for purge loss or fatty acid composition. Overall, ADG and G:F were less and marbling score was decreased, but there were no differences between treatments in beef palatability, retail case life, or concentrations of fatty acids in strip loins. 3aAngus 3aanimal performance 3abeef 3acarcass characteristics 3acorn 3adietary fat 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3aloins 3amarbling 3ameat carcasses 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apalatability 3asensory evaluation 3ashear stress 3aslaughterhouses 3asteaks 3asteers 3ayellow grease 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aCattlexgrowth & development 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Fatsxpharmacology 2aFood Handling 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects 2aZea maysxchemistry1 aGarmyn, A.J.1 aDerington, H.M.1 aGalyean, M.L.1 aJackson, S.P.1 aSmith, S.B.1 aMiller, M.F.0 tJournal of animal science.g2011 Mar., v. 89, no. 3 p.809-816dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2010-31873Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03708naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001300164245011200177300001600289500002400305500001500329520147400344650001901818650000901837650001201846650001001858650002601868650001501894650001401909650001801923650002101941650002601962650002701988650001902015650001202034650001202046650005002058650004602108650008002154650003802234650002402272650004602296650002802342650005702370650003902427650006602466650002902532650007802561650003802639651001002677651001002687653001302697700001702710700001202727700001402739700001502753700001502768700001202783700001902795700001402814700001402828773009902842852000902941856004802950655001202998IND4458220320221118064706.0110520e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445822032DNAL7 a209493172pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-010-9449-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Hui10aEnhanced yield performance of Bt rice under target-insect attacks: implications for field insect management  ap. 655-664.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe rapid development of transgenic biotechnology has greatly promoted the breeding of genetically engineered (GE) rice in China, and many GE rice lines are in the pipeline for commercialization. To understand field performances of GE rice, key agronomic traits of two insect-resistant Bt rice lines that have been granted biosafety certificates for commercial production in China were evaluated together with their nontransgenic counterparts under environmental conditions with significant differences in insect pressure. Results from the experiments showed enhanced field performances of the Bt GE rice lines compared with the non-GE counterparts for yield-related traits such as number of panicles and filled seeds per plant, under environmental conditions with no insecticide application. No detectable underlying cost of the Bt transgene was observed in the two insect-resistant GE rice lines, particularly in the GE hybrid rice line. Results further indicated significantly greater yield performances of the two insect-resistant GE rice lines under environmental conditions with non-target insect control compared with no insect control. It is concluded from this study that insect-resistant Bt GE rice, particularly the hybrid line, has great potential to maintain its high yield when ambient insect pressure is high. In addition, proper application of insecticides to control non-target insects will guarantee optimal performance of insect-resistant Bt GE rice. 3ainflorescences 3arice 3ahybrids 3aseeds 3apesticide application 3atransgenes 3abiosafety 3abiotechnology 3aagronomic traits 3aenvironmental factors 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3ainsect control 3ainsects 2aAnimals 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCrops, Agriculturalxeconomicsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aEndotoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Engineering 2aHemolysin Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticidesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aInsectaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aOryzaxeconomicsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTransgenesxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aChina 0aChina 0abreeding1 aLu, Bao-Rong1 aXu, Kai1 aWang, Wei1 aYang, Xiao1 aYang, Chao1 aLuo, Ju1 aLai, Fengxiang1 aYe, Wenli1 aFu, Qiang0 tTransgenic research.g2011 June, v. 20, no. 3 p.655-664dSpringer Netherlandsx0962-88197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-010-9449-7 7aarticle02493naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245012400166300001600290500002400306520133400330650002301664650002201687650000901709650001601718650001201734650001401746650001701760650001001777650002201787650002601809650002001835650002501855650001001880700001701890700001601907773010801923852000902031856005502040655001202095IND4449200820221118064800.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444920082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2010.00772.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Y.-W.10aLong-term effects on sward composition and animal performance of reducing fertilizer inputs to upland permanent pasture  ap. 138-151.  aIncludes references  aThis study investigated the long-term effects on sward composition and animal performance of applying different fertilizer regimes to upland permanent pasture. The experiment, which was carried out in 2008, was based on a set of replicated (n = 3) plots that had been established in 1990. The effects of applying (i) N, P, K and lime, (ii) P and K plus lime and (iii) lime only were compared with a treatment that received no nutrient applications. Using a put-and-take stocking system, the plots were grazed to a target sward surface height of 4 cm by ewes and lambs from April to early August and by ewes only from August to mid-October. The long-term reduction in nutrient inputs had led to decreases in the percentages of both sown and unsown grass species within the sward (P < 0·05), and an increase in the percentage of mosses and litter (P < 0·05), with a corresponding reduction in nutritional value. Although there were no statistically significant treatment-related differences in lamb growth rates, lower fertilizer inputs were associated with a marked decline in stock carrying capacity and associated overall productivity during both the pre- and post-weaning periods (P < 0·001). The findings highlight the challenges faced when attempting to reconcile production and environmental objectives in upland systems. 3aanimal performance 3acarrying capacity 3aewes 3afertilizers 3agrasses 3ahighlands 3alambing rate 3alambs 3along term effects 3amosses and liverworts 3anutritive value 3apermanent grasslands 3asward1 aFraser, M.D.1 aEvans, J.G.0 tGrass and forage science.g2011 Mar., v. 66, no. 1 p.138-151dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2010.00772.x 7aarticle02624naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245015400166300001600320500002400336520152500360650001901885650001201904650001801916650000901934650002701943650001101970650001301981651002201994700001802016700001502034700001802049700001702067773011402084852000902198856005502207655001202262IND4393353220070802032530.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439335322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.00909.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, J.M.10aMicrosatellite variation among River Sturgeons of the genus Scaphirhynchus (Actinopterygii: Acipenseridae): a preliminary assessment of hybridization  ap. 304-312.  aIncludes references  aMicrosatellite variation from 13 disomic loci is reported for a total of 208 individuals of the genus Scaphirhynchus. This includes 105 individuals of the pallid sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus albus) from the lower Mississippi River, 11 pallid sturgeon from the Upper Mississippi and Missouri rivers, 65 shovelnose sturgeon (S. platorynchus) from the lower Mississippi River, six Alabama sturgeon (S. suttkusi), and 21 individuals of sturgeon identified as intermediate between S. albus and S. platorynchus. Results indicate that all five of the above population/species units are significantly differentiated from one another based on pairwise FST estimates. Locus Spl-7 was diagnostic for the Alabama sturgeon and serves to further differentiate this allopatric species from other Scaphirhynchus. Classification of genotypes with and without a priori designations failed to clearly delineate the species and intermediates in the latter case but was successful for the species but not in the intermediates in the former case. The presence of six unique alleles in five of the 21 morphologically 'intermediate' sturgeon examined requires additional evaluation but suggests that these individuals are possibly not the result of hybridization. We hope that raising these important issues will bring all stakeholders to the table to establish a concerted effort needed for both morphological and molecular analyses to adequately address the question of hybridization and the origin of the morphological variation in these fishes. 3aScaphirhynchus 3aalleles 3ahybridization 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats 3arivers 3asturgeon 3aMississippi River1 aDillman, C.B.1 aWood, R.M.1 aKuhajda, B.R.1 aMayden, R.L.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2007 Aug., v. 23, no. 4 p.304-312dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.00909.x 7aarticle04811naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002700179245009900206300001600305500002400321506007600345520235600421506003702777650001302814650002002827650001102847650001802858650001602876650001702892650001702909650001002926650003102936650001502967650001402982650001102996650002103007650001903028650001303047650001903060650001403079650001303093650001703106650001103123650001103134650002003145650002503165650001503190650001803205650006203223650004003285650003703325650001703362650004603379650004703425650004403472650004303516650004403559650003403603650002203637700002803659700002103687700003303708700002503741700001803766700002503784773010103809852000903910856007803919856003203997655001204029IND4394457320221207140336.0070826e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439445732DNAL7 a176840262pmid7 aPMC25336122pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcm1192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedondo-Gómez, Susana10aGrowth and Photosynthetic Responses to Salinity of the Salt-marsh Shrub Atriplex portulacoides  ap. 555-563.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS ATRIPLEX: (Halimione) portulacoides is a halophytic, C₃ shrub. It is virtually confined to coastal salt marshes, where it often dominates the vegetation. The aim of this study was to investigate its growth responses to salinity and the extent to which these could be explained by photosynthetic physiology. METHODS: The responses of young plants to salinity in the range 0-700 mol m⁻³ NaCl were investigated in a glasshouse experiment. The performance of plants was examined using classical growth analysis, measurements of gas exchange (infrared gas analysis), determination of chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics (modulated fluorimeter) and photosynthetic pigment concentrations; total ash, sodium, potassium and nitrogen concentrations, and relative water content were also determined. KEY RESULTS: Plants accumulated Na⁺ approximately in proportion to external salinity. Salt stimulated growth up to an external concentration of 200 mol m⁻³ NaCl and some growth was maintained at higher salinities. The main determinant of growth response to salinity was unit leaf rate. This was itself reflected in rates of CO₂ assimilation, which were not affected by 200 mol m⁻³ but were reduced at higher salinities. Reductions in net photosynthetic rate could be accounted for largely by lower stomatal conductance and intercellular CO₂ concentration. Apart from possible effects of osmotic shock at the beginning of the experiment, salinity did not have any adverse effect on photosystem II (PSII). Neither the quantum efficiency of PSII (ΦPSII) nor the chlorophyll fluorescence ratio (Fv/Fm) were reduced by salinity, and lower mid-day values recovered by dawn. Mid-day Fv/Fm was in fact depressed more at low external sodium concentration, by the end of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS: The growth responses of the hygro-halophyte A. portulacoides to salinity appear largely to depend on changes in its rate of photosynthetic gas exchange. Photosynthesis appears to be limited mainly through stomatal conductance and hence intercellular CO₂ concentration, rather than by effects on PSII; moderate salinity might stimulate carboxylation capacity. This is in contrast to more extreme halophytes, for which an ability to maintain leaf area can partially offset declining rates of carbon assimilation at high salinity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAtriplex 3aadverse effects 3acarbon 3acarboxylation 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3agases 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ahalophytes 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3anitrogen content 3aphotosystem II 3apigments 3aplant response 3apotassium 3asalinity 3asalt marshes 3ashrubs 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3astomatal conductance 3avegetation 3awater content 2aAtriplexxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aChlorophyllxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFluorescence 2aPhotosynthesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhotosystem II Protein Complexxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aMateos-Naranjo, Enrique1 aDavy, Anthony J.1 aFernández-Muñoz, Francisco1 aCastellanos, Eloy M.1 aLuque, Teresa1 aFigueroa, M.

Quantitative 31P NMR measurements of the increase of biphenolic hydroxyl groups formed after a series of alkaline degradations in the presence of hydrosulfide anions (kraft conditions) showed the presence of 3.7 dibenzodioxocin rings/100 C9 units in milled wood lignin. The DFRC degradation protocol (Derivatization Followed by Reductive Cleavage) was chosen as an independent means to estimate their abundance. Initial experiments with a dibenzodioxocin model compound, trans-6,7-dihydro-7-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-4, 9-dimethoxy-2,11-dipropyldibenzo[e,g]-[1,4] dioxocin-6-ylmethanol, showed that it is not cleaved under DFRC conditions, but rather it isomerizes into a cyclic oxepine structure. Steric effects precluded this isomerization from occurring when DFRC was applied to milled wood lignin. Instead, monoacetylated biphenolic moieties were released and quantified by 31P NMR, at 4.3 dibenzodioxocin rings/100 C9 units. The dibenzodioxocin content in residual lignins isolated from kraft pulps delignified to various degrees showed that during pulp delignification, the initial rate of dibenzodioxocin removal was considerably greater than the cleavage rate of arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether bonds. The activation energy for the degradation of dibenzodioxocins under kraft conditions in milled wood lignin was 96 +/- 9 kJ/mol, similar to that of arylglycerol-beta-aryl ether bond cleavage. 3achemical composition 3aphenylpropanoids 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3achemical reactions 3asoftwood 3akraft pulping 3alignin 3achemical structure 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aHeterocyclic Compoundsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aLigninxanalysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPhosphorus Radioisotopes 2aSulfidesxchemistry 2aThermodynamics 2aWood 0awood 0aphenolic compounds1 aJurasek, L.1 aKristofova, L.1 aXia, Z.1 aSun, Y.1 aPalus, E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 13, v. 50, no. 4 p.658-666x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010909g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03078naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245013600170300001600306520120500322650001301527650002201540650002001562650002701582650002101609650001301630650001201643650002101655650002301676650001601699650000901715650003001724650003701754650003101791650001501822650003501837650002401872650002001896650002501916650003301941650003801974650002902012650003802041650002602079651001102105651001002116651001102126651001002137700001602147700002302163700001802186773010302204852000902307856007702316930003302393945001302426946001302439655001202452IND2326935420221118064732.0020507e20020213dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232693542DNAL7 a118296362pmid7 a10.1021/jf01082582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakan, B.10aFungal growth and Fusarium mycotoxin content in isogenic traditional maize and genetically modified maize grown in France and Spain  ap. 728-731.  aFungi of the genus Fusarium are common fungal contaminants of maize and are also known to produce mycotoxins. Maize that has been genetically modified to express a Bt endotoxin has been used to study the effect of insect resistance on fungal infection of maize grains by Fusarium species and their related mycotoxins. Maize grain from Bt hybrids and near-isogenic traditional hybrids was collected in France and Spain from the 1999 crop, which was grown under natural conditions. According to the ergosterol level, the fungal biomass formed on Bt maize grain was 4-18 times lower than that on isogenic maize. Fumonisin B1 grain concentrations ranged from 0.05 to 0.3 ppm for Bt maize and from 0.4 to 9 ppm for isogenic maize. Moderate to low concentrations of trichothecenes and zearalenone were measured on transgenic as well as on non-transgenic maize. Nevertheless, significant differences were obtained in certain regions. The protection of maize plants against insect damage (European corn borer and pink stem borer) through the use of Bt technology seems to be a way to reduce the contamination of maize by Fusarium species and the resultant fumonisins in maize grain grown in France and Spain. 3aZea mays 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3abacterial toxins 3aFusarium 3abiomass 3aline differences 3afood contamination 3azearalenone 3acorn 3afungal diseases of plants 2aBacillus thuringiensisxgenetics 2aCarboxylic Acidsxanalysis 2aFumonisins 2aFusariumxgrowth & development 2aGenetic Engineering 2aInsect Proteins 2aMycotoxinsxanalysis 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgenetics 2aTrichothecenesxanalysis 2aZea maysxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aZearalenonexanalysis 3aFrance 3aSpain 0aFrance 0aSpain1 aMelcion, D.1 aRichard-Molard, D.1 aCahagnier, B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 13, v. 50, no. 4 p.728-731x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01082583Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02172naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245013700170300001600307520087900323650001801202650001201220650001301232650001601245650002901261650003501290650002201325650003901347653001801386653004001404700002301444700002101467700002601488773010301514852000901617856007701626930003301703945001301736946001301749655001201762IND2327457020221118064559.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232745702DNAL7 a118534632pmid7 a10.1021/jf010983z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVinas, P.10aRapid determination of mercury in food colorants using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry with slurry sample introduction  ap. 949-954.  aThe determination of mercury in different types of color food additives using electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry is proposed. The procedure involves direct introduction of the additive samples as suspensions, and fast-program methodology is used to avoid mercury volatilization losses. Suspensions are prepared in a medium containing 0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 1% v/v concentrated nitric acid, 2% w/v potassium permanganate, and 3% w/v silver nitrate before being directly introduced into the furnace. Calibration uses aqueous standards, and compensation of the background is carried out using the Zeeman device. The characteristic mass is 61 pg and the detection limit is 59 pg. The reliability of the procedure is checked by comparing the results obtained with other results based on microwave-oven sample digestion, and by analyzing a certified reference material. 3afood coloring 3amercury 3aslurries 3asuspensions 2aFood Additivesxanalysis 2aFood Coloring Agentsxanalysis 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomicxmethods 0acontamination 0aatomic absorption spectrophotometry1 aPardo-Martinez, M.1 aLopez-Garcia, I.1 aHernandez-Cordoba, M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.949-954x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010983z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03178naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245014000173300001600313520163700329650001301966650002201979650002502001650001002026650000802036650001502044650001502059650002302074650003102097650002602128650002702154650003302181650003002214650003202244650002302276650003902299653001902338700001702357700001802374700001602392700001602408773010302424852000902527856007702536930003302613945001302646946001302659655001202672IND2327457220221118064630.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232745722DNAL7 a118534642pmid7 a10.1021/jf01097732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeriotto, G.10aBiosensor technology and surface plasmon resonance for real-time detection of genetically modified roundup ready soybean gene sequences  ap. 955-962.  aBiospecific interaction analysis (BIA) was performed using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and biosensor technologies to detect genetically modified Roundup Ready soybean gene sequences. We first immobilized, on SA sensor chips, single-stranded biotinylated oligonucleotides containing soybean lectin and Roundup Ready gene sequences, and the efficiency of hybridization to oligonucleotide probes differing in length was determined. Second, we immobilized biotinylated PCR products from nontransgenic soybeans (genomes carrying only the lectin gene), as well as from genetically modified Roundup Ready soybean, and we injected the oligonucleotide probes. Furthermore, we used the sensor chips carrying either lectin and Roundup Ready soybean PCR products or 21-mer oligonucleotide as probes, and we injected both nonpurified and purified asymmetric PCR products. The results obtained show that 13 and 15 mer oligonucleotides are suitable probes to detect genetically modified Roundup Ready soybean gene sequences (either target oligonucleotides or PCR products) under standard BIA experimental conditions. By contrast, when 11 mer DNA probes were employed, no efficient hybridization was obtained. All the SPR-based formats were found to be useful for detection of Roundup Ready gene sequences, suggesting that these procedures are useful for the real-time monitoring of hybridization between target single-stranded PCR products, obtained by using as substrates DNA isolated from normal or transgenic soybeans, and oligonucleotide or PCR-generated probes, therefore enabling a one-step, nonradioactive protocol to perform detection. 3asoybeans 3atransgenic plants 3aherbicide resistance 3agenes 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3aDNA probes 3aanalytical methods 3anucleic acid hybridization 2aBiosensing Techniques 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSoybeansxgenetics 2aSurface Plasmon Resonancexmethods 0aimmobilization1 aBorgatti, M.1 aMischiati, C.1 aBianchi, N.1 aGambari, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.955-962x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01097733Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02644naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245012100171300001600292500001500308520107100323650001801394650002601412650002301438650001601461650001201477650001301489650001801502650003301520650002801553650001401581650004101595650002201636650001301658650001601671650002901687653001601716653001101732700001501743700001401758700001401772700001401786700001501800700001401815700001301829773010301842852000901945856007701954930003302031945001302064946001302077655001202090IND2327457920221118064407.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232745792DNAL7 a118534692pmid7 a10.1021/jf011185b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, S.J.10aMethylation methods for the quantitative analysis of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomers in various lipid samples  ap. 989-996.  a2019-12-04  aPrecise methylation methods for various chemical forms of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which minimize the formation of t,t isomers and allylmethoxy derivatives (AMD) with the completion of methylation, were developed using a 50 mg lipid sample, 3 mL of 1.0 N H2SO4/methanol, and/or 3 mL of 20% tetramethylguanidine (TMG)/methanol solution(s). Free CLA (FCLA) was methylated with 1.0 N H2SO4/methanol (55 degrees C, 5 min). CLA esterified in safflower oil (CLA-SO) was methylated with 20% TMG/methanol (100 degrees C, 5 min), whereas CLA esterified in phospholipid (CLA-PL) was methylated with 20% TMG/methanol (100 degrees C, 10 min), followed by an additional reaction with 1.0 N H2SO4/methanol (55 degrees C, 5 min). Similarly, CLA esterified in egg yolk lipid (CLA-EYL) was methylated by base hydrolysis, followed by reaction with 1.0 N H2SO4/methanol (55 degrees C, 5 min). These results suggest that for the quantitative analysis of CLA in lipid samples by GC, proper methylation methods should be chosen on the basis of the chemical forms of CLA in samples. 3alinoleic acid 3aquantitative analysis 3agas chromatography 3amethylation 3aisomers 3aegg yolk 3asafflower oil 2aChromatography, Gasxmethods 2aIndicators and Reagents 2aIsomerism 2aLinoleic Acidsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aLipidsxchemistry 2aMethanol 2aMethylation 2aPhospholipidsxchemistry 0aderivatives 0alipids1 aPark, C.W.1 aKim, S.J.1 aKim, J.K.1 aKim, Y.R.1 aPark, K.A.1 aKim, J.O.1 aHa, Y.L.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.989-996x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf011185b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02315naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002800156245013900184300001700323500001500340520079700355650001001152650003101162650002301193650001801216650001301234650002301247650002001270650001601290650003001306650002501336650001301361650002801374650002701402650003201429650002701461650002501488653002201513653001701535700002001552773010401572852000901676856007701685930003301762945001301795946001301808655001201821IND2327458020221118064532.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232745802DNAL7 a118534702pmid7 a10.1021/jf01094232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-De-Corcuera, J.I.10aImproved amperometric method for the rapid and quantitative measurement of lipoxygenase activity in vegetable tissue crude homogenates  ap. 997-1001.  a2019-12-04  aAn improved amperometric method for rapid (2 min) quantitative determination of lipoxygenase (LOX) activity in vegetable tissue crude homogenates is presented.

The amperometric method was improved by encapsulating linoleic acid (LA) in beta-cyclodextrin (CD) resulting in a stable substrate-buffer solution at a pH below 8.0. Ethanol and Tween 20 were not effective in solubilizing high LA concentrations required by the assay. A prototype benchtop instrument with the potential for use in an industrial environment is also presented. 3abeans 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aencapsulation 3adextrins 3aanalytical methods 3aenzyme activity 3ameasurement 2aElectrochemistryxmethods 2aFabaceaexenzymology 2aKinetics 2aLinoleic Acidxanalysis 2aLipoxygenasexanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aVegetablesxenzymology 2aZea maysxenzymology 0abeta-cyclodextrin 0alipoxygenase1 aCavalieri, R.P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.997-1001x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01094233Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02080naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245012300173300001600296500001500312520076800327650001701095650001001112650002201122650002301144650003901167650002401206650003501230650004801265650002101313650001901334653001901353653001601372700002201388773010301410852000901513856007701522930003301599945001301632946001301645655001201658IND2326938420221118064417.0020507e20020213dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232693842DNAL7 a118296412pmid7 a10.1021/jf010943v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayasaka, Y.10aScreening for potential pigments derived from anthocyanins in red wine using nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry  ap. 756-761.  a2019-12-04  aRed wine extracts were screened for potential wine pigments derived from anthocyanins, using a combination of nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry techniques. Fourteen aglycons were considered to be of anthocyanidin origin on the basis of their MS/MS spectra. The proposed structures of the aglycons were anthocyanidin C-4 substituted with vinyl linkage between C-4 and the hydroxy group at C-5. The anthocyanidin derivatives identified in the wine extracts were vinyl, vinylmethyl, vinylformic acid, 4-vinylphenol, 4-vinylguaiacol, and vinylcatechin adducts of malvidin as well as vinylformic acid and 4-vinylphenol adducts of peonidin and petunidin. The presence of vinyl alcohol, 4-vinylcatechol, and 4-vinylsyringol adducts of malvidin was also proposed. 3aanthocyanins 3awines 3amass spectrometry 3achemical structure 2aAnthocyaninsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aMolecular Structure 2aPigments, Biologicalxanalysis 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization 2aVitisxchemistry 2aWinexanalysis 0aplant pigments 0aderivatives1 aAsenstorfer, R.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 13, v. 50, no. 4 p.756-761x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010943v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02290naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245010800170300001800278520098900296650001201285650001401297650001701311650001001328650001701338650003901355650005001394650002201444650003501466650004701501650002401548650003101572653002701603773010501630852000901735856007701744930003301821945001301854946001301867655001201880IND2327463620221118064426.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232746362DNAL7 a118535112pmid7 a10.1021/jf011205+2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, H.S.10aCharacterization of major anthocyanins and the color of red-fleshed budd blood orange (Citrus sinensis)  ap. 1243-1246.  aHigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with photodiode array detection was applied for the characterization of anthocyanins in red-fleshed Budd Blood (Citrus sinensis) orange. More than seven anthocyanin pigments were separated within 30 min by using a binary gradient (0.1% H3PO4 in water and 0.1% H3PO4 in acetonitrile) elution on a Prodigy ODS column. Separations by reversed-phase HPLC and semipreparative HPLC on a Prodigy 10-micrometer ODS Prep column, and acid and alkali hydrolyses were used for identification of anthocyanins. The primary anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange grown in Florida were cyanidin-3-(6"-malonylglucoside) (44.8%) followed by cyanidin-3-glucoside (33.6%). Two other minor pigments were also acylated with malonic acid. Malonated anthocyanins represented the major proportion (>51%) of anthocyanins in Budd Blood orange. Total anthocyanin contents and juice color parameters (CIE L*,a*,b*) were compared with six other Florida-grown blood oranges. 3aoranges 3acultivars 3aanthocyanins 3acolor 3aorange juice 2aAnthocyaninsxanalysisxchemistry. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aCitrusxchemistry 2aFood Coloring Agentsxanalysis 2aPigments, Biologicalxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrophotometryxmethods 0amalonated anthocyanins0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.1243-1246x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf011205+3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02467naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245007100175300001800246500001500264520117600279650001201455650001501467650003101482650001101513650001301524650001901537650001201556650001201568650001301580650001201593650001301605650002201618650002301640650001701663653002201680700001901702700002601721773010501747852000901852856007701861930003301938945001301971946001301984655001201997IND2327462120221118064425.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232746212DNAL7 a118535002pmid7 a10.1021/jf010789c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrands, C.M.J.10aQuantification of melanoidin concentration in sugar-casein systems  ap. 1178-1183.  a2019-12-04  aMelanoidins are the final, brown, high molecular weight products of the Maillard reaction. The aim of the present study was to determine the average molar extinction coefficients of melanoidins formed in heated glucose-casein and fructose-casein systems. The value of the extinction coefficient can be used to translate spectrophotometrically measured browning (absorbance values) into melanoidin concentration. In the present study the melanoidins were quantified by measuring the concentration of sugar incorporated into the melanoidins, using 14C-labeled sugar. The extinction coefficient of the melanoidins remained constant during the observation period as the absorbance at 420 nm increased to approximately equal to 8 units, and it was calculated to be 477 (+/- 50) L mol(-1) cm(-1) in the glucose-casein reaction and 527 (+/- 35) L mol(-1) cm(-1) in the fructose-casein reaction. This difference is not significant. An increase of the number of sugar molecules per reactive amino group during the heating of glucose-casein and the fructose-casein mixtures was observed by the radiochemical method as well as by microanalysis of the high molecular weight fraction. 3aglucose 3aabsorbance 3aMaillard reaction products 3acasein 3afructose 3aheat treatment 2aCaseins 2aCooking 2aFructose 2aGlucose 2aKinetics 2aMaillard Reaction 2aPolymersxanalysis 2aTime Factors 0aMaillard reaction1 aWedzicha, B.L.1 aBoekel, M.A.J.S. van.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.1178-1183x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010789c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02557naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245004400173300001800217520103700235650002301272650001001295650001001305650001101315650000901326650001501335650001501350650003701365650001201402650001101414650002101425650002401446650002401470650003801494650002201532650002201554653001101576653001301587653001901600653002101619653005001640700001501690700001401705700001701719700001701736773010501753852000901858856007701867930003301944945001301977946001301990655001202003IND2327460620221118064537.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232746062DNAL7 a118534912pmid7 a10.1021/jf011022n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinforth, R.10aRetronasal transport of aroma compounds  ap. 1111-1117.  aA comparison was made between the amounts of volatiles in the headspace above a solution and the breath volatile content (exhaled from the nose or mouth) after consumption of the same solution. The amounts of volatiles in the breath were lower than those in the headspace, with breath exhaled via the mouth containing, on average, 8-fold more volatiles than breath exhaled via the nose. Dilution of the sample by saliva in-mouth did not appear to be a major factor affecting volatile delivery. Instead, the rate of in vivo equilibration (mass transfer) appeared to be the most significant factor, principally affecting volatile delivery from the solution to the gas phase. Thereafter, gas-phase dilution of the volatile as it passed through the upper airway resulted in a further decrease in volatile concentration. The final factor affecting the volatile concentration exhaled from the nose was absorption of volatiles to the nasal epithelia, which was greatest for those compounds with the lowest air/water partition coefficients. 3avolatile compounds 3aodors 3amouth 3asaliva 3anose 3aabsorption 3aepithelium 3astructure-activity relationships 2aAcetone 2aHumans 2aNosexphysiology 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aRegression Analysis 2aRespiratory Mechanicsxphysiology 2aSalivaxchemistry 2aTastexphysiology 0abreath 0atransfer 0aexhaled breath 0anasal epithelium 0aquantitative structure property relationships1 aMartin, F.1 aCarey, M.1 aDavidson, J.1 aTaylor, A.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.1111-1117x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf011022n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02547naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245010700175300001800282500001500300520108800315650002101403650001601424650003101440650000701471650001401478650002101492650001601513650001901529650001201548650001001560650001201570650001001582650002001592650001101612650003101623650002401654650001001678650001001688650001301698653002201711700001801733700001601751773010501767852000901872856007701881930003301958945001301991946001302004655001202017IND2327460820221118064444.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232746082DNAL7 a118534922pmid7 a10.1021/jf01116622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBredie, W.L.P.10aEffect of temperature and pH on the generation of flavor volatiles in extrusion cooking of wheat flour  ap. 1118-1125.  a2019-12-04  aExtrusion temperature (120, 135, and 150 degrees C) and quantity of added sodium hydroxide (0, 3, and 6 g/kg feedstock) were used as variables to study flavor generation in extrusion cooking of wheat flour. In total, 127 volatile components were identified in the extrudates, of which 51 contained sulfur. The levels of pyrroles, thiophenes, thiophenones, thiapyrans, and thiazolines increased at higher extrusion temperatures, whereas furans and aldehydes decreased. The addition of sodium hydroxide also affected the formation of volatile compounds. However, thiophenes, thiophenones, polythiacycloalkanes, thiazoles, thiazolines, pyrroles, and some pyrazines tended to increase with the more alkaline extrusion conditions. Some compounds from lipid-Maillard interactions were identified in the extrudates. Analysis of the volatile components by gas chromatography-olfactometry showed sulfur-and nitrogen-sulfur-containing heterocycles as possible contributors to the sulfury and rubbery odors observed in extrudates produced at the higher temperature and more alkaline conditions. 3asodium hydroxide 3awheat flour 3aMaillard reaction products 3apH 3aextrusion 3aflavor compounds 3atemperature 3aextruded foods 3acooking 3aodors 2aCooking 2aFlour 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aSmell 2aTaste 2aTriticum 0aMaillard reaction1 aMottram, D.S.1 aGuy, R.C.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.1118-1125x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01116623Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001700156245011000173300001800283520134100301650000901642650001201651650002301663650001401686650001001700650001201710650001801722650002401740650002201764650002401786653001701810700001801827700001901845773010501864852000901969856007701978930003302055945001302088946001302101655001202114IND2327460220221118064527.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232746022DNAL7 a118534892pmid7 a10.1021/jf01087202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJezussek, M.10aComparison of key aroma compounds in cooked brown rice varieties based on aroma extract dilution analyses  ap. 1101-1105.  aThe aroma compounds present in cooked brown rice of the three varieties Improved Malagkit Sungsong (IMS), Basmati 370 (B 370), and Khaskhani (KK), and of the variety Indica (German supermarket sample), were identified on the basis of aroma extract dilution analyses (AEDA). A total of 41 odor-active compounds were identified, of which eleven are reported for the first time as rice constituents. 2-Amino acetophenone (medicinal, phenolic), which was up to now unknown in rice aroma, exhibited the highest flavor dilution (FD) factor among the 30 to 39 odor-active compounds detected in all four varieties. 2-Acetyl-1-pyrroline, exhibiting an intense popcorn-like aroma-note, was confirmed as a further key aroma constituent in IMS, B 370, and KK, but was not important in Indica. Differences in the FD factors between the varieties were found for the previously unknown rice aroma compound 3-hydroxy-4,5-dimethyl-2(5H)-furanone (Sotolon; seasoning-like), which was higher in B 370 than in IMS and KK. In IMS, a yet unknown, spicy smelling component with a very high FD factor could be detected, which contributed with lower FD factors to the overall aromas of B 370 and KK, and was not present in Indica. The latter variety, which was available on the German market, differed most in its overall aroma from the three Asian brown rices. 3arice 3acooking 3avolatile compounds 3avarieties 3asmell 2aCooking 2aFood Handling 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aOryzaxchemistry. 2aSpecies Specificity 0aorganolepsis1 aJuliano, B.O.1 aSchieberle, P.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.1101-1105x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf01087203Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02293naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001400156245006000170300001800230520091700248650004301165650002601208650002301234650001401257650001101271650001301282650002401295650003801319650005101357650003301408650002801441650004201469650003201511650001701543650002601560653001101586773010501597852000901702856007701711930003301788945001301821946001301834655001201847IND2327459820221118064617.0020607e20020227dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232745982DNAL7 a118534862pmid7 a10.1021/jf010570y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadlo, S.10aDisappearance of pyrimethanil residues on tomato plants  ap. 1089-1091.  aThe objective of this work was to estimate the disappearance of pyrimethanil, the active ingredient of Mythos 300 SC, at present, commonly used for the protection of greenhouse vegetables against diseases of fungal origin. Disappearance trends of the chemical deposits were studied on tomato plants grown in commercial greenhouses sprayed with a homogeneous 0.15% aqueous solution of the plant protection product. It was found that, on average, pyrimethanil residues on ripening fruits dropped by half and reached detection limit level in 5.7 and 13.7 days after Mythos 300 SC application, respectively. Pyrimethanil residues on tomato leaves dropped by half within 4.0 days and reached detection limit level in the first 10.5 days. Therefore, in conditions of high infection pressure, there is a need to repeat the fungicide application as early as after 3 or 4 days after previous application of Mythos 300 SC. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3apyrimidine fungicides 3afungicide residues 3ahalf life 3aleaves 3aripening 2aFungixdrug effects 2aFungicides, Industrialxchemistry 2aSolanum lycopersicumxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPyrimidinesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 2aVegetablesxchemistry 0afruits0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Feb. 27, v. 50, no. 5 p.1089-1091x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf010570y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle01160naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245012300176300001600299500002400315520022700339650001500566650001500581650001500596650000900611650001400620700002400634700002200658773011400680852000900794856005500803655001200858IND4423262320090801185401.0090718e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442326232DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01245.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojo-Vázquez, J.A.10aLength-weight relationships for coastal fish species from the gillnet artisanal fishery in the central Mexican Pacific  ap. 497-498.  aIncludes references  aThis paper presents 43 length-weight relationships of coastal fish species of the families Carangidae, Lutjanidae and Haemulidae from the central Mexican Pacific.

Design Expert Software (Version 7.1.6) uses Response Surface Methodology (RSM) for statistical designing of operating condition for immobilization of papain on alginate bead considering concentration of papain, concentration of sodium alginate, concentration of calcium chloride and pH as numeric factors and Specific Enzymatic Activity (SEA) of immobilized papain sample as response. Immobilization using 25.96g/L papain, 20g/L sodium alginate and 20g/L calcium chloride at pH 7 gives the desired product as indicated by ANOVA (Analysis of Variance). Three parameters viz., initial concentration of mercury (II), amount of AIP and pH are varied in a systematic manner. Maximum 98.88% removal of mercury (II) has been achieved within 8min when simulated aqueous solution of mercury (II) with initial concentration of 10mg/L has been contacted with 5g of AIP at pH 9 and at 35°C in a batch contactor.

This Cambodian nut contains 7.5% water and 70% oil. Most of the fatty acids are saturated and include 42% C12:0 and 41.8% C14:0; the sterol composition is similar to that of other vegetable oils. This oil is less rich in alpha-tocopherol than in gamma-tocopherol. Analysis of the solid content of the oil with respect to the temperature by NMR shows a fast fall of solid content around its fusion range at 38-39 degrees C. The main differences in the properties of the indigenous Cambodia nut from other known oleaginous seeds are in its selenium content, fatty acid composition, fusion temperature profile, and content of antioxidants. These important characteristics can soon make possible its application in pharmacology, cosmetics, the margarine industry, etc. 3anutrient content 3aIrvingia 3afatty acids 3aseed oils 3agamma-tocopherol 3aalpha-tocopherol 3anuts 3aamino acid composition 3aprotein content 3amineral content 3asterols 2aAntioxidantsxanalysis 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aMineralsxanalysis 2aNutsxchemistry 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysis 2aSeleniumxanalysis 2aSitosterolsxanalysis 2aTemperature 2aTrees 2aWater 2aalpha-Tocopherolxanalysis 2agamma-Tocopherolxanalysis 0aCambodia 0achemical composition 0atocopherols 0aprotein composition1 aChunhieng, T.1 aOlle, M.1 aMontet, D.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2002 Mar. 13, v. 50, no. 6 p.1478-1482x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf011118h3Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001200154245011000166300001600276500032300292520109100615650001401706650001401720650001101734650001501745650001001760650001201770650001201782650001401794650001501808650001201823650001101835650001301846650001301859650001001872650001601882650001101898651001401909651002101923700001501944700001501959773014401974856005502118852000902173655001202182IND60542131420221118065207.0160826e20160208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054213142DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1108.252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVar, M.10aMorphological features and examination of Colchicum speciosum distributed in the Basyayla plateau, Turkey  ap. 195-200.  aPaper presented at the XXIX International Horticultural Congress on Horticulture: Sustaining Lives, Livelihoods and Landscapes (IH2014): V International conference of Landscape and Urban Horticulture and International Symposium on Sustainable Management in the Urban Forest held August 17-22, 2014, Brisbane, Australia  aColchicum speciosum, a naturally-occurring species in Turkey, belongs to the genus Colchicum and family Liliaceae. Known locally as “Döngeri”, “Vargit”, “Güzgülü”, “Acıçiğdem”, it colours the upland meadows when blooming in autumn. It is the indicator of winter and awakens the local people for migration to Black Sea upland meadows. Its seeds are so valuable because of the colchicine content, used to produce drugs for several diseases, it is also a poisonous herb and has been cultivated in gardens as an ornamental. Colchicum speciosum has several different uses at the studies of pastoral and urban landscape architect for different locations because of their remarkable flowers, blooming periods and growing environments. The plant has significant ornamental potential and is used in this way abroad, but is not widely used in urban areas locally. This study looked at the main morphological features of the species and the natural landscape distribution, according to the landscape planning criteria, to supplement the use of this plant in urban landscape. 3aColchicum 3aLiliaceae 3aautumn 3acolchicine 3adrugs 3aflowers 3agardens 3ahighlands 3alandscapes 3ameadows 3apeople 3aplanning 3aplateaus 3aseeds 3aurban areas 3awinter 3aBlack Sea 3aTurkey (country)1 aDincer, D.1 aBaykal, H.0 tActa horticulturae.g2016 Feb. 8, , no. 1108 p.195-200dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1108.25  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245020800164300001600372500001500388520149400403650002201897650002101919650001201940650001401952650001301966650001601979650002101995650001402016650002802030650001502058650002502073650002002098650001602118650001802134650001502152650002302167650002002190650001002210650000702220650002602227651001302253653001002266700001902276700001802295773008602313852000902399945002502408946001102433655001202444IND4361745120221118064930.0040324e200209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436174512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This study was undertaken to study the influence of paste preparation conditions (whipping time and speed) on the swelling capacity (SC). Also the effect of temperature, pH and the salt concentration of the mixing water on the water absorption capacity (WAC), water solubility index (WSI) and the swelling capacity (SC) of the paste were studied following a completely randomised factorial design. The result revealed that an increase in whipping speed was generally accompanied by an increase in the initial swelling capacity of the paste. Further whipping after the attainment of the maximum swelling capacity resulted in a decrease in swelling capacity. WAC and WSI of the paste increased with increase in NaCl concentration and in pH. The temperature range used in this experiment had no significant influence on WAC and WSI (P>0.05). The swelling capacity of paste diminished with the increase in NaCl concentration and a decrease in temperature. Contour plots depicting the effect of changing levels of the different factors showed that optimum conditions for a good batter were pH of 4-10, NaCl concentration of 0.5 M and a temperature of about 30°C. Application of these conditions gave akara with highly acceptable sensory characteristics. 3atraditional foods 3afood composition 3acowpeas 3ared beans 3awhipping 3afried foods 3awater solubility 3asoy flour 3afood processing quality 3afood paste 3aswelling (materials) 3asodium chloride 3atemperature 3ablended foods 3aabsorption 3asensory properties 3afood processing 3awater 3apH 3afunctional properties 3aCameroon 0aflour1 aNjintang, Y.N.1 aWaldron, K.W.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Sept., v. 54, no. 3 p.207-214x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02869naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245011600182300001400298500001500312520140400327650001401731650002801745650002601773650001801799650002401817650002801841650001801869650001401887650002501901650001801926650001601944650002001960650001801980650001501998650001802013650001502031650001402046650001802060650001902078653002402097653002102121653002002142653001902162700001802181773008302199852000902282945002502291946001102316655001202327IND4361742920221118064951.0040324e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436174292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Model solution & validation  ap. 11-25.  a2019-12-05  aA fundamental two-dimensional model to predict the heat and mass transfer that occur during the frying and cooling process of tortilla chips was solved using finite element technique. The assembly of elements method with each element being four-noded quadrilateral elements was used to obtain a two-dimensional distribution. The Gauss-Legendre method was used for the numerical integration of each of the integrals. The system of non-linear equations (including contributions from all elements) was solved using FORTRAN Power Station 4.0. A good agreement between experimental and predicted data was obtained. The parameters that were studied included water saturation, oil saturation, temperature during frying and cooling. Change in structure (shrinkage and expansion) was also verified and agreed well with the experimental data. Sensitivity analysis showed that the higher frying temperature the faster drying rate and a faster increase in the temperature and pressure of the product. More oil was absorbed at a lower frying temperature. The thicker the product the lesser the oil content. Oil absorption appeared to seize once the temperature of the product begins to increase and a crust begins to form. The cooling temperature had the most influence on oil absorption. The cooling temperature that was nearest to the temperature of the fried product led to the least amount of oil absorption. 3athickness 3afinite element analysis 3acooking fats and oils 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3afood processing quality 3afood surfaces 3aequations 3aswelling (materials) 3awater content 3atemperature 3adeep fat frying 3acorn products 3aprediction 3alipid content 3aabsorption 3ashrinkage 3aheat transfer 3atortilla chips 0aphysical properties 0awater saturation 0afood processing 0aoil saturation1 aMoreira, R.G.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.11-25x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02030naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001600144245004500160300001600205500001500221520098100236650002301217650001201240650002101252650001001273650001101283650001601294650001201310650001701322651001401339653001001353653002301363653001701386653001101403700001601414700001801430700001801448773008501466852000901551945002501560946001101585655001201596IND4361740120221118065101.0040324e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436174012DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The industrial residue named "okara" has a standard protein content. A candy (nougat) with okara, peanut, glucose, hydrogenated oil, sugar and natural essences was produced. Modifying the okara and peanut contents, three samples were prepared: A (18.3% okara and 27.4% peanut); B (27.4% and 18.3%) and C (36.6% and 9.1%), remaining the other components constant. The nougat was given to persons of both sexes and of different ages. The nonparametric Friedman test was used to evaluate the acceptance and preference. It concludes: (1) samples with lower okara content have a higher acceptance; (2) the acceptance of A differs significantly with regard to taste and texture from B and C; (3) C differs of A and B with regard to the acceptance. The production of this candy would increase the available vegetable proteins for human consumption and would increase the output of soybean products factories. 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3asoybean products 3acandy 3aflavor 3aingredients 3arecipes 3apalatability 3aArgentina 0aokara 0asensory properties 0afood quality 0anougat1 aGenta, M.L.1 aAlvarez, N.V.1 aSantana, M.S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 June, v. 53, no. 2 p.199-202x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02205naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245011300182300001600295520088600311650001401197650001901211650001201230650001301242650001001255650002401265650001701289650001501306650001901321650001101340650002301351650002201374650002401396653001701420653001901437653002001456653002001476653004001496700001301536700001701549700001501566773008501581852000901666945002501675946001101700655001201711IND4361710720221118064936.0040322e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436171072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

By simulating the behavior of the bottled virgin olive oil it was possible to assess the influence of the bottle's shape and size on the quality decay kinetics of virgin olive oil bottled in glass and plastic containers. In particular, five geometrically different containers were used to predict the storage behavior of bottled virgin olive oil. The obtained results show that the quality decay kinetics of bottled virgin olive oil greatly depends on container geometry. However, the extent to which the container's geometrical factors affect the quality decay kinetics depends on the material used to make the bottle, and on the initial value of the oxygen partial pressure in the bottle headspace. 3aolive oil 3afood packaging 3abottles 3aplastics 3aglass 3apackaging materials 3afood storage 3ashelf life 3ahydroperoxides 3aoxygen 3alipid peroxidation 3areaction kinetics 3amathematical models 0abottled oils 0acontainer size 0acontainer shape 0apackaging shape 0atwo-dimensional mathematical models1 aBove, S.1 aLa Notte, E.1 aSacchi, R.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2003 Apr., v. 57, no. 2 p.189-197x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02356naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100002100161245010500182300001300287500001500300520089000315650001401205650002601219650001801245650002401263650002801287650001401315650002501329650001301354650001801367650001601385650002001401650001801421650002301439650001501462650001801477650001501495650001201510650001401522650001801536650001901554653002401573653002101597653002001618653001901638700001801657773008201675852000901757945002501766946001101791655001201802IND4361742720221118065005.0040324e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436174272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Semi-empirical correlations were included to account for structural changes, such as shrinkage and expansion due to puffing. All water present in the tortilla chip was considered bound and led to shrinkage when removed. The parameters that were studied included water saturation, Sw, oil saturation, So, temperature, T, and pressure, P. Liquid flow results from convective flow due to the gradient in total gas pressure and capillary flow due to the gradient of capillary force. Gas movement results from convective flow due to the total gas pressure gradient and Knudsen diffusion due to the concentration gradient. The only transport phenomenon during cooling is oil absorption, which is assumed to be a function of the capillary pressure. 3athickness 3acooking fats and oils 3amass transfer 3amathematical models 3afood processing quality 3aequations 3aswelling (materials) 3aduration 3awater content 3atemperature 3adeep fat frying 3acorn products 3athermal properties 3aprediction 3alipid content 3aabsorption 3acooling 3ashrinkage 3aheat transfer 3atortilla chips 0aphysical properties 0awater saturation 0afood processing 0aoil saturation1 aMoreira, R.G.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 June, v. 53, no. 1 p.1-10x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/03/26  aNon-US 7aarticle02399naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144072001700161100001500178245008400193300001600277520129600293650001801589650001401607650001001621650001501631650001201646650001901658650001601677650001901693650001701712650002001729650002401749650001401773650001401787700001401801700002001815773008501835852000901920945002501929946001101954655001201965IND4361738920221118065110.0040324e200206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436173892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTurhan, M.10aApplication of Peleg model to study water absorption in chickpea during soaking  ap. 153-159.  aApplication of the Peleg model was investigated for predicting water absorption by five winter- and five spring-planted chickpea genotypes during soaking between temperature (T) of 20 and 100°C. The Peleg model can predict kinetics of the chickpea soaking till equilibrium using short-term data at the given conditions. Its specific form for infinite time may also be used to estimate equilibrium moisture content (Me) at T > or = 40°C. Spring and winter chickpeas showed no significant difference (P< 0.05) in the Peleg rate constant (K1) and Peleg capacity constant (K2) within and between the groups at all temperatures except for K1 at T<40°C. The discrepancy for K1 was attributed to characteristic water permeabilities of spring and winter chickpeas which were prominent at T< 40°C. The Peleg constant K1 decreased from 17.1 x 10(-3) to 0.95x10(-3) h%-1 for the spring chickpeas, and from 22.2 x10(-3) to 1.02 x 10(-3) h %-1 for the winter chickpeas with increasing temperature from 20 to 100°C. An Arrhenius plot for K1 exhibited a slope change around 55°C corresponding to approximate gelatinization temperature of the chickpea samples. The Peleg constant K2 for the samples linearly increased from 7.26 x10(-3) to 9.48x10(-3) %-1 with increasing temperature from 20 to 100°C. 3awater content 3achickpeas 3awater 3aabsorption 3asoaking 3aheat treatment 3atemperature 3agelatinization 3apermeability 3afood processing 3amathematical models 3aequations 3acultivars1 aSayar, S.1 aGunasekaran, S.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 June, v. 53, no. 2 p.153-159x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/04/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02137naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245010300141300001600244520086400260650001801124650001801142650002201160650001201182650002401194650001601218650001301234650001601247650001301263650002001276650001801296650002101314650001701335650002701352650001601379651001001395653002701405653002401432653002101456700001401477700001701491700001701508773008501525852000901610945002501619946001101644655001201655IND4361757420221118065054.0040325e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436175742DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Textural properties (at 4°C) and ultrasonic velocity (at 4, 8, 12 and 25°C) were measured. The ultrasonic velocity could be mathematically related with the textural parameters such as hardness and compression work (CW). The results showed that using a non-destructive method such as ultrasonic measurements, hardness and CW could be accurately estimated (%var=95% in both parameters). Moreover, the measurement of ultrasonic velocity at different temperatures showed that velocity decreased when temperature increased. Thus, from the slope of the temperature-velocity straight lines it was possible to assess, in a non-destructive way, the moisture and fat contents of the meat-based product (%var=91% and 93%, respectively). 3awater content 3ameat products 3atraditional foods 3atexture 3aacoustic properties 3aultrasonics 3avelocity 3atemperature 3ahardness 3aprotein content 3alipid content 3afood composition 3afood quality 3anondestructive methods 3ameasurement 3aSpain 0asobrassada de Mallorca 0aultrasonic velocity 0acompression work1 aSimal, S.1 aBenedito, J.1 aRossello, C.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 July, v. 53, no. 3 p.279-285x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02397naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245010500159300001600264520124900280650001301529650001701542650001701559650002201576650002301598650001901621650002501640650002701665650001901692650002201711650002001733650002401753700001601777700001501793700001701808700002001825773008501845852000901930945002501939946001101964655001201975IND4361757320221118064907.0040325e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436175732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Tomato juice was subjected to MTS treatments (20 kHz, 2 kg pressure, 117 micrometer amplitude and 70°C), or to control thermal treatments (TT), for 1 min. Flow curves, yield stress and apparent viscosity were measured on both kind of samples. Apparent viscosity of MTS samples were 1.6-fold higher than that of TT samples. Yield stress values were also 2.2-fold higher in MTS than in TT samples. Flow curve values were fitted to the power law equation; MTS samples showed about 1.9-fold higher consistency values and lower flow indexes, n=0.190 vs. n=0.126, than TT samples. MTS samples retained about 20% more serum than TT samples after centrifugation. TT inactivated about 38% of the initial PME activity whereas PME activity was undetectable in MTS-treated tomato juice. TT left PG unaffected whereas MTS treatments inactivated 62% of total PG activity. These results suggest, that MTS could be an useful technology to obtain high viscosity and consistency tomato juice. 3atomatoes 3atomato juice 3atomato paste 3afood preservation 3apressure treatment 3aheat treatment 3aultrasonic treatment 3arheological properties 3apectinesterase 3apolygalacturonase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inactivation1 aSanchez, C.1 aBurgos, J.1 aMontanes, L.1 aLopez Buesa, P.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 July, v. 53, no. 3 p.273-278x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdGHKe2004/04/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02197naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001500144245006600159300001600225500001500241520102200256650002201278650002801300650002301328650002001351650002001371650002501391650001301416650002801429650001501457653002401472653002301496653002001519700001401539700001501553700001701568700001901585700001701604773008501621852000901706945002501715946001101740655001201751IND4361749020221118064834.0040324e200111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436174902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAlbert, S.10aInferential quality assessment in breakfast cereal production  ap. 157-166.  a2019-12-05  aThis paper describes the development of inferential models for the provision of real-time, on-line estimates of the quality of a breakfast cereal for production line operators. Five quality variables were selected and on-line measurements reflective of the key process conditions were identified. Following process data logging, a number of linear and non-linear data-based modelling methods were applied to identify relationships between the on-line measurements and the product quality. Off-line verification of the models indicated that the prediction accuracy achieved was sufficient to offer the opportunity for quality control improvements. The models were subsequently implemented on-line to provide the process operators with frequent estimates of product quality. Performance assessment has indicated a reduction in the variability of all five quality parameters. In addition to details of the modelling, the decisions relating to the development strategy and justification for implementation are considered. 3abreakfast cereals 3afood processing quality 3aprocess monitoring 3aneural networks 3afood processing 3aqualitative analysis 3aaccuracy 3aindustrial applications 3aprediction 0amathematical models 0ainferential models 0aprocess control1 aHiden, H.1 aConlin, A.1 aMartin, E.B.1 aMontague, G.A.1 aMorris, A.J.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 Nov., v. 50, no. 3 p.157-166x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01262naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001400127245006900141300001600210520040000226650002700626650001400653650000700667650001400674650002500688653004000713653002100753700001600774700001600790773008500806852000900891945002500900946001100925655001200936IND4361756520221118064830.0040325e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436175652DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Dependencies of specific conductivity sigma, juice yield Y, instantaneous flow rate v and qualitative juice characteristics at different modes of PEF treatment are discussed. Three main compression phases were observed in a case of mechanical expression. A unified approach is proposed for juice yield data analysis allowing a reduction in data scattering caused by differences in the quality of samples. Simultaneous application of pressure and PEF treatment revealed a passive form of PEF-induced cell plasmolysis. Pressure provokes the damage of defect cells, enhances diffusion migration of moisture and depresses the cell resealing processes. PEF application at the moment when the press-cake's specific electrical conductivity reaches a minimum and the pressure achieves its constant value seemed to be the most optimal. It has been found that a combination of pressing and PEF treatment gives the optimum results and enhances the yield of juice significantly and improves its quality. 3aplant tissues 3amathematical models 3afood processing quality 3apressing 3aapples 3aelectrical conductivity 3aequations 3aflow 3aapple juice 3apulsed electric fields 3apressure treatment 3adata analysis 3anonthermal processing 3aextraction 3akinetics 3aoptical properties 0aoptimization 0acompression1 aLebovka, N.I.1 aVorobiev, E.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2001 Nov., v. 50, no. 3 p.129-139x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01494naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110100001800127245010400145300001600249520046800265650001600733650002700749650002400776650001400800650001800814650001800832650001400850650002000864650001200884650001100896653001900907700001700926700001800943700001700961773008500978852000901063945002501072946001101097655001201108IND4361746620221118064853.0040324e200210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436174662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Blanched potato strips were impregnated at 25°C by soaking in solutions of corn syrup DE 42-NaCl, 50-3% by weight, and NaCl 3% by weight. After rinsing and air drying, the strips were deep fried in sunflower oil at 160, 170 and 180°C. A control treatment, consisting of potato strips blanched but not soaked was also conducted. Experimental data of surface temperature, mean moisture content of potato strips and crust color changes during frying were fit to empirical relationships, with correlation coefficients greater than 99.0%. A first-order rate equation was used to model the kinetics of color change. In all cases, the Arrhenius activation energy decreased alongside with decreasing mean moisture content, suggesting a possible color development rate control from a chemical step to a diffusional one. The kinetic parameters were employed to predict the color change during the deep-fat frying with RMS's values in the range of 5.1-10.5%. 3awater content 3aFrench fries 3adeep fat frying 3acolor 3afood surfaces 3akinetics 3asoaking 3acorn syrup 3asodium chloride 3asolutions 3afood processing quality 3aequations 3asurface temperature 3aabsorption 3alipids 3aprediction1 aRioseco, V.K.1 aGonzalez, P.A.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2002 Sept., v. 54, no. 3 p.249-255x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  aINDdHBIe2004/04/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02992naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245012300175300001600298500002400314520151600338650001901854650002201873650001901895650003001914650001101944650002101955650001901976650001401995650001102009650001202020650002302032650003202055650002302087650001202110650001402122650001102136650001302147650002202160700001702182700002202199700002002221700003202241700002902273773013002302852000902432856005702441655001202498IND4451811520221118024137.0110401e199606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445181152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.1996.tb00836.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSauvion, Nicolas10aEffects of GNA and other mannose binding lectins on development and fecundity of the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae  ap. 285-293.  aIncludes references  aThree mannose-binding lectins were assayed in artificial diets for their toxic and growth-inhibitory effects on nymphal development of the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae. The snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) lectin GNA was the most toxic, with an induced nymphal mortality of 42% at 1500 μg ml⁻¹ (30 μM) and an IC₅₀ (50% growth inhibition) of 630 μg ml⁻¹ (13 μM). The daffodil (Narcissus pseudonarcissus) lectin NPA and a garlic (Allium sativum) lectin ASA induced no significant mortality in the range 10-1500 μg ml⁻¹, but did result in growth inhibition of 59% (NPA) and 26% (ASA) at 1500 μg ml⁻¹ (40 μM for NPA, 63 μM for ASA). All three lectins were responsible for a slight but significant growth stimulation when ingested at 10 μg ml⁻¹, reaching + 26%, + 18% and + 11% over the control values for the garlic lectin, the daffodil lectin and the snowdrop lectin, respectively. GNA, as well as the glucose/mannose binding lectin Concanavalin A, were also provided at sublethal doses throughout the life cycle of the aphids, and effects on adult performance were monitored. Adult survival was not significantly altered, but both lectins adversely affected total fecundity and the dynamics of reproduction, resulting in significant reduction in calculated rm's (population intrinsic rate of natural increase) on lectin-containing diets. These effects are discussed in relation to the use of transgenic plants expressing these toxic lectins for potential control of aphid populations. 3aAllium sativum 3aGalanthus nivalis 3aMyzus persicae 3aNarcissus pseudonarcissus 3aadults 3aartificial diets 3aconcanavalin A 3afecundity 3agarlic 3aglucose 3agrowth retardation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainsect development 3amannose 3amortality 3anymphs 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants1 aRahbé, Yvan1 aPeumans, Willy J.1 aDamme, Els J.M.1 aGatehouse, J.

Soil conservation, therefore, is a concern for both farmers and communities alike. Soil conservation programs are a major thrust of extension agricultural cultural programs in Australia. Community participation is an important part of these conservation programs. Four states in Australia have district soil conservation advisory committees. These committees are studied as an example of community participation. Both committee members and the extension officers who work with the committees are included in the study. Results indicate that both committee members and extension officers agree that the advisory committees contribute significantly to the conservation programs in their areas. However, the two groups disagree in terms of what the most important accomplishments of the committees have been. Thus, while the committees are generally viewed positively, there is some potential for problems related to the different perceptions of the committees' accomplishments. 3acitizen participation 3asoil conservation 3asoil erosion 3aobjectives 3aleadership 3aextension education 3anational surveys 3aAustralia 0aadvisory committees 0aroles1 aMaurer, R.C.0 tJournal of the Community Development Society.g1990, v. 21, no. 1 p.54-70x0010-38297nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02678naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245009700168300001800265500001500283520137000298650001701668650001101685650001701696650001501713650002001728650002301748650001001771650002301781650002801804650001301832650001201845650001501857650001201872650001201884650001201896650001301908650001101921651001501932653001401947700001801961773007401979852000902053856008802062939003302150946001302183655001202196IND4478488120221118024020.0140314e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447848812DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.12552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, R.P.P.10aHomalodisca coagulata (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae) Transmission of Xylella fastidiosa to Almond  ap. 1255-1259.  a2019-12-05  aAlmond leaf scorch (ALS) is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, transmitted by sharpshooter leafhoppers and spittlebugs. The recent invasion of a X. fastidiosa vector, Homalodisca coagulata (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae), into California may have major consequences to the spread of ALS because this insect feeds readily on trees, including stone fruit species. We found that, under laboratory conditions, H. coagulata acquired X. fastidiosa from symptomatic almond plants with low efficiency relative to grape (3.3 to 10% per individual per day). Inoculation efficiency also was low, approximately 4% per insect per day. H. coagulata inoculated 1-year-old woody tissues of almond plants at similar rates as green shoots. H. coagulata transmitted two X. fastidiosa grape strains from grape source plants to grape and almond. We also observed X. fastidiosa transmission to dormant almond plants. X. fastidiosa populations in the petioles of field-collected symptomatic almond leaves were not higher than 10(7) CFU/g of tissue, suggesting that low bacterial populations within almond are partially responsible for the lower acquisition rates observed from diseased almond compared with diseased grape, which are usually within the range of 10(8) to 10(9) CFU/g. The relevance of our findings to ALS epidemiology, considering H. coagulata as a vector, is discussed. 3astone fruits 3agrapes 3aepidemiology 3aCercopidae 3aplant pathology 3aXylella fastidiosa 3atrees 3aalmond leaf scorch 3aHomalodisca vitripennis 3apetioles 3aalmonds 3apopulation 3astrains 3ainsects 3atissues 3abacteria 3ashoots 3aCalifornia 0aHemiptera1 aPurcell, A.H.0 tPlant disease.g2003 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1255-1259x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.12553Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140314  aOther US 7aarticle02934naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001600148245014500164300001800309520148000327650001901807650002001826650001901846650003901865650002501904650002501929650002501954650001401979650001801993650001002011650002502021650002002046650002202066650001302088650001202101650001902113650001202132651001802144700001202162700001302174700001902187700001702206773007402223852000902297856008802306939003302394946001302427655001202440IND4478487420221118024007.0140314e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447848742DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.12262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouto, E.R.10aProperties of Strains of Sweet potato feathery mottle virus and Two Newly Recognized Potyviruses Infecting Sweet Potato in the United States  ap. 1226-1232.  aSome biological and molecular properties of six potyvirus isolates (LSU-1, -2, -3, and -5; 95-2; and 95-6) from sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) were evaluated. Isolates LSU-1 and -3 and 95-2 were transmitted by Aphis gossypii and Myzus persicae while LSU-2 and -5 were not transmitted by either aphid. The partial nucleotide sequence of the nuclear inclusion b (NIb) and the coat protein (CP) genes of these six isolates were compared with the corresponding sequences of 17 Sweet potato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV) strains and 18 other potyviruses. LSU-1 and -3 had high sequence similarity to the published sequences for Sweet potato virus G (SPVG), did not react with antisera to other known sweet potato viruses, and caused distinct symptoms. We propose to designate these two isolates as SPVG. This report documents the occurrence of this virus in the United States and provides the first characterization of its biological properties. LSU-2 and -5 were distinct in symptomatology; partial Nib, CP nucleotide, and derived amino acid sequence; and serology to other viruses. We propose to call this virus (LSU isolates 2 and 5) Ipomoea vein mosaic virus. The present study revealed a high degree of sequence similarity between 95-6 and the common strain of SPFMV, and between 95-2 and the russet crack strain of SPFMV. Results from this study suggest not only that at least two strains of SPFMV occur in the United States, but that two other potyviruses also are present. 3aAphis gossypii 3aIpomoea batatas 3aMyzus persicae 3aSweet potato feathery mottle virus 3aSweet potato virus 2 3aSweet potato virus G 3aamino acid sequences 3aantiserum 3acoat proteins 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant pathology 3asequence homology 3aserology 3astrains 3asweet potatoes 3aviruses 3aUnited States1 aSim, J.1 aChen, J.1 aValverde, R.A.1 aClarke, C.A.0 tPlant disease.g2003 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1226-1232x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.12263Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140314  aOther US 7aarticle03195naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245013300166300001800299520175700317650002202074650001602096650001402112650002502126650001302151650003002164650001902194650001102213650001402224650002002238650003002258650001502288650001802303650001302321650001302334650001002347650001202357651001302369651001402382651001402396700001302410700001602423700001502439773009202454852000902546856008802555939003302643946001302676655001202689IND4478487920221118024053.0140314e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447848792DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.12502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalvick, D.K.10aCultivar Preference and Genotype Distribution of the Brown Stem Rot Pathogen Phialophora gregata in the Midwestern United States  ap. 1250-1254.  aBrown stem rot (BSR), caused by Phialophora gregata f. sp. sojae, is an important yield-limiting disease of soybean (Glycine max) in the midwestern United States. Midwestern populations of P. gregata are separated into genotypes A and B based on intergenic spacer sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Genotype A causes both leaf and stem symptoms, and genotype B typically causes internal stem symptoms only. Data are limited on the geographic distribution of genotypes A and B. It is not well understood whether cultivars may be infected preferentially by a genotype. Field plots were established at five sites in Illinois, three sites in Wisconsin, and two sites in Minnesota in two different years. Soybean cvs. Bell, BSR101, Dwight, Sturdy, Williams 82, LN92-12033, and LN92-12054 were sown with two to four replications at each field site. From each plot, 5 to 10 stems were harvested arbitrarily at the R8 growth stage and assayed by polymerase chain reaction to detect the A and B genotypes. Both pathogen genotypes were detected at all locations except Urbana, where only genotype A was detected, and St. Paul, where only B was detected. Genotype A was the predominant genotype detected in susceptible cvs. Williams 82 and LN92-12054, with 70 and 78% of infected stems, respectively, positive for A. The other susceptible cultivar, Sturdy, yielded predominantly genotype A at four of the seven Illinois and Wisconsin locations where both pathogen genotypes were present, but yielded predominantly B at the Minnesota location where both genotypes were detected. Genotype B was the predominant type detected in partially resistant cvs. Dwight, LN92-12033, and Bell, with 56, 85, and 99% of the infected stems, respectively, testing positive for B. 3aCadophora gregata 3aGlycine max 3acultivars 3adevelopmental stages 3agenotype 3ageographical distribution 3aintergenic DNA 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation 3aribosomal DNA 3asoybeans 3astem rot 3astems 3atesting 3aIllinois 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin1 aChen, W.1 aKurle, J.E.1 aGrau, C.R.0 tPlant disease.g2003 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1250-1254wJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.12503Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140314  aOther US 7aarticle04430naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001900149245008600168300001300254520290900267650002103176650000803197650002503205650001903230650000903249650001203258650001203270650001003282650001003292650001403302650001903316650003303335650001603368650002703384650001803411650001403429650002003443650001803463650001703481650002403498650001203522650001403534650001603548651002103564651001303585700001503598700001803613700001503631773007403646852000903720856008903729939003303818946001303851655001203864IND4478493420221118024150.0140314e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447849342DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.1268B2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSholberg, P.L.10aFirst Report of Brown Rot in Wine Grapes Caused by Monilinia fructicola in Canada  ap. 1268.  aA survey was conducted in 2001 and 2002 to determine incidence of fruit pathogens in wine grapes (Vitis vinifera), an important crop in the southern interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Grape clusters were sampled every 2 weeks from June to October at eight vineyard sites located from Osoyoos in the south to Kelowna, approximately 100 km to the north. In the laboratory, the berry clusters were surface disinfested for 0.5 min in 70% ethanol, followed by 1 min in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, and rinsed twice in sterile distilled water. The berries were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 15 ml/liter of 85% lactic acid and incubated at 20°C for 1 week. During the 2002 survey, a fungus resembling Monilinia fructicola (G. Wint.) Honey was observed sporulating on immature ‘Pinot noir’ grapes from Kelowna that were sampled on 14 August. Later in the growing season, a similar fungus was detected on ‘Riesling’ grapes from Summerland sampled on 11 September. There was no evidence of brown rot near the vineyard in Kelowna, but diseased stonefruit were present near the vineyard in Summerland. Subsequent identification of the fungus from ‘Riesling’ as M. fructicola was based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal rRNA genes. The sequenced isolate was deposited in the Canadian Collection of Fungus Cultures as DAOM 231119, and the ITS sequence was accessioned in GenBank as AY289185. Colony growth on PDA was rapid and in concentric rings with the colony margin complete, microconidia abundant, and macroconidia 12 to 13 μm long. Macroconidia germinated with a long germ tube before branching. These characteristics distinguished this fungus from M. laxa, a closely related species that is slow growing with lobed colony margins, produces few microconidia, and germ tubes that branch close to the conidium (1). The complete ITS sequence for DAOM 231119 was a 100% match to other sequences deposited for M. fructicola (Z73777, AF010500, and U21815). On the basis of comparisons of available data, ITS sequences for M. fructicola (three complete ITS, seven partial ITS) and M. laxa (8 complete ITS, 10 partial ITS) differed consistently at four nucleotide positions. The fungus identified as M. fructicola was tested for pathogenicity on mature surface-sterilized ‘Pinot noir’ and ‘Riesling’ grapes. Under humid conditions, buff-colored sporodochia bearing conidia developed over the surface of the infected berries. This indicates that M. fructicola can cause decay of wine grapes and could be confused with bunch rot caused by Botrytis cinerea. Previously, M. fructicola was reported on grapes in Oklahoma, but likely these grapes were not Vitis vinifera (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of brown rot caused by M. fructicola on wine grapes in North America. 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aDNA 3aMonilinia fructicola 3aVitis vinifera 3aagar 3aconidia 3aethanol 3afungi 3agenes 3agerm tube 3agrowing season 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3alactic acid 3anew geographic records 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3aplant pathology 3aribosomal RNA 3asmall fruits 3asodium hypochlorite 3asurveys 3avineyards 3awine grapes 3aBritish Columbia 3aOklahoma1 aHaag, P.D.1 aHambleton, S.1 aBoulay, H.0 tPlant disease.g2003 Oct., v. 87, no. 10 p.1268-1268x0191-29177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS.2003.87.10.1268B3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140314  aOther US 7aarticle02648naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011800125300001600243500001500259520138700274650002801661650002301689650002601712650002001738650002101758650002501779650002201804650001001826650002301836650002601859650001101885650004301896653001601939700001901955700001701974773017901991852000902170930003302179945001302212946001302225655001202238IND2041731920221118024048.0940831e199403  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204173192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorrie, J.10aPotential evapotranspiration as a means of predicting irrigation timing in greenhouse tomatoes grown in peat bags  ap. 163-168.  a2019-12-05  aThe use of potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates to identify irrigation timing for greenhouse tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) grown in peat-based substrate was evaluated for a spring and fall crop. PET (using the Penman equation) was calculated from leaf, wet and dry bulb temperatures, and incident and reflected photosynthetic photon flux. Substrate matric potential (SMP) was monitored continuously using electronic tensiometers. Two irrigation starting setpoints (-4.5 and -6.5 kPa SMP) and two nutrient solution electrical conductivity (EC) treatments (1.5 and 3.0 dS.m(-1)) were factorially combined in a completely randomized design. Irrigation frequency was greater in treatments irrigated at -4.5 than at -6.5 kPa. The integral of calculated PET values was correlated with SMP for both experiments. Accumulated PET values were higher at the start of irrigation in the -6.5-kPa treatments for spring and fall crops. Nutrient solution EC did not influence irrigation frequency. Leaf pressure potential (LPP) was correlated to PET-predicted LPP (r(2) > 0.56) in plants subjected to high EC, low (-6.5 kPa) matric potential setpoint, or both treatments. PET and electronic tensiometer technology can be used jointly to improve irrigation management for tomatoes grown in peat-based substrates by more accurately responding to crop needs for water and nutrients. 3aelectrical conductivity 3aevapotranspiration 3agreenhouse production 3aair temperature 3asoilless culture 3aleaf water potential 3adiurnal variation 3abulbs 3anutrient solutions 3airrigation scheduling 3aleaves 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 0atemperature1 aGraham, M.E.D.1 aGosselin, A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1994 Mar., v. 119, no. 2 p.163-168aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle03257naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245012900122300001600251520198600267650002202253650001402275650001002289650001102299650001102310650001202321650001302333650002002346650001102366650001002377650001102387650001102398650001502409650002102424650002102445653001502466653001602481653001702497700001802514700002002532773017902552852000902731930003302740945001302773946001302786655001202799IND2041732920221118024043.0940831e199403  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204173292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, A.10aGrowth characteristics and root calcium absorption of watermelon seedlings as influenced by the fungicides captan and thiram  ap. 202-208.  aThe influence of two fungicide--captan and thiram--on growth and 45Ca absorption by roots of 'Starbrite' watermelon [Citrullus lanatus (Thunb.) Matsum. and Nakai] seedlings was investigated. Unilateral application of Ca+2 and Al in agar induced curvature in roots from untreated and pretreated seeds. In untreated seeds, PCMBS inhibited Ca+2-and Al-induced root curvature by 82% and 92%, respectively. In commercially pretreated seeds (captan + thiram), PCMBS inhibited Ca+2- but not Al-induced root curvature. Captan or thiram also inhibited Ca+2- or Al-induced root curvature, and the effects of captan and thiram on root curvature were additive. Serial concentration (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, or 100 mg.liter-1) tests indicated that captan inhibited 45Ca absorption the most at 100 mg.liter-1, whereas thiram inhibited 45Ca absorption the most at 0.01 mg.liter-1. The effects of captan and thiram on 45Ca absorption were statistically additive. Thiram seemed to influence Ca+2 uptake by affecting exofacial sulfhydryl groups (a mode of action similar to that of PCMBS). DTT reversed the inhibitory effect of thiram on 45Ca absorption by 34% but did not reverse the effect of captan. A field test showed that acidic soil (pH 4.55) reduced leaf number; leaf, stem, shoot, and whole-plant dry weights; and stem length of 15-day-old seedlings. Although there was no difference in root dry weights or root:shoot ratios of plants from pretreated and untreated seeds planted in soil at pH 6.26, planting commercially pretreated seeds in acidic soil produced plants with greater root dry weights and root: shoot dry weight ratios than those from untreated seeds. Seedlings showed a greater response to seed treatment in early growth stages. Captan and thiram may have influenced growth characteristics by inhibiting Al uptake of seedlings planted in acidic soil. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the influence of the fungicides captan and thiram on mineral ion uptake in roots. 3aCitrullus lanatus 3aseedlings 3aroots 3acaptan 3athiram 3acalcium 3aaluminum 3anutrient uptake 3aleaves 3astems 3ashoots 3aweight 3aacid soils 3aapplication rate 3aroot shoot ratio 0ainhibition 0agrowth rate 0aroot culture1 aLatimer, J.G.1 aWilkinson, R.E.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1994 Mar., v. 119, no. 2 p.202-208aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01760naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012100128300001400249500006300263520069000326650001801016650001101034650002701045650002301072650003601095650002201131651001001153700001701163700001701180700001701197700002201214700001401236773007001250852000901320930003301329945001301362946001101375655001201386IND2062805420221118023959.0980330e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206280542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBringmann, G.10aAncistroguineines A and B as well as ancistrotectorine-naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids from Ancistrocladus guineensis  ap. 37-43.  aPart 95 in the series "Acetogenic isoquinoline alkaloids."  aThe isolation of three naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids from the leaves of Ancistrocladus guineensis is described.

Thus, two hitherto unknown 5,8'-coupled naphthylisoquinolines, named ancistroguineines A and B, were isolated, constituting the first example of a pair of 3-epimeric naphthylisoquinoline alkaloids. Moreover, ancistrotectorine, a 7,3'-coupled alkaloid previously known only from the South-East Asian species Ancistrocladus tectorius, was isolated. Its absolute stereostructure was confined by oxidative degradation and by comparison of experimental and calculated CD spectra. 3aMagnoliopsida 3aleaves 3aisoquinoline alkaloids 3achemical structure 3achemical constituents of plants 3aspectral analysis 3aKenya1 aGünther, C.1 aBusemann, S.1 aSchaffer, M.1 aOlowokudejo, J.D.1 aAlo, B.I.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.37-43x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01491naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008500128300001200213520052000225650002100745650001100766650000900777650001700786650002500803650003600828650002200864700001700886700001500903700001800918700001500936700001500951700001700966773006800983852000901051930003301060945001301093946001101106655001201117IND2062791420221118024110.0980327e199801  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206279142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHisamatsu, T.10aIsolation and identification of GA112 (12 beta-hydroxy-GA12) in Matthiola incana  ap. 3-6.  aShoots and flower buds of stock (Matthiola incana (L) R.

Co-cultures or Atropa belladonna transformed roots and Duboisia hybrid shooty teratomas produced significant levels of scopolamine, whereas no scopolamine could be detected in separate root and shoot cultures. Maximum scopolamine levels found in co-cultured shoots were 4.8 mg g-1 dry weight in a 2 X 2.5-l dual bioreactor system, and 3.7 +/- 0.9 mg g-1 in dual l-1 shake flasks. Periodic crushing of the roots in shake flasks was effective in releasing hyoscyamine, but impaired growth and overall alkaloid synthesis. Less severe root damaging in the bioreactor was more successful in improving scopolamine accumulation. Uptake of hyoscyamine by shooty teratomas was inhibited at high hyoscyamine concentrations, was reduced in the presence of ATPase inhibitors, and could be significantly enhanced by pre-incubating the shoots on medium containing hyoscyamine. 3aAtropa belladonna 3aDuboisia 3amixtures 3asecondary metabolites 3aroots 3aneoplasms 3ashoots 3aalkaloids 3atransgenic plants 3amechanical damage 3aadenosinetriphosphatase 3abioreactors 3atissue culture 3agenotype1 aDoran, P.M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 Jan., v. 47, no. 1 p.17-25x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01169naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006100124300001800185520026100203650001000464650002300474650003600497650002200533650004400555650002100599653002600620700001400646700001600660700001500676773007400691852000900765930003300774945001300807946001100820655001200831IND2061891720221118024302.0980217e199712  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206189172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKouno, I.10aBisesquiterpenoid from the root of Lindera strychnifolia  ap. 1283-1284.  aFrom the root of Lindera strychnifolia, which is well known to contain many kinds of sesquiterpenes, a new bisesquiterpene has been isolated.

It was highest at the end of August (11.1 micromoles CO2 (micromoles chlorophyll)-1 hr-1) and decreased during the autumn and winter, reaching a minimum in February (0.6 micromoles CO2 (micromoles chlorophyll)-1 hr-1). In March, with increased light in the subarticum, the potential rose temporarily, and after another minimum at the beginning of May, the potential slowly rose to the summer level (2.3-6.5 micromoles CO2 (micromoles chlorophyll)-1 hr-1). The seasonal fluctuation pattern of the potential of net photosynthesis was the same when calculated on a dry weight basis. Seasonal changes also occurred in the chlorophyll content and in the contents of polar lipids, particularly DGDG (digalactosyl diacylglycerols) and PC (phosphatidyl choline) and less clearly in MGDG (monogalactosyl diacylglycerols), PE (phosphatidyl ethanolamine) and PG (phosphatidyl glycerols). The contents of chlorophylls, DGDG and PC increased during autumn and early winter during the hardening process and decreasing light and temperature. Their contents decreased in late winter and spring in response to dehardening and increased light and temperature in the subarcticum. Thus, the molar ratios of MGDG:DGDG and PE:PC varied throughout the year, being lowest in winter. In addition, fatty acids of individual lipid classes showed seasonal fluctuation. In both MGDG and DGDG, the proportion of linolenic acid was higher in summer than in winter and that of linoleic acid was vice versa. In both PC and PK, the proportion of palmitic acid was highest in summer and lowest in winter and, particularly in PC, this variation was compensated for by changes in linoleic acid and less clearly in linolenic acid, and, in PE, by the long-chain behenic acid. In PG, the proportions of trans-16:1 and oleic acid were higher in summer than in winter, whereas the proportions of palmitic and linoleic acids were higher in winter than in summer.

Geijerenes were not detected in the fruit oil. The essential oil yield of the transformed roots grown in one of the media was comparable with that obtained for the roots of the parent plant and, calculated on a dry weight basis, the oil yield of these hairy roots was comparable with that of the fruits. 3aPimpinella anisum 3aroots 3aessential oils 3achemical composition 3aRhizobium rhizogenes 3aculture media 3alight 3ayields 3agenetic transformation 3atransgenic plants 3atissue culture 0adry matter 0adark 0afruits1 aFigueiredo, A.C.1 aOlivera, M.M.1 aBarrosa, J.G.1 aPedro, L.G.1 aDeans, S.G.1 aYounus, A.K.M.1 aScheffer, J.J.C.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.455-460x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01957naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007200126300001600198520101700214650001901231650002101250650001601271650001301287650002001300650001101320650001301331650000701344650002201351650001301373653000901386653001101395653001301406700001401419773007201433852000901505930003301514945001301547946001101560655001201571IND2124323920221118024242.0980729e199806  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212432392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez, F.J.10aGibberellic acid stimulation of isoperoxidase from pedicel of grape  ap. 411-414.  aSoluble peroxidase activity from pedicels of cv. Thompson seedless grape was highly stimulated by post-bloom gibberellic acid (GA3) applications to vines. This stimulation was dependent on the dose employed and increased with berry ripening. In control vines, i.e. non GA3 treated, the level of peroxidase activity remained constant during berry ripening. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) analysis of soluble peroxidases from pedicel extracts performed in a 3-10 pH range, showed the presence of a main band that corresponded to an acidic isoperoxidase of (pI 3.5) and the presence of a minor band of (pI 3.9). It is a well-known fact that GA3 applications to cv. Thompson seedless grape beside producing berry enlargement cause berry-drop which has been associated with pedicel thickening. Here we found a positive correlation between pedicel thickness and peroxidase activity within the rates of GA3 used. The involvement of the acidic isoperoxidases in pedicel thickening and its relation to berry-drop are discussed. 3aVitis vinifera 3agibberellic acid 3aperoxidases 3aisozymes 3aenzyme activity 3adosage 3aripening 3apH 3aisoelectric point 3adiameter 0adrop 0afruits 0apedicels1 aGomez, M.0 tPhytochemistry.g1998 June, v. 48, no. 3 p.411-414x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01486naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007600126300001800202520041400220650001300634650001400647650001400661650002100675650000900696650002300705650003600728650002200764650004400786651000900830700001500839700001700854700001700871700001600888700001700904700001500921773007400936852000901010930003301019945001301052946001101065655001201076IND2123927520221118024056.0980710e199804  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND212392752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibota, O.10aTwo chalcone-prenylcoumarin diels-alder adducts from Brosimum rubescens  ap. 1381-1385.  aTwo new Diels-Alder type adducts, named palodesagretins I and II, were isolated from a Peruvian folk medicine 'palo de sangre" (Brosimum rubescens).

The detailed structure-property research demonstrates that the cold crystallization temperature of ground samples and the emission wavelengths of pristine samples are in good accordance with the packing density, conformation distortion and intermolecular interactions, but emission wavelengths of ground samples are slightly chain-dependent. For benzimidazoles with alkyl chains, longer and more branched chains can produce looser packings, which cause pristine samples to display red-shifted emission and reduced MFC activity. For benzimidazoles with a phenyl chain, the emission wavelengths of both the pristine and the ground samples are remarkably red-shifted. Moreover, the degree of conformation distortion is larger, and the cold crystallization temperature is higher. Interestingly, the homologue with the n-hexyl chain displays an intense ML effect that is mainly attributed to the heavy discharge quantity on largely enhanced discharge areas under force stimuli due to the great fragility of this crystal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenzimidazoles 3achemical interactions 3acold 3acrystallization 3aimidazoles 3atemperature 3awavelengths1 aLiu, Xiao-Jing1 aJia, Ran-Rong1 aXu, Tian-Hui1 aXia, Min0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 25, v. 9, no. 52 p.30381-30388dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra05255k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03002naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001500158245011000173300001400283520162500297592002801922650002401950650002001974650002401994650000902018650001302027650001002040650001402050650002402064650001602088653002502104653001002129653002002139653001802159653003102177653000702208653000802215653000702223653000802230700002202238700002002260700002102280700002102301773009602322856009302418852000902511655001202520IND60778527720221119183701.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Kettie10aHigh ambient temperature and humidity associated with early embryonic loss after embryo transfer in mares  ap. 37-42.  aIncreased ambient temperatures has been identified to contribute to reproductive outcomes for several domesticated species, but its impact on equine reproduction has not been previously investigated. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the relationship between ambient climatic conditions, as measured by temperature-humidity index (THI) between day 7 and day 14 of gestation, and early embryonic loss (EEL) in recipient mares undergoing embryo transfer. The study examined records from 834 embryo transfers at an equine breeding facility in Victoria, Australia. Early embryonic loss was defined as a negative transrectal ultrasound on day 14 of gestation after an embryo was transferred on day 7. Both maximum THI on the day of transfer (day 7) and mean THI between day 7 and day 14 were investigated for association with the outcome of EEL using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for confounders including embryo age and quality, recipient mare quality and embryo transfer quality. EEL was observed in 21% of embryo transfers. A five-unit increase in maximum THI on the day of transfer was associated with an 18% increase in the odds of EEL (p = 0.01). Similarly, the odds of EEL increased by 25% for each five-unit increase in mean THI between day 7 and 14 (p = 0.003). As both single and cumulative episodes of high THI were associated with increased EEL in embryo transfer mares from this equine breeding facility, further studies are warranted to identify similar effects in a broader population, establish causality and evaluate possible mitigation strategies in anticipation of heat waves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aembryo transfer 3aembryonic mortality 3aheat 3ahumidity 3amares 3apregnancy 3aregression analysis 3aultrasonics 0aEarly embryonic loss 0aMares 0aEmbryo transfer 0aHeat exposure 0aTemperature humidity index 0aCI 0aEEL 0aOR 0aTHI1 aPfeiffer, Caitlin1 aBurden, Chelsie1 aKrekeler, Natali1 aMarth, Christina0 tTheriogenology.g2022 Aug., v. 188 p.37-42dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2022.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02613naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011100168300001600279520160400295592002801899650002301927650001701950650001001967650001001977650000901987650002101996700001702017700002802034700002802062700002702090773010102117856004802218852000902266655001202275IND50085801820221118232139.0140412e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008580182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-014-0625-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGazal, Vinícius10aBehavioral responses of the arboreal termite Nasutitermes corniger (Isoptera: Termitidae) to wood extracts  ap. 581-590.  aThe termite Nasutitermes corniger is attracted to weathered wood, but it is not known whether this attraction is of chemical or physical nature. This work examines whether wood extracts can change the attraction of N. corniger to a food substrate. In a first experiment, filter paper impregnated with a eucalyptus extract, Eucalyptus grandis, and another one with a solvent were placed in the foraging arena of N. corniger nests under laboratory conditions. The extracts used were from weathered or unweathered wood. During the second experiment, two tests were performed using eucalyptus wood. First, a piece of unweathered wood was impregnated with an extract of weathered wood (treatment) or solvent (control). In the second test, a piece of weathered wood was impregnated with an extract of unweathered wood (treatment) and another one with solvent (control). At the end of the tests, the number of termite recruitment on each substrate was quantified. Filter paper recruited more termites when treated with unweathered wood extracts or with extracts of weathered wood than when impregnated with the solvent. Unweathered wood treated with extracts of weathered wood recruited more termites than the control. However, weathered wood impregnated with extracts of unweathered wood recruited similar numbers of termites as the same wood impregnated with the solvent. It was verified that chemicals from weathered or unweathered wood increased the foraging activity of N. corniger in neutral substrates, but only chemicals from weathered wood altered the attraction of N. corniger to eucalyptus wood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aNasutitermes 3afoods 3anests 3awood 3awood extractives1 aBailez, Omar1 aViana-Bailez, Ana Maria1 aAguiar-Menezes, Elen L.1 aMenezes, Eurípedes B.0 tWood science and technology.g2014 May, v. 48, no. 3 p.581-590dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-014-0625-4  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100001700188245007700205300001600282506007600298520070700374592002801081506003701109650001601146650001501162650001201177700001601189773011701205856008201322852000901404655001201413IND60516573420221207074647.0190727e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051657342DNAL7 aPMC46947242pmcid7 a232984492pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723120004682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, W.

Here, the results are extended to allow for the relatives’ ancestor being inbred. Inbreeding of a parent reduces variation in actual relationship among its offspring, by an amount that depends on the inbreeding level and the type of mating that led to that level. For descendants of full-sibs, the variation is reduced in later generations, but for descendants of half-sibs, it is increased.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achromosomes 3ainbreeding 3aprogeny1 aWEIR, B.

An insight on celiac consumers' opinions and expectations  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAs a result of increased research and development, people suffering from celiac disease have more options for gluten‐free (GF) products; but we still lack information about celiac consumer's opinions on GF food and whether their requirements are met by currently available products. In this study, we analyzed celiac consumers' opinions and perceptions on commercially available GF products—particularly bread—and provided insights for food scientists and producers. To this end, we applied projective techniques of sentence completion task, word association, free listing, and open‐ended questions. A total of 205 celiac consumers completed the online survey. Despite the rise of the GF market, celiac patients are dissatisfied with the taste, texture, price, and availability of GF products. Bread is a staple GF product, consumed daily by 93% of the participants. Results show that consumers expect improvements that result in the production of soft, moist, and tasty GF bread, with lower price and better availability. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: This study provides understanding about the celiac consumers' opinions, expectations and perceptions about gluten free products using projective techniques. Its results will help: (a) define strategies to improve sensory aspects, especially taste, texture and price of gluten‐free breads; (b) increase awareness and understanding of the food industry with information on perceptions that can be used when developing or enhancing commercially available products on the market. This study shows the effectiveness of projective techniques in obtaining consumer opinions on quality aspects of gluten‐free bread.  aPublisher supplied data  aFinance Code 001cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior 3aceliac disease 3afood industry 3agluten 3agluten-free bread 3amarkets 3aprices 3aresearch and development 3asurveys 3ataste 3atexture1 ade Araújo, Vitoria Alves1 aFaggian, Letícia1 ada Silveira Araújo, Marielle Batista1 aCapriles, Vanessa Dias1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8486-11120 tJournal of sensory studies.g2021 Aug., v. 36, no. 4 p.e12664-dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl66238x0887-82507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/joss.126643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011400166500001900280520185400299592002802153650002502181650001102206650001602217650003102233650002102264650001102285650001202296651001002308651001002318653002302328653002302351653001302374653003802387700001802425700002102443700001402464700001702478700002002495700002202515700005502537773011902592856008802711852000902799655001202808IND60704743620221121225554.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSi, Chao10aCapacity for clonal integration in introduced versus native clones of the invasive plant Hydrocotyle vulgaris  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aClonal plants can make up a disproportionately high number of the introduced, invasive plant species in a region. Physiological integration of connected ramets within clones is a key ecological advantage of clonal growth. To ask whether clonal integration underlies the invasiveness of clonal plants, we tested the hypothesis that introduced clones of an invasive species will show higher capacity for integration than native clones of the same species. We conduct a greenhouse experiment on the widespread, perennial herb Hydrocotyle vulgaris. Clonal fragments consisting of pairs of connected ramets from seven sites in northwestern Spain where the species is native and seven sites in southeastern China where the species is introduced and invasive were grown for 79 days with the younger, apical ramet shaded to 30% of ambient light and the connection between ramets either severed or left intact. Severance decreased the final dry mass and ramet number of the apical ramet and its offspring in nearly all clones and increased the mass or ramet number of the basal portion of the fragment in about half of the clones, but these effects did not differ consistently between native and introduced clones. Severance did affect allocation more in introduced than in native clones, decreasing root/total mass more in apical portions and increasing it more in basal portions. Maintaining the connection between ramets caused introduced, but not native, clonal fragments to produce more leaf and less root mass and thus to lower allocation to roots. Regardless of severance, introduced clones accumulated about twice as much mass as native clones. Results suggest that introduced clones of a species can show greater effects of integration on allocation than native clones. In species such as H. vulgaris, this might increase competitiveness for light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydrocotyle vulgaris 3aclones 3aenvironment 3agreenhouse experimentation 3ainvasive species 3aleaves 3aprogeny 3aChina 3aSpain 0aBiomass allocation 0aClonal integration 0aGenotype 0aIntroduced invasive plant species1 aAlpert, Peter1 aZhang, Jian-Feng1 aLin, Jing1 aWang, Yi-Yue1 aHong, Meng-Meng1 aRoiloa, Sergio R.1 aYu, Fei-Hai1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5007-17450 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.141056-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018000160300002000340520067800360592002801038650001401066650002901080650001601109700001401125700001901139700001401158700001701172773012401189856007501313852000901388655001201397IND60776424420221123031442.0220506e20220503xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077642442DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02127g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Kun,d1953-10aHighly selective cross-coupling reactions of 1,1-dibromoethylenes with alkynylaluminums for the synthesis of aryl substituted conjugated enediynes and unsymmetrical 1,3-diynes  ap. 13314-13318.  aA highly efficient method for the synthesis of aryl substituted conjugated enediynes and unsymmetrical 1,3-diynes via selective cross-coupling reactions of 1,1-dibromoethylenes with alkynylaluminums using the Pd(OAc)₂–DPPE and Pd₂(dba)₃–TFP complexes as catalysts, respectively, has been successfully developed.

A key feature of morbilliviruses is their ability to spread by virus&ndash;cell and cell&ndash;cell fusion. The latter process, which leads to syncytia formation in vitro and in vivo, is driven by the viral fusion (F) and haemagglutinin (H) glycoproteins. In this study, we demonstrate that MeV glycoproteins are sensitive to inhibition by bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2/Tetherin/CD317) proteins. BST2 overexpression causes a large reduction in MeV syncytia expansion. Using quantitative cell&ndash;cell fusion assays, immunolabeling, and biochemistry we further demonstrate that ectopically expressed BST2 directly inhibits MeV cell&ndash;cell fusion. This restriction is mediated by the targeting of the MeV H glycoprotein, but not other MeV proteins. Using truncation mutants, we further establish that the C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor of BST2 is required for the restriction of MeV replication in vitro and cell&ndash;cell fusion. By extending our study to the ruminant morbillivirus peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) and its natural host, sheep, we also confirm this is a broad and cross-species specific phenotype.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMeasles morbillivirus 3aSmall ruminant morbillivirus 3aantigens 3abone marrow 3agiant cells 3aglycoproteins 3ahemagglutinins 3ahumans 3amutants 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3asheep1 aHuman, Stacey 1 aAlderman, Joseph 1 aJobe, Fatoumatta 1 aLogan, Leanne 1 aRix, Thomas 1 aGonçalves-Carneiro, Daniel 1 aLeung, Corwin 1 aThakur, Nazia 1 aBirch, Jamie 1 aBailey, Dalan 0 tViruses.g2019 July 30, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v110806923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002500166245010300191300001600294520143900310592002801749650002201777650001301799650001501812650001101827650000901838650001401847650002301861650001101884650002401895650001501919650002601934650001201960650001401972650000901986651001201995700002302007700002402030700002602054700002402080773011402104856008202218852000902300655001202309IND60082452120221117155934.0210608e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008245212DNAL7 a252181902pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-014-3042-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenarsky, Michael P.10aQuantitative food web analysis supports the energy-limitation hypothesis in cave stream ecosystems  ap. 859-869.  aEnergy limitation has long been the primary assumption underlying conceptual models of evolutionary and ecological processes in cave ecosystems. However, the prediction that cave communities are actually energy-limited in the sense that constituent populations are consuming all or most of their resource supply is untested. We assessed the energy-limitation hypothesis in three cave streams in northeastern Alabama (USA) by combining measurements of animal production, demand, and resource supplies (detritus, primarily decomposing wood particles). Comparisons of animal consumption and detritus supply rates in each cave showed that all, or nearly all, available detritus was required to support macroinvertebrate production. Furthermore, only a small amount of macroinvertebrate prey production remained to support other predatory taxa (i.e., cave fish and salamanders) after accounting for crayfish consumption. Placing the energy demands of a cave community within the context of resource supply rates provided quantitative support for the energy-limitation hypothesis, confirming the mechanism (limited energy surpluses) that likely influences the evolutionary processes and population dynamics that shape cave communities. Detritus-based surface ecosystems often have large detrital surpluses. Thus, cave ecosystems, which show minimal surpluses, occupy the extreme oligotrophic end of the spectrum of detritus-based food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal production 3acrayfish 3aecosystems 3aenergy 3afish 3afood webs 3amacroinvertebrates 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3aprediction 3asalamanders and newts 3astreams 3asurpluses 3awood 3aAlabama1 aHuntsman, Brock M.1 aHuryn, Alexander D.1 aBenstead, Jonathan P.1 aKuhajda, Bernard R.0 tOecologia.g2014 Nov., v. 176, no. 3 p.859-869dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-3042-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245010200190300001600292520157600308592002801884650002301912650002101935650001801956650001101974650001501985650002802000650002402028650002302052700002202075700002202097773011702119856008202236852000902318655001202327IND60516573720221122034753.0190727e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051657372DNAL7 a233742402pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723120004932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVERBYLA, ARŪNAS P.10aRWGAIM: an efficient high-dimensional random whole genome average (QTL) interval mapping approach  ap. 291-306.  aMapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) underlying variation in quantitative traits continues to be a powerful tool in genetic study of plants and other organisms. Whole genome average interval mapping (WGAIM), a mixed model QTL mapping approach using all intervals or markers simultaneously, has been demonstrated to outperform composite interval mapping, a common approach for QTL analysis. However, the advent of high-throughput high-dimensional marker platforms provides a challenge. To overcome this, a dimension reduction technique is proposed for WGAIM for efficient analysis of a large number of markers. This approach results in reduced computing time as it is dependent on the number of genetic lines (or individuals) rather than the number of intervals (or markers). The approach allows for the full set of potential QTL effects to be recovered. A proposed random effects version of WGAIM aims to reduce bias in the estimated size of QTL effects. Lastly, the two-stage outlier procedure used in WGAIM is replaced by a single stage approach to reduce possible bias in the selection of putative QTL in both WGAIM and the random effects version. Simulation is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the dimension reduction approach as well as demonstrate that while the approaches are very similar, the random WGAIM performs better than the original and modified fixed WGAIM by reducing bias and in terms of mean square error of prediction of estimated QTL effects. Finally, an analysis of a doubled haploid population is used to illustrate the three approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromosome mapping 3adoubled haploids 3agenetic lines 3agenome 3aprediction 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits 3astatistical models1 aTAYLOR, JULIAN D.1 aVERBYLA, KLARA L.0 tGenetics research.g2012 Dec., v. 94, no. 6 p.291-306dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723120004933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02054naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245006400168300001400232520083900246592002801085650001001113650002201123650001501145650001401160650001201174650001301186650001501199650001601214650002401230653001301254653001201267653002001279653001701299653002601316653001501342700002601357700001701383700002101400773010301421856008701524852000901611655001201620IND60536194020221120110117.0190410e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053619402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.02.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Miri10aHeteropoly acid catalyzed hydrolysis of glycogen to glucose  ap. 61-68.  aComplete conversion of glycogen to glucose is achieved by using H3PW12O40·nH2O (HPW) and H4SiW12O40·nH2O (HSiW) as catalysts for the hydrolysis under optimized hydrothermal conditions (mass fraction of catalyst 2.4%, 373 K and 2 h reaction time). The reusability of the catalyst (HPW) was demonstrated. In addition to carrying out the glycogen hydrolysis in an autoclave, other novel methods such as microwave irradiation and sonication have also been investigated. At higher mass fraction of the heteropoly acids (10.5%), glycogen could be completely converted to glucose under microwave irradiation. Sonication of an aqueous solution of glycogen in the presence of HPW and HSiW also yielded glucose. Thus, heteropoly acids are efficient, environmentally friendly and reusable catalysts for the conversion of glycogen to glucose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aaqueous solutions 3aautoclaves 3acatalysts 3aglucose 3aglycogen 3ahydrolysis 3amethodology 3amicrowave radiation 0aGlycogen 0aGlucose 0aHeteropoly acid 0aHydrothermal 0aMicrowave irradiation 0aSonication1 aPulidindi, Indra Neel1 aPerkas, Nina1 aGedanken, Aharon0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 May, v. 76 p.61-68dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.02.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03775naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002300111024003100134024002200165024001900187024003400206040001800240100001700258245013100275506007600406506017300482520146000655592002802115596008002143596004502223506003702268650001602305650002402321650002302345650001102368650002302379650002502402650001002427650001702437650001402454650004302468650001202511651001302523700002802536700002002564700002502584700001602609700002002625700002102645700003502666700002002701773011802721856011402839856007702953956012503030961000903155852000903164655001203173IND60647249120221214225024.0190711e20190514xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064724912DNAL7 a3319832aris7 a10113/64724912hdl7 a10.3390/plants80501272doi7 aPMC65718562pmcid7 a310917272pmid7 a10.3390/plants80501272chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShakir, Sara10aNon-cultivated Cotton Species (Gossypium spp.) Act as a Reservoir for Cotton Leaf Curl Begomoviruses and Associated Satellites  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aA collection of cultivated and non-cultivated species of cotton (Gossypium spp.) has been maintained for the last four decades in Multan, Pakistan. This geographical location has been observed as a hotspot for the evolution of begomoviruses and satellites associated with cotton leaf curl disease (CLCuD). Recent studies showed that begomoviruses responsible for the CLCuD epidemic in the 1990s, and that almost disappeared from the CLCuD complex in 2000s, have been observed again in CLCuD-infected cotton fields. To identify host species that acted as probable reservoirs for these viruses, we characterized begomoviruses and satellites in non-cultivated cotton species G. raimondii, G. thurberi and G. mustelinum and identified several species of CLCuD associated begomoviruses and satellites. Further, phylogenetic analysis indicated that the identified begomoviruses and beta/alphasatellites are closely related to the ones associated with the most recent CLCuD complex. qPCR indicated that the comparative level of virus significantly decreased in the presence of alphasatellites. Our results indicated that non-cultivated cotton species have been continuously challenged by diverse begomoviruses and associated satellites and act as reservoirs for CLCuD associated begomoviruses. These results provide novel insights into understanding the spread of begomoviruses and associated satellites in New World cotton species introduced into the Old World.  aPublisher supplied data  cHigher Education Commission Pakistandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004681  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBegomovirus 3aGossypium raimondii 3aGossypium thurberi 3acotton 3adisease reservoirs 3adisease transmission 3ahosts 3aleaf curling 3aphylogeny 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aviruses 3aPakistan1 aZaidi, Syed  Shan-e-Ali1 aAtiq-ur-Rehman,1 aFārūq, Muḥammad,1 aAmin, Imran1 aScheffler, Jodi1 aScheffler, Brian1 aShah Nawaz-ul-Rehman, Muhammad1 aMansoor, Shahid0 tPlants.g2019 May 14, v. 8, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/64724913Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants80501273Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttps://submit.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Scheffler%20Log%20No.%20331983%20-%20Published.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245013400186300001300320520092300333592002801256650001801284650002101302650004001323650001401363650001001377650001001387650001201397650002501409650001101434650002401445650001201469650007201481650003201553650002301585650003101608650002001639650002801659650002801687650002001715650007701735650002301812650003701835700002101872700002201893700002101915700002601936700002701962773009901989856008102088852000902169655001202178IND4418084020221121214714.0160225e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441808402DNAL7 a190437372pmid7 a10.1007/s00436-008-1287-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFoster, Jeremy M.14aThe Wolbachia endosymbiont of Brugia malayi has an active phosphoglycerate mutase: a candidate target for anti-filarial therapies  ap. 1047.  aPhosphoglycerate mutases (PGM) interconvert 2- and 3-phosphoglycerate in the glycolytic and gluconeogenic pathways. A putative cofactor-independent phosphoglycerate mutase gene (iPGM) was identified in the genome sequence of the Wolbachia endosymbiont from the filarial nematode, Brugia malayi (wBm). Since iPGM has no sequence or structural similarity to the cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase (dPGM) found in mammals, it may represent an attractive Wolbachia drug target. In the present study, wBm–iPGM cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli was mostly insoluble and inactive. However, the protein was successfully produced in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis and the purified recombinant wBm–iPGM showed typical PGM activity.

In Morocco, CE is a major zoonosis, despite the implementation of a national control program since 2007. Therefore, in 2016, a field trial that associates the EG95 vaccine (lambs) and anthelmintic treatment (dogs) was started in the Mid Atlas, the most endemic region in Morocco, with preliminary positive results. Here, a qualitative approach was used to analyze the feasibility and social acceptability of this strategy. Fifteen focus group discussions were separately conducted with breeders and with their wives, and forty-two individual interviews were performed with private-sector veterinarians and officers from structures responsible for the CE control program. Recordings were transcribed and analyzed with the R software, using the RQDA package. This qualitative research was validated using the credibility, transferability, dependability and confirmability criteria. This study showed that the professionals' views on sheep vaccination and anthelmintic treatment were divided between acceptability and concerns. Conversely, breeders and their wives highlighted the issue of the costs of procedures the utility of which was not immediately clear to them. All participants proposed solutions to improve this strategy, and also stressed the lack of education on CE. By bringing together the views of the communities and the professionals, this study traced the main lines (targeting the different aspects of CE and taking into account the local socio-cultural beliefs) that must be taken into account to ensure the short- and long-term CE control in Morocco.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthelmintics 3acomputer software 3aechinococcosis 3aeducation 3afield experimentation 3afocus groups 3aprivate sector 3aqualitative analysis 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aveterinary medicine 3azoonoses 3aMorocco 0aCystic echinococcosis 0aEG95 vaccine 0aAnthelmintic treatment of dogs 0aFeasibility 0aAcceptability1 aAntoine-Moussiaux, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1575-625X1 aSahibi, Hamid1 aFilali, Hind1 aMarcotty, Tanguy1 aThys, Séverine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7936-31940 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2021 July, v. 192 p.105373-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2021.1053733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02416naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009300168300001400261520116100275592002801436650002501464650001801489650002401507650001301531650003101544650001201575653002401587653001901611653000901630653002401639653002301663653002001686700002201706700002001728700001801748700001601766700002101782773009701803856008501900852000901985655001201994IND60570625220221120235322.0170708e20170710xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057062522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZilony, Neta10aProlonged controlled delivery of nerve growth factor using porous silicon nanostructures  ap. 51-59.  aAlthough nerve growth factor (NGF) is beneficial for the treatment of numerous neurological and non-neurological diseases, its therapeutic administration represents a significant challenge, due to the difficulty to locally deliver relevant doses in a safe and non-invasive manner. In this work, we employ degradable nanostructured porous silicon (PSi) films as carriers for NGF, allowing its continuous and prolonged release, while retaining its bioactivity. The PSi carriers exhibit high loading efficacy (up to 90%) of NGF and a continuous release, with no burst, over a period of>26days. The released NGF bioactivity is compared to that of free NGF in both PC12 cells and dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We show that the NGF has retained its bioactivity and induces neurite outgrowth and profound differentiation (of >50% for PC12 cells) throughout the period of release within a single administration. Thus, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the immense therapeutic potential of these tunable carriers as long-term implants of NGF reservoirs and paves the way for new localized treatment strategies of neurodegenerative diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3ananomaterials 3anerve growth factor 3aneurites 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3asilicon 0aNerve growth factor 0aPorous silicon 0aPC12 0aDorsal root ganglia 0aControlled release 0aDifferentiation1 aRosenberg, Michal1 aHoltzman, Liran1 aSchori, Hadas1 aShefi, Orit1 aSegalʹ, Ėster,0 tJournal of Controlled Release.g2017 July 10, v. 257 p.51-59dElsevier B.V.x0168-36597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2016.12.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002500188245010700213300001600320506007600336520169300412592002802105506003702133650002302170650002102193650002102214650001202235650001502247650001002262650001502272650001602287650002602303650002102329650001402350650001702364650001702381650001002398650002602408650001502434700001902449773011402468856008202582852000902664655001202673IND60082452420221207124056.0210608e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008245242DNAL7 aPMC42079602pmcid7 a251943492pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-014-3047-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakker, Elisabeth S.10aExperimental evidence for enhanced top-down control of freshwater macrophytes with nutrient enrichment  ap. 825-836.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe abundance of primary producers is controlled by bottom-up and top-down forces. Despite the fact that there is consensus that the abundance of freshwater macrophytes is strongly influenced by the availability of resources for plant growth, the importance of top-down control by vertebrate consumers is debated, because field studies yield contrasting results. We hypothesized that these bottom-up and top-down forces may interact, and that consumer impact on macrophyte abundance depends on the nutrient status of the water body. To test this hypothesis, experimental ponds with submerged vegetation containing a mixture of species were subjected to a fertilization treatment and we introduced consumers (mallard ducks, for 8 days) on half of the ponds in a full factorial design. Over the whole 66-day experiment fertilized ponds became dominated by Elodea nuttallii and ponds without extra nutrients by Chara globularis. Nutrient addition significantly increased plant N and P concentrations. There was a strong interactive effect of duck presence and pond nutrient status: macrophyte biomass was reduced (by 50 %) after the presence of the ducks on fertilized ponds, but not in the unfertilized ponds. We conclude that nutrient availability interacts with top-down control of submerged vegetation. This may be explained by higher plant palatability at higher nutrient levels, either by a higher plant nutrient concentration or by a shift towards dominance of more palatable plant species, resulting in higher consumer pressure. Including nutrient availability may offer a framework to explain part of the contrasting field observations of consumer control of macrophyte abundance.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAnas platyrhynchos 3aChara globularis 3aElodea nuttallii 3abiomass 3abody water 3aducks 3afreshwater 3amacrophytes 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3apalatability 3aplant growth 3aponds 3atrophic relationships 3avegetation1 aNolet, Bart A.0 tOecologia.g2014 Nov., v. 176, no. 3 p.825-836dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-3047-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03837naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245008600173500001900259520216600278592002802444650001902472650002402491650001002515650001302525650002202538650002902560650001402589650001502603650001402618650002202632650002402654650001502678650002302693650001202716650001902728650002102747653001802768653001502786653001402801653001802815653001102833700001302844700001602857700005202873700001502925700001702940700005202957700005803009773011903067856008803186852000903274655001203283IND60704744020221121165643.0201023e20201210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaodong10aDepression of soil nitrogen fixation by drying soil in a degraded alpine peatland  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSoil biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) represents a major pathway through which nitrogen enters pristine peatlands. Many peatlands have been undergoing human-induced changes in environmental factors, while environmental changes dramatically affect the community composition and activity of nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes (i.e., diazotrophs). However, the impact of peatland degradation on soil BNF remains unclear. By carrying out a field campaign, we examined how soil BNF varies along a natural gradient from pristine marshes to moderately-degraded meadows and sandy meadows on the Zoige Plateau. Plant and topsoil samples from four pristine marshes, three moderately-degraded meadows, and three sandy meadows were collected to determine the potential rate of nitrogen fixation (RNfᵢₓ), abundance of the nifH gene, diazotrophic community composition, and soil and plant characteristics. Our results showed that topsoil RNfᵢₓ varied in the range 0.018–3.00 μmol N g d.w.⁻¹ day⁻¹ (i.e. 21.74–1632.37 mg N m⁻² day⁻¹) across the ten sites, being lowest in sandy meadows and highest in pristine marshes. Topsoil RNfᵢₓ and diazotrophic abundance were positively correlated with soil water content, sedge cover, plant biomass, soil organic carbon content, and total nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Soil water content, which affected most plant and soil characteristics, had dominant influences on the abundance and community structure of diazotrophs. The RNfᵢₓ was closely correlated with the abundance of dominant diazotroph groups. The community composition of diazotrophs differed markedly among sites of different degradation levels. Proteobacteria was the most abundant diazotrophic phylum across the ten sites. Heterotrophic diazotrophs acted as the major contributor to BNF, especially in pristine marshes and moderately-degraded meadows. We conclude that soil water content was the main factor driving the depressed soil BNF during peatland degradation in Zoige, due to soil water effects on plant cover and biomass, soil organic carbon and total phosphorus, and the abundance and community structure of diazotrophs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProteobacteria 3acommunity structure 3agenes 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3apeatlands 3aphosphorus 3aphytomass 3aprokaryotic cells 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3atopsoil 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal phosphorus 0aZoige Plateau 0aDiazotroph 0anifH gene 0aSoil moisture 0aMeadow1 aJia, Xin1 aWu, Haidong1 aLi, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9718-27681 aYan, Liang1 aWang, Jinzhi1 aLi, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9146-80441 aKang, Xiaoming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0528-13960 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 10, v. 747 p.141084-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01512naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001200140245013800152300002000290520051600310592002800826650002300854650001400877650001200891700001800903700001500921700001900936700001800955700001600973773012500989856007501114852000901189655001201198IND60776424820221123031631.0220506e20220428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077642482DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra02473j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Jie10aPalladium-catalysed difluoroolefination of benzyl tosylates toward the synthesis of gem-difluoro-2-trifluromethyl styrene derivatives  ap. 12983-12987.  aWe have presented an efficient method to access gem-difluoro-2-trifluromethyl styrene derivatives via palladium catalysis.

The oligomeric assembly of mtHsp60 into heptameric ring structures that enclose a folding chamber only occurs upon addition of ATP and is significantly more labile than that of GroEL, where the only oligomeric species is a tetradecamer. The lability of the mtHsp60 heptamer provides an opportunity to detect and visualize lower-order oligomeric states that may represent intermediates along the assembly/disassembly pathway. Using cryo-electron microscopy we show that, in addition to the fully-formed heptamer and an “inverted” tetradecamer in which the two heptamers associate via their apical domains, thereby blocking protein substrate access, well-defined lower-order oligomeric species, populated at less than 6% of the total particles, are observed. Specifically, we observe open trimers, tetramers, pentamers and hexamers (comprising ∼4% of the total particles) with rigid body rotations from one subunit to the next within ∼1.5–3.5° of that for the heptamer, indicating that these may lie directly on the assembly/disassembly pathway. We also observe a closed-ring hexamer (∼2% of the particles) which may represent an off-pathway species in the assembly/disassembly process in so far that conversion to the mature heptamer would require the closed-ring hexamer to open to accept an additional subunit. Lastly, we observe several classes of tetramers where additional subunits characterized by fuzzy electron density are caught in the act of oligomer extension.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3achaperonins 3acryo-electron microscopy 3ahumans 3amitochondria 3amolecular biology 3aproteome 0achaperones 0aclass I chaperonins 0ahuman mitochondrial Hsp60 0asparsely-populated lower-order oligomeric states 0acryo-EM 0amtHsp601 aCanagarajah, Bertram1 aSchwieters, Charles D.1 aClore, Marius,0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Dec. 03, v. 433, no. 24 p.167322-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1673223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02287naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010700162300002000269520120400289592002801493650002201521650001201543650001501555650002101570650001301591650001301604650001701617650002201634650003401656650002201690700001801712773012401730856007401854852000901928655001201937IND60664624920221119145358.0190912e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066462492DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43505a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamaddar, Pallabi10aCompetent arsenicals: aqueous biphasic extractions and their application in nitrate/nitrite speciation  ap. 20750-20757.  aThe present article reports on the speciation of As(v) and As(iii) using aqueous biphasic extraction based on a polyethylene glycol–salt system. For the detection of these inorganic arsenicals the salts of As(v) and As(iii) are converted to their respective arsenomolybdenum blues having the formulae [AsⱽMo₄ⱽ Mo₈ⱽᴵO₄₀]⁷⁻ and [AsᴵᴵᴵMo₄ⱽ Mo₈ⱽᴵO₄₀]⁹⁻ and measured for their absorption spectra at 820 nm. These blue species are different in their extraction behaviour with the aqueous biphasic system. Once the blue solutions are formed they could further find application in the speciation of nitrite and nitrate in aqueous solution. A high molecular weight polymer, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was found to have a better efficiency to differentiate the nitrite and nitrate species. Kinetic studies show a proper decay rate of the As-blues with nitrite and no sensitivity for the nitrate species in PVA medium. This has been attributed to the structural property of PVA and its changes in the presence of the heteroplyacids. The results have been explained on the basis of changes in structural topology as revealed by the scanning electron microscope images.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3aarsenic 3aarsenicals 3amolecular weight 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apolyethylene 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3ascanning electron microscopes 3aspectral analysis1 aSen, Kamalika0 tRSC advances.g2013 Oct. 16, v. 3, no. 43 p.20750-20757dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra43505a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012100166506010400287506007600391520187700467592002802344506003702372650002202409650003102431651001502462651000902477653001502486653001602501653000902517653001602526653001202542653002102554653001902575700001902594700002402613700002402637773009102661856008202752852000902834655001202843IND60724202720221207092252.0220523e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072420272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jag.2021.1022962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Dijk, Daan10aSpectral signature analysis of false positive burned area detection from agricultural harvests using Sentinel-2 data  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAccurate mapping of burned area is of key importance for fire emissions modeling and post-fire rehabilitation planning. In this research, Sentinel-2 data were used to analyze the difference in spectral signature between burned area and false positives from agricultural harvests. 26 fires that were mapped in the field using Global Navigation Satellite System during 2017 and 2018 were analyzed over California and Utah, USA. Individual Sentinel-2 bands and a wide range of commonly used spectral indices for burned area were tested using a spectral separability index. The separability index assessed discrimination between the classes burned area and 1) unburned area and 2) area in agricultural land that were flagged as false positive from agricultural harvest. Separability values higher than one indicate good separation and the higher the values, the better the separation. For each class, we first determined the multitemporal difference, i.e. the absolute value of the pre-minus-post-change value. Second, we compared with other classes by using the spectral separability index. We found that for the burned-to-unburned comparison the near and shortwave infrared spectral regions and spectral indices that make use of these spectral regions, were the best discriminators (separability (M) values of approximately 2), corroborating findings from earlier works. For the burned-to-agricultural false positive comparison Sentinel-2 bands 4 and 5, corresponding with the Red and Red-edge spectral regions, were the best discriminator (M−values greater than 2). Consequently, spectral indices containing the Red band show a similar strong separability of agricultural false positives. The results from our research reveal an additional layer of information that could be exploited to minimize false positives in agricultural lands in space-borne burned area products.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagricultural land 3aglobal positioning systems 3aCalifornia 3aUtah 0aSentinel-2 0aBurned area 0aFire 0aAgriculture 0aHarvest 0aSpectral indices 0aFalse positive1 aShoaie, Sorosh1 aLeeuwen, Thijs van,1 aVeraverbeke, Sander0 tITC journal.g2021 May, v. 97 p.102296-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:22337x1569-84327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2021.1022963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013500159300001800294500002000312520177300332592002802105650001702133650002002150650001302170650001102183650002002194650001402214650001502228650001202243650002302255650001402278650001102292650001402303650001402317650002602331650001402357650001402371700001502385700001602400700001902416773011602435856007302551852000902624655001202633IND60572250120221120043201.0170712e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057225012DNAL7 a10.1111/jeb.129572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaumgartner, M.10aProtistan predation interferes with bacterial long‐term adaptation to substrate restriction by selecting for defence morphotypes  ap. 2297-2310.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBacteria that are introduced into aquatic habitats face a low substrate environment interspersed with rare productive ‘hotspots’, as well as high protistan grazing. Whereas the former condition should select for growth performance, the latter should favour traits that reduce predation mortality, such as the formation of large cell aggregates. However, protected morphotypes often convey a growth disadvantage, and bacteria thus face a trade‐off between investing in growth or defence traits. We set up an evolutionary experiment with the freshwater isolate Sphingobium sp. strain Z007 that conditionally increases aggregate formation in supernatants from a predator–prey coculture. We hypothesized that low substrate levels would favour growth performance and reduce the aggregated subpopulation, but that the concomitant presence of a flagellate predator might conserve the defence trait. After 26 (1‐week) growth cycles either with (P+) or without (P−) predators, bacteria had evolved into strikingly different phenotypes. Strains from P− had low numbers of aggregates and increased growth yield, both at the original rich growth conditions and on various single carbon sources. By contrast, isolates from the P+ treatment formed elevated proportions of defence morphotypes, but exhibited lower growth yield and metabolic versatility. Moreover, the evolved strains from both treatments had lost phenotypic plasticity of aggregate formation. In summary, the (transient) residence of bacteria at oligotrophic conditions may promote a facultative oligotrophic life style, which is advantageous for survival in aquatic habitats. However, the investment in defence against predation mortality may constrain microbial adaptation to the abiotic environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSphingomonas 3aaquatic habitat 3abacteria 3acarbon 3acell aggregates 3acoculture 3afreshwater 3agrazing 3agrowth performance 3alifestyle 3amorphs 3amortality 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apredation 3apredators1 aNeu, T.

MSC-exosomes enhanced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in tumor cells by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) pathway. Inhibition of ERK1/2 activation reserved the increase of VEGF level by MSC-exosomes.

Comparisons of leaf chemistry were made among leaves that experienced variable levels of crab damage. Because R. mangle is the crab's preferred food source based on damage patterns in the field, comparisons of R. mangle leaf chemistry were made in relation to that of the black mangrove Avicennia germinans and the white mangrove Laguncularia racemosa. We observed a negative relationship between level of leaf damage and percent dry weight of nitrogen, carbohydrates, condensed tannins, and sclerophylly. In contrast, a positive relationship was found between leaf damage and the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The chemical constituents that provided the best explanation for differences in damage among the three mangrove species include condensed tannins, nitrogen, carbon:nitrogen ratio, carbohydrates, phenolics, water content, and ash. The results from this study suggest that chemistry only partially explains food preference by A. pisonii. It appears that A. pisonii feeding behavior and preference may be influenced by a more complex series of factors and interactions, which may include reproduction by, predation on, and interspecific competition with A. pisonii.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAratus pisonii 0aAvicennia germinans 0aFlorida 0aherbivory 0aLaguncularia racemosa 0amangrove 0anitrogen 0aRhizophora mangle 0atannin1 aBell, Susan S.1 aDawes, Clinton J.0 tBiotropica.g2004 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.333-343dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F031943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245008100167300001600248520148500264536042301749592002802172650001502200650001502215650002002230650002102250650001602271653002902287653002202316653002502338653001902363700002402382700001802406773014302424856008602567852000902653655001202662IND60779571020221122060156.0220610e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077957102DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2020.18203442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiayi10aLow-Rank Covariance Function Estimation for Multidimensional Functional Data  ap. 809-822.  aMultidimensional function data arise from many fields nowadays. The covariance function plays an important role in the analysis of such increasingly common data. In this article, we propose a novel nonparametric covariance function estimation approach under the framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) that can handle both sparse and dense functional data. We extend multilinear rank structures for (finite-dimensional) tensors to functions, which allow for flexible modeling of both covariance operators and marginal structures. The proposed framework can guarantee that the resulting estimator is automatically semipositive definite, and can incorporate various spectral regularizations. The trace-norm regularization in particular can promote low ranks for both covariance operator and marginal structures. Despite the lack of a closed form, under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator can achieve unified theoretical results that hold for any relative magnitudes between the sample size and the number of observations per sample field, and the rate of convergence reveals the phase-transition phenomenon from sparse to dense functional data. Based on a new representer theorem, an ADMM algorithm is developed for the trace-norm regularization. The appealing numerical performance of the proposed estimator is demonstrated by a simulation study and the analysis of a dataset from the Argo project.

In this work, a novel LSPR-enhanced ECL emission from CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) by Au NDs for the detection of nucleic acid is reported. This system is composed of a thin film of CdTe NCs on glassy carbon electrode (GCE) as anodic ECL emitter and Au NDs as plasmon enhancer. DNA tetrahedron embedded with a stem-loop hairpin structure on one edge was applied as a switch to regulate the distance between CdTe NCs and Au NDs. At original state, the hairpin structure was closed and DNA tetrahedron played in a relaxed state on CdTe NCs film. The ECL emission of CdTe NCs was quenched by proximal Au NDs due to Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which was defined as the “turn-off” mode. After the complementary hybridization with target DNA, the hairpin structure changed to a rodlike configuration, resulting in an increased distance between CdTe NCs and Au NDs, and a significant enhancement of ECL induced by LSPR of Au NDs, which was defined as a “turn-on” mode. Along with the asymmetric modification method, a controllable and versatile pathway for modifying nanomaterials, the ECL sensor performed well with great stability and repeatability for nucleic acid detection in the range from 1.0 to 500 fM. Considering the high sensitivity and selectivity in the serum sample assay, this proposed method indicates a great potential for bioassay application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abioassays 3ablood serum 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectromagnetic field 3aenergy transfer 3aglassy carbon electrode 3ananocrystals 3ananogold 3anucleic acid hybridization1 aFeng, Qiu-Mei1 aZhou, Zhen1 aZhao, Wei1 aXu, Jing-Juan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9579-93181 aChen, Hong-Yuan0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 90, no. 2 p.1340-1347dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245012900166300001600295520155000311592002801861650002001889650001901909650001001928650000901938650001001947650001101957650002001968650000801988650001801996650000902014650001902023650001902042650001002061651001902071653001502090653002502105653001302130653001602143653001202159653001702171700002202188700001602210773009602226856008202322852000902404655001202413IND60691345620200616000000.0200429e20041201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069134562DNAL7 a10.2752/0892793047856432302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaylor, Heidi10aHomelessness and dog ownership: an investigation into animal empathy, attachment, crime, drug use, health and public opinion  ap. 353-368.  aA sample of 51 homeless people in Cambridge, UK completed a questionnaire featuring adapted Animal Empathy and Companion Animal Bonding Scales. Concepts of crime, drug use, and health matters amongst the homeless, both dog owning and non-dog owning, were investigated, as well. Ninety members of the general public completed a similar questionnaire which sought their opinions on homeless people who own dogs. There was a highly significant difference (p < 0.01) between the homeless and the securely housed on their animal empathy and attachment scores, with the homeless sample displaying higher values. Gender and dog ownership status had no effect on these scores. A near significant result (U = 2, n₁ = 13, n₂ = 58, p = 0.06) was revealed for animal empathy scores of those who gave money to dog-owning homeless people and those who gave to non-dog owning homeless people. Of the public respondents, women were significantly more likely to show concern for a homeless person's dog's welfare than men (X²₍₁₎ = 8.5, p < 0.01), and of the homeless respondents, non-dog owners were significantly more likely than dog owners to believe that having a dog helped initiate conversations with the public (X²₍₁₎ = 4.0, p < 0.05). Highly significant differences (U = 10, n₁ = 31, n₂ = 20, p < 0.01) were found for medical care use between the dog-owning and non-dog owning homeless, and health scores showed a reversed trend compared to that expected for the general population, with dog owners scoring lower than non-dog owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal diseases 3aanimal welfare 3acrime 3adogs 3adrugs 3agender 3ahomeless people 3amen 3apet ownership 3apets 3apublic opinion 3aquestionnaires 3awomen 3aUnited Kingdom 0aattachment 0adog ownership status 0adrug use 0ahealth care 0aempathy 0ahomelessness1 aWilliams, Pauline1 aGray, David0 tAnthrozoös.g2004 Dec. 1, v. 17, no. 4 p.353-368dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793047856432303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02893naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002500142245010200167300002000269520174000289592002802029650000902057650002202066650002202088650001302110650001102123650001802134650001502152650001902167650001702186650001702203650001402220700006202234773014902296856007702445852000902522655001202531IND60612336620221119203244.0180907e20180809xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061233662DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b054632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiontkowski, Zachary10aExcited-State Planarization in Donor–Bridge Dye Sensitizers: Phenylene versus Thiophene Bridges  ap. 11046-11057.  aDonor−π–acceptor complexes for solar energy conversion are commonly composed of a chomophore donor and a semiconductor nanoparticle acceptor separated by a π bridge. The electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor is known to be large when the π systems of the donor and bridge are coplanar. However, the accessibility of highly coplanar geometries in the excited state is not well understood. In this work, we clarify the relationship between the bridge structure and excited-state donor–bridge coplanarization by comparing rhodamine sensitizers with either phenylene (O-Ph) or thiophene (O-Th) bridge units. Using a variety of optical spectroscopic and computational techniques, we model the S₁ excited-state potential surfaces of O-Ph and O-Th along the dihedral coordinate of donor–bridge coplanarization, τ. We find that O-Th accesses a nearly coplanar (τ = 8°) global minimum geometry in S₁ where significant intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character is developed. The S₁ coplanar geometry is populated in <10 ps and is stable for ca. 1 ns. Importantly, O-Ph is sterically hindered from rotation along τ and therefore remains at its initial S₁ equilibrium geometry far from coplanarity (τ = 56°). Our results demonstrate that donor–bridge dye sensitizers utilizing thiophene bridges should facilitate strong donor–acceptor coupling by an ultrafast and stabilizing coplanarization mechanism in S₁. The coplanarization will result in strong donor–acceptor coupling, potentially increasing the electron transfer efficiency. These findings provide further explanation for the success of thiophene as a bridge unit and can be used to guide the informed design of new molecular sensitizers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adyes 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy conversion 3ageometry 3amodels 3ananoparticles 3arhodamines 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3aspectroscopy 3athiophene1 aMcCamant, David W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9095-040X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Aug. 09, v. 140, no. 35 p.11046-11057dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b054633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02082naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008600160520107500246592002801321650002001349650001901369650001501388650001101403650001601414650002901430650001101459651001001470700001701480700001701497700001601514773013001530856007501660852000901735655001201744IND60794341920221118050143.0220922e20220918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079434192DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141846562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hongmiao 10aLand Cover Classification for Polarimetric SAR Images Based on Vision Transformer  aDeep learning methods have been widely studied for Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) land cover classification. The scarcity of PolSAR labeled samples and the small receptive field of the model limit the performance of deep learning methods for land cover classification. In this paper, a vision Transformer (ViT)-based classification method is proposed. The ViT structure can extract features from the global range of images based on a self-attention block. The powerful feature representation capability of the model is equivalent to a flexible receptive field, which is suitable for PolSAR image classification at different resolutions. In addition, because of the lack of labeled data, the Mask Autoencoder method is used to pre-train the proposed model with unlabeled data. Experiments are carried out on the Flevoland dataset acquired by NASA/JPL AIRSAR and the Hainan dataset acquired by the Aerial Remote Sensing System of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The experimental results on both datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3aimage analysis 3aland cover 3amodels 3apolarimetry 3asynthetic aperture radar 3avision 3aChina1 aXing, Cheng 1 aYin, Junjun 1 aYang, Jian 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 18, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245004600167300001600213520177800229536007202007592002802079650001502107650001402122650001202136650001602148653002002164653002802184653002602212653002102238653003002259653002602289700002002315700001802335773014302353856008602496852000902582655001202591IND60779571220221122080208.0220610e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077957122DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2020.18254472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lazhi10aWarp Bridge Sampling: The Next Generation  ap. 835-851.  aBridge sampling is an effective Monte Carlo (MC) method for estimating the ratio of normalizing constants of two probability densities, a routine computational problem in statistics, physics, chemistry, and other fields. The MC error of the bridge sampling estimator is determined by the amount of overlap between the two densities. In the case of unimodal densities, Warp-I, II, and III transformations are effective for increasing the initial overlap, but they are less so for multimodal densities. This article introduces Warp-U transformations that aim to transform multimodal densities into unimodal ones (hence “U”) without altering their normalizing constants. The construction of a Warp-U transformation starts with a normal (or other convenient) mixture distribution that has reasonable overlap with the target density p, whose normalizing constant is unknown. The stochastic transformation that maps back to its generating distribution is then applied to p yielding its Warp-U version, which we denote . Typically, is unimodal and has substantially increased overlap with . Furthermore, we prove that the overlap between and is guaranteed to be no less than the overlap between p and , in terms of any f-divergence. We propose a computationally efficient method to find an appropriate , and a simple but effective approach to remove the bias which results from estimating the normalizing constant and fitting with the same data. We illustrate our findings using 10 and 50 dimensional highly irregular multimodal densities, and demonstrate how Warp-U sampling can be used to improve the final estimation step of the Generalized Wang–Landau algorithm, a powerful sampling and estimation approach.

The degrees of reduction of bacterial cells in smears were estimated by growing the exposed smears in routine bacterial media and by studying the surviving bacterial growth density in a spectrophotometer at 600nm.The study also revealed various parameters at which the selected pathogenic bacterial smear cells succumbed to microwave radiation, under such conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3anonthermal processing 3amicrowave treatment 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3afood safety 3abacterial contamination 3amodel food systems 3amortality 3abacterial colonization 3afood processing quality 0amicrowaves 0apathogen 0abacteria 0acell growth turbidity1 aSiores, Elias1 aLamb, Andrew0 tInternational journal of food engineering.g2010 Oct. 11, v. 6, no. 5dDe Gruyterx1556-37587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2202/1556-3758.18783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002300135245009100158300001600249520123200265592002801497653002101525653001401546653001901560653001501579653001101594653001401605653001201619653001201631700002501643700001901668773010301687856007101790852000901861655001201870IND60125365220221122054415.0151103e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012536522DNAL7 a10.1646/040052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBucher, Enrique H.10aHerbivory by Leaf-cutting Ants: Nutrient Balance between Harvested and Refuse Material  ap. 327-332.  aFrom an ecological standpoint, the symbiosis between leaf-cutting ants and their fungus can be described as an herbivore feeding on plant material harvested by the ants, metabolized by the fungus, and finally removed by the ants as refuse. Here, we report on a nutrient balance (soluble and insoluble carbon and nitrogen compounds) between harvested and refuse material collected from six Acromyrmex lundi nests from a semiarid woodland in Cóórdoba, Argentina. The nutrient balance was calculated using cellulose as an indicator. Harvested material had low protein (10%%) and high fiber content (57%%). Refuse material was rich in fiber (53%%), total nitrogen (2%%), and ash content (28%%). Balance was negative for soluble carbon and phenols. Soluble fibers, lignin, and true protein remained unchanged. Surprisingly, crude protein and all soluble nitrogen fractions had a positive balance, suggesting additional nitrogen sources besides plant material. Phenol utilization by the leaf-cutting ant fungus suggests that phenols are not harmful to the fungus. Inability to metabolize insoluble carbon compounds and a net nitrogen gain in the refuse material were peculiar and interesting features of the ant––fungus system.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcromyrmex lundi 0aArgentina 0aChaco woodland 0aCóórdoba 0afibers 0aherbivory 0aphenols 0aprotein1 aMarchesini, Victoria1 aAbril, Adriana0 tBiotropica.g2004 Sept., v. 36, no. 3 p.327-332dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F040053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03232naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245010000213300001800313520165800331592002801989650000802017650002602025650001802051650001502069650001802084650002502102650002002127650001702147650001502164650001102179650001202190650002402202650001102226650001402237650001402251650001302265650001302278700001902291700002002310700002202330700002402352700002102376700002002397700001702417700005902434773012802493856008402621852000902705655001202714IND60598597720221120091735.0180702e20180112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerez-Guaita, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2640-292710aMultispectral Atomic Force Microscopy-Infrared Nano-Imaging of Malaria Infected Red Blood Cells  ap. 3140-3148.  aAtomic force microscopy-infrared (AFM-IR) spectroscopy is a powerful new technique that can be applied to study molecular composition of cells and tissues at the nanoscale. AFM-IR maps are acquired using a single wavenumber value: they show either the absorbance plotted against a single wavenumber value or a ratio of two absorbance values. Here, we implement multivariate image analysis to generate multivariate AFM-IR maps and use this approach to resolve subcellular structural information in red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum at different stages of development. This was achieved by converting the discrete spectral points into a multispectral line spectrum prior to multivariate image reconstruction. The approach was used to generate compositional maps of subcellular structures in the parasites, including the food vacuole, lipid inclusions, and the nucleus, on the basis of the intensity of hemozoin, hemoglobin, lipid, and DNA IR marker bands, respectively. Confocal Raman spectroscopy was used to validate the presence of hemozoin in the regions identified by the AFM-IR technique. The high spatial resolution of AFM-IR combined with hyperspectral modeling enables the direct detection of subcellular components, without the need for cell sectioning or immunological/biochemical staining. Multispectral-AFM-IR thus has the capacity to probe the phenotype of the malaria parasite during its intraerythrocytic development. This enables novel approaches to studying the mode of action of antimalarial drugs and the phenotypes of drug-resistant parasites, thus contributing to the development of diagnostic and control measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aRaman imaging 3aabsorbance 3aantimalarials 3adevelopmental stages 3adrug resistance 3aerythrocytes 3ahemoglobin 3alipids 3amalaria 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3aparasites 3aphenotype 3astaining 3avacuoles1 aKochan, Kamila1 aBatty, Mitchell1 aDoerig, Christian1 aGarcia-Bustos, Jose1 aEspinoza, Shirly1 aMcNaughton, Don1 aHeraud, Phil1 aWood, Bayden R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3581-447X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 12, v. 90, no. 5 p.3140-3148dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03765naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011300163300001400276520189200290592002802182650001102210650003102221650002102252650001402273650001902287650001402306650002502320650001502345650001002360650003802370650001902408650002802427650001602455650001702471650001002488650001602498650000902514650004302523650005202566650002302618650002402641650001202665650001802677650003602695650001602731653001102747653001702758653003602775653003302811653001402844653001702858700001802875700001402893700001302907700002002920773009602940856008203036852000903118655001203127IND60628121620221121112911.0190523e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062812162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.01.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhiling10aRutaecarpine ameliorated sepsis-induced peritoneal resident macrophages apoptosis and inflammation responses  ap. 11-20.  aSepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction disease caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Rutaecarpine is an important alkaloid component of Evodia rutaecarpa. There has been no study on the therapeutic effects of rutaecarpine in sepsis.Mice were randomly assigned into four groups: sham, sepsis, sepsis plus vehicle and sepsis plus rutaecarpine groups. Mice in sepsis were administered CLP surgery. Rutaecarpine or vehicle was injected intraperitoneally 1 h after CLP. The liver damage, bacterial infection, survival rate and weight loss were observed, and changes in the ratio of peritoneal resident macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy. Western blotting was used to identify the levels of NF-κB signaling pathway, ER stress and apoptosis related proteins. TUNEL and Annexin V/PI assay were used to detect the apoptosis of liver tissues and peritoneal resident macrophages, respectively. ELISA and qRT-PCR were used to detect the inflammatory factors.Rutaecarpine alleviated weight loss, bacterial infection and liver injury, and regulated inflammation homeostasis, enhancing survival rate induced by sepsis. Population of peritoneal resident macrophages (CD11b+F4/80hiMHCIIlow) was significantly decreased in sepsis mice, which was resulted from ER stress-induced apoptosis through caspase-12 signaling pathway. Rutaecarpine restored the ratio of peritoneal resident macrophages and the level of GATA6 in CD11b+ peritoneal macrophages. Rutaecarpine could also attenuate sepsis–induced inflammatory responses through inhibiting the activation of ER stress/NF-κB pathway.Rutaecarpine ameliorated sepsis-induced peritoneal resident macrophages apoptosis and inflammation responses through inhibition of ER stress-mediated caspase-12 and NF-κB pathways. Our study provided new insights for drug development against sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuodia 3aGATA transcription factors 3aWestern blotting 3aalkaloids 3aanimal tissues 3aapoptosis 3abacterial infections 3acaspase-12 3adrugs 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aflow cytometry 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3aliver 3amacrophages 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asepsis (infection) 3asignal transduction 3asurgery 3asurvival rate 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3aweight loss 0aSepsis 0aRutaecarpine 0aPeritoneal resident macrophages 0aEndoplasmic reticulum stress 0aApoptosis 0aInflammation1 aYang, Mingshi1 aPeng, Yue1 aGao, Min1 aYang, Bingchang0 tLife sciences.g2019 July 01, v. 228 p.11-20dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.01.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008200171300001600253520116400269592002801433650002001461650002401481650001401505650000901519653002801528653003301556653002701589653003201616700002301648700002301671700002001694773014301714856008601857852000901943655001201952IND60779571420221122080234.0220610e20220403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077957142DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2020.18254492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yan Dora10aBayesian Regression Using a Prior on the Model Fit: The R2-D2 Shrinkage Prior  ap. 862-874.  aPrior distributions for high-dimensional linear regression require specifying a joint distribution for the unobserved regression coefficients, which is inherently difficult. We instead propose a new class of shrinkage priors for linear regression via specifying a prior first on the model fit, in particular, the coefficient of determination, and then distributing through to the coefficients in a novel way. The proposed method compares favorably to previous approaches in terms of both concentration around the origin and tail behavior, which leads to improved performance both in posterior contraction and in empirical performance. The limiting behavior of the proposed prior is , both around the origin and in the tails. This behavior is optimal in the sense that it simultaneously lies on the boundary of being an improper prior both in the tails and around the origin. None of the existing shrinkage priors obtain this behavior in both regions simultaneously. We also demonstrate that our proposed prior leads to the same near-minimax posterior contraction rate as the spike-and-slab prior.

Characterizing roundness by defining a quantitative shape descriptor is of great importance. Due to the geometrical complexity of realistic particles, it remains a considerable challenge to establish a 3D quantitative roundness descriptor. In this context, a robust numerical approach is developed for quantitative and precise computation of a roundness descriptor for granular particles. Corner identification and sphere-fitting algorithms are developed to compute the 3D roundness descriptor Rd³ᴰ. Finally, the proposed method is applied to different granular particles, e.g., superball particles, bank gravel and crushed rock. The results indicate that the proposed Rd³ᴰ descriptor can provide reasonable and robust evaluations of particle roundness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3agranules 3agravel 3amechanical properties 3apowders 3aquantitative analysis 0aParticle shape 0a3D morphology 0aRoundness1 aWang, Xiang1 aLiang, Zhengyu1 aGong, Jian0 tPowder technology.g2018 Aug., v. 336 p.584-593dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245013900159300001600298520148000314592002801794650002001822650001801842650001401860650001301874650001201887650001601899650001901915650001801934650003901952650002001991650000902011650002402020650002602044650001702070653002602087653001302113653000902126653003602135653001102171700001902182700001702201700001302218773009802231856008202329852000902411655001202420IND60628121720221121144325.0190213e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062812172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.lfs.2019.01.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin10aContribution of acid sphingomyelinase to angiotensin II-induced vascular adventitial remodeling via membrane rafts/Nox2 signal pathway  ap. 303-310.  aVascular adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) in the vascular remodeling during atherosclerosis are increasing arousing attention. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) is a soluble glycoprotein which is involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. However, it remains unknown if ASM is expressed in vascular AFs and regulates vascular adventitial remodeling and underlying mechanisms.ASM downregulation with gene silencing was used in the rat AFs treated with angiotensin (Ang) II, which is universally demonstrated to induce vascular adventitia remodeling. It was showed that ASM was indeed expressed in vascular AFs and ASM downregulation resulted in a significant decrease in the protein level of PCNA and collagen I and cell migration under Ang II stimulation. Such improvement of adventitial remodeling was not further augmented by Ang-(1–7), which is deemed as an endogenous Ang II blocker. We further found that ASM downregulation blocked the Nox2-dependent superoxide (O2−) generation, which regulated vascular remodeling in AFs under Ang II. ASM siRNA decreased the aggregation of membrane rafts (MRs) and the consequent recruiting of ceramide and Nox2 in MRs.In conclusion, these results suggested that ASM downregulation could improve vascular adventitial remodeling which was attributed to inhibiting MRs/Nox2 redox signaling pathway in AFs. Thus, these data supported the idea that ASM is a potential therapeutic target for diabetic vascular complication.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3acell movement 3aceramides 3acollagen 3aenzymes 3afibroblasts 3agene silencing 3aglycoproteins 3aproliferating cell nuclear antigen 3aprotein content 3arats 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atherapeutics 0aAcid sphingomyelinase 0aCeramide 0aNox2 0aVascular adventitial fibroblast 0aAng II1 aWang, Hui-Fang1 aLi, Xiao-Xue1 aXu, Ming0 tLife sciences.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 219 p.303-310dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.01.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03368naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245009700181300001400278520143100292592002801723650002501751650002101776650001601797650001301813650001401826650002701840650001701867650002601884650002101910650000901931650001301940650002001953650001401973650004401987650001202031650002902043650002802072650004502100650000902145650004602154650005902200650003502259650000902294650001702303650004502320650005602365700002502421700002002446700002502466700002102491700002202512700002502534700001902559773010702578856004802685852000902733655001202742IND4447051520221121061211.0121003e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444705152DNAL7 a203583082pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-010-8643-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Ajmal10aSynergistic Effect of Selenium and Melatonin on Neuroprotection in Cerebral Ischemia in Rats  ap. 81-96.  aThe synergistic scavenger effects of selenium and melatonin collectively we called Se-Mel was studied on the prevention of neuronal injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion. Male Wistar rats were treated with sodium selenite (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and melatonin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 30 min before the middle carotid artery occlusion (MCAO) and immediately after MCAO to male Wistar rats and was continued for 3 days once daily at the interval of 24 h. Behavioral activity (spontaneous motor activity and motor deficit) was improved in Se-Mel-treated rats as compared to MCAO group rats. The level of glutathione and the activity of antioxidant enzymes was depleted significantly while the content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, protein carbonyl, and nitric oxide radical (NO·) was increased significantly in MCAO group. Systemic administration of Se-Mel ameliorated oxidative stress and improves ischemia/reperfusion-induced focal cerebral ischemia. Se-Mel also inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in Se-Mel+MCAO group as compared to MCAO group rats. Thus, Se-Mel has shown an excellent neuroprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury through an anti-ischemic pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the pretreatment with Se-Mel at the onset of reperfusion, reduced post-ischemic damage, and improved neurological outcome following transient focal cerebral ischemia in male Wistar rat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acarotid arteries 3aglutathione 3aischemia 3amelatonin 3aneuroprotective effect 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3aselenium 3asodium selenite 3asynergism 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolism 2aGlutathionexmetabolism 2aIschemic Attack, Transientxdrug therapy 2aMale 2aMelatoninxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aNeuroprotective Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSeleniumxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substancesxmetabolism1 aKhan, Mohd.

The method was developed and improved for more efficient, user-friendly and systematic studies based on our earlier experience. In this work, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) from Showa Denko® and the corresponding acid modified products were explored. The adsorption at low concentration was found to follow a Langmuir isotherm. Adsorption equilibrium constant (Keq.) and maximum surface coverage (Γmax) were determined based on the model. In general, the ionomer showed stronger adsorption for MWCNTs (Keq.=21−377 depending on treatment) comparing to Vulcan (Keq.=18), and slightly lower monolayer coverage. The interaction was found to be strongly affected by surface composition, morphology, porosity and oxygen containing functional groups, which are varied with purification and functionalization treatments. The modification of the surface properties was also studied with HR-TEM, BET, porosity measurement, EDXS, XPS, Raman and TG. The results will contribute to optimize electrode preparation with novel nano-carbon catalyst supports and durable catalyst for low temperature (LT) PEMFCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3afuel cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3amoieties 3asurface area 3aporosity 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3aelectrodes 3amodels 3atransmission electron microscopy 3asulfonic acids 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3afluorine 3aoxygen 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 0asulfonic acid1 aBorghei, Maryam1 aDhiman, Rajnish1 aJiang, Hua1 aRuiz, Virginia1 aKauppinen, Esko1 aSkou, Eivind0 tCarbon.g2014 May, v. 71 p.218-228dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.01.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04595naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245020200169500001900371520258800390592002802978650004403006650002203050650001503072650001503087650002203102650001303124650002803137650001803165650001503183650003703198650000903235650001903244650001603263650001303279650001403292650001603306650002703322650001303349650002403362650002003386650002303406650002103429650002103450650003703471650001603508653001403524653001303538653002503551700002103576700006203597700002503659700001903684700002903703700002903732773011303761856008603874852000903960655001203969IND60724203620221122101104.0210226e20210505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072420362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1248402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Sushma10aAdsorption of cationic dyes, drugs and metal from aqueous solutions using a polymer composite of magnetic/β-cyclodextrin/activated charcoal/Na alginate: Isotherm, kinetics and regeneration studies  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, we successfully synthesized novel polymer gel beads based on functionalized iron oxide (Fe3O4), activated charcoal (AC) particles with β-cyclodextrin (CD) and sodium alginate (SA) polymer (Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA), by a simple, reproducible and inexpensive method. These beads proved to be versatile and strong adsorbents with magnetic properties and high adsorption capacity. The composites were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, vibrating sample magnetometry, adsorption at −196 °C, high resolution transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and point of zero charge measurements. Two dyes, two drugs and one metal were used to test the adsorption capability of the prepared polymer nanocomposite. The adsorbent showed good removal efficiencies for the studied pollutants, especially the cationic dyes and the metal, when compared to other low-cost adsorbents. The saturated adsorption capacity of Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA reached 5.882 mg g−1 for methyl violet (MV), 2.283 mg g−1 for brilliant green (BG), 2.551 mg g−1 for norfloxacin (NOX), 3.125 mg g−1 for ciprofloxacin (CPX), 10.10 mg g−1 for copper metal ion (Cu(II)). The adsorption isotherm studies showed that data fitted well with Langmuir and Temkin isotherms models. The kinetic data showed good correlation coefficient with low error function for the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The data analysis was carried out using error and regression coefficient functions for the estimation of best-fitting isotherm and kinetic models, namely: chi-square test (χ2) and sum of the squares of errors (SSE). The activation energy was found to be 47.68 kJ mol−1 for BG, 29.09 kJ mol−1 for MV, 28.93 kJ mol−1 for NOX, 4.53 kJ mol−1 for CPX and 17.08 kJ mol−1 for Cu(II), which represent chemisorption and physisorption behavior of sorbent molecules. The polymer composites can be regenerated and easily separated from aqueous solution without any weight loss. After regeneration, the Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA beads still have good adsorption capacities up to four cycles of desorption and adsorption. The results indicate that the polymer gel beads are promising adsorbents for the removal of different categories of toxicants (like dyes, drugs and metal) in single adsorbate aqueous systems. Thus, the novel Fe3O4/CD/AC/SA beads can be effectively employed for a large-scale applications as environmentally compatible materials for the adsorption of different categories of pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aactivation energy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acharcoal 3achi-square distribution 3aciprofloxacin 3adesorption 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agels 3agentian violet 3airon oxides 3akinetics 3amagnetism 3anorfloxacin 3apolymer nanocomposites 3apolymers 3aregression analysis 3asodium alginate 3asorption isotherms 3athermogravimetry 3atoxic substances 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aweight loss 0aToxicants 0aIsotherm 0aRegeneration studies1 aAsthana, Anupama1 aSingh, Ajaya Kumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8180-72921 aCakrabartī, Rūpā,1 aVidya, S.

We now show the involvement of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the regulation of vorinostat-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Vorinostat induced the hyperacetylation of histone H3, which correlated to apoptosis induction. Vorinostat-induced apoptosis occurred in parallel with the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and the dephosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Knockdown of p38 MAPK prominently abrogated apoptosis induction and was accompanied by decreased caspase-3 cleavage. These findings support the notion that the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway followed by caspase-3 cleavage is responsible for vorinostat-induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abreast neoplasms 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle 3adephosphorylation 3ahistone deacetylase 3ahistones 3ahumans 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aphosphorylation 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aBlotting, Western 2aBreast Neoplasmsxphysiopathology 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHydroxamic Acidsxpharmacology 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aUp-Regulation 2ap38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinasesxmetabolism1 aKanematsu, Sayaka1 aMiki, Hisanori1 aYoshizawa, Katsuhiko1 aTsubura, Airo0 tCancer letters.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 2 p.112-121dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.07.0323Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03331naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255520173900271592002802010650001902038650001002057650001802067650001802085650002402103650001202127650001902139653005002158653001902208653001802227653002402245653002502269653000702294653000802301653000802309653000802317653000902325653001402334653001002348653000802358700005802366700001302424700001602437700002002453700002102473700001802494700001502512700005702527773009902584856008502683852000902768655001202777IND60601801820221119215357.0201125e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060180182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Wenhao10aNumerical simulation of hydrodynamic behaviors in a novel gas-solids conical downer  ap. 573-583.  aThe flow behaviors in a series of novel gas-solids co-current downflow conical fluidized beds (conical downers; 7 m in height, 0.14 m inlet diameter, 0.02, 0.04, 0.07 and 0.14 m outlet diameters), which are expected to realize a high-density solids holdup along a downer-type pyrolyzer to strengthen the heat transfer efficiency, were systematically investigated by means of a numerical approach. A 2D, transient, Eulerian–Eulerian two fluid model based on the kinetic theory of granular flow with a k-ε turbulence model for gas phase was adopted to simulate the hydrodynamics of the conical downer and explore possibilities of achieving a high density solids holdup in the bed. In order to avoid the different effects of different boundary coefficients on the simulation results, a boundary condition which can realize the adjustment without changing the related parameters was used here. The results demonstrated that the conical downer was beneficial to the enhancement of solids holdup. This was more obvious at Ug = 1 m/s in this study. According to the analysis of the axial distributions of pressure and velocity, the unique hydrodynamics of three axial acceleration regions were characterized, which was different from traditional downer. In addition, it was found that the length of the third acceleration region increased with the increase in gas velocity but decrease in outlet diameter of the conical downer. Also, the conical downer was able to save a large amount of carrier gas and reduce the percentage of carrier gas in the follow-up mixture gas. These results are expected to be a guidance for the design of an efficient downer-type pyrolyzer in a triple-bed combined circulating fluidized bed gasifier.  aPublisher supplied data 3afluidized beds 3agases 3aheat transfer 3ahydrodynamics 3amathematical models 3apowders 3aturbulent flow 0aTriple-bed combined circulating fluidized bed 0aConical downer 0aFlow behavior 0aHigh density holdup 0aNumerical simulation 0aBC 0aBFB 0aCFD 0aDEM 0aKTGF 0aPC-SIMPLE 0aTBCFB 0aTFM1 aYang, Jingxuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6006-83521 aLi, Peng1 aWang, Junli1 aZhang, Zhonglin1 aFushimi, Chihiro1 aHao, Xiaogang1 aHuang, Wei1 aGuan, Guoqing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5875-35960 tPowder technology.g2018 Aug., v. 336 p.573-583dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2018.06.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01731naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011500170520055500285592002800840650001400868650001700882650002100899650001800920650002300938650002500961653003200986653001701018653001701035653001801052700001601070700001601086700001701102700001601119700001501135773009801150856008801248852000901336655001201345IND60777814720221118002304.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077781472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1132402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Kaicheng10aIsoquinoline alkaloids from the Corydalis tomentella with potential anti-hepatoma and antibacterial activities  aSix undescribed isoquinolines, including one rarely reported N-benzyl isoquinoline together with sixteen known ones were isolated from C. tomentella.

There has been a considerable amount of research and debate surrounding the use of enclosure style and/or animal behavior to act as indicators of animal welfare. There are assumptions, supported by some studies but contradicted by others, that naturalistic enclosures and the expression of “wild behavior” inherently promote good welfare. These assumptions also appear to be used by the public to judge the welfare of zoo-housed animals. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether visitors to Paignton Zoo Environmental Park, UK, were using these assumptions to judge the welfare of zoo-housed animals. Visitors (n=42) were shown two series of photographs (n=8 in each series), one representing different primate enclosure styles and one depicting different tiger behaviors. The visitors were asked to rank the photographs in response to a series of questions (n=4 primate enclosure; n=5 tiger behavior). The public were consistent in their assessment of enclosure styles, which confirmed they held the assumption that naturalistic enclosures are good; all respondents rated the greenest enclosure highly and thought its inhabitants would have the best welfare. The interpretation of captive tiger behavior was also consistent across respondents, but this did not clearly indicate that they thought wild behavior was good. Most respondents thought that tigers in captivity and in the wild performed similar behavior. However, they did not think that expression of wild-type behavior was indicative of good welfare in captivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanthera tigris 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal welfare 3acaptive animals 3aphotographs 3azoo animals 3azoos 3aUnited Kingdom 0abehavior 0aenclosure 0anaturalistic 0aprimate 0atiger 0azoo visitor1 aMcCormick, W.1 aGibbs, A.0 tAnthrozoös.g2004 June 1, v. 17, no. 2 p.98-108dRoutledgewJournal:2060x1753-03777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2752/0892793047869917923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002400181245013100205300001800336506007600354520125700430592002801687506003701715650004801752650001301800650001301813650001001826650001201836650001501848650002101863650003001884650001401914700001901928700002101947700002301968700001801991700002302009700002302032773013702055856008002192852000902272655001202281IND4468113120221207080040.0120328e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446811312DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.05818-112doi7 aPMC32331132pmcid7 a220030152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElguezabal, Natalia10aEstimation of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis Growth Parameters: Strain Characterization and Comparison of Methods  ap. 8615-8624.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe growth rate of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis was assessed by different methods in 7H9 medium supplemented with OADC (oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, catalase), Tween 80, and mycobactin J. Generation times and maximum specific growth rates were determined by wet weight, turbidometric measurement, viable count, and quantitative PCR (ParaTB-Kuanti; F57 gene) for 8 M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains (K10, 2E, 316F, 81, 445, 764, 22G, and OVICAP 49). Strain-to-strain differences were observed in growth curves and calculated parameters. The quantification methods gave different results for each strain at specific time points. Generation times ranged from an average of 1.4 days for viable count and qPCR to approximately 10 days for wet weight and turbidometry. The wet-weight, turbidometry, and ParaTB-Kuanti qPCR methods correlated best with each other. Generally, viability has been assessed by viable count as a reference method; however, due to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis clumping problems and the presence of noncultivable M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis cells, we conclude that qPCR of a single-copy gene may be used reliably for rapid estimation of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis bacterial numbers in a sample.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aalbumins 3acatalase 3agenes 3aglucose 3aoleic acid 3aparatuberculosis 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviability1 aBastida, Felix1 aSevilla, Iker A.1 aGonzÃ¡lez, Nuria1 aMolina, Elena1 aGarrido, Joseba M.1 aJuste, RamÃ³n A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 77, no. 24 p.8615-8624dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.05818-113Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012100175300001800296520155100314592002801865650002701893650002401920650001301944650000901957650001501966650000701981650002001988650001902008650001902027650001302046650001602059650001102075650002602086700002202112700002002134700002502154700001802179700006202197773012802259856008402387852000902471655001202480IND60598598120221120060358.0180702e20180117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859812DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUpadhyay, Prabhat K.12aA Phosphorescent Trinuclear Gold(I) Pyrazolate Chemosensor for Silver Ion Detection and Remediation in Aqueous Media  ap. 4999-5006.  aWe report a phosphorescent chemosensor based on a trinuclear Au(I) pyrazolate complex or [Au(3-CH₃,5-COOH)Pz]₃ (aka Au₃Pz₃) stabilized in aqueous chitosan (CS) polymer media. Au₃Pz₃ is synthesized in situ within aqueous CS media at pH ∼ 6.5 and room temperature (RT). Au₃Pz₃ exhibits strong red emission (λₘₐₓ ∼ 690 nm) in such solutions. On addition of silver salt to Au₃Pz₃/CS aqueous media, a bright-green emissive adduct (Au₃Pz₃/Ag⁺) with a peak maximum within 475–515 nm is developed. The silver adduct exhibits a 4-fold increase in quantum yield (0.19 ± 0.02) compared to Au₃Pz₃ alone (0.05 ± 0.01), along with a corresponding increase in phosphorescence lifetime. With almost zero interference from 15 other metal ions tested, Au₃Pz₃ exhibits extreme selectivity for Ag⁺ with nM/ppb detection limits (6.4−72 ppb, depending on %CS and on the sensitivity basis being a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) = 3 or a baseline-corrected signal change = 10%). Au₃Pz₃ exhibits sensitivity to higher concentrations (>1 mM) of other metal ions (Tl⁺/Pb²⁺/Gd³⁺). The sensing methodology is simple, fast, convenient, and can even be detected by the naked eye. On addition of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), the red Au₃Pz₃ emission can be restored. Au₃Pz₃ and its silver adduct retain their characteristic photophysical properties in thin film forms. Remarkable photostability with <7% photobleaching after 4 h of UV irradiation is attained for Au₃Pz₃ solutions or thin films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aambient temperature 3achitosan 3agold 3ametal ions 3apH 3aphosphorescence 3aphotobleaching 3aphotostability 3apolymers 3aremediation 3asilver 3aultraviolet radiation1 aMarpu, Sreekar B.1 aBenton, Erin N.1 aWilliams, Corshai L.1 aTelang, Ameya1 aOmary, Mohammad A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3247-34490 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 17, v. 90, no. 8 p.4999-5006dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b043343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245015400170300002000324520168400344592002802028650002002056650004402076650002202120650001502142650002302157650002402180650001702204650001402221650001302235650001102248650000902259650001302268650001802281650001502299650001402314650001102328650002302339650001302362650001102375650001902386650003002405650003702435700002202472700003402494700001702528773012402545856007402669852000902743655001202752IND60664626120221119145236.0190912e20131016xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066462612DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43524e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMendoza-Reséndez, Raquel10aSynthesis of metallic silver nanoparticles and silver organometallic nanodisks mediated by extracts of Capsicum annuum var. aviculare (piquin) fruits  ap. 20765-20771.  aSilver-based nanostructures were prepared through reduction/oxidation reactions of aqueous silver nitrate solutions mediated by extracts of red fruits of the piquin pepper (Capsicum annuum var. aviculare) at room temperature. Detailed morphological and microstructural studies using X-ray diffraction, conventional and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction revealed that the product was constituted by three kinds of nanoparticles. One of them was composed of twinned metallic silver nanoparticles with a size of few nanometers. Other kind of particles was ultrafine disk-like single crystals of silver 4,4′-dimethyldiazoaminobenzene, being in our best knowledge the first time that this compound is reported in the form of nanoparticles. Both kinds of nanoparticles experienced processes of self-assembly and subsequent grain growth to form the third kind of nanoparticles. Such resulting nanostructures are monocrystalline and flattened metallic silver nanoparticles that have diameters around tens of nanometers, the [112] direction perpendicular to the particle plane, and are coated by a surface organometallic layer and residues of biomolecules. The ultraviolet-visible spectrum of the biosynthesized product showed a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) extinction band with an absorbance maximum at around 400 nm, thereby confirming the presence of fine Ag particles.

Accumulating evidence indicates that Stat3 plays an important role in tumorigenesis of various primary cancers and cancer cell lines by upregulating cell survival proteins and downregulating tumor suppressors. We propose that the Stat3 pathway is also involved in acquired drug resistance of gastric cancer. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression and activation of Stat3 in drug resistant gastric cancer cell lines. Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-PCR determined that Stat3 and its target genes were overactivated and/or overexpressed in drug resistant cells. Inhibition of Stat3 function resulted in significant decreases in cisplatin resistance and enhanced apoptosis in drug resistant cells. The levels of Stat3 target oncogenes such as Bcl-2 and c-Myc were decreased with DPP, a Stat3 inhibitor, treatment, while the expression of tumor suppressor p53 was increased. Interestingly, the vacuolar ATPase, a proton pump which interferes the uptake of therapeutic drugs, was down regulated by Stat3 inhibition. In conclusion, these data supported the hypothesis that interruption of Stat3 signaling could reverse resistance to chemotherapy agents in human gastric cancer cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenesis 3adrug therapy 3acell viability 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3acisplatin 3agene overexpression 3ahumans 3amultiple drug resistance 3astomach neoplasms 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aWestern blotting 3aproton pump 3aoncogenes 3aapoptosis 2aAdenocarcinomaxphysiopathology 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferation 2aCisplatinxpharmacology 2aDrug Delivery Systems 2aDrug Resistance, Multiplexdrug effects 2aDrug Resistance, Neoplasmxdrug effects 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSTAT3 Transcription Factorxantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aStomach Neoplasmsxphysiopathology 0achemotherapy1 aChen, Min1 aShen, Yonghua1 aShen, Weidong1 aGuo, Huimin1 aGao, Qian1 aZou, Xiaoping0 tCancer letters.g2012 Feb. 28, v. 315, no. 2 p.198-205dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0304-38357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.canlet.2011.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01370naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245011400153300002000267520031000287592002800597650002400625650001400649650001700663650001800680650001800698650000800716650001600724700001500740700002000755700001700775700002000792773012500812856007400937852000901011655001201020IND60664626420221119145441.0190912e20130930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066462642DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra43532f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Fang10aRoom temperature ionic liquid assisted well-dispersed core-shell tin nanoparticles through cathodic corrosion  ap. 18791-18793.  aCathodic corrosion has been successfully applied to obtain well-dispersed core–shell tin/tin oxide nanoparticles in room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) for the first time.

The present study examined the effects of continuous training (CT) and aerobic-interval training (AIT) coinciding with a high-fat diet (HFD) on capillary density, macrophage polarization in mesenteric (mAT) and subcutaneous (sAT) adipose tissue.48 male Wistar rats were divided into HFD and normal diet (ND) groups. After 10 weeks, each group was divided into sedentary, CT, and AIT. The animals in training groups performed 10-week matched distances of CT and AIT on a motorized treadmill (5 times/week).The results showed that HFD significantly reduced the capillary density of adipose tissue (sAT: 54% vs. mAT:49%) and increased systemic insulin resistance, mean adipocyte size, crown-like structure (CLs), and M1-macrophages with no change in the total number of adipocytes in either tissue. Exercise training reversed the HFD induced adipose tissue dysfunction. Compared to CT, AIT was more effective on increasing the capillary density of sAT (170 vs. 87%) and mAT (140 vs. 100%). Likewise, AIT increased the capillary density of both tissues even in comparison to the ND sedentary group (~25%). Compared with CT as well, AIT more significantly increased the number of M2 macrophages (181 vs. 122%) and decreased CLs (60 vs. 38%) in mAT.The findings suggest that hypertrophy is a major contributor to adipose tissue expansion in obesity. Furthermore, exercise training largely demonstrated beneficial effects on adipose tissue remodeling, where AIT is more effective than CT in reducing HFD-induced adipose tissue dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipose tissue 3aexercise 3ahigh fat diet 3ahypertrophy 3ainsulin resistance 3alaboratory animals 3amacrophages 3amales 3aobesity 3arats 0aAngiogenesis 0aAerobic training 0aAdipose tissue 0aAdipocyte 0aInflammation 0aInsulin resistance 0aMacrophage polarization 0aObesity1 aTalebi-Garakani, Elahe1 aHamidian, Gholamreza1 aSafarzade, Alireza0 tLife sciences.g2019 Mar. 01, v. 220 p.32-43dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11720x0024-32057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2019.01.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01977naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245011100165520067600276592002800952650002900980650003101009650003601040650001601076650001501092650002301107650002201130650001301152653004601165653001501211653001401226653002501240653003101265700001801296700001201314700005801326773009801384856008801482852000901570655001201579IND60777815120221118002507.0220614e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077781512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.1132462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Min10aXanthones from the stems of Calophyllum membranaceum Gardn. et Champ. and their anti-inflammatory activity  aEighteen undescribed xanthones, including six pairs of xanthone enantiomers, three xanthones, and three xanthone glycosides, together with one pair of known xanthone enantiomers and 12 known xanthones, were isolated from the stems of Calophyllum membranaceum Gardn. et Champ.

Nitrogen-doped carbon xerogels (NCXs) which have been successfully applied as effective electrocatalysts for the ORR have continued to attract attention due to their competitive price and tunable surface chemistry. A new dual N-doped NCX (NCoNC) electrocatalyst is fabricated as a carbon based catalyst though a facile impregnation of peptone in a precursor and ammonia etching pyrolysis method. XPS analysis demonstrates that the NCoNC electrocatalyst not only has a high N doping amount, but also has an optimized chemical state composition of N doping, which play an important role in improving the microstructure and catalytic performance of the catalysts. XRD and HRTEM results show that the doped metal nano-particles are coated with a double carbon layer of graphene carbon (inner layer) and amorphous carbon (outer layer) forming serrated edges that facilitate the ORR process. The as-obtained NCoNC catalyst exhibits good electrocatalytic performance and excellent stability for the ORR in both acidic and alkaline environments. In particular, in alkaline electrolyte, the decrements of both the limiting current density and the half-wave potential of the NCoNC catalyst were significantly lower than those of a commercial Pt/C catalyst during accelerated aging tests. When serving as an air electrode in Zn–air batteries, the catalyst also exhibits superior catalytic performance with a peak power density of 78.2 mW cm⁻² and a stable open-circuit voltage of 1.37–1.43 V. This work presents a novel tactic to regulate the microstructure and composition of carbon-based electrocatalysts by the facile and scalable dual-effect nitrogen doping method which may be conducive to promoting and developing highly efficient and promising electrocatalysts for the ORR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrolytes 3agraphene 3amicrostructure 3anitrogen 3apeptones 3aprices 3apyrolysis 3axerogels1 aLuo, Yongping1 aZhou, Laihong1 aXiao, Zonghu1 aZhang, Fayun1 aHuang, Ping1 aLiu, Chen0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 04, v. 12, no. 21 p.13440-13447dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra01238c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245009600171500001900267520151200286592002801798650001101826650002301837650003701860650001901897650002201916650001101938650002101949650001801970650001601988650002302004650001902027650001302046650001202059650002102071650003702092653002502129653001502154653002502169700001302194700002002207700001602227700003102243700001802274700001902292700001702311773011902328856008802447852000902535655001202544IND60704740720221120191342.0201025e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jingwei10aBacteria mediated Fenton-like reaction drives the biotransformation of carbon nanomaterials  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCarbon nanomaterials (CNs), which gain heightened attention as novel materials, are increasingly incorporated into daily products and thus are released into the environment. Limited research on CNs environmental fates lags their industry growth, only few bacteria have been confirmed to biotransform CNs and the mechanism behind has not been revealed yet. In this study, four types of commercial CNs, i.e. graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO), single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and oxidized (carboxylated) SWCNTs, were selected for investigation. The biotransformation of CNs by Labrys sp. WJW, which could grow with these CNs as the sole carbon source, was investigated. The bacterial transformation was proved by qPCR, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, liquid chromatography/time-of-flight/mass spectrometry, and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry analyses. The biotransformation resulted in morphology change, defect increase and functional group change of these CNs. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of CNs biodegradation mediated by extracellular Fenton-like reaction was demonstrated. In this reaction, the OH production was mediated by reduction of H₂O₂ involved a continuous cycle of Fe(II)/Fe(III). These findings reveal a novel degradation mechanism of microorganism towards high molecular weight substrate, which will provide a new insight into the environmental fate of CNs and the guidance for their safer use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabrys 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3abiodegradation 3abiotransformation 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acarboxylation 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental fate 3agraphene oxide 3aindustry 3aliquids 3amolecular weight 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCarbon nanomaterials 0aLabrys sp. 0aFenton-like reaction1 aMa, Qiao1 aZhang, Zhaojing1 aLi, Shuzhen1 aDiko, Catherine Sekyerebea1 aDai, Chunxiao1 aZhang, Henglin1 aQu, Yuanyuan0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 746 p.141020-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01498naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143242021300167245010600380300001600486520042100502592002800923650001700951650001500968650001500983650001900998700002101017773008401038856007701122852000901199655001201208IND60132697820221116173342.0150511e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013269782DNAL7 a10.1051/apido:20070102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHepburn, H.

However, while precise regulation of BDNF levels is an important determinant in defining the biological outcome, the role of microRNAs (miRs) in modulating BDNF expression has not been extensively analyzed. Using in silico approaches, reporter systems, and analysis of endogenous BDNF, we show that miR-1, miR-10b, miR-155, and miR-191 directly repress BDNF through binding to their predicted sites in BDNF 3′UTR. We find that the overexpression of miR-1 and miR-10b suppresses endogenous BDNF protein levels and that silencing endogenous miR-10b increases BDNF mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we show that miR-1/206 binding sites within BDNF 3′UTR are used in differentiated myotubes but not in undifferentiated myoblasts. Finally, our data from two cell lines suggest that endogenous miR-1/206 and miR-10 family miRs act cooperatively in suppressing BDNF through their predicted sites in BDNF 3′UTR. In conclusion, our results highlight miR-1, miR-10b, miR-155, and miR-191 as novel regulators of BDNF long and short 3′UTR isoforms, supporting future research in different physiological and pathological contexts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3a3' untranslated regions 3aangiogenesis 3abinding sites 3abrain 3agene overexpression 3aheart 3amemory 3amicroRNA 3amyoblasts 3amyotubes 3askeletal muscle 3asynaptogenesis1 aKumar, Anmol1 aHärma, Mari-Anne1 aAndressoo, Jaan-Olle0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2014 Nov., v. 71, no. 22 p.4443-4456dSpringer-Verlagx1420-682X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-014-1628-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02844naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245011100206506007600317520132000393592002801713506003701741650003101778650001901809650001501828650001501843650002301858650002001881650002801901650002001929650001101949650001701960650001401977650002601991653001702017653003302034653002702067653002302094653003402117700001902151773011202170856008302282852000902365655001202374IND60649561520221207080216.0190725e20191001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064956152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1114902doi7 aPMC67183192pmcid7 a313023942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSher, Mazhar10aDevelopment of a multiplex fully automated assay for rapid quantification of CD4+ T cells from whole blood  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe development of cost-effective and rapid assays for the accurate counting of CD4 cells has remained prime focus for disease management. The lack of such assays has severely affected people living in resource-limited disease prevalent areas. CD4 count information plays a vital role in the effective management of HIV disease. There is an unmet need to develop rapid, cost-effective, portable and user-friendly point-of-care (POC) disease diagnostic platform technology for CD4+ T cell counting. Here, we have developed a flow-free magnetic actuation platform that uses antibody-coated magnetic beads to efficiently capture CD4+ T cells from a 30 μL drop of whole blood. On-chip cell lysate electrical impedance spectroscopy has been utilized to quantify the isolated CD4 cells. The developed assay has a limit of detection of 25 cells per μL and provides accurate CD4 counts in the range of 25–800 cells per μL. The whole immunoassay along with the enumeration process is very rapid and provides CD4 quantification results within 5 min time frame. The assay does not require off-chip sample preparation steps and minimizes human involvement to a greater extent. The developed impedance-based immunoassay has potential to significantly improve the CD4 enumeration process especially for POC settings.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHIV infections 3aautomation 3abiosensors 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3adisease control 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3amagnetism 3apoint-of-care systems 0aCD4+ T cells 0aHuman immunodeficiency virus 0aAntiretroviral therapy 0aRapid immunoassays 0aResource-constrained settings1 aAsghar, Waseem0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Oct. 01, v. 142 p.111490-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1114903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245007400158300002000232520136300252592002801615650004401643650001601687650001301703650001001716650002401726650001601750650001001766650001301776650001401789650001301803650001201816650001801828650001301846650002501859700001301884700001701897700001801914700002001932700001701952700001701969700001601986700001702002700001602019773012402035856007502159852000902234655001202243IND60776421420221120032529.0220506e20220505xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077642142DNAL7 a10.1039/d2ra01361d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeng, Xuedong12aA study on coconut fatty acid diethanolamide-based polyurethane foams  ap. 13548-13556.  aThe possibility of using coconut fatty acid diethanolamide, a derivate from coconut oil as a bio-based polyol for the synthesis of polyurethane foam was explored. The intrinsic tertiary amine moiety in this polyol (p-CFAD) endowed an auto-catalytic effect in the synthesis process of polyurethane foams, combined with a shorter cream and gelation time compared to the fossil-based polyol 3152. H-nuclear magnetic resonance (¹H-NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR) were conducted to characterize the chemical structural features of the p-CFAD, and rheology measurement showed the shear-thinning behavior due to the branched structure. A thermal conductivity comparable to the commercial rigid polyurethane foam was achieved when 40wt% fossil-based polyol 3152 was substituted with the bio-based p-CFAD. With the increased content of the p-CFAD, a transition of the physical properties from rigid PU foam to soft PU foam was observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the occurrence of the interconnected pores on the cell walls with the increase of the added p-CFAD, implying the possibility of regulating the cellular structure and foam properties via the incorporation of the p-CFAD. Results showed the feasibility of using p-CFAD as a potential polyol in the development of bio-based polyurethane foams with high performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acoconut oil 3acoconuts 3acream 3aelectron microscopy 3afatty acids 3afoams 3agelation 3amagnetism 3amoieties 3apolyols 3apolyurethanes 3arheology 3athermal conductivity1 aLi, Cong1 aCai, Xiaoxia1 aYang, Zhizhou1 aZhang, Fengshan1 aLiu, Yanshao1 aYang, Guihua1 aWang, Qiang1 aFang, Guigan1 aZhang, Xian0 tRSC advances.g2022 May 05, v. 12, no. 21 p.13548-13556dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2ra01361d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245007900164300001400243520079400257592002801051650001701079650002001096650002501116650002601141650001501167650001501182650002401197650001901221650002101240650001601261651001101277653001701288653001901305653001501324653001601339700001401355700002701369700001901396773013101415856008001546852000901626655001201635IND60623078320221117015448.0181127e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307832DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965083293022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuit, Andreas10aSaving the WoodpeckersbSocial Capital, Governance, and Policy Performance  ap. 42-61.  aThis article investigates if higher levels of social capital, better governance structures, and a more ambitious conservation policy are positively linked to the ability of states to address biodiversity loss.

These data are argued to be a more valid indicator of biodiversity than most other available cross-national measures of environmental quality. A seemingly unrelated regression analysis reveals that none of the indicators are linked to higher levels of woodpecker diversity, which in turn leads to the conclusion that present institutions, environmental policies, and social structures have negligible effects on biodiversity compared to long-term landscape transformations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3adata collection 3aenvironmental policy 3aenvironmental quality 3agovernance 3alandscapes 3aregression analysis 3asocial capital 3asocial structure 3awoodpeckers 3aEurope 0abiodiversity 0asocial capital 0agovernance 0acomparative1 aHall, Ola1 aMikusiński, Grzegorz,1 aAngelstam, Per0 tJournal of environment & development.g2009 Mar., v. 18, no. 1 p.42-61dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965083293023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245011400179500001900293520174600312592002802058650002302086650001302109650001802122650002602140650000902166650001002175650001602185650001702201650002202218650001302240651001002253653001302263653002402276653001002300653002902310700001602339700001602355773011902371856008802490852000902578655001202587IND60704741020221120182356.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070474102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRanjan, Avinash Kumar10aEffect of lockdown due to SARS COVID-19 on aerosol optical depth (AOD) over urban and mining regions in India  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-COronaVIrus Diseases 2019 (SARS-COVID-19) pandemic has posed a serious threat to human health (death) and substantial economic losses across the globe. It was however presumed that extreme preventive measures of entire lockdown in India might have reduced the air pollution level and therefore decreased the aerosol optical depth (AOD). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) daily AOD product was deployed to investigate the change in AOD level during lockdown phases across the Indian Territory as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019) of the same periods. The key findings of the study revealed that AOD level over the Indian Territory is greatly reduced (~45%) during the lockdown periods as compared to the long-term mean AOD level (2000–2019). Furthermore, a noteworthy negative AOD anomaly (~6 to 37%) was observed across the four metropolitan cities in India during the entire lockdown period (25th March to 15th May 2020). However, coal mining regions of the various coalfields in India showed a positive anomaly (~+11 to 40%) during the lockdown periods due to ongoing mining operations. In a nutshell, the study results indicated a huge drop in the AOD level over Indian Territory during lockdown periods. It is expected that the pandemic can influence some policy decisions to propose air pollution control methods. Lockdown events possibly may play a crucial role as a potential solution for air pollution abatement in the future. It may not be uncommon in future when the governments may implement deliberately selective lockdowns at pollution hotspots to control the pollution level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aair pollution control 3acoal 3adeath 3aenvironment 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3apandemic 3aIndia 0aCOVID-19 0aAOD, Satellite data 0aMODIS 0aMining, Indian territory1 aPatra, A.K.1 aGorai, A.K.0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.141024-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1410243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02409naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245015100178520099900329592002801328650002701356650001601383650002501399650002001424650001601444650002001460650001401480650002401494650001401518650001501532650001101547650001401558653002701572653000901599653001801608653001601626653001401642700001801656700002001674700001501694700001601709700001601725773009901741856009001840852000901930655001201939IND60778525520221119183528.0220621e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7384052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Moamer A.H.14aThe cross-regulation between two-component system BasS-BasR and ferric uptake regulator Fur in virulence gene expression in Edwardsiella piscicida  aEdwardsiella piscicida is a widespread pathogen that infects a vast variety of fish species and causes hemorrhagic septicemia and significant property damage in the global aquaculture industry. E. piscicida employs type III and VI secretion systems (T3/T6SS) to penetrate and colonize macrophages, which are regulated by the EsrA-EsrB two-component system (TCS). In this study, we demonstrate that the BasS-BasR TCS positively regulates the expression of esrB and controls the secretion of T3/T6SS proteins. The regulatory protein BasR bound to the esrB promoter to activate the expression of virulence genes. Upon sensing the environmental ferric signals, BasS-BasR activated virulence gene expression through EsrB and simultaneously released Fur repression on esrB expression, eventually promoting E. piscicida colonization in turbot. Overall, this study revealed a new role of BasS-BasR TCS in virulence regulation and iron uptake, providing valuable insights into bacterial parthenogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEdwardsiella piscicida 3aaquaculture 3aaquaculture industry 3agene expression 3amacrophages 3aparthenogenesis 3apathogens 3aregulatory proteins 3asecretion 3asepticemia 3aturbot 3avirulence 0aEdwardsiella piscicida 0aEsrB 0aBasS-BasR TCS 0aIron uptake 0aVirulence1 aCai, Jingxiao1 aZhang, Yuanxing1 aYin, Kaiyu1 aWang, Qiyao1 aShao, Shuai0 tAquaculture.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 559 p.738405-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7384053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04287naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100001800167245015600185300001600341520217500357592002802532650005602560650001502616650001902631650001902650650002802669650003802697650001502735650002202750650001002772650002302782650001902805650001102824650003002835650005002865650001402915650001602929650001902945650000902964650001202973650001402985650001202999650002903011650002803040650003803068650001103106650002003117650000903137650006103146650008203207650001503289650001603304650003003320650002003350700001903370700002103389700002103410773010103431856008403532852000903616655001203625IND4456668920221117011801.0141111e20110512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445666892DNAL7 a212730102pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuinhof, T.F.10aDetection of PRRSV circulation in herds without clinical signs of PRRS: Comparison of five age groups to assess the preferred age group and sample size  ap. 180-184.  aA cross-sectional study was conducted to find the most effective diagnostic approach to detect circulation of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). The study was performed in 10 Dutch swine herds, with sows and fattening pigs or breeding stock. Herds did not experience clinical signs of PRRS during the last 6 months before sampling, but a PRRSV infection was confirmed at most 2 years before sampling. Blood samples were collected from 5 age groups: sows during early and late gestation, weaners at 9 weeks of age, fatteners or breeding stock at 16 and 22 weeks of age. For each category, 20 serum samples were examined; in total 100 serum samples per herd. Samples were analysed for PRRSV antibodies with ELISA (n=1002), and rt-PCR when ELISA S/P-ratios were above 1.5 (n=307) or below 0.4 (n=187; random selection from each age group). A logistic regression analysis was used to obtain factors associated with the probability of virus detection in a pig (PCR positive test result). Herd, ELISA-result, and age group were included as explanatory variables. Variables remained in the model when statistically significant. ELISA results showed that none of the herds could be considered to be free of PRRSV infection. Mean PRRSV seroprevalence in unvaccinated animals varied between 18% and 82%, and mean PRRS-virus prevalence varied between 0% and 41%. In only one of the 10 herds, no PRRS-virus could be detected. The odds of finding PRRS-virus in blood samples were 8.6 (95% CI, 5.3–13.9) in pigs of 9 weeks of age and 4.6 (95% CI, 3.0–7.0) in pigs of 16 weeks of age, compared with fatteners of 22 weeks of age. This result indicates that 9- to 16-week-old pigs are the preferred age group to detect PRRS-virus, in herds without clinical signs of PRRS. We concluded that PRRS-virus circulation could be detected in 8 out of 9 of the study-herds, with a relatively low number of blood samples. Testing 12 blood samples in both rt-PCR and ELISA, with 6 samples in pigs 9 weeks of age and 6 samples in pigs 16 weeks of age, will lead to a cost-efficient first evaluation of the PRRSV infection-status in herds without clinical signs of PRRS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aantibodies 3ablood sampling 3abreeding stock 3across-sectional studies 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agroup size 3ahematologic tests 3aherds 3alivestock breeding 3alogit analysis 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3apregnancy 3aprobability 3aseroprevalence 3asows 3aviruses 3aweanlings 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Viralxblood 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aPorcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndromexdiagnosis 2aPorcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virusxisolation & purification 2aPrevalence 2aSample Size 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSwinexvirology1 avan Schaik, G.1 avan Esch, E.J.B.1 aWellenberg, G.J.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2011 May 12, v. 150, no. 1-2 p.180-184dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.01.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03755naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002600155245014000181520211700321592002802438650002202466650002502488650002902513650002702542650002202569650001902591650002002610650001602630650000902646650001802655650001402673650002002687650001802707650001502725650002002740650002502760650001602785653001602801653001702817653001302834653001502847653000902862700003002871700002802901700004002929700003002969700002702999773010003026856009003126852000903216655001203225IND60778525620221119183941.0220614e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077852562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7384062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMielke, Thiago Duarte14aThe strategic use of water additives for tambaqui Colossoma macropomum transport: New insights of bacteriosis and productivity approach  aThe transport of live fish is a major sanitary issue for aquaculture. This study addresses two critical steps regarding natural recurrent mortality outbreaks after transport of tambaqui Colossoma macropomum. At first, five mortality outbreaks post-transport of juveniles showing clinical signs suggestive of columnaris were investigated. Flavobacterium columnare was ascertained as the etiological agent in all outbreaks, causing massive mortality up to 72 h after transport. Based on these findings, the next step consisted of a trial to investigate the use of three additives (8 g/L sodium chloride, 11.12 mg/L Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil and 60 mg/L oxytetracycline) in the water of transport, simulating fish farmers' practices to prevent disease outbreak. Juveniles (≅ 8 cm) were transported for 3 h under trade-mimicking conditions, then transferred to 20 tanks (5 groups, 4 replicates) and monitored for 30 days for analysis of health status. Zootechnical parameters (weight gain, total feed intake, feed conversion, specific growth rate and growth analysis) were assessed on days 1, 15 and 30. The best health status was attributed to the group transported with 0.8% NaCl, which showed 100% survival, in addition to being the only group that did not show behavioral changes and clinical signs, indicating the absence of any infectious biological source after transport. A poly-infection (Aeromonas jandaei and F. columnare) was detected in fish from all other groups (M. alternifolia, oxytetracycline and control). Furthermore, fish exposed to sodium chloride showed better weight gain and feed conversion compared to those transported with oxytetracycline (p ≤ 0.05). Then, the pathogenicity of the two isolated strains (A. jandaei and F. columnare) was ascertained by Koch's Postulate assay, which established two emerging pathogens for C. macropomum. This study addresses fundamental information for the development of fish farming and suggests the addition of salt at 0.8% in the water of transport to prevent columnaris and motile Aeromonas septicemia (MAS) associated disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas jandaei 3aColossoma macropomum 3aFlavobacterium columnare 3aMelaleuca alternifolia 3adisease outbreaks 3aessential oils 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afish 3ahealth status 3amortality 3aoxytetracycline 3apathogenicity 3asepticemia 3asodium chloride 3aspecific growth rate 3aweight gain 0aBacteriosis 0aFish disease 0aHandling 0aPrevention 0aSalt1 aFrancisco, Claire Juliana1 aDorella, Fernanda Alves1 aFigueiredo, Henrique César Pereira1 aTavares, Guilherme Campos1 aGallani, Sílvia Umeda0 tAquaculture.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 558 p.738406-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7384063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02333naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002400146245010100170300001500271520115200286592002801438650001901466650002501485650002001510650003401530650001301564651001101577651001801588653001201606653002301618653001101641653002201652653002201674653001401696653001601710773013201726856008001858852000901938655001201947IND60623078520221117015139.0181127e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307852DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965083293582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Jennifer L.10aNorway, the United States, and Commercial WhalingbPolitical Culture and Social Movement Framing  ap. 79-102.  aNorway has long tried to portray itself as one of the most environmentally responsible states. But it has consistently refused to support the moratorium against commercial whaling. This article offers a cultural explanation for this seeming contradiction, by examining the way the global antiwhaling movement framed the issue and the Norwegian environmental organizations reframed it. It argues that two cultural differences are relevant. First, animal-rights organizations were an important part of the U.S. antiwhaling coalition, whereas such organizations are largely excluded from the Norwegian environmental activist community, where animal rights arguments have found little traction. Secondly, U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) operate in an adversarial pluralistic political culture, whereas the Norwegian environmental movement is embedded in a corporatist system where consensual decision making is the norm and has fostered a close relationship with the state. This has led to different images and strategic considerations being used by NGOs to frame the issue and ultimately to different decisions on the need for a moratorium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acultural differences 3adecision making 3anongovernmental organizations 3apolitics 3aNorway 3aUnited States 0awhaling 0aenvironmental NGOs 0aNorway 0athe United States 0apolitical culture 0apluralism 0acorporatism0 tJournal of environment & development.g2009 Mar., v. 18, no. 1 p.79-102dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965083293583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03677naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005700152245008700209520201300296592002802309650001502337650001302352650002302365650001702388650002502405650001102430650002302441650004602464650001202510650001002522650002602532650001602558650001702574650002002591650001602611651001202627653001702639653001702656653001502673653001402688653001202702700001802714700005902732700002002791700002402811700002002835700002502855700002702880700002402907773009602931856008703027852000903114655001203123IND60649561920221117044032.0190801e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064956192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHouissa, Hela1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6478-122X10aMultimycotoxin LC-MS/MS analysis in pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) from Tunisia  aThe current study assesses the natural occurrence of mycotoxins and fungal metabolites in Tunisian Pearl millet. Investigations using a multi-mycotoxin liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric (LC/ESI–MS/MS) method were carried out on a total of 220 pearl millet samples collected from farmers (n = 144) located in four different agroecological zones in Tunisia and from retail shops (n = 76). Results revealed fifty-seven regulated and emerging metabolites contaminating 91.4% of grain samples. Among major mycotoxins, both aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and ochratoxin A (OTA) were the most prevalent at rate of 8.6% each and occurring at an average level of 106 and 69.4 μg/kg, respectively. All positives samples were significantly exceeding the European thresholds (5 and 3 μg/kg, respectively). Lower incidence (5.9%) of Zearalenone (ZEA) contaminated samples at levels below the authorized limits (100 μg/kg) was recorded. Pearl millet grains from the south coastal zone (CT.S) had significantly the highest mean AFB1 contamination (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, OTA was encountered only in CT.S zone. Furthermore, commercial samples showed higher OTA and ZEA mean concentrations than farmers samples (p < 0.05). As regards emerging mycotoxins, Fusarium mycotoxins including beauvericin (BEA), equisetin (EQUS), monoacetoxyscirpenol (MAS) and diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) were detected in 43.2%, 43.2%, 11.4% and 10.5% of positive samples, respectively. Furthermore, 12.7%, 50.9%, 53.2% and 14.1% of grains were contaminated with Alternaria mycotoxins namely alternariol (AOH), alternariolmonomethyl ether (AME), tentoxin (TEN) and tenuazonic acid (TA), respectively. The majority of emerging Fusarium and Alternaria mycotoxins mean levels were significantly higher in grains from north coastal area (p < 0.01). The present study highlighted a wide range of mycotoxins in Tunisian pearl millet with a different mycotoxin patterns within the agroecological zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aFusarium 3aPennisetum glaucum 3aaflatoxin B1 3aagroecological zones 3acoasts 3adiacetoxyscirpenol 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3afarmers 3afungi 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolites 3aochratoxin A 3atenuazonic acid 3azearalenone 3aTunisia 0aPearl millet 0aLC/MS/MS-ESI 0aOccurrence 0aMycotoxin 0aTunisia1 aLasram, Salma1 aSulyok, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3302-07321 aŠarkanj, Bojan1 aFontana, Angélique1 aStrub, Caroline1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf),1 aSchorr-Galindo, Sabine1 aGhorbel, Abdelwahed0 tFood control.g2019 Dec., v. 106 p.106738-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01567naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245004100172520062100213592002800834653000800862653000800870653000800878653000800886653003100894653001900925653001500944653001400959700001700973700005800990773009801048856008601146852000901232655001201241IND60736371120221118041703.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1098752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJuárez, Rubén,10aCoalitional efficient profit-sharing  aAgents invest their available time in projects that generate profit.

Here, we studied the effects of epistatic modifiers that segregate in a wild-derived Drosophila melanogaster population on the mutational effects of P-element insertions in Semaphorin-5C (Sema-5c) and Calreticulin (Crc), pleiotropic genes that affect olfactory behaviour and startle behaviour and, in the case of Crc, sleep phenotypes. We introduced Canton-S B (CSB) third chromosomes with or without a P-element insertion at the Crc or Sema-5c locus in multiple wild-derived inbred lines of the Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) and assessed the effects of epistasis on the olfactory response to benzaldehyde and, for Crc, also on sleep. In each case, we found substantial epistasis and significant variation in the magnitude of epistasis. The predominant direction of epistatic effects was to suppress the mutant phenotype. These observations support a previous study on startle behaviour using the same D. melanogaster chromosome substitution lines, which concluded that suppressing epistasis may buffer the effects of new mutations. However, epistatic effects are not correlated among the different phenotypes. Thus, suppressing epistasis appears to be a pervasive general feature of natural populations to protect against the effects of new mutations, but different epistatic interactions modulate different phenotypes affected by mutations at the same pleiotropic gene.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3abenzaldehyde 3acalreticulin 3aepistasis 3agenes 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3apleiotropy 3aquantitative traits 3asleep 3asubstitution lines1 aHARBISON, SUSAN T.1 aHAHN, LAUREN E.1 aMOROZOVA, TATIANA V.1 aYAMAMOTO, AKIHIKO1 aMackay, Trudy F.

Due to the lack of adequate in vivo evidence in dengue disease model, the present study was initiated to screen and identify the cytokines affected by freeze-dried C. papaya leaf juice (FCPLJ) treatment in AG129 mice infected with DEN-2 dengue virus. METHODS: The AG129 mice were fed orally with FCPLJ for 3 consecutive days after 24 h of dengue virus inoculation. Plasma cytokines were screened by using ProcartaPlex immunoassay. The gene expression in the liver was analyzed by using RT² Profiler PCR Array. RESULTS: The results showed that FCPLJ treatment has increased the plasma CCL2/MCP-1 level during peak of viremia. Gene expression study has identified 8 inflammatory cytokine genes which were downregulated in the liver of infected AG129 mice treated with FCPLJ. The downregulated inflammatory cytokine genes were CCL6/MRP-1, CCL8/MCP-2, CCL12/MCP-5, CCL17/TARC, IL1R1, IL1RN/IL1Ra, NAMPT/PBEF1 and PF4/CXCL4. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated the possible immunomodulatory role of FCPLJ during dengue virus infection in AG129 mice.  aPublisher supplied data  aNMRR-15-2188-27661cMinistry of Health Malaysia0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCarica papaya 3aDengue virus 3aalternative medicine 3acytokines 3adengue 3adisease models 3afreeze drying 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunomodulators 3ajuices 3aleaves 3aliver 3amice 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aviremia1 aMohd Abd Razak, Mohd Ridzuan1 aMohmad Misnan, Norazlan1 aMd Jelas, Nur Hana1 aSastu, Umi Rubiah1 aMuhammad, Amirrudin1 aHo, Tiffiny Chau Dee1 aJusoh, Bazilah1 aZolkifli, Nor Azlina1 aThayan, Ravindran1 aMat Ripen, Adiratna1 aZainol, Murizal1 aSyed Mohamed, Ami Fazlin0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2019 Dec., v. 19, no. 1 p.44-44dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-019-2438-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02923naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245011800186300001600304520169100320592002802011650001202039650002502051650002202076650001502098650001302113650001802126650001202144650001902156650001402175650001402189650001002203700002602213700002002239700002302259700002602282773011402308856008202422852000902504655001202513IND60082449920221121014538.0210608e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008244992DNAL7 a252050282pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-014-2998-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWojtowicz, Todd10aPlant genetic identity of foundation tree species and their hybrids affects a litter-dwelling generalist predator  ap. 799-810.  aThe effects of plant genetics on predators, especially those not living on the plant itself, are rarely studied and poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effect of plant hybridization and genotype on litter-dwelling spiders. Using an 18-year-old cottonwood common garden, we recorded agelenid sheet-web density associated with the litter layers of replicated genotypes of three tree cross types: Populus fremontii, Populus angustifolia, and their F₁ hybrids. We surveyed 118 trees for agelenid litter webs at two distances from the trees (0–100 and 100–200 cm from trunk) and measured litter depth as a potential mechanism of web density patterns. Five major results emerged: web density within a 1-m radius of P. angustifolia was approximately three times higher than within a 1-m radius of P. fremontii, with F₁ hybrids having intermediate densities; web density responded to P. angustifolia and F₁ hybrid genotypes as indicated by a significant genotype × distance interaction, with some genotypes exhibiting a strong decline in web density with distance, while others did not; P. angustifolia litter layers were deeper than those of P. fremontii at both distance classes, and litter depth among P. angustifolia genotypes differed up to 300 %; cross type and genotype influenced web density via their effects on litter depth, and these effects were influenced by distance; web density was more sensitive to the effects of tree cross type than genotype. By influencing generalist predators, plant hybridization and genotype may indirectly impact trophic interactions such as intraguild predation, possibly affecting trophic cascades and ecosystem processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAraneae 3aPopulus angustifolia 3aPopulus fremontii 3aecosystems 3agenotype 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3aplant genetics 3apredation 3apredators 3atrees1 aCompson, Zacchaeus G.1 aLamit, Louis J.1 aWhitham, Thomas G.1 aGehring, Catherine A.0 tOecologia.g2014 Nov., v. 176, no. 3 p.799-810dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl44754x0029-85497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-2998-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02778naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245012800169300001600297520111000313592002801423650001501451650001101466650001001477650001001487650003301497650001501530650001501545650001801560650001701578650001901595650001501614650001401629650001101643650000901654650001201663650002001675651002001695651001001715653002301725653001001748653003701758653001201795653001601807653001601823653003201839700002301871700002401894700002001918700002001938700002001958773013301978856008002111852000902191655001202200IND60623078920221117015814.0181127e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062307892DNAL7 a10.1177/10704965093335642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLa Rovere, Roberto10aOptions to Improve Livelihoods and Protect Natural Resources in Dry EnvironmentsbThe Case of the Khanasser Valley in Syria  ap. 107-129.  aThis article reviews work that had the objective of introducing agricultural technologies in a marginal dryland area, the Khanasser Valley, northwestern Syria. The highly variable rainfall is barely sufficient to support livelihoods in this traditional barley—livestock production system. The valley is representative of other marginal dryland areas in West Asia and North Africa. We used a farmer-participatory approach to evaluate the performance of agricultural technologies for dry marginal areas in terms of their contribution to livelihoods and effect on the environment. The integrated approach allowed comprehensively comparing and evaluating the viability of promising technologies, including novel crops, intercropping, soil management techniques, and livestock rearing. The results show that improved barley varieties, olives, cumin, and lamb fattening can improve livelihoods, particularly for the land-owning households, whereas other households can benefit indirectly in terms of employment spillovers. These options are also environmentally friendly and sustain the natural resource base.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abarley 3acrops 3acumin 3adry environmental conditions 3aemployment 3ahouseholds 3aintercropping 3alamb feeding 3alamb finishing 3alivelihood 3alivestock 3aolives 3arain 3arearing 3asoil management 3aNorthern Africa 3aSyria 0amarginal dry areas 0aSyria 0aintegrated technology assessment 0aimpacts 0alivelihoods 0aenvironment 0anatural resource management1 aBruggeman, Adriana1 aTurkelboom, Francis1 aAw-Hassan, Aden1 aThomas, Richard1 aAl-Ahmad, Kasem0 tJournal of environment & development.g2009 June, v. 18, no. 2 p.107-129dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001525x1552-54657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10704965093335643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01350naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245003400171520028300205592002800488650002300516650001100539650001000550650001900560650002100579653000800600653000800608653003100616653002100647653002600668653002000694653002500714653001600739700002800755773009800783856008600881852000900967655001200976IND60736371420221118041713.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1098842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrieri, Luca10aWhat drives bank performance?  aChanges in macroeconomic conditions explain the preponderance of the fluctuations in loan charge-offs.

The continuous experiment was conducted under 55 °C using a continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 day. A stable hydrogen yield of 15.4 ± 0.23 mol kg−1 of cellulose consumed was maintained for 190 days with acetate and butyrate as the main soluble byproducts. An analysis of the 16S rRNA sequences showed that the hydrogen-producing thermophilic cellulolytic microorganisms (HPTCM) were close to Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum, Clostridium sp. and Enterobacter cloacae. Batch experiment demonstrated that the highest H2 producing activity was obtained at 55 °C and the ultimate hydrogen yield and the metabolic by-products were influenced greatly by temperatures. The effect of temperature variation showed that the activation energy for cellulose and glucose were estimated at 103 and 98.8 kJ mol−1, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium 3aEnterobacter cloacae 3aThermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum 3aacetates 3aactivation energy 3abioreactors 3abutyrates 3abyproducts 3acellulolytic microorganisms 3acellulose 3afermentation 3aglucose 3ahydrogen 3amicrobial communities 3anucleotide sequences 3aribosomal RNA 3atemperature 3athermophilic bacteria 0aDark fermentation 0aCellulose 0aThermophilic 0aMicrobial community structure 0aActivity test1 aGadow, Samir I.1 aTanaka, Yasumitsu1 aZheng, Run,1 aLi, Yu-You1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4067-88550 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Apr., v. 75 p.57-64dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245015100168520091800319592002801237650000801265650002101273650002801294650002401322650002401346650001901370650001201389650003901401650002801440650001601468650002601484650001201510650002701522650001401549653001201563653002101575653002301596653001601619653002001635700001801655700001701673700001701690700002001707700001601727700001801743700006301761773009601824856008701920852000902007655001202016IND60649562120221117043741.0190712e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064956212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDebao Niu, 10aMulti-target antibacterial mechanism of eugenol and its combined inactivation with pulsed electric fields in a hurdle strategy on Escherichia coli  aEugenol (2-Methoxy-4-(2-Propenyl) Phenol; EUG) is a natural antibacterial ingredient of the essential oil from many aromatic plants. The antimicrobial mechanism of EUG and its combined inactivation effect with pulsed electric fields (PEF) treatment in a hurdle strategy on E. coli ATCC 8739 were investigated. Results showed that membrane integrity and the morphology of E. coli cell were damaged and the membrane permeability was increased when E. coli was exposed to higher levels of EUG. Analysis of fluorescence spectra, molecular docking and atomic force microscope indicated that EUG bound to the AT-rich region of DNA through groove binding mode, leading to morphological alterations and the aggregation of DNA molecules. The combinations of EUG and PEF demonstrated strong synergistic effects for sterilization and it was proven to be an effective method to achieve a higher level of E. coli inactivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aEscherichia coli 3aatomic force microscopy 3acomputer simulation 3aessential oil crops 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3aingredients 3amembrane permeability 3aphenols 3apulsed electric fields 3asynergism 0aEugenol 0aEscherichia coli 0aMembrane integrity 0aDNA binding 0aCombined effect1 aWang, Qian-Yi1 aRen, Er-Fang1 aZeng, Xin-An1 aWang, Lang-Hong1 aHe, Tian-Fu1 aWen, Qing-Hui1 aBrennan, Charles S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0921-79650 tFood control.g2019 Dec., v. 106 p.106742-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl56242x0956-71357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2019.1067423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02698naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245006900177300001600246520128900262592002801551650002501579650002201604650001101626650000901637650001601646650001801662650002801680650001701708650001201725650003101737650001201768650002301780650001901803651001201822653001401834653002701848653001701875653001101892653001201903700002601915700001701941700002501958700001901983773010602002856008702108852000902195655001202204IND60536191620221120025503.0190410e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053619162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaag, Nicola Leonard10aMethane formation potential of cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum)  ap. 126-133.  aThe growing number of biogas plants in Germany has greatly increased the demand for maize silage, the predominant crop used for biogas production. With a share of 80% among the energy crops, maize silage is currently subject to major concerns such as competition between food and fuel, environmental issues and sustainability. Alternative substrates cannot compete with the specific methane yield (SMY) of maize and are therefore disadvantaged. The cup plant is considered suitable to provide a solution however little data is available. To support the search for alternative crops, batch and continuous laboratory tests were carried out in order to determine the SMY of cup plant silage. The mean SMY in the batch test was measured at 0.251 ± 0.0141 m³N/kg oDM and at 0.227 ± 0.0158 m³N/kg oDM in the continuous test. The results show that the methane yield per ha of cup plant lies in the range between grass and maize silage. The cup plant proved to have no negative effects on process stability for the ratio fed into the digester. Although cup plant cannot currently compete with maize silage, further research in plant breeding will help to increase dry matter yields, SMY potential and promote the positive environmental effect such as a diverse energy crop rotation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilphium perfoliatum 3aalternative crops 3abiogas 3acorn 3acorn silage 3acrop rotation 3adry matter accumulation 3aenergy crops 3agrasses 3alaboratory experimentation 3amethane 3amethane production 3aplant breeding 3aGermany 0aCup plant 0aSpecific methane yield 0aBiogas yield 0aBiogas 0aBiomass1 aNägele, Hans-Joachim1 aReiss, Klaus1 aBiertümpfel, Andrea1 aOechsner, Hans0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2015 Apr., v. 75 p.126-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2015.02.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02739naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245006200181300001400243520156100257592002801818650002001846650001201866650002301878650002001901650001301921650002001934650002101954650001101975650001401986650002802000650002402028700001502052700001802067700002002085700001802105773011502123856008202238852000902320655001202329IND60516571820221122050520.0190729e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051657182DNAL7 a226245682pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723120002492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Jun,10aBayesian B-spline mapping for dynamic quantitative traits  ap. 85-95.  aOwing to their ability and flexibility to describe individual gene expression at different time points, random regression (RR) analyses have become a popular procedure for the genetic analysis of dynamic traits whose phenotypes are collected over time. Specifically, when modelling the dynamic patterns of gene expressions in the RR framework, B-splines have been proved successful as an alternative to orthogonal polynomials. In the so-called Bayesian B-spline quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, B-splines are used to characterize the patterns of QTL effects and individual-specific time-dependent environmental errors over time, and the Bayesian shrinkage estimation method is employed to estimate model parameters. Extensive simulations demonstrate that (1) in terms of statistical power, Bayesian B-spline mapping outperforms the interval mapping based on the maximum likelihood; (2) for the simulated dataset with complicated growth curve simulated by B-splines, Legendre polynomial-based Bayesian mapping is not capable of identifying the designed QTLs accurately, even when higher-order Legendre polynomials are considered and (3) for the simulated dataset using Legendre polynomials, the Bayesian B-spline mapping can find the same QTLs as those identified by Legendre polynomial analysis. All simulation results support the necessity and flexibility of B-spline in Bayesian mapping of dynamic traits. The proposed method is also applied to a real dataset, where QTLs controlling the growth trajectory of stem diameters in Populus are located.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aPopulus 3achromosome mapping 3adata collection 3adiameter 3agene expression 3agenetic analysis 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aquantitative trait loci 3aquantitative traits1 aLI, JIAHAN1 aYANG, RUNQING1 aZhou, Xiaojing,1 aXu, Shizhong,0 tGenetics research.g2012 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.85-95dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723120002493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03238naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100006800188245008100256300001100337506007600348520179100424592002802215506003702243650001802280650001902298650002502317650001702342650001102359650002302370650001202393650001302405650001302418650002602431650002002457650001002477650001702487650001802504700003302522700001902555773011502574856008202689852000902771655001202780IND60630632220221207105138.0210403e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063063222DNAL7 aPMC63714632pmcid7 a307446242pmid7 a10.1186/s12917-019-1804-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtrocka-Domagała, Iwona1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3271-040810aDexamethasone-induced impairment of post-injury skeletal muscle regeneration  ap. 56.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Due to the routine use of dexamethasone (DEX) in veterinary and human medicine and its negative impact on the rate of wound healing and skeletal muscle condition, we decided to investigate the effect of DEX on the inflammatory and repair phases of skeletal muscle regeneration. In this study, a porcine skeletal muscle injury model was used. The animals were divided into non-treated and DEX-treated (0.2 mg/kg/day) groups. On the 15th day of DEX administration, bupivacaine hydrochloride-induced muscle injury was performed, and the animals were sacrificed in subsequent days. Regeneration was assessed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. In the inflammatory phase, the presence and degree of extravasation, necrosis and inflammation were evaluated, while in the repair phase, the numbers of muscle precursor cells (MPCs), myotubes and young myofibres were estimated. RESULTS: In the inflammatory phase, DEX increased the severity and prolonged extravasation, prolonged necrosis and inflammation at the site of the muscle injury. In the repair phase, DEX delayed and prolonged MPC presence, impaired and prolonged myotube formation, and delayed young myofibre formation. Furthermore, DEX markedly affected the kinetics of the parameters of the inflammatory phase of the skeletal muscle regeneration more than that of the repair phase. CONCLUSIONS: DEX impairment of the inflammatory and repair phases of the skeletal muscle regeneration was proven for the first time. The drug appears to affect the inflammatory phase more than the repair phase of regeneration. In light of our results, the possibility of reduction of the regenerative capacity of skeletal muscles should be considered during DEX therapy, and its use should be based on risk–benefit assessment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adexamethasone 3ahistopathology 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3amodels 3amuscle development 3amuscles 3amyotubes 3anecrosis 3arisk-benefit analysis 3askeletal muscle 3aswine 3atherapeutics 3atissue repair1 aPaździor-Czapula, Katarzyna1 aGesek, Michał0 tBMC veterinary research.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.56-56dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1804-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02352naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245010000184300001400284520130900298592002801607650002001635650001901655650001401674650001401688650001801702650000901720650001601729650001401745700001801759700001901777773011501796856008201911852000901993655001202002IND60516571920221122050411.0190729e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051657192DNAL7 a226245652pmid7 a10.1017/S00166723120002502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLUO, XIAO-JIN10aGenetic-basis analysis of heterotic loci in Dongxiang common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.)  ap. 57-61.  aHeterosis is widely used in genetic crop improvement; however, the genetic basis of heterosis is incompletely understood. The use of whole-genome segregating populations poses a problem for establishing the genetic basis of heterosis, in that interactions often mask the effects of individual loci. However, introgression line (IL) populations permit the partitioning of heterosis into defined genomic regions, eliminating a major part of the genome-wide epistasis. In our previous study, based on mid-parental heterosis (HMP) value with single-point analysis, 42 heterotic loci (HLs) associated with six yield-related traits were detected in wild and cultivated rice using a set of 265 ILs of Dongxiang common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.). In this study, the genetic effects of HLs were determined as the combined effects of both additive and dominant gene actions, estimated from the performance values of testcross F₁s and the dominance effects estimated from the HMP values of testcross F₁s. We characterized the gene action type at each HL. Thirty-eight of the 42 HLs were over-dominant, and in the absence of epistasis, four HLs were dominant. Therefore, we favour that over-dominance is a major genetic basis of ‘wild-cultivar’ crosses at the single functional Mendelian locus level.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza rufipogon 3adominant genes 3aepistasis 3aheterosis 3aintrogression 3aloci 3atestcrosses 3awild rice1 aXIN, XIAO-YUN1 aYANG, JIN-SHUI0 tGenetics research.g2012 Apr., v. 94, no. 2 p.57-61dCambridge University PresswJournal:1937x1469-50737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00166723120002503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245006400208500001900272520020600291592002800497650001300525650002600538650001400564650002400578650000900602653001700611653000900628653001700637653002300654653002700677700005900704700006200763773009800825856008600923852000901009655001201018IND60736371720221118041726.0210619e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1098882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrosato, Lisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3415-656X10aPredicting SME’s default: Are their websites informative?  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe propose the use of online indicators, scraped from the firms’ websites, to predict default risk for a sample of Spanish firms via nonlinear discriminant analysis and the logistic regression model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3adiscriminant analysis 3aeconomics 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aDefault risk 0aSMEs 0aWeb scraping 0aCorporate websites 0aNonlinear discriminant1 aDomenech, Josep1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7302-58101 aLiberati, Caterina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9910-40180 tEconomics letters.g2021 July, v. 204 p.109888-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2021.1098883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03009naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245016100162300002000323520175300343592002802096650002302124650001502147650001402162650003002176650002102206650002202227650000902249650003302258650002302291650001002314700002102324700002702345700001902372700002402391773012502415856007402540852000902614655001202623IND60671320420221120165133.0191002e20190918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067132042DNAL7 a10.1039/c9ra04778f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkpan, Ekemini D.10aAcridine-based thiosemicarbazones as novel inhibitors of mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl: synthesis, electrochemical, DFT and Monte Carlo simulation studies  ap. 29590-29599.  aElectrochemical, surface morphology, density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation methods were employed in investigating the effects of (2E,2′E)-2,2′-(3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-9-phenyl-3,4,6,7-tetrahydroacridine-1,8(2H,5H,9H,10H)-diylidene)bis(N-phenylhydrazinecarbothioamide) (IAB-NP), (2E,2′E)-2,2′-(3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-9-phenyl-3,4,6,7-tetrahydroacridine-1,8(2H,5H,9H,10H)-diylidene)bis(N-(2,4-difluorophenyl)hydrazinecarbothioamide)IAB-ND) and (2E,2′E)-2,2′-(3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-9-phenyl-3,4,6,7-tetrahydroacridine-1,8(2H,5H,9H,10H)-diylidene)bis(N-(2-fluorophenyl) hydrazinecarbothioamide) (IAB-NF) on mild steel corrosion in 1 M HCl solution. From the studies, compounds IAB-NP, IAB-ND and IAB-NF inhibit mild steel corrosion in the acid and the protection efficiencies were found to increase with the increase in concentration of each compound. At the optimum inhibitor concentration of 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ M, the inhibition efficiencies (%) of the compounds are in the order IAB-NF (90.48) > IAB-ND (87.48) > IAB-NP (85.28). Potentiodynamic polarization measurements revealed that all the compounds acted as mixed-type corrosion inhibitors. Experimental data for the adsorption of the studied molecules on a mild steel surface in 1 M HCl fitted into the Langmuir adsorption isotherm and the standard free energies of adsorption (ΔGoads) suggested both physisorption and chemisorption mechanisms. Scanning electron microscopy analyses confirmed the formation of a protective film on the mild steel surface by the inhibitor molecules, resulting in protection of the metal from corrosive electrolyte ions. The experimental findings were corroborated by both theoretical density functional theory and Monte Carlo simulation studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3acorrosion 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrochloric acid 3aions 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asteel1 aIsaac, Ibanga O.1 aOlasunkanmi, Lukman O.1 aEbenso, Eno E.1 aSherif, El-Sayed M.0 tRSC advances.g2019 Sept. 18, v. 9, no. 51 p.29590-29599dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9ra04778f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02260naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245055400165300001600719520061700735592002801352650001201380650001101392650004401403650002201447650002001469653002801489653002401517653001001541653001601551700002001567700002601587700002101613700001601634773015001650856007701800852000901877655001201886IND60521763820221119151702.0160531e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052176382DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1985-05102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindner, Ekkehard10aDarstellung und Eigenschaften von und Reaktionen mit metallhaltigen Heterocyclen, XLVII [1].

Four strains of microorganisms Saccharomycopsis fibuligera isolate Y27 (SF), Bacillus tequilensis KCTC 13622 (BT), Bacillus subtilis strain D7XPN1 (BS) and Bacillus aryabhattai B8W22 (BA) with high-efficiency degradation of glucoside of soybean isoflavones (SI) were obtained through screening and isolation, and were used to ferment soybean meal (SBM) to enhance the utilization of SBM. Six isonitrogenous (50.05% crude protein) and isolipidic (10.46% crude lipid) diets were formulated. The FM diet (the control diet) was formulated with 55% fishmeal. Five experimental diets (Diets SBM45, SF45, BT45, BS45 and BA45) were formulated by replacing 45% of FM inclusion level of control diet using SBM or either FSBM produced by the above four strains, respectively. Results showed that there was a significant decrease in feed intake (FI) of fish fed the SBM45 diet than those of the control and either FSBM diets (P = 0.000), and no significant difference was found among the control, SF45, BT45 and BS45 groups (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, fish fed the diet BA45 showed a significantly higher FI compared with the control group (P = 0.000). The appetite-stimulating factor (agouti gene-related protein, agrp1) gene expression was significantly up-regulated in fish fed the diet SF45 compared with the SBM45 group (P = 0.058). Meanwhile, the appetite-suppressive factors (proopiomelanocorein, pomc and cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript, cart) gene expression was significantly down-regulated in fish fed the diet SF45 compared with the SBM45 group (P = 0.009, 0.006). The foregut α-amylase and trypsin activity were significantly promoted in fish fed the diet BS45 compared with those of the SBM45 and BA45 treatments (P = 0.000). There was a significant decrease in apparent digestibility coefficient of dry matter in fish fed the SBM45 diet compared with fish fed the control diet and fish fed either FSBM-based diet (P = 0.000), however, no significant difference was found among the control, SF45, BS45 and BA45 groups (P > 0.05). Moreover, no significant difference was observed in survival rate among dietary treatments (P > 0.05). Fish fed the diet BT45 had significantly lower feed efficiency than that of the control group (P = 0.048), meanwhile no significant difference was found among the control, SBM45, SF45, BS45 and BA45 treatments (P > 0.05). Fish fed the SBM45 diet had significantly lower specific growth rate compared with fish fed the control diet and fish fed either FSBM-based diet (P = 0.000). Furthermore, the antioxidant capacity significantly increased in fish fed the control and four FSBM diets compared with the SBM45 group (P < 0.05). The serum, liver and hindgut inflammatory responses of fish fed the control and four FSBM diets were significantly lower than those of the SBM45 group (P < 0.05). In conclusion, fish fed four FSBM diets could promote growth, enhance antioxidant capacity and reduce inflammatory responses of turbot juveniles compared with those of the SBM45 group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus aryabhattai 3aBacillus subtilis 3aSaccharomycopsis fibuligera 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aalpha-amylase 3aamphetamine 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquaculture 3ablood serum 3acocaine 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3afermentation 3afish meal 3aforegut 3agene expression 3aglucosides 3agrowth performance 3ahindgut 3aisoflavones 3alipids 3aliver 3asoybean meal 3asoybeans 3aspecific growth rate 3asurvival rate 3atrypsin 3aturbot 0aTurbot (Scophthalmus maximus L.) 0aSoybean isoflavones 0aFermented soybean meal 0aGrowth 0aInflammatory responses1 aZhang, Wencong1 aZheng, Jichang1 aGong, Ye1 aCui, Kun1 aMai, Kangsen1 aAi, Qinghui0 tAquaculture.g2022 Nov. 15, v. 560 p.738414-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2022.7384143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008800167300001600255520113000271592002801401650000801429650001801437650001201455650002101467650002201488650001301510650002701523650001801550650001401568650001601582650004701598651001001645653001801655653002201673653003101695653002701726653001401753700001401767700002001781700001901801700001701820700001501837700001901852700001601871773012501887856005102012852000902063655001202072IND50075499820221122004139.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007549982DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2011.5879742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhar, Vishwa10aPathogenic and molecular characterisations of pigeonpea wilt pathogen Fusarium udum  ap. 423-436.  aThirty two pathogenic isolates of Fusarium udum from different pigeonpea growing areas in India were studied for pathogenic and molecular variability. Pathogenic variability was tested on 12 pigeonpea differential genotypes, which revealed prevalence of five variants in F. udum. The amount of genetic variation was evaluated by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification with 20 random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and nine microsatellite markers. All amplifications revealed scorable polymorphisms among the isolates, and a total of 137 polymorphic fragments were scored for the RAPD markers and 16 alleles for the simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. RAPD primers showed 86% polymorphism. Genetic similarity was calculated using Jaccard's similarity coefficient and cluster analysis was used to generate a dendrogram showing relationships between them. Isolates could be grouped into three subpopulations based on molecular analysis. Results indicated that there is high genetic variability among a subpopulation of F. udum as identified by RAPD and SSR markers and pathogenicity on differential genotypes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aFusarium udum 3aalleles 3acluster analysis 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3apigeon peas 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aIndia 0aFusarium udum 0agenetic diversity 0amolecular characterisation 0apathogenic variability 0apigeonpea1 aDatta, S.1 aChaudhary, R.G.1 aUpadhyay, J.P.1 aSaifulla, M.1 aMishra, S.1 aPrajapti, R.K.1 aShamim, Md.0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 45, no. 4 p.423-436dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2011.587974  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006200147245010700209300001800316520200800334592002802342650001202370650001102382650001702393650001602410651002102426700001902447700002202466773012602488856008102614852000902695655001202704IND60635317420221116233657.0190329e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063531742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-018-4354-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvtushevsky, O.

Concurrent and lagged relationships show that teleconnection strength in austral spring was weak (strong) before (after) 1996/1997. This decadal change coincides in time with the climate regime shift in the Pacific in the 1990s known from many studies. We show that, after the regime shift, the concurrent and delayed teleconnection with the Southern Hemisphere extratropics is insignificant in September and abruptly increases in October. Penetration of the stratospheric anomaly into the troposphere in October can indicate interacting tropospheric and stratospheric pathways of the teleconnection to strongly enhance the central tropical Pacific impact since the late 1990s. The results give evidence that the Southern Annular Mode seems to be connecting element between the two pathways in the recent decades. The common tendencies in the eastward shift of the tropical anomalies and zonal wave 1 phase in the Antarctic stratosphere in austral spring have been demonstrated. The difference between the central Pacific and eastern Pacific teleconnections is consistent with that known from previous studies and new tendencies in their decadal changes and delayed effects have been revealed. It has been found that the central Pacific contributions to the Pacific decadal oscillation and to the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere have also increased significantly after the 1990s. This characterizes the central tropical Pacific as one of the key regions impacting climate and teleconnection not only in the Southern Hemisphere, but also in the Northern Hemisphere. Our findings are consistent with and further develop the recent studies of the stratosphere–troposphere coupling in austral spring, and emphasize significant contribution of the delayed tropical signals to the climate variability in austral spring in both hemispheres.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aspring 3astratosphere 3atroposphere 3aAntarctic region1 aGrytsai, A.

Microarray and quantitative real-time PCR analyses were performed to quantify the differential expression pattern of HLA-G1 + H1 hES cells. The results showed that HLA-G1 differentially regulated the expression of 425 genes with at least a twofold increase or decrease. These differentially expressed genes were classified into 13 functional groups, including cellular components, biological processes, and molecular functions. The pathways of focal adhesion, the TGF-β signaling pathway, and the immune response were the most predominantly affected. The synergism of these genes could explain the mechanism of the immunosuppression of HLA-G1 + H1 hES cells. Thus, the expression pattern reflected a broad spectrum of roles of HLA-G1 in hES cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglobal change 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3amicroarray technology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asynergism 3atransforming growth factor beta 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxcytologyximmunologyxmetabolismxtransplantation. 2aFocal Adhesions 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHLA-G Antigensxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aLentivirusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aMice, SCID 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSignal Transduction 2aTeratomaxmetabolism 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTranscriptome 2aTransfection 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxmetabolism1 aZhao, Sanjun1 aZhao, Hongxi1 aYao, Yuanqing0 tBiochemical genetics.g2012 Oct., v. 50, no. 9-10 p.809-821dSpringer-Verlagx0006-29287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10528-012-9522-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02315naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245012200175500001900297520111000316592002801426650001301454650001101467650002201478650002001500650001201520651001201532653002101544653001201565653001501577653001701592653001601609700002601625700002501651700002101676700002201697773010301719856008601822852000901908655001201917IND60736372220221118041856.0210527e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073637222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1059892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmukall, Matthew J.10aEffects of leader type and gear strength on catches of coastal sharks in a longline survey around Bimini, The Bahamas  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aOur study assessed the influence of leader type (monofilament vs stainless steel cable) and gear strength (i.e., hook size and leader thickness) on species composition, catch rates, and size distribution of sharks captured in a fisheries independent longline survey near Bimini, The Bahamas. A total of 28 surveys were conducted, resulting in 50,400 hook hours. Catches consisted of 167 sharks from eight species. Overall, catches were higher on monofilament leaders for light duty gear, but there was no difference for heavy duty gear. When bite-offs were combined with catches to form ‘total shark contacts’ the rates were not significantly different between the two leader types. Tiger sharks were the only species to show differences in mean pre-caudal lengths between light and heavy duty gear, likely due to the wide range of size classes encountered for this species. These results further highlight the importance of understanding selectivity of terminal gear (gear strength and leader material), especially for comparing catches across surveys conducted by multiple agencies or organizations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aresearch 3asharks 3aspecies diversity 3astainless steel 3asurveys 3aBahamas 0aGear selectivity 0aBycatch 0aManagement 0aConservation 0aCircle hook1 aGuttridge, Tristan L.1 aDhellemmes, Félicie1 aSeitz, Andrew C.1 aGruber, Samuel H.0 tFisheries research.g2021 Aug., v. 240 p.105989-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl33528x0165-78367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2021.1059893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245011800173300001600291520096700307592002801274650002801302650001101330650001001341650001401351650002001365650001201385650001301397650001201410650001801422650001401440650000901454650001401463651001001477653001801487653002301505653002801528653001401556653002501570653001901595700001901614773012501633856005101758852000901809655001201818IND50075500020221122032331.0140410e20120201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007550002DNAL7 a10.1080/03235408.2011.5879832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayaprakashvel, M.10aMorphological and pathological variations of rice sheath blight inciting south Indian Rhizoctonia solani isolates  ap. 455-467.  aFrequent assessment of pathogen diversity is one of the most important criteria in designing disease management programmes. A study on diversity of field isolates of Rhizoctonia solani from sheath blight-infected rice fields of south India has been carried out. A total of 236 R. solani isolates were obtained from 45 locations in the surveyed area. Sclerotial features such as colour, size and shape and distribution pattern were varying among isolates. However, no other morphological features found to differ among isolates. Majority of the R. solani isolates were fast growers as they attained complete mycelial growth within 2 days in a 90-mm Petri plate and the emergence of sclerotial structures was seen even in 4 days of incubation. Selected 10 R. solani isolates exhibited considerable variations in pathogenicity on three different rice cultivars. Vellai ponni was found to be the most susceptible rice cultivar to all the field isolates of R. solani.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3ablight 3acolor 3acultivars 3adisease control 3agrowers 3amycelium 3apaddies 3apathogenicity 3apathogens 3arice 3asclerotia 3aIndia 0asheath blight 0aRhizoctonia solani 0amorphological diversity 0asclerotia 0apathogenic variation 0arice cultivars1 aMathivanan, N.0 tArchives of phytopathology and plant protection.g2012 Feb. 1, v. 45, no. 4 p.455-467dTaylor & Francisx1477-29067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03235408.2011.587983  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013700162520140500299592002801704650002001732650001301752650001501765650001301780650001801793650001401811650002001825651001001845700002001855700002301875700002201898700001801920700001901938700002201957700002001979700002201999700002402021700002402045700002202069700001902091700002302110773012102133856007402254852000902328655001202337IND60784223520221120052458.0220726e20220706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078422352DNAL7 a10.3390/v140714842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl Sayes, Mohamed 10aInsights into Genetic Characteristics and Virological Features of Endemic Avian Influenza A (H9N2) Viruses in Egypt from 2017–2021  aFrom 2010 to 2013, genotype I avian influenza A(H9N2) viruses of the G1-lineage were isolated from several poultry species in Egypt. In 2014, novel reassortant H9N2 viruses were detected in pigeons designated as genotype II. To monitor the subsequent genetic evolution of Egyptian A(H9N2) viruses, we characterized the full genomes of 173 viruses isolated through active surveillance from 2017 to 2022. In addition, we compared the virological characteristics and pathogenicity of representative viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA indicated that all studied sequences from 2017–2021 were grouped into G1-like H9N2 viruses previously detected in Egypt. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Egyptian A(H9N2) viruses had undergone further reassortment, inheriting four genes (PB2, PB1, PA, NS) from genotype II, with their remaining segments deriving from genotype I viruses (these viruses designated as genotype III). Studying the virological features of the two most dominant genotypes (I and III) of Egyptian H9N2 viruses in vitro and in vivo indicated that both replicated well in mammalian cells, but did not show any clinical signs in chickens, ducks, and mice. Monitoring avian influenza viruses through surveillance programs and understanding the genetic and antigenic characteristics of circulating H9N2 viruses are essential for risk assessment and influenza pandemic preparedness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aavian influenza 3agenotype 3amonitoring 3apandemic 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3arisk assessment 3aEgypt1 aKandeil, Ahmed 1 aMoatasim, Yassmin 1 aEl Taweel, Ahmed 1 aRubrum, Adam 1 aKutkat, Omnia 1 aKamel, Mina Nabil1 aBadra, Rebecca 1 aBarakat, Ahmed B.1 aMcKenzie, Pamela P.1 aEl-Shesheny, Rabeh 1 aWebby, Richard J.1 aKayali, Ghazi 1 aAli, Mohamed Ahmed0 tViruses.g2022 July 06, v. 14, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27138x1999-49157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/v140714843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02699naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245011700182520139800299592002801697650003601725650002901761650002201790650001201812650002801824653003001852653002401882653001101906653003601917653002901953700003701982700003702019700002702056700002902083773011802112856008602230852000902316655001202325IND60724201020221122071843.0211114e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072420102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaz, Tainá da Silva Rocha10aAssessment of sustainable development through a multi-criteria approach: Application in brazilian municipalities  aIn the last decades, there has been an increase in impacts on the environment, driven by the industrialization process. As a result, society's social and environmental awareness increased, and business organizations began to promote corporate social responsibility initiatives to positively contribute to better working and environmental conditions, and other sustainability issues. This article aims to verify the performance of 217 Brazilian municipalities from 31 indicators segmented in the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social), selected from the literature review, to contribute to the sustainable investment strategy of organizations. To this end, we used the multi-criteria decision making method, Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), and proposed an analytical sustainability dashboard. The main results of this paper were the sustainable performance rankings of the municipalities and the dashboard with three analytical panels that contributed to identifying the points of improvement of each municipality, consequently contributing to the investment strategy in these locations. This research consists, therefore, of an important methodology, combining the multi-criteria method and the sustainability dashboard, to assess the sustainable development of the municipalities in the triple bottom line dimensions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorporate social responsibility 3aenvironmental management 3aindustrialization 3asociety 3asustainable development 0aSustainability indicators 0aPanel of indicators 0aTOPSIS 0aCorporate social responsibility 0aBrazilian municipalities1 aCaiado, Rodrigo Goyannes Gusmão1 aQuelhas, Osvaldo Luiz Gonçalves1 aGavião, Luiz Octávio1 aLima, Gilson Brito Alves0 tJournal of environmental management.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 282 p.111954-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1119543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245011200167300001800279520097300297592002801270650002001298650002301318650002201341650001301363650002501376700001401401700001201415700001601427700001401443700001401457700005601471773012801527856008401655852000901739655001201748IND60598595620221123043140.0180702e20180116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059859562DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.7b041912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Lingyu10aVisualizing the Regulation of Hydroxyl Radical Level by Superoxide Dismutase via a Specific Molecular Probe  ap. 1317-1324.  aHydroxyl radical (·OH), as the most deleterious reactive oxygen species, is believed to be the etiological agent for many diseases and aging. An altered ·OH level has been confirmed in certain types of superoxide dismutase (SOD) mutation, but the regulation of ·OH by SOD in situ is still controversial or unclear because of the lack of effective tools to detect ·OH in the biological environment. Herein we report the first two-photon excitable molecular probe (P2) for ·OH, which is able to track the subtle fluctuation of ·OH level both in vitro and in vivo with high sensitivity and specificity. The probe was successfully applied to visualize ·OH variations in a variety of SOD1-involved biological processes, confirming that the inhibited enzymatic activity and down-regulated expression of SOD1 both lead to elevated intracellular ·OH level. This is the first report to visually reveal the relationship between SOD1 and ·OH level with a molecular tool.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenzyme activity 3aetiological agents 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amutation 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aXia, Tian1 aHu, Wei1 aChen, Shiyu1 aChi, Siyu1 aLei, Yidi1 aLiu, Zhihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1500-93420 tAnalytical chemistry.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 90, no. 2 p.1317-1324dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b041913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02153naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245010800205300001600313520095500329592002801284650001501312650002101327650001701348650001201365650002001377650001101397650000901408650001601417653003301433653001901466653002601485653001201511653001201523700001601535700002101551773009001572856008401662852000901746655001201755IND60610972220221120225453.0180830e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061097222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Zisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2379-934010aNovel multi-step sorption-reaction energy storage cycles for air conditioning and temperature upgrading  ap. 464-472.  aNovel multi-step sorption-reaction cycles for air conditioning (cooling, heating) and temperature upgrading are studied.

Standing crop of nectar bore little relationship to nectar in bagged flowers either in terms of volume or temporal pattern of availability. There was almost no nectar in open flowers except in those collected at dawn and those of Aphelandra sinclairiana; these were apparently too abundant to be depleted by visitors. Nectar volumes in open flowers were even more variable than in bagged flowers. We argue that understanding the evolution of plant–– pollinator interactions requires understanding the relationship between nectar production and standing crop, as well as the impact of high variability on decisions by foraging animals. We conducted experiments to determine the effect of nectar removal on nectar production. Nectar removal via simulated legitimate visits had no impact on total production in flowers of Pavonia, Isertia, and Palicourea. For A. sinclairiana and Pentagonia, total nectar production in visited flowers was reduced compared to unvisited flowers. Data from individuals of these last two species indicated that the population-level pattern was assembled from individuals that responded differently to nectar removal; clearly, understanding the evolution of nectar traits demands data from individuals. We argue that detecting patterns of plant responses to nectar removal requires the context of floral characteristics (e.g., longevity, ovule number, or pollinators). Nectar removal via simulated nectar-robbing visits had no impact on total nectar production in A. sinclairiana but reduced total production in Isertia. Nectar robbing did not cause plants to invest more energy in nectar than they would have the absence of robbing. Finally, we found no difference in seed set by robbed and unrobbed flowers of A. sinclairiana. Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that nectar robbers are not always detrimental to plant fitness.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAcanthaceae 0aCosta Rica 0ahummingbird pollination 0aMalvaceae 0anectar 0anectar robbing 0aPanama 0aRubiaceae 0astanding crop1 aWeeks, Jennifer A.0 tBiotropica.g2004 June, v. 36, no. 2 p.216-230dAssociation for Tropical Biologyx0006-36067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1646%2F03105-Q15603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01713naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001600281520066700297592002800964650001200992650002301004650001001027650002001037650001901057650000901076650002701085651001001112700001801122700001701140700001501157700001701172773010501189856004801294852000901342655001201351IND50059577520221118045709.0121102e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005957752DNAL7 a10.1007/s12686-012-9670-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoying10aDevelopment and characterization of microsatellite markers for genetic analysis of Cyclina sinensis Gmelin, 1791  ap. 905-907.  aCyclina sinensis is one of the most popular commercially cultivated clam species in China.

Recently, the host protein actin histidine methyltransferase SET domain containing 3 (SETD3) was identified to interact with 2Aᵖʳᵒ and to be essential for virus replication. The role of SETD3 and its interaction with 2Aᵖʳᵒ remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the potential involvement of SETD3 in several functions of 2Aᵖʳᵒ. For this, we introduced the 2Aᵖʳᵒ from coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) in a mutant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) containing an inactivated Leader protein (EMCV-Lᶻⁿ) that is unable to shut down host mRNA translation, to trigger nucleocytoplasmic transport disorder (NCTD), and to suppress stress granule (SG) formation and type I interferon (IFN) induction. Both in wt HeLa cells and in HeLa SETD3 knockout (SETD3ᴷᴼ) cells, the virus containing active 2Aᵖʳᵒ (EMCV-2Aᵖʳᵒ) efficiently cleaved eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma (eIF4G) to shut off host mRNA translation, cleaved nucleoporins to trigger NCTD, and actively suppressed SG formation and IFN gene transcription, arguing against a role of SETD3 in these 2Aᵖʳᵒ-mediated functions. Surprisingly, we observed that the catalytic activity of enteroviral 2A is not crucial for triggering NCTD, as a virus containing an inactive 2Aᵖʳᵒ (EMCV-2Aᵐ) induced NCTD in both wt and SETD3ᴷᴼ cells, albeit delayed, challenging the idea that the NCTD critically depends on nucleoporin cleavage by this protease. Taken together, our results do not support a role of SETD3 in the proteolytic activities of enterovirus 2Aᵖʳᵒ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCardiovirus A 3aEnterovirus 3aactin 3acatalytic activity 3ahistidine 3ainterferons 3amethyltransferases 3amutants 3anucleocytoplasmic transport 3anucleoporins 3apolyproteins 3aproteinases 3aproteolysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aAloise, Chiara 1 avan Vliet, Arno L.

Captopril and furosemide exhibited desorption kinetics over 30–40h, and ranitidine. HCl had a complete release time of 5–10h. As evident from the slow release kinetics, the mesoporous carbons have excellent potential for the controlled-release media of the specific drugs targeted towards oral delivery. The mesoporous carbons, synthesized from phloroglucinol and lignin, a synthetic and a sustainable precursor, respectively, exhibit BET surface area of 200–400m²g⁻¹ and pore volume of 0.2–0.6cm³g⁻¹. The synthetic carbon has narrower pore widths and higher pore volume than the renewable counterpart and maintains a longer release time. The release kinetics reveals that the diffusivities of the drugs from carbon media are of equivalent magnitude (10⁻²² to 10⁻²⁴m²s⁻¹). However, a tailored reduction of pore width in the sorbent reduces the diffusivity of smaller drug molecule by an order of magnitude. Thus, engineered pore morphology, along with its functionalization potential for specific interaction, can be exploited for optimal delivery system of a preferred drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adesorption 3adiffusivity 3afurosemide 3ahydrochloric acid 3alignin 3aporous media 3asorbents 3asurface area1 aWarren, Kaitlyn E.1 aNaskar, Amit K.0 tCarbon.g2014 May, v. 71 p.47-57dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2014.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03180naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011200159520221600271592002802487650001502515650002802530650003102558650001002589700001202599700001902611700001902630700001502649773013002664856007502794852000902869655001202878IND60794340120221118051556.0220922e20220916xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079434012DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141846412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhipeng 10a3D LiDAR Aided GNSS/INS Integration Fault Detection, Localization and Integrity Assessment in Urban Canyons  aThe performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation System (INS) integrated navigation can be severely degraded in urban canyons due to the non-line-of-sight (NLOS) signals and multipath effects. Therefore, to achieve a high-precision and robust integrated system, real-time fault detection and localization algorithms are needed to ensure integrity. Currently, the residual chi-square test is used for fault detection in the positioning domain, but it has poor sensitivity when faults disappear. Three-dimensional (3D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has good positioning performance in complex environments. First, a LiDAR aided real-time fault detection algorithm is proposed. A test statistic is constructed by the mean deviation of the matched targets, and a dynamic threshold is constructed by a sliding window. Second, to solve the problem that measurement noise is estimated by prior modeling with a certain error, a LiDAR aided real-time measurement noise estimation based on adaptive filter localization algorithm is proposed according to the position deviations of matched targets. Finally, the integrity of the integrated system is assessed. The error bound of integrated positioning is innovatively verified with real test data. We conduct two experiments with a vehicle going through a viaduct and a floor hole, which, represent mid and deep urban canyons, respectively. The experimental results show that in terms of fault detection, the fault could be detected in mid urban canyons and the response time of fault disappearance is reduced by 70.24% in deep urban canyons. Thus, the poor sensitivity of the residual chi-square test for fault disappearance is improved. In terms of localization, the proposed algorithm is compared with the optimal fading factor adaptive filter (OFFAF) and the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed algorithm is the most effective, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in the east and north is reduced by 12.98% and 35.1% in deep urban canyons. Regarding integrity assessment, the error bound can overbound the positioning errors in deep urban canyons relative to the EKF and the mean value of the error bounds is reduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achi-square distribution 3aglobal positioning systems 3alidar1 aLi, Bo 1 aDan, Zhiqiang 1 aWang, Hongxia 1 aFang, Kun 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Sept. 16, v. 14, no. 18dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141846413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245006200170300001600232520096100248592002801209650002501237650001201262650001401274650001901288650001601307650001501323650001301338650002301351650001701374653002801391653001201419653000901431653003001440653000901470653002401479653002201503700002401525700001701549773009701566856008201663852000901745655001201754IND60691343820200616000000.0200429e20030901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069134382DNAL7 a10.2752/0892793037869920712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarker, Sandra B.10aEffect of aquariums on electroconvulsive therapy patients  ap. 229-240.  aThis study investigates the effect of an aquarium on pre-treatment anxiety, fear. frustration, and depression in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) patients.

State-of-the-art GDLs of the type SIGRACET® SGL 25BC were aged for 0 h, 16 h and 24 h in a hydrogen peroxide solution before they were assembled in the fuel cells. In-operando radiographic measurements were combined with voltage and contact angle measurements. Correlations between applied ageing conditions, GDL water saturation and cell performance were revealed. Hereby, all cell operating conditions were tested several times to estimate the reproducibility of in-operando radiographic fuel cell measurements.Water films at the GDL-membrane and at the GDL-flow field interfaces were found and attributed to MPL cracks and large pores in the GDL structure. The combination of these cracks and pores are assumed to play a crucial role for blocked gas paths, leading to an undersupply with reactants and an increased humidification of the membrane. It is shown that water agglomerations directly impact the membrane resistance. We assume that the hydrophobicity of the fibers inside the GDL is more important for the cell performance than water agglomerations at the membrane-GDL interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontact angle 3aelectric power 3aelectrolytes 3afuel cells 3ahumidification 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3apolymers 3aradiography 3awater management 0aPolymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell 0aIn-operando synchrotron radiography 0aArtificial ageing 0aGas diffusion layer 0aWater management1 aKlages, Merle1 aMesserschmidt, Matthias1 aScholta, Joachim1 aManke, Ingo0 tEnergy.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 118 p.502-511dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2016.10.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03740naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245006400172300001600236520242200252592002802674650002202702650003702724650001102761650001902772650002502791650001302816650002102829650001302850650001502863650001402878650003302892650001102925650001102936653001402947653001802961653001802979653002402997653002203021700001603043700001803059773011203077856008403189852000903273655001203282IND60601444920221122063840.0180706e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060144492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2013.12.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhatib, Sheima J.10aSulfur resistant Pd and Pd alloy membranes by phosphidation  ap. 283-293.  aNovel ultra-thin Pd and Pd-alloy (Pd–Ag, Pd–Cu) membranes, with a phosphorus component, were prepared on a porous hollow fiber α-alumina support. The aim was to study the effect of the presence of a P additive on the behavior of the membranes towards sulfur poisoning. To incorporate P in the structure, the membranes were exposed to PH3 as a gaseous phosphorous source. The performance and sulfur resistance of the membranes with and without P was evaluated by measuring the hydrogen permeance and the H2/N2 selectivity at 673K before and during exposure to a gas mixture of 100ppm H2S in H2, and also after regeneration in H2. The membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), both before exposure to H2S and after exposure/regeneration. XRD shows no detectable amounts of sulfur or phosphorus compounds in any of the exposed or P-treated membranes respectively. XPS indicates that S was located on the surface of the H2S/H2 treated Pd and Pd–Ag membranes. No S was detected on the surface of the Pd–Cu membranes indicating that no irreversible S compounds were formed in the latter. P was also detected on the surface of the P-treated membranes. The presence of phosphorus lowered the hydrogen permeance and H2/N2 selectivity; however it drastically improved the Pd-alloy membranes' capacity of recovery in H2 after H2S poisoning. The Pd–Cu membrane recovered only part of its H2 permeance after regeneration, going from 11.2×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ (as-prepared) to 2.3×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹, while in the presence of P the H2 permeance varied from 5.2×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ (as-prepared) to 6.5×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ and its H2/N2 selectivity increased from 30,000 to 40,000. Similarly, the Pd–Ag membrane recovered better in the presence of P going from 17×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ (as-prepared) to 6.3×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ in contrast to 52×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ (as-prepared) to 5.9×10⁻⁷molm⁻²s⁻¹Pa⁻¹ in the absence of P. SEM images show that in the absence of P, more cracks and pinholes are visible on the surface of the H2S/H2 exposed membranes. The presence of P produces more homogeneous surfaces and less segregation, conferring a structural integrity to the membrane by suppressing the formation of cracks and pinholes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aalloys 3aaluminum oxide 3aartificial membranes 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen sulfide 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3apoisoning 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asulfur 0aPalladium 0aCuPd and AgPd 0aPhosphidation 0aPalladium phosphide 0aSulfur resistance1 aYun, Samhun1 aOyama, S.

This comb-like polymer was characterized by attenuated total reflectance-FTIR (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The carboxyl groups of mPEG-COOH reacted with the epoxy groups of ENR to produce graft polymers. The composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) based on this comb-like polymer ENR-g-mPEG-COOH was prepared via introducing LiClO₄ into the graft polymer matrix. The CPE was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), DSC, an equilibrium swelling method, and electrochemical workstation techniques. With increasing mPEG-COOH content, the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte significantly increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarboxylic acids 3acomposite polymers 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aepoxides 3amoieties 3apolyethylene glycol 3arubber1 aMei, Hua1 aRen, Wentan1 aZhang, Yong0 tRSC advances.g2016 Nov. 09, v. 6, no. 108 p.107021-107028dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17129j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006600148245012600214300001600340500001900356520138900375592002801764596008001792596006301872650002501935650001201960650001501972650001401987650001502001650002102016650003102037650002402068650001202092650001902104650001302123650001602136650001302152651001502165700001902180700002102199700002102220700002602241700002502267773009902292856008202391852000902473655001202482IND60689976720221119225016.0200424e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997672DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-019-00430-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChamberlain, Samuel D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5570-764X10aEffect of Drought-Induced Salinization on Wetland Methane Emissions, Gross Ecosystem Productivity, and Their Interactions  ap. 675-688.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSalinity gradients across estuaries influence wetland carbon storage, methane (CH₄) biogeochemistry, and plant productivity. Estuarine freshwater wetlands may experience increases in salinity during drought; however, the impact of salinization on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is uncertain. We measured ecosystem-scale GHG emissions from a wetland experiencing salinization during the 2011–2017 California drought and used information theory analyses to quantify couplings and causal interactions between CH₄ fluxes and two dominant environmental drivers; gross ecosystem photosynthesis and temperature. Machine learning models were then used to estimate salinization-induced changes in CH₄ fluxes and plant productivity. We observed dynamic CH₄ flux-driver relationships across the salinization disturbance event, where temperature connections strengthened, and productivity connections dampened during salinization. Annual gross ecosystem productivity reduced by 64% during peak salinization, whereas annual CH₄ emissions only reduced by 10%, suggesting that other CH₄ substrate sources compensated for reductions in recent photosynthate. Our results demonstrate the value of applying information theory and machine learning approaches to ecological analyses and suggest that drought-induced salinization may increase GHG emissions from estuarine freshwater wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data  aAmeriflux contract 7079856cU.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Science  aAward 4600011240cCalifornia Department of Water Resources 3acarbon sequestration 3adrought 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3agreenhouse gases 3agross primary productivity 3amathematical theory 3amethane 3aphotosynthesis 3asalinity 3atemperature 3awetlands 3aCalifornia1 aHemes, Kyle S.1 aEichelmann, Elke1 aSzutu, Daphne J.1 aVerfaillie, Joseph G.1 aBaldocchi, Dennis D.0 tEcosystems.g2020 Apr., v. 23, no. 3 p.675-688dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-019-00430-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245014400159300001600303520124700319592002801566650001401594650002601608650002801634650002701662650001501689650001501704650001601719650001801735650001201753650001401765650002701779650002301806650001601829650002201845650000901867700002001876700001901896700001801915700001901933700001701952773012101969856007402090852000902164655001202173IND60440517320221120220427.0151024e200507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051732DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029773472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Ji Woong10aAdenosine and purine nucleosides prevent the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential by peroxynitrite in rat primary astrocytes  ap. 810-815.  aPreviously, we have shown that astrocytes deprived of glucose became highly vulnerable to peroxynitrite, and adenosine and its metabolites attenuated the gliotoxicityvia the preservation of cellular ATP level. Here, we found that adenosine and related metabolites prevented the disruption of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) in glucose-deprived rat primary astrocytes exposed to 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), a peroxynitrite releasing agent. Exposure to glucose deprivation and SIN-1 (2h) significantly disrupted MTP in astrocytes, and adenosine prevented it in dose-dependent manner with an EC₅₀ of 5.08 μM. Adenosine also partially prevented the cell death by myxothiazol, a well-known inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Blockade of adenosine deamination or intracellular transport with erythro-9-(hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenosine (EHNA) or S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI), respectively, completely reversed the protective effect of adenosine. Other purine nucleos(t)ides including inosine, guanosine, ATP, ADP, AMP, ITP, and GTP also showed similar protective effects. This study indicates that adenosine and related purine nucleos(t)ides may protect astrocytes from peroxynitrite-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine 3aadenosine diphosphate 3aadenosine monophosphate 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aastrocytes 3acell death 3adeamination 3adose response 3aglucose 3aguanosine 3aguanosine triphosphate 3amembrane potential 3ametabolites 3aprotective effect 3arats1 aYoo, Byung-Kwon1 aRyu, Mi Kyoung1 aChoi, Min Sik1 aPark, Gyu Hwan1 aKo, Kwang Ho0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 July, v. 28, no. 7 p.810-815dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029773473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011700157300002000274520143000294592002801724650001501752650001501767650001101782650001901793650001201812650001001824650002101834650001501855650001101870650003301881650001501914650001901929700002001948700001701968700001801985700001802003773012402021856007402145852000902219655001202228IND60664709020221119174836.0190912e20131115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470902DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45052j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Hyunjoo10aUnderstanding the unique interaction of amine-containing ionic compounds with SO₂ for high absorption capacity  ap. 25944-25949.  aControl of the interaction between sorbents and acid gases (SO₂ and CO₂) is of prime importance for a fundamental understanding of acid–base chemistry to aid in the development of new absorbents. However, delicated and precise monitoring of the reaction dynamics by conventional one-dimensional (1D) spectroscopy is still challenging due to overlapping bands and restricted static information. Herein, we investigated the unique interactions of an amine-containing ionic compound, [Bztmeda][MeSO₃], and SO₂, which are related to the high absorption capacity and reversibility of the reaction, by principal component analysis (PCA) and two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy (2D IR COS). The physical transition of [Bztmeda][MeSO₃], arising from the hydrogen bonding interactions with SO₂, could not be observed by 1D IR spectra, but was captured by PCA analysis. Synchronous 2D correlation spectra demonstrated that the absorption of SO₂ was derived from the hydrogen bonding interactions between the tertiary amine groups of [Bztmeda] cations and the oxygen atoms of SO₂ and/or between the sulfonate groups of [MeSO₃] anions (bridged by water molecules) and the oxygen atoms of SO₂. Asynchronous 2D correlation spectra decoupled the new bands of amine and sulfonate groups under the different chemical environments, showing the order of the actual sequence of the SO₂ absorption processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aanions 3acarbon dioxide 3acations 3agases 3ahydrogen bonding 3amonitoring 3aoxygen 3aprincipal component analysis 3asulfonates 3asulfur dioxide1 aJung, Young Mee1 aLee, Keun Im1 aKim, Hoon Sik1 aPark, Ho Seok0 tRSC advances.g2013 Nov. 15, v. 3, no. 48 p.25944-25949dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra45052j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006700148245011900215300001600334500001900350520167200369592002802041596005602069596009902125596008602224650001202310650001202322650001102334650001502345650001502360650001902375650001902394650002502413650000902438650001302447651001702460700002302477700002202500700002102522773009902543856008202642852000902724655001202733IND60689976820221119224815.0200424e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997682DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-019-00438-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonaldson, Jason Ernest1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9267-329310aDroughts Decouple African Savanna Grazers from Their Preferred Forage with Consequences for Grassland Productivity  ap. 689-701.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aGrazing lawn and flammable-tussock grass communities are contrasting resource pools for mammalian grazers in terms of forage quantity and quality. Drought events fundamentally alter forage availability within these communities and therefore should alter herbivore use with repercussions for the recovery and functioning of ecosystems after drought. During and after an intense El Niño drought (2014–2017) in Kruger National Park, South Africa, we addressed two questions: (1) how does herbivore use of different grass types change during a drought and (2) how do these changes affect grass productivity post-drought? We monitored grazer use of three different grass communities (lawn, tussock and burned-tussock) at a landscape scale and measured primary productivity monthly during and post-drought. For the first drought year, grazer numbers were highest on grazing lawn communities. This pattern continued into the second dry growing season, until herbivores finally left the study area. Both lawns and tussock grasslands recovered rapidly after the first good rainfall (productivity > 150 g m⁻² per month). However, grazers did not return to feed on the same patches they had frequented pre-drought resulting in grazing lawn grasses self-shading and senescing. Longer droughts have the potential to decouple grazers and grazing lawns with negative impacts on lawn productivity and persistence that could drive the loss of lawns in savanna landscapes and impact mesoherbivore populations. It is clear from our results that grazer effects need to be incorporated into drought frameworks to understand the consequences of droughts for grassland function.  aPublisher supplied data  a94250cNational Research Foundation of South Africa  aSub-Grant 2000004946cUSAID/NAS program ‘Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research’  aCycle 3cUSAID/NAS program ‘Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research’ 3aEl Nino 3adrought 3aforage 3aherbivores 3alandscapes 3alawns and turf 3anational parks 3aprimary productivity 3arain 3asavannas 3aSouth Africa1 aParr, Catherine L.1 aMangena, E.

The QSLNs were prepared by emulsification solvent evaporation followed by a cold homogenization method. The QSLNs were spherical when observed under atomic force microscopy, with an average diameter of 172.9 ± 12.65 nm. This formulation was pharmaceutically characterized and then evaluated for osteoprotective activity in ovariectomized (OVx) rats. A single oral dose of QSLNs (5 mg kg⁻¹ d⁻¹) significantly increased the bioavailability compared to free quercetin. The oral administration of QSLNs to ovariectomized rats increased serum quercetin levels by 3.5-fold compared to free quercetin. After 12 weeks of treatment, the bone mineral density of the femur, tibia and lumbar spine L-5 measured by micro-computed tomography (μCT) was restored in the QSLNs group, and was equivalent to the sham control group compared to in the OVx group, but the QSLNs had no effect on adipogenesis and uterine weight in OVx rats. μCT analysis showed that the QSLNs group had an improved trabecular microarchitecture in the distal femoral, proximal tibial and lumbar spine cancellous bones. The developed quercetin formulation based on solid lipid nanoparticles inhibited bone loss in osteopenic rats. Q and QSLNs inhibited the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast cells differentiation and the expression of osteoclast-specific genes in in vitro experiments using bone marrow cells treated with RANKL and M-CSF. The data from this study suggest that, overall, QSLNs treatment recovers bone loss (femur, BV/TV; ∼21%, p < 0.01) more so than in the Q treatment group, while both inhibit bone loss without showing any hyperplasic effect on the uteri in OVx rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipogenesis 3aanimal models 3aatomic force microscopy 3abioavailability 3ablood serum 3abone density 3abone health 3abone marrow cells 3abone resorption 3acold 3aemulsifying 3aevaporation 3afemur 3agenes 3ahomogenization 3ain vitro studies 3aligands 3alipids 3alumbar spine 3amacrophage colony-stimulating factor 3amicro-computed tomography 3ananoparticles 3aoral administration 3aosteoclasts 3aosteoporosis 3aovariectomy 3apostmenopause 3aquercetin 3arats 3asolvents 3atibia 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B1 aBanala, Venkatesh Teja1 aKushwaha, Priyanka1 aKarvande, Anirudha1 aSharma, Shweta1 aTripathi, Ashish Kumar1 aVerma, Ashwni1 aTrivedi, Ritu1 aMishra, Prabhat Ranjan0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 12, v. 6, no. 100 p.97613-97628dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17141a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02457naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245009500161300002000256520130600276592002801582650002401610650002601634650001701660650000901677650001401686650001501700650001101715650001901726650001101745700002101756700002201777700001501799700002701814700001801841773012801859856007501987852000902062655001202071IND60534413020221118052402.0160802e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053441302DNAL7 a10.1021/es30177172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchultz, Aaron
G.10aSilver Nanoparticles Inhibit Sodium Uptake in Juvenile Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)  ap. 10295-10301.  aThe silver ion (Ag⁺) is well documented to be a potent inhibitor of sodium (Na⁺) transport in fish. However, it has not been determined whether silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) elicit this same effect and, if so, if the NP itself and/or the dissociation of ionic Ag⁺ causes this effect. Citrate-capped Ag NPs were dialyzed in water to determine the dissolution rate of ionic Ag⁺ from the NPs and the maximum concentration of free Ag⁺ released from the NPs was used as a paired Ag⁺ control to distinguish NP effects from ionic metal effects. The maximum concentration of ionic Ag⁺ released from these NPs over 48 h was 0.02 μg l–¹. Juvenile rainbow trout were exposed to 1.0 mg l–¹ citrate-capped Ag NPs and dialyzed citrate-capped Ag NPs or 10 μg l–¹ and 0.02 μg l–¹ ionic Ag⁺ (as AgNO₃) as controls. Both nondialyzed and dialyzed Ag NPs and 10 μg l–¹ ionic Ag⁺ significantly inhibited unidirectional Na⁺ influx by over 50% but had no effect on unidirectional Na⁺ efflux. Na⁺,K⁺-ATPase was significantly inhibited by the Ag NPs with no discernible effect on carbonic anhydrase activity. This study is the first to show that sodium regulation is disrupted by the presence of citrate-capped Ag NPs, and the results suggest that there are nanospecific effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3acarbonate dehydratase 3adissociation 3afish 3ajuveniles 3ananosilver 3asilver 3asilver nitrate 3asodium1 aOng, Kimberly J.1 aMacCormack, Tyson1 aMa, Guibin1 aVeinot, Jonathan G.

These gases affect the direct application of biogas, and are a prime concern in biogas utilization processes. Conventional physico-chemical biogas purification methods are energy-intensive and expensive. To promote sustainable development and environmental friendly technologies, biological biogas purification technologies can be applied. This review describes biological technologies for both upstream and downstream processing in terms of pollutant removal mechanisms and efficiency, bioreactor configurations and different operating conditions. Limitations of the biological approaches and their future scope are also highlighted.

The nucleoprotein of influenza A virus, which is one of the most conserved and abundant structural proteins on the virion, was used as a target. In this study, highly sensitive biosensors were realized by combining specific recognition of antibody–antigen interactions and high signal enhancement of the SERS effect. SERS probes were fabricated by decorating PEGylated, 4,4′-thiobisbenzenethiol (TBBT)-labeled gold nanoparticles (NPs) with influenza A antibodies. To improve the sensitivity, a SERS immunoassay was performed on two-dimensional (2D) arrays of gold@silver core–shell (Au@Ag) NPs, which work as SERS substrates. The SERS signal of TBBT was utilized to detect the selective nucleoprotein–antibody recognition. The SERS signal was enhanced ∼4 times by using the SERS substrates instead of a flat Au film. These results indicate that using a well-tuned Au@Ag 2D array as a SERS substrate is an effective way of improving sensitivity of SERS-based biosensors. Our SERS immunoassay system revealed high selectivity and good reproducibility with a sample-to-sample variation of 4.6% (relative standard deviation). To demonstrate the applicability of our SERS immunoassay system to real biological samples, the detection of influenza A using infected allantoic fluid was also performed. The linear relation between the concentration of infected allantoic fluid and the SERS signal was obtained in the range of 5 to 56 TCID₅₀ per mL (R² = 0.96 for the TBBT Raman bands at 1565 cm⁻¹) with the lowest detection limit of 6 TCID₅₀ per mL. These findings demonstrated the potential of this SERS immunosensor platform for the highly sensitive and specific detection of target molecules in a complex matrix commonly found in clinical specimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInfluenza A virus 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aallantoic fluid 3aantibodies 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3agold 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ainfluenza 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3anucleoproteins 3astandard deviation 3astructural proteins 3avirion1 aSakamoto, Kenji1 aLaocharoensuk, Rawiwan1 aBamrungsap, Suwussa1 aSongsivilai, Sirirurg1 aDharakul, Tararaj1 aMiki, Kazushi0 tRSC advances.g2016 Oct. 13, v. 6, no. 100 p.97791-97799dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17143e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002100146245013100167300001800298520164600316592002801962650002201990650001402012650001102026650001302037650001602050700006202066773013602128856008002264852000902344655001202353IND60735907020221120072703.0210429e20210416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073590702DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c016202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Ronald P.12aA Simple New Way To Account for Free Volume in Glassy Dynamics: Model-Free Estimation of the Close-Packed Volume from PVT Data  ap. 4221-4231.  aIn this article we focus on the important role of well-defined free volume (Vfᵣₑₑ) in dictating the structural relaxation times, τ, of glass-forming liquids and polymer melts. Our definition of Vfᵣₑₑ = V – Vₕc, where V is the total system volume, means the use of Vfᵣₑₑ depends on determination of Vₕc, the system’s volume in the limiting closely packed state. Rejecting the historically compromised use of Vfᵣₑₑ as a dynamics-dependent fitting function, we have successfully applied a clear thermodynamics-based route to Vₕc using the locally correlated lattice (LCL) model equation of state (EOS). However, in this work we go further and show that Vₕc can be defined without the use of an equation of state by direct linear extrapolation of a V(T) high-pressure isobar down to zero temperature (T). The results from this route, tested on a dozen experimental systems, yield ln τ vs 1/Vfᵣₑₑ isotherms that are linear with T-dependent slopes, consistent with the general ln τ ∼ f(T) × (1/Vfᵣₑₑ) form of behavior we have previously described. This functional form also results by implementing a simple mechanistic explanation via the cooperative free volume (CFV) rate model, which assumes that dynamic relaxation is both thermally activated and that it requires molecular segmental cooperativity. With the degree of the latter, and thus the activation energy, being determined by the availability of free volume, the new route we demonstrate here for determination of Vfᵣₑₑ expands the potential for understanding and predicting local dynamic relaxation in glass-forming materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aequations 3amodels 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aLipson, Jane E.

The effective operation of these DWTS requires regular desludging and so knowledge of expected filling rates is essential for both the homeowner as well as the municipalities which accept this sludge in licensed premises; yet few studies have attempted to quantify the sludge accumulation in such decentralized systems. Field studies were carried out on 27 septic tanks across Ireland to quantify sludge accumulation rates from which optimum desludging frequencies for use in Ireland have then been determined. Sludge accumulation was found to be very high in the first 12 months of system operation (approximately 250 L/person/y) but dropped off to below 150 L/person/y after 2 years. Such volumetric accumulation rates appear high compared to the few other reported international studies; however, measured solids accumulation rates, were low compared to international estimates, ranging from 1 to 10 kg/person/y. An equation for optimal desludging frequencies between 3 and 5 years has been formulated for various tank sizes and occupancy based on the Irish field data and previous international research - 5 years being the maximum allowable interval between desludging before the limiting volume of 50% sludge in the tank is reached.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequations 3amaritime climate 3amunicipal wastewater 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3aIreland 0aOn-site wastewater 0aSeptic tank 0aDesludging 0aAccumulation 0aSanitation1 aKnappe, Jan1 aGill, Laurence W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1599-11050 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 304 p.114199-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2021.1141993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01243naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013800156300001800294520023700312592002800549650002300577650001200600650001300612650002200625700001200647700001500659700001900674700001800693773013400711856007500845852000900920655001200929IND60658990720221121170429.0190826e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899072DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc11996f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Peng12aA novel (3,36)-connected and self-interpenetrated metal–organic framework with high thermal stability and gas-sorption capabilities  ap. 7722-7724.  aBy using a ligand containing pyridyl and carboxylate groups as units, a novel (3,36)-connected and self-interpenetrated metal–organic framework was constructed, which exhibited high thermal stability and gas sorption capabilities.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3aligands 3asorption 3athermal stability1 aLi, Bao1 aZhao, Ying1 aMeng, Xianggao1 aZhang, Tianle0 tChemical communications.g2011 June 28, v. 47, no. 27 p.7722-7724dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc11996f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03146naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245012900165500002200294520190400316592002802220653001802248653001202266653001502278653002002293653001802313653002802331653002102359653002002380653002602400653003102426700001302457700001402470700001302484700001602497700001802513700001202531773010202543856008202645852000902727655001202736IND60569321620221118115120.0170524s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056932162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ngib.2017.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Zhongren10aHigh-yield well modes and production practices in the Longwangmiao Fm gas reservoirs, Anyue Gas Field, central Sichuan Basin  aPre-press version  aThe lithologic Longwangmiao Fm gas reservoirs are situated in the Moxi Block of the Anyue Gas Field, central Sichuan Basin. Due to their great heterogeneity affected by the differential roles of lithologic facies and karstification, huge differences exist in the single-well gas yield tests. To improve the development efficiency of gas reservoirs and achieve the goal of “high yield but with few wells to be drilled”, it is especially important to establish a high-yield gas well mode by use of cores, logging, seismic data, etc., and through analysis of reservoir properties, high-yield controlling factors, and seismic response features of quality reservoirs and so on. The following findings were achieved. (1) The positive relationship between yield and the thickness of dissolved vug reservoirs is obvious. (2) The dissolved vug reservoirs are reflected as the type of honeycomb dark patches from the image logging and the conventional logging is featured generally by “Three Lows and Two Highs (i.e., low GR, low RT and low DEN but high AC and high CNL)”. (3) From the seismic profile, the highlighted spots (strong peaks) correspond to the bottom boundary of the Longwangmiao Fm reservoirs. The trough waves in larger amplitude represents that there are more well-developed karsts in the reservoirs. On this basis, high-quality 3D seismic data was used for tracking and fine interpretation of those highlighted spots and trough waves on the strong peaks to describe the plane distribution of high-yield dissolved vug reservoirs in this study area. This study is of great significance to the good planning of development wells and well trajectory planning and adjustment. As a result, high-thickness dissolved vug reservoirs have been targeted in this study area with the tested gas yield of 28 wells reaching up to 100 × 104 m3/d among the completed and tested 30 wells in total.  aPublisher supplied data 0aSichuan Basin 0aCentral 0aMoxi Block 0aLongwangmiao Fm 0aGas reservoir 0aDissolved vug reservoir 0aSeismic response 0aHigh-yield mode 0aReservoir description 0aEncountering the pay zones1 aYang, Yu1 aXiao, Yao1 aHe, Bing1 aSong, Linke1 aZhang, Minzhi1 aLi, Fei0 tNatural Gas Industry B.g2017, dElsevier B.V.aSichuan Petroleum Administrationx2352-85407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ngib.2017.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200445 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024005000099040001800149100001700167245008700184300001600271500000900287520180500296592002802101650001302129650000902142650002802151650001502179650003002194650001902224650002102243650002502264650000902289650001002298650002102308650001602329650001102345650002502356650002102381651001302402700002002415700001602435700002302451773012202474852000902596856009702605655001202702991594312680742620221116232248.0191122e197707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7790947852DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1977.00021962006900040025x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmika, D.

This study was conducted on a Torripsammet soil (Valent fine sandy loam) during three consecutive growing seasons to determine the magnitude and differences in NO₃-N losses below corn (Zea mays L.) roots from two different, but current, farmer-used fertilizer management practices. Three farmer-owned and -operated center pivot sprinkler irrigation systems (designated A, B, and C) near Crook, Colo. were used each year. Nitrate-N percolation losses were measured in water samples collected at 150 cm below the soil surface in vacuum extractors located in a line 91, 182, and 372 m for the pivot in each field. The A, B, and C systems were managed so that 4.8, 2.5, and 10.2% respectively, of the growing season water (irrigation plus rain) percolated to the 150-cm depth. Three-year average annual NO₃-N collected in the extractors was 30.4, 19.0, and 59.7 kg/ha for the A, B, and C systems, respectively. Nitrate-N and water percolating to the 150-cm depth were highly correlated (r = 0.95), with each centimeter of water carrying an average 10.2 kg/ha NO₃-N. Average annual total dry matter production for the systems, in the same order, was 20,763, 21,876, and 18,858 kg/ha, respectively, and was negatively related to NO,-N percolating to the 150-cm depth (r = −0.99), showing that production was highly related to NO₃-N loss. Total dry matter production decreased 65 kg/ha for each kg/ha of NO₃-N percolating to the 150-cm depth. Soil NO₃-N changed very little from spring to fall in each of the systems but the soil under the A and B systems contained more than 250 kg/ha NO₃-N to a depth of 180 cm, whereas soil under the C system contained only 20 kg/ha to this depth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acorn 3adry matter accumulation 3aextractors 3agroundwater contamination 3agrowing season 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3arain 3aroots 3asandy loam soils 3asandy soils 3aspring 3asprinkler irrigation 3awater management 3aColorado1 aHeermann, D.

Concentrations of air pollutants (nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), particulate matter with an aerodynamics diameters ≤ 1.0 µm (PM₁), ≤2.5 µm (PM₂.₅) or ≤10 µm (PM₁₀)) of individuals were estimated using a spatiotemporal model based on satellites data. The metabolic equivalent (MET) of PA of each individual was evaluated using the formula: duration (hour/time) × frequency/week × MET coefficient of each type of activity. Logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between air pollutants, PA and high 10-year ASCVD risk. Interaction plots were used to describe interactive effects of air pollutants and PA on high 10-year ASCVD risk.Each 1 µg/m³ increase in PM₁, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀ and NO₂ were related to a 4.4% (odds ratio (OR): 1.044, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.034, 1.056), 9.1% (OR: 1.091, 95% CI: 1.079, 1.104), 4.6% (OR: 1.046, 95% CI: 1.040, 1.051) or 6.4% (OR: 1.064, 95% CI: 1.055, 1.072) increase in high 10-year ASCVD risk (all p < 0.001), respectively; each one unit-increase in PA MET (hour/day) value was related to a 1.8% (OR: 0.982, 95% CI: 0.980, 0.985) decrease in high 10-year ASCVD risk. Negative interactive effects of PA and PM₁, PM₂.₅, PM₁₀ and NO₂ on high 10-year ASCVD risk were observed (all p < 0.001).Exposure to high levels of air pollutants were related to increase high 10-year ASCVD risk and these associations were attenuated by PA, implying that PA may be an effective method to the prevention of high 10-year ASCVD risk in highly polluted rural regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aaerodynamics 3aair 3aair pollution 3acardiovascular diseases 3achronic exposure 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aenvironment 3amodels 3anitrogen dioxide 3aodds ratio 3aparticulates 3aphysical activity 3aregression analysis 3arisk 0aASCVD 0aNO2 0aPA 0aPM1 0aPM2.5 0aPM10 0aMET 0aCVD 0aWC 0aSBP 0aTC 0aHDL-C 0aBP 0aAOD 0aOMI 0aSD 0aCI 0aAtherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 0aRural population1 aHou, Jian1 aLiu, Xiaotian1 aLi, Ruiying1 aDong, Xiaokang1 aPan, Mingming1 aMao, Zhenxing1 aHuo, Wenqian1 aChen, Gongbo1 aGuo, Yuming1 aLi, Shanshan1 aWang, Chongjian0 tEnvironment international.g2020 July, v. 140 p.105819-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6374x0160-41207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.1058193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01888naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005400149245016600203300001800369520051200387592002800899650001100927650002300938650002300961650002300984650002301007650003101030650002301061650001401084650001201098650000901110700001901119700001801138700001701156700001801173700001701191700005701208773012101265856008301386852000901469655001201478IND60653933320221116183953.0190722e20190702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065393332DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.9b020982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yuxin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7410-609210aHighly Enantioselective Synthesis of Acyclic N,N′-Acetals by Chiral Urea Derived from Quinine Catalyzed the Addition of Aryl Amines to Isatin-Derived Ketimines  ap. 5719-5724.  aN,N′-Acetals are sensitive compounds, and the challenging asymmetric synthesis of acyclic N,N′-acetals by the general addition of amines to ketimines has never been reported so far.

This study was conducted to determine the effects of the long-term application of different sources and rates of P application on extractable [DTPA-sorbitol (diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid and sorbitol] micronutrients. Soil extractable and total micronutrients (B, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo, and Zn), pH, and organic matter content were determined from sites across Oklahoma that had received long-term applications of beef manure, swine effluent, biosolids, or commercial fertilizer. Three continuous inorganic P experiments that had been conducted for 36 to 39 yr and three organic P experiments that had been conducted for 11 to 12 yr were evaluated. The long-term application of inorganic P had little effect on micronutrient availability. However, long-term application of biosolids significantly (p < 0.05) increased extractable Cu, Fe, Mo, and Zn in soil, while long-term application of beef manure significantly increased all the micronutrients evaluated. Similarly, the long-term application of swine effluent significantly increased extractable B, Cu, Mo, and Zn in soil. The addition of micronutrients from organic amendments increased micronutrient availability, while long-term inorganic P application had little effect. The result of our study indicates organic amendments make an ideal fertilizer source for areas with micronutrient deficiencies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosolids 3acattle manure 3acopper 3acrop production 3afertilizer rates 3airon 3along term effects 3amanganese 3aorganic matter 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3asoil 3asorbitol 3aswine 3azinc 3aOklahoma1 aZhang, Hailin1 aSchroder, Jackie L.1 aHattey, Jeffrey A.1 aRaun, William R.1 aPayton, Mark E.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2011 May, v. 75, no. 3 p.927-939dThe Soil Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2010.02693Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01725naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010400168300001600272520084000288592002801128650002101156650001501177650001401192700002001206773010701226856008201333990002301415852000901438655001201447IND60094114020221118124549.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarelier, Sarah10aLigand specificity, privileged substructures and protein druggability from fragment-based screening  ap. 469-474.  aFragment-based screening has now become an established method for the generation of lead molecules against therapeutic targets. Fragment molecules are simple, low molecular-weight compounds with few chemical functionalities. These characteristics lead to high hit rates for fragment screening as compared to the more classical High-Throughput Screening of drug-like molecules and raise the question of the specificity of fragment molecules. This review analyzes recent outcomes of fragment screenings published in the literature, showing that the specificity of the fragments can be related to their structures and physico-chemical properties. We also discuss both the concept of privileged fragment scaffolds and the role of fragment-based screening in predicting protein druggability, highlighted by recent publications in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3amolecular weight 3aprediction 3ascreening1 aKrimm, Isabelle0 tCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology.g2011 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.469-474dElsevier Ltdx1367-59317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.02.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02386naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245008300169300001400252520091500266592002801181650002501209650002501234650001301259650005801272650001401330650001001344650001301354650002101367650002801388651001501416653001701431653001601448653002901464653002401493653001301517653001801530700002301548700002301571700003001594700003201624700002201656700002501678773011401703856007801817852000901895655001201904IND60614568620221117173443.0181029e20180701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061456862DNAL7 a10.2478/nbec-2018-00072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBozorov, Soyibjon S.10aChemical composition and biological activity of seed oil of amaranth varieties  ap. 66-73.  aThe work is devoted to study of seed oil composition of amaranth varieties: Kharkov, Lera, Andijan and Helios, acclimatized in Uzbekistan. We demonstrated the possibility of using reversed-phase HPLC using a refractometric detector, which allows simultaneous determination of squalene and triacylglycerides in plant seeds and determining the authenticity of amaranth oils. Established seed oiliness ranged from 6.39 to 7.81 % of the initial mass. Amaranth oil samples contained quite large amount of unsaturated fatty acids 72.72 – 73.28 %, 1.17 % of which is omega-3-alpha-linolenic acid. The squalene content in the seeds ranged from 0.35 % to 0.55 %. It was established that the squalene content in oils obtained by extraction is greater than the one obtained by cold pressing. In the triacylglyceride composition of the investigated cold-pressed and extracted oils, no significant differences were found.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3achemical composition 3apressing 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3aseed oils 3aseeds 3asqualene 3atriacylglycerols 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aUzbekistan 0aAmaranth oil 0aFatty acids 0aRefractometric detection 0aReversed-phase HPLC 0aSqualene 0aTriglycerides1 aBerdiev, Nodir Sh.1 aIshimov, Uchkun J.1 aOlimjonov, Shukhratjon S.1 aZiyavitdinov, Jamolitdin F.1 aAsrorov, Akmal M.1 aSalikhov, Shavkat I.0 tNova biotechnologica et chimica.g2018 July 01, v. 17, no. 1 p.66-73dSciendowJournal:21370x1338-69057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/nbec-2018-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02345naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010900168300001600277520118400293592002801477650001301505650001601518650001901534650000901553650001901562650001301581650001201594650001301606650001301619650001301632700002201645700001901667700002101686700001801707773014301725856008201868852000901950655001201959IND60588833320221117171415.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058883332DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1853-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernandes, AnaS.10aInfluence of culture conditions towards optimal carotenoid production by Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B  ap. 143-155.  aWith the increasing awareness on the toxicity of several synthetic dyes, demand for pigments from natural sources, such as microbial carotenoids, has gained interest as a promising safe alternative colour additive. In this study, a surface response methodology based on the Doehlert distribution for two factors [% of glucose in a mixture of glucose + fructose (10 g/L total sugars), and sulfate concentration] was used towards the optimal carotenoids production by Gordonia alkanivorans strain 1B in the presence of light (400 lx). Time influence on pigment production by this bacterium was also evaluated, as well as the cell viability profile during longer incubation periods at optimal conditions. Indeed, the highest carotenoid production (2596–3100 μg/gDCW) was obtained when strain 1B was cultivated in the optimal conditions: glucose 10 g/L and sulfate ≥ 22 mg/L, in the presence of light for 19 days at 30 °C, 150 rpm. Flow cytometry showed that the highest production was somehow related with the cellular stress. These results highlight the great potential of strain 1B as a new hyperpigment producer to be exploited towards several applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3acarotenoids 3acell viability 3adyes 3aflow cytometry 3afructose 3aglucose 3apigments 3asulfates 3atoxicity1 aPaixão, SusanaM.1 aSilva, TiagoP.1 aRoseiro, JoséC.1 aAlves, Luís,0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2018 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.143-155dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1853-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01853naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245010900168300001600277520085300293592002801146650001401174650002601188650001001214650001801224650003301242700002301275700002001298773010701318856008201425990002301507852000901530655001201539IND60094114120221118124533.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorelli, Xavier10aChemical and structural lessons from recent successes in protein–protein interaction inhibition (2P2I)  ap. 475-481.  aWorldwide research efforts have driven recent pharmaceutical successes, and consequently, the emerging role of Protein–Protein Interactions (PPIs) as drug targets has finally been widely embraced by the scientific community. Inhibitors of these Protein–Protein Interactions (2P2Is or i-PPIs) are likely to represent the next generation of highly innovative drugs that will reach the market over the next decade. This review describes up-to-date knowledge on this particular chemical space, with a specific emphasis on a subset of this ensemble. We also address current structural knowledge regarding both protein–protein and protein–inhibitor complexes, that is, the 2P2I database.

The RRPP were orally administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200mg/kg for 4 weeks and the anti-fatigue activity was evaluated using a weight-loaded swimming test, along with the determination of serum urea nitrogen (SUN), hepatic glycogen and blood lactic acid (BLA) contents. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the body weight of mice in the three RRPP groups compared with the negative control group during initial, intermediate and terminal stages in the experiment (p>0.05). The ratio of exhausting swimming time was obviously increased 31.48% (p<0.05) and 61.51% (p<0.01) in the middle-dose group and the high-dose RRPP group, respectively. The BLA and SUN levels were decreased in middle-dose and high-dose RRPP groups (p<0.01). Hepatic glycogen level was increased in three RRPP treated groups (p<0.01). Therefore, RRPP may be responsible for the pharmacological effect of anti-fatigue of Radix Rehmanniae Preparata. The mechanism was related to the increase of the storage of hepatic glycogen and the decrease of the accumulation of SUN and BLA.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3aglycogen 3alactic acid 3amice 3aoral administration 3aswimming 3aurea nitrogen1 aYu, Ke-qiang1 aLiu, Yan-yan1 aOuyang, Ming-zi1 aYan, Mei-hua1 aLuo, Ren1 aZhao, Xiao-shan0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2012 Jan. 1, v. 50, no. 1 p.59-62dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.09.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013600165300001600301520129500317592002801612650002101640650001201661650002001673650002001693650001901713650002401732650002501756650001801781650001301799650002101812700006201833700002401895700002201919700002401941700001701965773014301982856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60588833420221120030140.0180619e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058883342DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-017-1862-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoretti, Paul10aDynamic modeling of nitrogen removal for a three-stage integrated fixed-film activated sludge process treating municipal wastewater  ap. 237-247.  aThe integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process is being increasingly used to enhance nitrogen removal for former activated sludge systems. The aim of this work is to evaluate a numerical model of a new nitrifying/denitrifying IFAS configuration. It consists of two carrier-free reactors (anoxic and aerobic) and one IFAS reactor with a filling ratio of 43% of carriers, followed by a clarifier. Simulations were carried out with GPS-X involving the nitrification reaction combined with a 1D heterogeneous biofilm model, including attachment/detachment processes. An original iterative calibration protocol was created comprising four steps and nine actions. Experimental campaigns were carried out to collect data on the pilot in operation, specifically for modelling purpose. The model used was able to predict properly the variations of the activated sludge (bulk) and the biofilm masses, the nitrification rates of both the activated sludge and the biofilm, and the nitrogen concentration in the effluent for short (4–10 days) and long (300 days) simulation runs. A calibrated parameter set is proposed (biokinetics, detachment, diffusion) related to the activated sludge, the biofilm and the effluent variables to enhance the model prediction on hourly and daily data sets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abiofilm 3adata collection 3adenitrification 3adynamic models 3amathematical models 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content1 aChoubert, Jean-Marc1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7717-11021 aCanler, Jean-Pierre1 aBuffière, Pierre1 aPétrimaux, Olivier1 aLessard, P.,0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2018 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.237-247dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3920376x1615-75917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-017-1862-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01264naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014300156300001800299520027700317592002800594650002300622650002100645650001300666700001800679700001400697700001600711700001700727773013400744856007500878852000900953655001200962IND60658991120221121195644.0190826e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899112DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12003d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Shao-Lu10aNew linear supramolecular polymers that are driven by the combination of quadruple hydrogen bonding and crown ether–paraquat recognition  ap. 6903-6905.  aNovel linear supramolecular polymers, based on the combination of two classical binding interactions: the quadruple hydrogen bonding ureidopyrimidinone units and crown ether–paraquat host–guest recognition motifs, have been constructed from two heteroditopic monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3apolymers1 aXiao, Tangxin1 aWu, Yufei1 aJiang, Juli1 aWang, Leyong0 tChemical communications.g2011 June 28, v. 47, no. 24 p.6903-6905dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c1cc12003d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01277naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245007300170300001600243520043600259592002800695650001000723650001100733650001400744700002000758773010700778856008200885990002300967852000900990655001200999IND60094114320221118124604.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeach, Andrew R.,10aMolecular complexity and fragment-based drug discovery: ten years on  ap. 489-496.  aWe review the concept of molecular complexity in the context of the very simple model of molecular interactions that we introduced over ten years ago.

In order to study the effect of type of milk (conventional vs. organic, characterized by a specific fatty acid composition), Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis (BB12, B94, BL04 and HN019) counts, acidification activity and chemical composition (pH, lactose, lactic acid contents and fatty acids profile) were investigated before fermentation and after 24Â h of products stored at 4Â Â°C. Organic and conventional milk influenced acidification performance and bacteria counts, which was strain-dependent. Higher counts of BB12 were observed in organic milk, whereas superior counts of BL04 were found in conventional milk. Organic fermented milk showed lower levels in saturated fatty acids (FA) and higher in monounsaturated FA contents. Similarly, among bioactive FA, organic fermented milks have higher amounts of trans vaccenic acid (TVAâC18:1t), conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and slightly higher contents of Î±-linoleic acid (ALA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aBifidobacterium animalis 3abioactive properties 3achronic diseases 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3afatty acid composition 3afermented milk 3alactic acid 3alactose 3amilk 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3asaturated fatty acids 3avaccenic acid1 aOliveira, Ricardo P.S.1 aSilva, Roberta C.1 aSoares, Fabiana A.S.M.1 aGioielli, Luiz A.1 aOliveira, MaricÃª N.0 tLebensmittel-Wissenschaft + Technologie.g2012 Nov., v. 49, no. 1 p.89-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl1644x0023-64387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lwt.2012.04.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03016naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011700169300001600286520186000302592002802162653001002190653002402200653001502224653001602239653001502255653001702270700002702287700002002314700001802334700002102352700001502373700002302388773015002411856008402561852000902645655001202654IND60558726220221119030948.0161115e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055872622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehrian, Payam10aDetermining the lymphadenopathy characteristics of the mediastinum in lung CT scan of children with tuberculosis  ap. 306-312.  aObjective/Background: Most tuberculosis cases in children are primary infection, with difficult and imprecise diagnosis mainly based on the existence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Here, we investigated the characteristics of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in lung computed tomography (CT) scans of children with tuberculosis. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 75 children with tuberculosis referred to Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran, from 2009 to 2013. Their medical records were investigated, and CT-scan characteristics were extracted by a radiologist. Results: Mean±standard deviation age of cases was 11.2±4.6years. CT-scan results indicated 94.7% of cases had lymphadenopathy, with lower paratracheal, upper paratracheal, hilar, and subcarinal forms observed in 81.7%, 69.1%, 53.5%, and 47.9% of cases as the most involved stations in lymph nodes, respectively. In 74.6% of patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, perilymph node fat inflammation (matting) was observed, with 52.11% exhibiting conglomeration. Bronchial pressure was observed in 4.23% of children with tuberculosis, and bilateral-, right-, and left-parenchymal involvement was observed in 42.7%, 25.3%, and 8% of these cases, respectively. Left- and right-pleural effusion and calcification was reported in 6.7%, 12%, and 5.6% of patients, respectively. Additionally, nearly 80% of patients exhibited mediastinal lymphadenopathy and lung-parenchyma involvement simultaneously. Lung-parenchyma involvement was significantly correlated with subcarinal (p<.001), hilar (p<.001), subaortic (p=.030), lower paratracheal (p=.037), and axillary (p=.006) stations. Conclusion: Situation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy and its synchronicity with lung-parenchyma involvement can help in differential diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from other lung diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 0aChild 0aComputed tomography 0aLymph node 0aMediastinum 0aTomography 0aTuberculosis1 aMoghaddam, Amin Momeni1 aTavakkol, Elham1 aAmini, Afshin1 aMoghimi, Mehrdad1 aKabir, Ali1 aVelayati, Aliakbar0 tInternational Journal of Mycobacteriology.g2016 Sept., v. 5 p.306-312dElsevier LtdaAsian-African Society for Mycobacteriologyx2212-55317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.06.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01873naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004400168300001600212520085100228592002801079650001701107650001301124650001501137650001001152650001701162650004201179650002201221650002601243650001101269650002201280773010701302856008201409990002301491852000901514655001201523IND60094114520221118124550.0141104e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.05.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMitchell, Wayne10aNatural products from synthetic biology  ap. 505-515.  aDNA sequencing has uncovered microbial secondary metabolic potential that never surfaced in fermentation based screens. Deep and cheap sequencing of a genus such as Streptomyces can rapidly expose hundreds of metabolic genes and operons. Meanwhile, synthetic biologists, in their quest to engineer advanced biofuels, are mastering metabolic engineering. Natural products, a reliable source of new therapeutic leads for many years, have fallen into disfavor with drug discoverers partly because these molecules are rarely available as pure compounds and sourcing is often problematic. The convergence of next generation sequencing and synthetic biology, along with less spectacular progress in analytic technologies such as mass spectroscopy, opens the door to the creation of large, reliable libraries of pure natural products for drug discovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStreptomyces 3abiofuels 3abiologists 3adrugs 3afermentation 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolic engineering 3aoperon 3asynthetic biology0 tCurrent Opinion in Chemical Biology.g2011 Aug., v. 15, no. 4 p.505-515dElsevier Ltdx1367-59317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2011.05.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002500144245009700169300001400266506002800280520163700308592002801945506003701973650002502010650002502035650001102060650001102071650002102082650001202103650002202115650002402137650001002161650001502171650001302186650002002199650001002219651000902229653002502238653001902263653003202282653001502314700002002329700002802349773013702377856007902514852000902593655001202602IND60773840120221207051104.0200621e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077384012DNAL7 a10.22103/jab.2009.11502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepahvand, Niyaz Ali10aField and Molecular Evaluation of Resistance of Iranian Bread Wheats to Fusarium Head Blight  ap. 63-80.  aResource is Open Access  aFusarium Head Blight is a critical wheat disease in Iran, particularly in the provinces of; Mazandaran, Golestan, Ardabil (Moghan) and Fars. The main casual agent of this disease is the fungus Fusarium graminearum. Primary evaluation of 3350 bread wheat accessions of National Plant Gene Bank of Iran to FHB, revealed that some of them were resistant. Twenty two resistant samples along with 1 resistant check and 1 susceptible check derived from primary selection were evaluated using RCBD with 3 replications surrounded by the spreader in Gharakhil Research Station, Sari in autumn 2002. Five severe casual isolates of Fusarium were used for the resistance evaluation. Five times of spray inoculation were applied on the samples just before sunset, in which the concentration of inocula was 3×104 macro conidia/ml. The main agronomic traits were evaluated. The plant pathogen interaction characters, disease index, disease incidence and Fusarium damaged kernels were evaluated three times 10, 14 and 18 days after inoculation. Disease intensity area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) was also calculated. The results revealed that several samples were resistant to disease compared to resistant check. Cluster analysis showed that the resistant accessions were grouped in the same cluster with the resistant check, Sumai#3. For achievement of markers linked to resistance, ten SSR primer pairs were applied. The samples produced different band patterns; however the primers GWM234, GWM251 and GWM340 were informative. They may be able to discriminate resistant samples through optimizing lab conditions and further trials.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFusarium graminearum 3aFusarium head blight 3aautumn 3abreads 3acluster analysis 3aconidia 3adisease incidence 3adisease progression 3afungi 3agene banks 3ainoculum 3aplant pathogens 3awheat 3aIran 0afusarium head blight 0airanian wheats 0aresistant wheat to fusarium 0assr marker1 aHeydari, Farzad1 aTutiyaei, Abdol hossein0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2009 June, v. 1, no. 1 p.63-80dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2009.11503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01628naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245007300170300001400243520075700257592002801014650001301042650001501055650001101070650001901081650001401100773011101114856008101225990002301306852000901329655001201338IND60094114720221118124542.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2010.10.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlein, Christoph A10aFramework models of tumor dormancy from patient-derived observations  ap. 42-49.  aUnusually long latency periods between the treatment of primary tumors and metastatic recurrences are commonly thought to prove the existence and relevance of clinical tumor dormancy. However, careful consideration of disease courses and cancer growth rates leads to the conclusion that clinical dormancy may be everything from non-existent to much more frequent than originally thought. On the other hand, cellular dormancy defined as a non-productive state of disseminated tumor cells is very frequent, while homeostatic mechanisms such as angiogenic and immunological control contribute to the chronicity of cancer. This review attempts to provide a conceptual framework for the study of dormancy, which may guide clinical and experimental research.  aPublisher supplied data 3adormancy 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms0 tCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.42-49dElsevier Ltdx0959-437X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2010.10.0113Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002900146245010100175300001400276506002800290520062700318592002800945506003700973650002401010650000901034650001101043700001201054773014701066856008101213852000901294655001201303IND60773840220221207072552.0170131e199506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077384022DNAL7 a10.20543/mkkp.v10i20.4462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasmudjiastuti, Emiliana10aPenelitian penggunaan minarex sebagai bahan pelunak dalam pembuatan kompon karet sol karet cetak  ap. 54-59.  aResource is Open Access  aThe objective of this research is to use Minarex oil as a softener in making rubber sole compound and to know the optimal of formulation.

The bilayer contains 49 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 10 mol % cholesterol, 40 mol % sphingomyelin, and 1 mol % sulforhodamine-tagged 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (SR-DOPE). Phase separation of the cholesterol domains is seen within the bilayer structure, and exposure of this supported bilayer to controlled amounts of n-butanol in the aqueous overlayer produces morphological changes over a range of length scales. We report steady state fluorescence imaging, fluorescence lifetime imaging, and fluorescence anisotropy decay imaging for these bilayers. These data are consistent with literature reports on the interactions of lipid bilayers with n-butanol and provide molecular-scale insight relative to bilayer organization that has not been available to date. The exposure of these bilayers to n-butanol leads to more extensive disruption of the bilayer than is seen for their exposure to ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abutanol 3acholesterol 3aethanol 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alipid bilayers 3amica 3aphospholipids 3aphysical chemistry 3aseparation 3asphingomyelins1 aBlanchard, G.

The aim of this study was to examine the pattern of TB in Aswan Chest Hospital, Aswan, Egypt.This cross-sectional study was carried out using medical records from the TB registry in Aswan Chest Hospital. The investigated variables included demographic characteristics, type of TB infection, and affected organs. All data were coded and statistically analyzed.The average age of the 557 patients infected with TB was 40.31±18.87years; 58.2% of the cases were men and 41.8% were women. In both sexes, the highest number of TB patients was from the reproductive age groups. During the 5-year study period, the highest percentage of cases were new cases and the highest frequency of cases was during 2011 and the lowest frequency was during 2015. Pulmonary TB cases showed a sharp decline; however, there was a decrease in extrapulmonary TB cases during 2012 and 2013, with a slight rise in 2014 and 2015. Of the pulmonary TB cases, 82.5% were smear-positive TB.There was a decline in the total number of TB cases across the studied years and the most studied cases were pulmonary smear-positive and new cases. Younger people represented a large percentage of reported cases.  aPublisher supplied data 0aExtrapulmonary tuberculosis 0aPulmonary tuberculosis 0aTuberculosis1 aKinawy, Sayed Abd Elsabour1 aAbdelkarim, Yasser Mohamad Ahmad1 aArafa, Mahmoud Ahmed0 tInternational Journal of Mycobacteriology.g2016 Sept., v. 5 p.333-340dElsevier LtdaAsian-African Society for Mycobacteriologyx2212-55317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01692naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245011000171300001600281520038600297592002800683650002500711650001400736650001700750650001400767650002400781650001300805650001500818653005500833653001700888653002400905653004100929653001700970653002200987700002501009700001401034700001701048773012501065856008301190852000901273655001201282IND60601574020181023000000.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRousseaux, Julien10aPrise en charge nutritionnelle d’une patiente après allogreffe de cellules souches hématopoïétiques  ap. 137-142.  aPatients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after myeloablative conditioning (MAC) have a high incidence of malnutrition that is known to increase the risk of mortality.

It exhibits therapeutic effects in functional dyspepsia (FD), but the underlying mechanisms remain not well understood. Enterochromaffin (EC) cells contribute to the pathogeneses of visceral hypersensitivity in functional gastrointestinal disorders. But whether and how EC cells in duodenum participate in the mechanism of FD remain unsettled.To detect the crucial factors related to EC cells, and to evaluate the therapeutic effect of MLJZ and to determine whether MLJZ relieves visceral hypersensitivity in FD by regulating EC cell-5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor (5HT3r) signaling.FD rats were established by iodoacetamide gavage combined with tail clamping method. The verification of FD model and the evaluation of the therapeutic effect of MLJZ was taken place by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and visceral sensitivity measurement. The expression of EC cells and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) in duodenum was detected by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). IHC staining and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were applied to measure the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (TPH1), paired box gene 4 (PAX4), transient receptor potential A1 (TRPA1), transient receptor potential C4 (TRPC4) and 5HT3r. Duodenum sections were stained by double immunofluorescence (IF) to study the synthesis of 5HT in EC cells.The gastric sensitivity increased in FD rats while MLJZ decoction significantly attenuated visceral hypersensitivity. The duodenum of FD rats displayed increased expressions of EC cells, 5HT, TPH1, PAX4 and 5HT3r. And the overexpression was reduced in response to MLJZ decoction treatment.EC cell-5HT3r signaling pathway is abnormally active in FD with visceral hypersensitivity. And MLJZ decoction can alleviates visceral hypersensitivity in FD by regulating EC cell-5HT3r signaling in duodenum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aduodenum 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agastrointestinal diseases 3agenes 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aindigestion 3amodels 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3aserotonin 3asignal transduction 3astaining 3atherapeutics 3atraditional medicine 3atryptophan 0aFunctional gastrointestinal disorders 0aDyspepsia 0aEC cells 0aChinese herbal drugs 0aLiu-Jun-Zi1 aZhao, Luqing1 aZhang, Shengsheng1 aZhu, Chunyang0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2020 Mar. 25, v. 250 p.112468-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2019.1124683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02650naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013400172300001600306520169100322592002802013653000802041653000802049653000802057653000802065700002102073700002302094773015002117856008402267852000902351655001202360IND60558727020221119030744.0161115e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055872702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Mohanad M.10aEpidemiology of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug resistant, and totally drug resistant tuberculosis in Middle East countries  ap. 249-256.  aThe 2015 represent the deadline for the global tuberculosis (TB) targets set through the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). From 2016 and onward, new goals were set to end the global TB epidemic via implementing new campaign entitled “the End TB Strategy”. The major hurdle to end TB epidemic in several parts of the world is the emergence and spread of drug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. The better understanding of the actual global burden of drug resistant tuberculosis would feed into better implementing the End TB Strategy. In this article we summarize the current knowledge on the patterns of drug resistance tuberculosis cases in the Middle East countries. These countries are served by the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO), one out of six regional offices of World Health Organization. Middle East countries are characterized by geographic vicinity and population’s interaction. However, they are dissimilar in several aspects such as economy and health infrastructures. Regarding economy, countries in this region are ranging from wealthy to very poor. Prevalence of tuberculosis and patterns drug resistance tuberculosis cases are also following variable trends within countries of this region. In almost all Middle East countries, there is under-reporting of drug-resistance tuberculosis cases. There are shortages in the infrastructures and facilities for detecting the pattern of drug-resistance tuberculosis. For instance, sixout of 14 countries have neither in-country capacity nor a linkage with a partner laboratory for second-line drug susceptibility testing and only 4 countries have registered site performing Xpert MTB/RIF.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMTB 0aMDR 0aXDR 0aTDR1 aVelayati, Ali A.1 aMohammed, Suhad H.0 tInternational Journal of Mycobacteriology.g2016 Sept., v. 5 p.249-256dElsevier LtdaAsian-African Society for Mycobacteriologyx2212-55317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmyco.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245018200169300001800351520176000369592002802129650002202157650001602179650001302195650004402208650001602252650001902268700002402287700001502311700002202326700001702348700001902365700002002384700001702404700002002421700002002441700001702461700001902478773013202497856007802629852000902707655001202716IND60540992920221121001326.0160820e20150422xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054099292DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.5b021472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPartridge, Benjamin
E.10aIncreasing 3D Supramolecular Order by Decreasing Molecular Order. A Comparative Study of Helical Assemblies of Dendronized Nonchlorinated and Tetrachlorinated Perylene Bisimides  ap. 5210-5224.  aA nonplanar, twisted, and flexible tetrachlorinated perylene bisimide (Cl₄PBI) was functionalized with two AB₃ minidendrons containing hydrogenated or semifluorinated dodecyl groups. The hydrogenated dendron was attached to the imide groups of Cl₄PBI via m = 0, 1, and 2 methylenic units, whereas the dendron containing semifluorinated groups was attached via m = 3 or a di(ethylene oxide) linker (m = 2EO). The supramolecular structures of these compounds, determined by a combination of differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, and solid-state NMR, were compared with those of nonchlorinated planar and rigid PBI reported previously, which demonstrated the thermodynamically controlled formation of 2D periodic arrays at high temperatures and 3D arrays at low temperatures. The molecularly less ordered Cl₄PBI containing hydrogenated dendrons self-organize into exclusively 3D crystalline periodic arrays under thermodynamic control for m = 0 and 2, while the more highly molecularly ordered PBI produced less stable and ordered 3D crystals and also 2D assemblies. This induction of a higher degree of 3D order in supramolecular assemblies of the less well-ordered molecular building blocks was unanticipated. The semifluorinated dendronized Cl₄PBI with m = 3 formed a 2D columnar hexagonal array under kinetic control, whereas the compound with m = 2EO formed an unusual 2D honeycomb-like hexagonal phase under thermodynamic control. These Cl₄PBI compounds provide a new route to stable crystalline assemblies via thermodynamic control at lower temperatures than previously obtained with PBI, thus generating 3D order in an accessible range of temperature of interest for structural analysis and for technological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acalorimetry 3acrystals 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atemperature 3athermodynamics1 aLeowanawat, Pawaret1 aAqad, Emad1 aImam, Mohammad R.1 aSun, Hao-Jan1 aPeterca, Mihai1 aHeiney, Paul A.1 aGraf, Robert1 aSpiess, Hans W.1 aZeng, Xiangbing1 aUngar, Goran1 aPercec, Virgil0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2015 Apr. 22, v. 137, no. 15 p.5210-5224dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.5b021473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02068naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245007400175300001600249520086000265592002801125650001201153650001401165650001201179650001801191650001901209650001401228650002501242653001501267653002001282653001301302653001101315653001401326653001901340653001301359653000901372700001801381700003001399773012501429856008301554852000901637655001201646IND60601574120181023000000.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060157412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nupar.2014.03.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaynaud-Simon, Agathe10aVitamine D chez la personne âgée : pourquoi ?

First, aging of the skin reduces vitamin D synthesis. Second, lifestyle or dependency results in low sun exposure. More importantly, the effect of vitamin D deficiency may become more rapidly apparent in aging subjects with poorer bone and muscle reserve. Interventional studies that have shown positive clinical results of vitamin D supplementation have been conducted in aging subjects. Vitamin D supplementation reduces the risk of fracture and falls in the elderly, costs little, and this could have a major impact on public health. It is recommended to systematically supplement all elderly persons with vitamin D, with doses ranging from 800 to 1000UI/day, either daily or 80,000 to 100,000UI every 2–3months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelderly 3alifestyle 3amuscles 3apublic health 3arisk reduction 3avitamin D 3avitamin D deficiency 0aVitamine D 0aPersonne âgée 0aFracture 0aChutes 0aVitamin D 0aElderly person 0aFracture 0aFall1 aRolland, Yves1 aSouberbielle, Jean-Claude0 tNutrition clinique et métabolisme.g2014 May, v. 28, no. 2 p.123-129dElsevier SASwJournal:J000001838x0985-05627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nupar.2014.03.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01211naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245007500159300001800234520028500252592002800537650002000565650001800585650001100603650001500614700002000629700001900649700002300668773013400691856007500825852000900900655001200909IND60658991920221121195606.0190826e20110614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065899192DNAL7 a10.1039/c1cc12020d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiroto, Satoru10aSynthetic protocol for diarylethenes through Suzuki–Miyaura coupling  ap. 7149-7151.  aThe synthesis of a variety of diarylethenes through the Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction of 1,2-dichlorohexafluorocyclopentene with arylboronic acids and esters has been developed.

Eighteen medical students from James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland, Australia participated in one of three focus group interviews. Data analysis incorporated the principles of the constant comparative method.Four themes emerged to explain the determinants of immunisation in this population: protection from infectious disease, understanding of the consequences of infectious disease, influence of individual and institutional recommendations, and practical barriers. Strategies to improve immunity were explored in three themes: empowering and educating students, improving access and mandating immunisation.The determinants of medical student immunisation are complex and interconnected. A multi-faceted, long-term approach is needed to improve medical student immunity, and should include implementation of vaccination clinics and awareness initiatives, with future consideration of mandatory vaccination and integration into clinical skills programs and sessions. Immunisation policies and duty of care arrangements need clarification.  aPublisher supplied data 3afocus groups 3aimmunity 3ainfectious diseases 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3astudents 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aQueensland 0aMedical students 0aHealthcare students 0aImmunisation 0aOccupational diseases 0aInfection control1 aSpeare, Richard1 aHeal, Clare1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5041-26660 tVaccine Reports.g2016, dElsevier Ltdx2405-78437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vacrep.2016.11.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013800169300001500307520146100322592002801783650001301811650001901824650002001843650001401863650001401877650001101891650001701902653002401919653002001943653001901963653002601982653002702008700001402035700001702049773010702066856008702173852000902260655001202269IND60601400120221120235651.0190402e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060140012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Haiqing13aAn advanced analytical solution for pressure build-up during CO2 injection into infinite saline aquifers: The role of compressibility  ap. 95-105.  aExisting analytical or approximate solutions that are appropriate for describing the migration mechanics of CO2 and the evolution of fluid pressure in reservoirs do not consider the high compressibility of CO2, which reduces their calculation accuracy and application value. Therefore, this work first derives a new governing equation that represents the movement of complex fluids in reservoirs, based on the equation of continuity and the generalized Darcy's law. A more rigorous definition of the coefficient of compressibility of fluid is then presented, and a power function model (PFM) that characterizes the relationship between the physical properties of CO2 and the pressure is derived. Meanwhile, to avoid the difficulty of determining the saturation of fluids, a method that directly assumes the average relative permeability of each fluid phase in different fluid domains is proposed, based on the theory of gradual change. An advanced analytical solution is obtained that includes both the partial miscibility and the compressibility of CO2 and brine in evaluating the evolution of fluid pressure by integrating within different regions. Finally, two typical sample analyses are used to verify the reliability, improved nature and universality of this new analytical solution. Based on the physical characteristics and the results calculated for the examples, this work elaborates the concept and basis of partitioning for use in further work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acarbon dioxide 3acompressibility 3aequations 3amechanics 3amodels 3apermeability 0aAnalytical solution 0aCompressibility 0aCO2-brine flow 0aRelative permeability 0aCO2 geological storage1 aBai, Bing1 aLi, Xiaochun0 tAdvances in water resources.g2018 Feb., v. 112 p.95-105dElsevier LtdwJournal:11879x0309-17087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2017.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02775naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009900167300001300266520158000279592002801859650001801887650001201905650001401917650002701931650001201958650000901970650002001979650001101999650001802010650001202028650001402040653001102054653001502065653001402080653001002094700001802104700002102122773011802143856008302261852000902344655001202353IND60558727320221119030710.0190417e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055872732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcdf.2016.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRepin, Nikolay10aImpact of dietary fibre on in vitro digestibility of modified tapioca starch: viscosity effect  ap. 2-11.  aIn the current work, amylolysis of modified tapioca starch in simulated small intestinal conditions was studied in the presence of each of four dietary fibre types including yellow mustard mucilage, soluble flaxseed gum, fenugreek gum or oat gum. Each fibre was used at concentrations that were matched across the four fibre types for post-digestion viscosity. Due to molecular heterogeneity these concentrations were different for each fibre. The progress of amylolysis was studied by measuring the decline of digesta apparent viscosity over time at constant shear rate 60s−1. Expressing these data as a percentage of initial viscosity, and plotting it as a natural logarithm against time transformed the data to a linear form with a slope denoted as a viscosity decay constant (kv). Additionally, for some of the digesta samples progress of amylolysis was assessed by evaluating increases in reducing sugar concentration. Based on the kv values, the progress of amylolysis was reduced as the concentration of each fibre and therefore viscosity of digesta increased. However, the influence to hinder amylolysis was diminishing with increase of digesta viscosity. The progress of amylolysis was similar when each fibre was present at a concentration to match for post-digestion viscosity. Measurements of changes in reducing sugar content also confirmed these findings. Therefore, it was concluded that to alter amylolysis to a similar extent fibres have to be present at amounts to result in similar post-digestion viscosity even though their concentrations may not match.  aPublisher supplied data 3adietary fiber 3adigesta 3afenugreek 3ain vitro digestibility 3alinseed 3aoats 3areducing sugars 3astarch 3asugar content 3atapioca 3aviscosity 0aStarch 0aAmylolysis 0aViscosity 0aFibre1 aCui, Steve W.1 aGoff, H.

The problem of enhancing crop yield in these areas is widely distinguished as a challenge. In order to evaluate the integrated application of urea fertilizer (0, 160, and 320 kg ha⁻¹) and nano-metal oxide (Fe₂O₃, ZnO, and CuO) on safflower growth performance, a field experiment was carried out in the Baneh district, a semi-arid region in Western Iran. Urea fertilizer significantly increased the plant height (11%), canopy width (8%), ground cover percentage (6%), plant dry weight (35%), number of secondary branches (16%), seeds number per head (19%), and total seed yield (38%). However, the higher application of urea fertilizer resulted in a significant decrease in wrinkled seed percentage (3.25%), harvest index (2.62%), and thousand seed weight (2.67%). Also, nano-metal oxides significantly affected morphological traits and yield components. Mean comparison revealed that the best performance was obtained by the integrated application of 320 kg urea fertilizer and nano-Fe or nano-Zn. Overall, the present research highlighted the necessity of balanced and integrated application of macronutrients and micronutrient fertilizers for sustainable safflower production in semi-arid regions of Western Iran.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarthamus tinctorius 3aagricultural development 3aagronomic traits 3abranches 3acanopy 3acupric oxide 3aferric oxide 3afield experimentation 3agrowth performance 3aharvest index 3aplant height 3aseed weight 3aseed yield 3aseeds 3asemiarid zones 3asoil 3atrace element fertilizers 3aurea fertilizers 3avegetation cover 3azinc oxide 3aIran 0acopper 0aessential micronutrients 0amorpho-physiological traits 0anutrients interaction 0ayield components1 aFattahi, M.1 aSabaghnia, N.1 aNouraein, M.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 49, no. 3 p.153-163dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2018-00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03275naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245018000159300001600339520180900355592002802164650001202192650001702204650002602221650002602247650001002273650001002283650001102293650001502304650001002319650002402329650002002353650001602373650001202389650001502401650001502416651001402431653002202445653003502467653002302502653002602525653002202551700001902573700002102592773008802613856007102701852000902772655001202781IND60408750320221119084254.0150921s2015    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6040875032DNAL7 a10.1071/WR141832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCashins, Scott D.10aUsing site-occupancy models to prepare for the spread of chytridiomyosis and identify factors affecting detectability of a cryptic susceptible species, the Tasmanian tree frog  ap. 405-413.  aContext The global reduction of amphibian biodiversity as a result of the disease chytridiomycosis (caused by the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bd) has highlighted the need to accurately detect local population declines in association with Bd presence. Although Bd has spread globally, some remote regions such as the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (1.40million ha; TWWHA) in Australia, remain largely, but not entirely, disease free. The Tasmanian tree frog (Litoria burrowsae) resides primarily within TWWHA boundaries, and is believed to be susceptible to chytridiomycosis. Aims In the absence of historical abundance data, we used a single-season multi-state site-occupancy model to investigate the impact of Bd on L. burrowsae populations, on factors affecting species detection and to inform ongoing surveillance and conservation. Methods We recorded frog detection and ranked call intensity (estimation of population size) from repeated independent surveys within a season to estimate the role of covariates, such as presence of Bd and environmental variables, on species occupancy and detection probability. Key results Modelling revealed large frog populations are more likely to be present at naturally formed than human-formed ponds, strong winds negatively affect detection of populations, and time after sunset affects detection of large populations. Large frog populations were more likely to be Bd-negative; however, models including Bd presence were not well supported, in part a result of the small number of Bd-positive sites recorded. Conclusions and Implications The utility of site-occupancy modelling in understanding the impact of disease on populations is little known, but has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of many conservation programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitoria 3abiodiversity 3aconservation programs 3aenvironmental factors 3afrogs 3afungi 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aponds 3apopulation dynamics 3apopulation size 3aprobability 3asurveys 3awilderness 3awind speed 3aAustralia 0aamphibian decline 0aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 0adisease monitoring 0aecological monitoring 0aLitoria burrowsae1 aPhilips, Annie1 aSkerratt, Lee F.0 tWildlife research.g2015, v. 42, no. 5 p.405-413dCSIRO Publishingx1035-37127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/WR141833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01775naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245003300204300001400237500001500251520073200266592002800998650002601026650001501052650001901067650001501086650001901101650001001120653001301130653001801143700001601161773011101177856008101288990002301369852000901392655001201401IND60094115320221118125110.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2010.10.0022doi7 aPMC30591122pmcid7 a213170612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAylon, Yael10aNew plays in the p53 theater  ap. 86-92.  a2019-12-06  aThe p53 tumor suppressor and its paralogs p63 and p73 are at the crux of a network modulating cellular responses against potentially tumorigenic events. p53 acts primarily as a transcription factor, regulating the expression of both coding and non-coding RNAs, as well as the activity of RNA processing complexes. In line with their anti-tumorigenic function, p53 and p63 have recently been implicated in restricting tumor cell invasion. In parallel, a growing number of non-canonical target genes have been added to the p53 repertoire. These include genes encoding for proteins that impinge on a broad spectrum of cellular functions, from cell metabolism to stem cell renewal.

DSMZ 13134 (Proradix®) on plant growth, root morphology, and nutrient acquisition of a maize mutant (rth2) with impaired root hair production as compared with the corresponding wild type line, to study the importance of root hairs for the interaction of the PGPR strain with the host plant. The study was conducted in rhizobox culture with a sand–soil mixture and moderate P supply. Root hair development of the mutant was clearly impaired, reflected by slower growth and limited elongation as compared with the wild type line. This defect was compensated by more intense root growth and fine root production of the mutant which was particularly expressed after inoculation with Proradix®. By contrast, PGPR inoculation had no effect on root hair length. The beneficial effects of Proradix® on root growth were reflected in higher shoot contents of the macronutrients P and K. Interestingly, negative effects on shoot accumulation of the micronutrients Zn and Cu were observed. These findings support proposed PGPR effects of this strain but also show limitations that may be explained by additional strain-specific properties. Possible implications of these findings are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3acopper 3acorn 3afine roots 3ahost plants 3amutants 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aroot growth 3aroot hairs 3azinc 0aSiderophores 0aP. fluorescens 0arhizosphere 0apyoverdine 0aroot growth stimulation 0amineral nutrients1 aHerrmann, I.1 aHochholdinger, F.1 aLudewig, U.1 aNeumann, G.0 tScientia Agriculturae Bohemica.g2018 Sept. 01, v. 49, no. 3 p.164-172dSciendowJournal:23174x1805-94307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2478/sab-2018-00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011600163300001600279520168500295592002801980596006302008596006302071650001502134650001702149650001902166650001802185650001102203650001102214650001102225650000902236650001102245651001002256700002102266700001702287700002002304773015902324856008202483852000902565655001202574IND60588834620221120144836.0181123e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058883462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00477-016-1339-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lina,12aA catastrophe progression approach based index sensitivity analysis model for the multivariate flooding process  ap. 141-153.  aFlood mitigation should deal with those most sensitive flooding elements to very efficiently release risks and reduce losses. Present the most concerns of flood control are peak level or peak discharge which, however, may not always be the most sensitive flooding element. Actually, along with human activities and climate change, floods bring threats to bear on human beings appear in not only peak level and peak discharge, but also other elements like maximum 24-h volume and maximum 72-h volume. In this paper, by collecting six key flooding intensity indices (elements), a catastrophe progression approach based sensitivity analysis algorithm model is developed to identify the indices that mostly control over the flood intensity. The indices sensitivity is determined through a selected case study in the Wujiang River, South China, based on half a century of flow record. The model results indicate that there is no evident relationship of interplay among the index sensitivities, but the variability of the index sensitivity is closely related to the index variability and the index sensitivity increases with the decrease of index value. It is found that peak discharge is not the most influential flooding factor as is generally thought in this case. The sensitivity value of the maximum 24-h volume is the greatest influential factor among all the other indices, indicating that this index plays a leading role in the flood threat of the Wujiang River, South China. It is inferred that, for the purpose of flood warning and mitigation, the peak flood discharge is not always the most sensitive and dominant index as opposed to the others, depending on the sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data  a51210013cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China  a41501021cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3aflood control 3afloods 3ahumans 3amodels 3arisk 3arivers 3aChina1 aChen, Xiao Hong,1 aXu, Yong-Xin1 aHuang, Ming-Zhi0 tStochastic environmental research and risk assessment.g2018 Jan., v. 32, no. 1 p.141-153dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4308428x1436-32407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-016-1339-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01915naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245006400167300001400231520082100245592002801066650001401094650001401108650001801122650002301140650001401163650001501177650001901192650001401211650002401225650001501249650001701264650003601281773011101317856008101428990002301509852000901532655001201541IND60094115420221118125108.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009411542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInman, Gareth J10aSwitching TGFβ from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter  ap. 93-99.  aTGFβ acts as a potent tumor suppressor and tumor promoter in a context dependent manner. Tumor suppressive functions include inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis and regulation of autophagy. As tumors develop they switch their response to TGFβ and utilise this factor as a potent promoter of cell motility, invasion, metastasis and tumor stem cell maintenance. These multifactorial tumor influencing actions of TGFβ involve regulation of an increasing number of signal transduction pathways employing a diverse range of signaling molecules. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of how tumor cells respond to TGFβ and switch their response to this cytokine during disease progression is vital for both the development and the informed use of potentially powerful TGFβ targeted therapeutics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3acell movement 3acell proliferation 3acytokines 3ametastasis 3aneoplasm cells 3aneoplasms 3asignal transduction 3astem cells 3atherapeutics 3atransforming growth factor beta0 tCurrent Opinion in Genetics & Development.g2011 Feb., v. 21, no. 1 p.93-99dElsevier Ltdx0959-437X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gde.2010.12.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01917naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245013200170300002000302520048100322592002800803650002200831650001200853650003500865650001400900650002300914650003700937650002600974650000901000650002201009650002101031650001301052650001501065650003301080650002301113650003701136700001901173700002801192700002001220700002501240773012301265856007401388852000901462655001201471IND60664705820221118053146.0190912e20131104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470582DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45004j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNajafpour, Mohammad Mahdi10aActivated layered manganese oxides with deposited nano-sized gold or silver as an efficient catalyst for epoxidation of olefins  ap. 24069-24074.  aActivated layered manganese oxides with deposited nano-sized gold or silver were synthesized and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction spectrometry, atomic absorption spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray mapping.

Several experimental approaches were used to characterize CG15150/elfless and test whether defects in this gene underlie the male sterile phenotype associated with overlapping chromosomal deficiencies of region 36DE. elfless expression is greatly enhanced in the testes and the expression pattern of a UAS-elfless-EGFP driven by elfless-Gal4 is restricted to the tail cyst cell nuclei of the testes. Despite this, elfless transgenes failed to rescue the male sterile phenotype in Df/Df flies. Furthermore, null alleles of elfless, generated either by imprecise excision of an upstream P-element or by FLP-FRT deletion between two flanking piggyBac elements, are fertile. In a gain-of-function setting in the eye, we found that elfless genetically interacts with key members of the apoptotic pathway including the initiator caspase Dronc and the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UbcD1. DIAP1, but not UbcD1, protein levels are increased in heads of flies expressing Elfless-EGFP in the eye, and in testes of flies expressing elfless-Gal4 driven Elfless-EGFP. Based on these findings, we speculate that Elfless may regulate tail cyst cell degradation to provide an advantageous, though not essential, function in the testis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDrosophila 3aRING finger domains 3aamino acids 3aapoptosis 3acaspases 3achemical elements 3achromosomes 3adegradation 3aexcision 3again-of-function mutation 3anull alleles 3aocelli 3aphenotype 3aprotein content 3aspermatogenesis 3atail 3atestes 3atransgenes 3aubiquitin 3aubiquitin-protein ligase1 aJoiner, Mei-ling A.1 aSivan-Loukianova, Elena1 aEberl, Daniel F.0 tFly.g2008 Nov. 1, v. 2, no. 6 p.269-279dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.73523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245013300212300001300345520174000358592002802098650002202126650001002148650002102158650001202179650001102191650001502202650001402217650002302231650001202254650001602266650001302282650002102295650001602316653002002332653002702352653001902379653001502398653001002413653000802423653000802431653000702439653000702446653000802453653001002461653000702471653000902478653000902487653000802496653000702504653000802511653000802519653000902527653000902536653001002545653000802555653001302563653000702576653000902583653001102592700006002603700005702663700002602720700002102746700001902767700002602786773009902812856008502911852000902996655001203005IND60759078420221120061257.0220118e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075907842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2021.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandgrebe, Line E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5451-582210aHigh-fat meals do not affect thrombin formation and fibrin clot lysis in individuals with obesity during intentional weight loss  ap. 1-10.  aRepeated weight loss cycles are associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Meal-induced thrombin formation, measured as prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), is observed in individuals with overweight after weight loss, and postprandial effects can be one of the mechanisms underlying harmful effects during intentional weight loss. We hypothesize that consumption of high-fat meals during intentional weight loss triggers a prothrombotic state by increasing postprandial F1+2 or decreasing fibrin clot lysis in individuals with obesity, and that the response associates with the gut bacteria composition. A cross-over meal study was conducted in patients admitted to bariatric surgery during dietary weight loss (N = 20) and surgical weight loss (N = 16) (weight loss groups). High-fat (67 E%) and low-fat (16 E%) meals were served at 08:15 and 10:00 on 2 study days. Blood samples collected at 08:00 (fasting), 12:00, and 14:00 were analyzed for triglycerides, activated factor VII (FVIIa), F1+2, D-dimer, fibrinogen, tissue factor , and fibrin clot lysis. The proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and bacterial diversity were analyzed in fecal samples obtained less than 24 hours before the meal test. Triglyceride and FVIIa increased after high-fat meals in both weight loss groups, whereas D-dimer (dietary group) and F1+2 decreased and tissue factor and fibrin clot lysis did not change. There was a negative association between the proportion of Gram-negative bacteria and changes in FVIIa in the surgery group. Postprandial FVII activation after high-fat meals is not accompanied by increased F1+2, irrespective of the weight loss intervention, but might be associated with the proportion of Gram-negative gut bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3abariatric surgery 3ablood 3adigestive system 3afasting 3afibrin 3afibrinogen 3amorbidity 3anutrition research 3aobesity 3aprothrombin 3athrombin 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 0aCatabolic state 0aCoagulation activation 0aGut microbiota 0aHemostasis 0aFVIIa 0aBMI 0aCVD 0aCV 0aCI 0aCRP 0aELISA 0aGI 0aIL-6 0aIL-8 0aIQR 0akJ 0aLPS 0aLBP 0aLOCI 0aF1+2 0art-PA 0aSEM 0a16S rRNA 0aTF 0aTFPI 0aTGF-β1 aAndersen, Vibeke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0127-28631 aBang, Corinna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6814-61511 aMoitinho-Silva, Lucas1 aSchwarz, Herbert1 aJuhl, Claus B.1 aBladbjerg, Else-Marie0 tNutrition research.g2022 Jan., v. 97 p.1-10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2021.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245011500180300001600295520140600311592002801717650001301745650000801758650001801766650001601784650002601800650002101826650001701847650001501864650003301879650001201912651001001924651002001934653000901954653001001963653002601973653000901999653000902008653001602017700002302033773008802056856008602144852000902230655001202239IND60547257520221117193300.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054725752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitriou, Konstantinos10aIndicators reflecting local and transboundary sources of PM2.5 and PMCOARSE in Rome – Impacts in air quality  ap. 154-162.  aThe keystone of this paper was to calculate and interpret indicators reflecting sources and air quality impacts of PM2.5 and PMCOARSE (PM10–PM2.5) in Rome (Italy), focusing on potential exogenous influences. A backward atmospheric trajectory cluster analysis was implemented. The likelihood of daily PM10 exceedances was studied in conjunction with atmospheric patterns, whereas a Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) based on air mass residence time was deployed on a grid of a 0.5° × 0.5° resolution. Higher PM2.5 concentrations were associated with short/medium range airflows originated from Balkan Peninsula, whereas potential PMCOARSE sources were localized across the Mediterranean and coastal North Africa, due to dust and sea spray transportation. According to the outcome of a daily Pollution Index (PI), a slightly increased degradation of air quality is induced due to the additional quantity of exogenous PM but nevertheless, average levels of PI in all trajectory clusters belong in the low pollution category. Gaseous and particulate pollutants were also elaborated by a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which produced 4 components: [Traffic], [photochemical], [residential] and [Secondary Coarse Aerosol], reflecting local sources of air pollution. PM2.5 levels were strongly associated with traffic, whereas PMCOARSE were produced autonomously by secondary sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acluster analysis 3aparticulates 3apollutants 3aprincipal component analysis 3atraffic 3aItaly 3aNorthern Africa 0aPM10 0aPM2.5 0aAir mass trajectories 0aPSCF 0aRome 0aAir quality1 aKassomenos, Pavlos0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Oct., v. 96 p.154-162dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245005100158300001600209520191600225592002802141653001602169653002802185653002102213653001402234653001502248653002202263653002902285653001202314700001902326773010202345856007402447852000902521655001202530IND60131250820221122081927.0151127e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013125082DNAL7 a10.1672/07-223.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoers, Aaron M.10aStabilized Water Levels and Typha Invasiveness  ap. 676-685.  aBecause Typha ×× glauca often dominates wetlands where humans have stabilized the natural hydrologic regime, we 1) compared its expansion rates where water levels were stabilized vs. fluctuating and 2) explored the potential for stabilized water levels to allow plants to accumulate more phosphorus (P) and increase growth. In three Wisconsin marshes, the area dominated by Typha expanded linearly over time, but rates were higher where water levels were stabilized than where they fluctuated naturally (based on nine aerial photos from 1963 to 2000). In a large wetland (412 ha) behind a dam, Typha ×× glauca expanded 81,152 m²/year, and clone diameters extended 3.9 ±± 0.61 m/year. In contrast, a mixed stand (mostly T. angustifolia) in an upstream wetland with fluctuating water levels expanded only 2,327 m²/year, and clones extended only 2.5 ±± 0.75 m/year. While various factors could have caused these differences, a separate two-factor experiment in outdoor microcosms supported the hypothesis that stabilized water levels alone can enhance T. ×× glauca spread. The experiment indicated that both stabilized water levels and P additions increased P accumulation and growth of T. ×× glauca. Constant inundation (5––10 cm deep) allowed T. ×× glauca to produce 56%% more biomass (61.6 ±± 4.0 g) than a regime with two drawdowns (39.4 ±± 1.9 g; p < 0.001). Plants under constant inundation accumulated 0.15 ±± 0.007 g P, which was 36%% more than with one drawdown (0.12 ±± 0.004 g; p < 0.001) and 67%% more than with two drawdowns (0.09 ±± 0.005 g; p < 0.001). Also as expected, the addition of 2 g P/m² increased biomass 23%% more than the control (57.8 ±± 3.0 vs. 46.9 ±± 3.0 g/plant; p == 0.02). Our microcosm results suggest that unavailable P can shift to a form that T. ×× glauca can use. Thus, internal eutrophication can augment rates of T. ×× glauca invasion.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahydroperiod 0ainternal eutrophication 0ainvasive species 0aP release 0aphosphorus 0aTypha ×× glauca 0awater control structures 0awetland1 aZedler, Joy B.0 tWetlands.g2008 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.676-685dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-223.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04120naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006100152245013400213300001600347520242900363592002802792650001802820650001002838650001102848650001102859650001102870650001902881650001602900650001502916650001002931650002002941650001702961650001302978650001202991650002203003650002203025650002103047650000903068650001103077650001703088650001103105650001203116651001403128653001503142653001903157653001703176653001203193653001303205653001303218700005203231700001803283700001403301773011903315856008703434852000903521655001203530IND60628181620221120052540.0190410e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062818162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.revpalbo.2019.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamilton, Russel,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5443-835310aDistinguishing the pollen of Dipterocarpaceae from the seasonally dry and moist tropics of south-east Asia using light microscopy  ap. 117-133.  aThe Dipterocarpaceae family is ubiquitous across mainland and maritime south-east Asia. Species within the family are often so well-adapted to – and prolific within – ecologically distinct forest types, that they are used as habitat indicators within forestry and ecological research. The limited work on the classification of Dipterocarpaceae pollen under light microscopy, however, means that paleoecologists working in the region are currently unable to link fossil pollen to indicator species/assemblages with any confidence. As a consequence, ecologically meaningful and habitat-specific data are homogenized in the paleorecord.This study explores whether the classification of pollen from representative south-east Asian Dipterocarpaceae species can be resolved at a higher taxonomic resolution. This will provide paleoecologists with a tool to (1) better assess shifts in forest types (and hence climate/elevation envelopes) through time, and (2) predict species response to future regional change. Our revised classification scheme is based on an analysis of the pollen morphology of Dipterocarpaceae species from two globally significant ecoregions in south-east Asia – the seasonally dry tropical forests of mainland south-east Asia, and the Sulawesi lowland rainforests of Wallacea – under the light microscope. Results of this analysis show that, using a range of morphological metrics – notably grain size, size-to-wall thickness ratios and exine structure – mainland and Wallacean Dipterocarpaceae pollen can be readily classified into three taxonomic groups – Vatica, Dipterocarpus and Shorea/Hopea/Anisoptera/Pentacme types. At an intra-ecoregional scale, each assemblage can be further broken down into six groups. Some of these groupings appear useful for the classification of certain indicator pollen types within the family, including those taxa representative of key open – and closed – canopy dry forest habitats in the mainland seasonal tropics, the delimitation of peat/swamp forest types in both ecoregions, and the identification of lowland mafic forest types in Sulawesi. Additionally, being able to split the Dipterocarpaceae within these ecologically important ecoregions at a higher taxonomic resolution is of potential conservation significance, permitting long-term assessment of the adaptation capacity of different genera/species to climatic change or disturbance events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDipterocarpus 3aHopea 3aShorea 3aVatica 3acanopy 3aclimate change 3adry forests 3aecoregions 3aexine 3aforest habitats 3aforest types 3aforestry 3afossils 3aindicator species 3alight microscopes 3alight microscopy 3apeat 3apollen 3arain forests 3aswamps 3atropics 3aIndonesia 0aPalynology 0aMonsoon forest 0aPaleotropics 0aMeranti 0aSulawesi 0aCambodia1 aHall, T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2072-241X1 aStevenson, J.1 aPenny, D.0 tReview of palaeobotany and palynology.g2019 Apr., v. 263 p.117-133dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11736x0034-66677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.revpalbo.2019.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014200172506010400314506007600418520162900494592002802123506003702151650002302188650002502211650001102236650001302247650001602260650001102276650000902287650001202296651001602308653002502324653001802349653003202367653001802399653001702417653001602434700002902450700001802479700002302497773011902520856008802639852000902727655001202736IND60783350720221207102713.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHelbich, Marco10aLiving near coasts is associated with higher suicide rates among females but not males: A register-based linkage study in the Netherlands  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aExposure to blue spaces may promote psychological wellbeing and reduce mental distress. Whether these effects extend to suicide is unknown. We used register data from 14 million Dutch adults aged 18–64-years between 2007 and 2016 in a nested case-control study to estimate associations between blue space exposures and suicide risk. Each suicide case was matched to ten randomly selected controls. Two blue space exposures were assigned over a ten-year residential address history: distance to the closest inland blue space and distance to the coast. We fitted (gender-stratified) conditional logistic regressions to the data. Possible effect modifications by income were also examined. In total, our analyses included 9757 cases and 95,641 controls. Effect estimates for distance to the closest inland blue space in the total population showed that people living farthest away from inland blue space were at-risk. Suicide risk was lower among women who lived farther away from the coast; no significant effect was observed for men. No evidence was observed that income modified these associations. Our findings provide suggestive evidence that living close to the coast is associated with greater suicide risk for women, while living closer to inland blue spaces may add to the resilience against suicide in the total population. Past research shows that coastal proximity protects against milder forms of mental illness, but these protective effects do not appear to hold for suicide. Blue space interventions for women with severe mental illness or propensities to engage in self-harm should be approached with caution.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abehavior disorders 3acase-control studies 3acoasts 3adistress 3aenvironment 3aincome 3arisk 3asuicide 3aNetherlands 0aAquatic environments 0aMental health 0aResidential address history 0aAir pollution 0aGreen spaces 0aDeprivation1 aBrowning, Matthew H.E.M.1 aWhite, Mathew1 aHagedoorn, Paulien0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Nov. 01, v. 845 p.157329-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01957naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245006900162300001800231520078200249592002801031650002501059650002101084650002801105650002201133650002301155650001001178650001301188650001601201650002201217700001801239700002001257700001901277700001701296700001801313700002101331773012401352856007401476852000901550655001201559IND60440514820221120094908.0151024e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051482DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029729722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Young Chul10aTungtungmadic acid, a novel antioxidant, fromSalicornia herbacea  ap. 1122-1126.  aTungtungmadic acid (3-caffeoyl-4-dihydrocaffeoyl quinic acid) is a new chlorogenic acid derivative that was isolated from theSalicornia herbacea.

This study investigated the presence of four short-chain PFASs and twenty-four long-chain PFASs in leachate and sediment from ten Norwegian landfills, including one site in Svalbard, to assess whether short-chain PFASs are more dominant in leachate. PFASs were detected in all sites. Short-chain PFASs were major contributors to the total PFAS leachate concentrations in six of ten landfills, though not in Svalbard. In sediment, long-chain PFASs such as perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and PFOS-precursors were dominant. Short-chain PFAS leachate concentrations ranged from 68 to 6800 ng L⁻¹ (mean: 980 ± 1800; median: 360 ng L⁻¹), whereas long-chain concentrations ranged from 140 to 2900 ng L⁻¹ (mean: 530 ± 730; median: 290 ng L⁻¹). Sediment concentrations, which contained mainly long-chain PFASs, ranged from 8.5 to 120 μg kg⁻¹ (mean: 47 ± 36; median: 41 μg kg⁻¹). National release from Norwegian landfills to the environment was estimated to be 17 ± 29 kg per year (median: 6.3 kg per year), which is in the same range as national emissions from the US, China and Germany after normalizing the data to a per capita emission factor (3.2 ± 5.5 mg per person per year). Results from this study are compared with previous and current studies in other countries, indicating a general trend that short-chain PFASs are dominating over long-chain PFASs in landfill leachate emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3aemissions factor 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3asediments 3asulfonates 3aChina 3aGermany 3aNorway 3aUnited States1 aMæhlum, T.q(Trond),1 aHaarstad, Ketil1 aSlinde, Gøril Aasen1 aArp, Hans Peter H.0 tEnvironmental science.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 21, no. 11 p.1970-1979dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9em00170k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012600168520175000294592002802044650002902072650001502101650001602116650002302132650002102155650001202176650001302188650002002201650003102221650001302252650001602265650001902281650001902300650001002319650001002329650001702339650000902356650002602365650001402391650001902405650001502424653003402439653002502473653002102498653002002519700002002539700001802559700002202577700002102599700002202620700002202642700002502664700002302689700002002712700002102732700002402753700002102777700002702798773009502825856008202920852000903002655001203011IND60759078820221120044522.0211219e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075907882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRooney, John F.,10aGenomic comparisons between hepatocarcinogenic and non-hepatocarcinogenic organophosphate insecticides in the mouse liver  aShort-term biomarkers of toxicity have an increasingly important role in the screening and prioritization of new chemicals. In this study, we examined early indicators of liver toxicity for three reference organophosphate (OP) chemicals, which are among the most widely used insecticides in the world. The OP methidathion was previously shown to increase the incidence of liver toxicity, including hepatocellular tumors, in male mice. To provide insights into the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that underlies these tumors, effects of methidathion in the male mouse liver were examined after 7 and 28 day exposures and compared to those of two other OPs that either do not increase (fenthion) or possibly suppress liver cancer (parathion) in mice. None of the chemicals caused increases in liver weight/body weight or histopathological changes in the liver. Parathion decreased liver cell proliferation after 7 and 28 days while the other chemicals had no effects. There was no evidence for hepatotoxicity in any of the treatment groups. Full-genome microarray analysis of the livers from the 7 and 28 day treatments demonstrated that methidathion and fenthion regulated a large number of overlapping genes, while parathion regulated a unique set of genes. Examination of cytochrome P450 enzyme activities and use of predictive gene expression biomarkers found no consistent evidence for activation of AhR, CAR, PXR, or PPARα. Parathion suppressed the male-specific gene expression pattern through STAT5b, similar to genetic and dietary conditions that decrease liver tumor incidence in mice. Overall, these findings indicate that methidathion causes liver cancer by a mechanism that does not involve common mechanisms of liver cancer induction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse outcome pathways 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3acell proliferation 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzymes 3afenthion 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenomics 3ahepatocytes 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahistopathology 3aliver 3amales 3amethidathion 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aparathion 3aprioritization 3atoxicology 0aAdverse outcome pathway (AOP) 0aLiver carcinogenesis 0aNuclear receptor 0aTranscriptomics1 aWehmas, Leah C.1 aRyan, Natalia1 aChorley, Brian N.1 aHester, Susan D.1 aKenyon, Elaina M.1 aSchmid, Judith E.1 aGeorge, Barbara Jane1 aHughes, Michael F.1 aSey, Yusupha M.1 aTennant, Alan H.1 aSimmons, Jane Ellen1 aWood, Charles E.1 aCorton, J.

We use three probabilistic sampling methods (simple random sampling, adaptive cluster sampling, and the dual frame method) to estimate the number of vernal pools on protected, forested lands. Overall, these methods yielded similar values of vernal pool abundance for each study area, and suggest that photographic interpretation alone may grossly underestimate the number of vernal pools in forested habitats. We compare the relative efficiency of each method and discuss ways of improving precision. Acknowledging that the objectives of a study or monitoring program ultimately determine which sampling designs are most appropriate, we recommend that some type of probabilistic sampling method be applied. We view the dual-frame method as an especially useful way of combining incomplete remote sensing methods, such as aerial photograph interpretation, with a probabilistic sample of the entire area of interest to provide more robust estimates of the number of vernal pools and a more representative sample of existing vernal pool habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 0aabundance estimation 0aadaptive cluster sampling 0adual frame 0avernal pools 0awetlands1 aBailey, Larissa L.1 aCampbell Grant, Evan H.0 tWetlands.g2008 Sept., v. 28, no. 3 p.585-593dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-237.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024002200116024001900138040001800157100002400175245009300199300001400292520212400306592002802430650001102458650001402469650001002483650001002493650001902503650001202522650001002534650001702544650001202561650002602573650001102599650001702610650001302627650001102640650002602651700002702677700002302704773014802727856006802875856010402943990002303047852000903070655001203079IND60643258720221122140907.0190510e20110512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064325872DNAL7 a10.3791/22412doi7 aPMC31970962pmcid7 a216106732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagharious, Mark M.10aOptic nerve transection: a model of adult neuron apoptosis in the central nervous system  ap. e2241.  aRetinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are CNS neurons that output visual information from the retina to the brain, via the optic nerve. The optic nerve can be accessed within the orbit of the eye and completely transected (axotomized), cutting the axons of the entire RGC population. Optic nerve transection is a reproducible model of apoptotic neuronal cell death in the adult CNS 1-4. This model is particularly attractive because the vitreous chamber of the eye acts as a capsule for drug delivery to the retina, permitting experimental manipulations via intraocular injections. The diffusion of chemicals through the vitreous fluid ensures that they act upon the entire RGC population. Moreover, RGCs can be selectively transfected by applying short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), plasmids, or viral vectors to the cut end of the optic nerve 5-7 or injecting vectors into their target, the superior colliculus 8. This allows researchers to study apoptotic mechanisms in the desired neuronal population without confounding effects on other bystander neurons or surrounding glia. An additional benefit is the ease and accuracy with which cell survival can be quantified after injury. The retina is a flat, layered tissue and RGCs are localized in the innermost layer, the ganglion cell layer. The survival of RGCs can be tracked over time by applying a fluorescent tracer (3% Fluorogold) to the cut end of the optic nerve at the time of axotomy, or by injecting the tracer into the superior colliculus (RGC target) one week prior to axotomy. The tracer is retrogradely transported, labeling the entire RGC population. Because the ganglion cell layer is a monolayer (one cell thick), RGC densities can be quantified in flat-mounted tissue, without the need for stereology. Optic nerve transection leads to the apoptotic death of 90% of injured RGCs within 14 days postaxotomy 9-11. RGC apoptosis has a characteristic time-course whereby cell death is delayed 3-4 days postaxotomy, after which the cells rapidly degenerate. This provides a time window for experimental manipulations directed against pathways involved in apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aapoptosis 3aaxons 3abrain 3acell viability 3acutting 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3aganglia 3aintraocular injection 3amodels 3anerve tissue 3aplasmids 3aretina 3asmall interfering RNA1 aD'Onofrio, Philippe M.1 aKoeberle, Paulo D.0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2011 May 12, , no. 51 p.e2241-e2241dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/22413Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/2241/optic-nerve-transection-model-adult-neuron-apoptosis-central-nervous  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01643naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009900160300001800259520057500277592002800852650001400880650001800894650001800912650002400930650001400954650001400968700002300982700002401005700001801029700002101047700002101068773012101089856007401210852000901284655001201293IND60664706420221119174712.0190912e20131128xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470642DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45015e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDessì, Alessio10aMicrowave-activated synthesis of thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazoles by a condensation/oxidation sequence  ap. 1322-1328.  aA microwave-assisted preparation of symmetrical thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazoles from the corresponding aldehydes is presented.

There is an urgent need for fast, noninvasive methods to characterize and monitor compaction and its impact on hydraulic processes. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a well‐established method used for the assessment of soil hydraulic properties due to its high temporal resolution and sensitivity to changes in moisture content and salinity, whereas X‐ray computed tomography (CT) can be used for high‐spatial‐resolution imaging of soil structure. We used the combined strengths of both methods to study soil under three different levels of compaction. The soils were X‐ray scanned and electrically monitored after the application of a saline solution to the soil surface. The scans revealed the pore network architecture and allowed us to compute its size and connectivity. The ERT models revealed inhibited percolation rates for soils with a lower bulk density, but also how resistivity changes are spatiotemporally distributed within the soil columns. Furthermore, we obtained a quantitative link between the two methods, by which voxels more densely populated with pores were associated with higher temporal variations in electrical resistivity. Building on this, we established a spatial collocation between pore structure and distribution of solution during percolation. This demonstrates the potential of the combined strengths of the two tomographic methods to obtain an enhanced characterization of soil hydrodynamic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3abulk density 3aelectrical resistance 3ahydrodynamics 3asalinity 3asodium chloride 3asoil compaction 3asoil structure 3avadose zone 3awater content1 aKuras, Oliver1 aWilkinson, Paul B.1 aPridmore, Tony1 aMooney, Sacha J.0 tVadose zone journal.g2021 July, v. 20, no. 4 p.e20109-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245014900205520210000354592002802454650001602482650001602498650001002514650001902524650001102543650001002554650000902564650003402573650005302607650001402660650001402674650001502688653002202703653003002725653002402755700002002779700001502799700006202814700002502876700002302901773009502924856008203019852000903101655001203110IND60759079020221120173850.0211219e20220115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075907902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Shengzhong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3519-389914aThe role of mouse and human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α in modulating the hepatic effects of perfluorooctane sulfonate in mice  aPerfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a stable environmental contaminant that can activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). In the present work, the specific role of mouse and human PPARα in mediating the hepatic effects of PFOS was examined in short-term studies using wild type, Ppara-null and PPARA-humanized mice. Mice fed 0.006 % PFOS for seven days (∼10 mg/kg/day), or 0.003 % PFOS for twenty-eight days (∼5 mg/kg/day), exhibited higher liver and serum PFOS concentrations compared to controls. Relative liver weights were also higher following exposure to dietary PFOS in all three genotypes as compared vehicle fed control groups. Histopathological examination of liver sections from mice treated for twenty-eight days with 0.003 % PFOS revealed a phenotype consistent with peroxisome proliferation, in wild-type and PPARA-humanized mice that was not observed in Ppara-null mice. With both exposures, expression of the PPARα target genes, Acox1, Cyp4a10, was significantly increased in wild type mice but not in Ppara-null or PPARA-humanized mice. By contrast, expression of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) target gene, Cyp2b10, and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) target gene, Cyp3a11, were higher in response to PFOS administration in all three genotypes compared to controls for both exposure periods. These results indicate that mouse PPARα can be activated in the liver by PFOS causing increased expression of Acox1, Cyp4a10 and histopathological changes in the liver. While histopathological analyses indicated the presence of mouse PPARα-dependent hepatic peroxisome proliferation in wild-type (a response associated with activation of PPARα) and a similar phenotype in PPARA-humanized mice, the lack of increased Acox1 and Cyp4a10 mRNA by PFOS in PPARA-humanized mice indicates that the human PPARα was not as responsive to PFOS as mouse PPARα with this dose regimen. Moreover, results indicate that hepatomegaly caused by PFOS does not require mouse or human PPARα and could be due to effects induced by activation of CAR and/or PXR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandrostanes 3ablood serum 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ahumans 3aliver 3amice 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha 3aphenotype 3apregnanes 3atoxicology 0aNuclear receptors 0aPerfluorooctane sulfonate 0aSpecies differences1 aBilly, Laura J.1 aChang, Sue1 aGonzalez, Frank J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7990-21401 aPatterson, Andrew D.1 aPeters, Jeffrey M.0 tToxicology.g2022 Jan. 15, v. 465 p.153056-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11858x0300-483X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2021.1530563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01927naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006400159300001800223520068800241592002800929650001800957650001600975650002300991650001701014650001301031650002101044650001101065650003201076650001101108650004401119700002101163700001701184700002301201700001901224700001801243700001901261700001801280773012401298856007401422852000901496655001201505IND60440515020221120190147.0151024e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051502DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029729742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiem, Phan Van10aNew cytotoxic benzopyrans from the leaves ofMallotus apelta  ap. 1131-1134.  aTwo new benzopyrans 6-[1′-oxo-3′(R)-hydroxy-butyl]-5, 7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran (1) and 6-[1′-oxo-3′(R)-methoxy-butyl]-5,7-dimethoxy-2,2-dimethyl-2H-1-benzopyran (2) were isolated from the leaves ofMallotus apelta Muell.-Arg., (Euphorbiaceae).

M.10aAqueous film forming foam and associated perfluoroalkyl substances inhibit methane production and Co-contaminant degradation in an anaerobic microbial community  ap. 1915-1925.  aAqueous film forming foams (AFFF) can contain gram per liter concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and are often released in large quantities directly to the environment as they are used to fight fires. AFFF composition is complex and contains many unknown PFAS in addition to ingredients such as hydrocarbons, solvents, and corrosion inhibitors. While biological effects of single PFAS have been studied, the effects of PFAS-containing mixtures, such as AFFF, are unknown. The effect of PFAS on microorganisms is also not well understood; nevertheless, we rely on microorganisms in locations containing elevated PFAS concentrations to perform certain functions, such as carbon cycling and co-contaminant degradation. This study focused on determining the functional consequences of AFFF and PFAS exposure in a microbial community in both the presence and the absence of a co-contaminant. AFFF, select PFAS, and a PFAS mixture were tested to determine the effect of AFFF on an anaerobic microbial community and the characteristics of the PFAS that drive toxicity in such mixtures. To study this, anaerobic digester communities were exposed to PFAS and a co-contaminant (2,4-dichlorophenol, DCP); methane production, as an indicator of toxicity and the community's ability to cycle carbon, and co-contaminant degradation were monitored. Results showed that PFAS and AFFF can alter the toxicity of DCP, inhibit DCP degradation, decrease the number of methanogens present, and change the microbial community structure. DCP was also able to decrease the toxicity of the PFAS perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), possibly by changing the sorption of PFOS to the microorganisms present. Additionally, it was determined that while PFOS was responsible for AFFF toxicity, no single PFAS or simple PFAS mixture accurately accounted for the inhibition of DCP degradation caused by AFFF exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-dichlorophenol 3aanaerobic digesters 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3acommunity structure 3acorrosion 3afires 3afoams 3ahydrocarbons 3aingredients 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3asolvents 3asorption 3asulfonates 3atoxicity1 aTemme, Hanna R.1 aSimcik, Matt F.1 aNovak, Paige J.0 tEnvironmental science.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 21, no. 11 p.1915-1925dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9em00241c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245009600166300001800262520171300280592002801993650002102021650002502042650001102067650001902078650002002097650000902117650001002126650002102136650003402157650002702191650001402218650001502232650002302247650001502270651001702285651001802302773013202320856007402452852000902526655001202535IND60676286220221120072321.0191114e20191113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067628622DNAL7 a10.1039/c9em00265k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemucal, Christina K.10aSpatial and temporal variability of perfluoroalkyl substances in the Laurentian Great Lakes  ap. 1816-1834.  aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a diverse group of fluorinated organic chemicals that have been used in industrial and consumer applications since the 1950s. PFAS are resistant to chemical and biological degradation and are ubiquitous in the environment, including in water, sediment, and biota in the Laurentian Great Lakes. This critical review evaluates the spatial and temporal variability of commonly studied perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in the Great Lakes by synthesizing data collected in water, surface sediment, sediment cores, lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and herring gull (Larus argentatus) eggs. The lowest PFAS concentrations in all matrices are detected in Lake Superior, which is located in the most pristine region of the Great Lakes Basin. In contrast, higher concentrations are observed in Lakes Erie and Ontario, which are more impacted by industrial activity and wastewater discharge. The distribution of individual PFAS compounds also varies across the lakes in response to changes in PFAS sources, with higher proportions of PFSAs in the eastern lakes. Sediment and biota are enriched in long chain PFSAs and PFCAs relative to concentrations in the water column, as expected based on predicted partitioning behavior. Sediment cores and bioarchives consistently demonstrate that PFAS concentrations increased in the Great Lakes from the initial time points until the early 2000s. The available data indicate that PFOS and PFOA concentrations decline after this period in the upper Great Lakes, but are stable in Lake Ontario. However, these trends depend on the lake, the individual compound, and the organism considered.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLarus argentatus 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3abasins 3abiodegradation 3adata collection 3aeggs 3alakes 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3asediments 3asulfonates 3atemporal variation 3awastewater 3aLake Ontario 3aLake Superior0 tEnvironmental science.g2019 Nov. 13, v. 21, no. 11 p.1816-1834dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9em00265k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03638naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009400173520210700267592002802374650001902402650002602421650002902447650002402476650002902500650001602529650002302545650001102568650001102579650002602590650001402616650001602630650001502646650001902661650001702680650001102697650001202708650001602720650001402736650001602750650001302766650001602779653001702795653001702812653001802829653001902847700001902866700001802885773009902903856008503002852000903087655001203096IND60659347420221117050309.0200210e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065934742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHausmann, Johannes10aEffects of dropleg application technique during flowering of oilseed rape on insect pests  aSpraying of insecticides and fungicides during the flowering stage of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) could be necessary to control insect pests (such as Ceutorhynchus obstrictus (Marsham) and Dasineura brassicae (Winnertz)) and pathogens (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary). In contrast to the conventional application technique, dropleg nozzles are kept below the flowering canopy to restrict the exposure of pollinators to active ingredients of insecticides. The Julius Kühn-Institut (JKI) tested the efficacy of different insecticides using the dropleg technique compared to the conventional technique, on insect pests in field trials conducted from 2015 to 2017 in the area of Braunschweig. The crop was treated at full flowering (BBCH 65) for three consecutive years. The tested insecticides were Biscaya (72 g a. i. ha⁻¹ thiacloprid), Mavrik (48 g a. i. ha⁻¹ tau-fluvalinate), and Mospilan SG (40 g a. i. ha⁻¹ acetamiprid). The adults and larvae of oilseed rape pests that drop to the ground were collected using water trays. The emergence of new generation beetles (Brassicogethes aeneus (Fabricius), C. obstrictus) was recorded from BBCH 78 onwards, using photoeclectors. At least twice during each season, oilseed rape plants were assessed for D. brassicae injury. The new dropleg application technique showed similar efficacy on pest insects compared to the conventional spraying technique. Nevertheless, the abundance of pests was not always sufficient to get clear results. Results especially on D. brassicae indicate that the dropleg technique had a comparable efficacy under moderate pest pressure conditions observed in our study. Further research under conditions with a higher abundance of C. obstrictus, as well as research on the effects of dropleg technique on parasitoids of oilseed rape pests, is needed. The population of B. aeneus population was reduced slightly less using dropleg instead of conventional application technique. In all the years, the yields did not differ significantly with regard to the conventional and dropleg application techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus 3aBrassicogethes aeneus 3aCeutorhynchus obstrictus 3aDasineura brassicae 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aacetamiprid 3aactive ingredients 3aadults 3acanopy 3afield experimentation 3aflowering 3afluvalinate 3afungicides 3ainsect control 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3anozzles 3aparasitoids 3apathogens 3apollinators 3aspraying 3athiacloprid 0aInsecticides 0aD. brassicae 0aC. obstrictus 0aBee protection1 aBrandes, Meike1 aHeimbach, Udo0 tCrop protection.g2019 Dec., v. 126 p.104917-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02577naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245011100165520144700276592002801723650002001751650001001771650001201781650002101793650001301814650001501827650002301842650001001865650001501875653001101890653001001901653001201911653001701923653002201940700002001962773011401982856008602096852000902182655001202191IND60773126020221121055907.0220614e20220705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Neng10aMaternal transfer and biodistribution of citrate and luminogens coated silver nanoparticles in medaka fish  aGiven the wide applications of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), it is necessary to evaluate their potentially adverse long-term effects. In this study, we performed a 100-day exposure of medaka fish to citrate and luminogens coated AgNPs and investigated the maternal transfer potentials and biodistribution of AgNPs. Following long-term AgNPs exposure, AgNPs were mainly distributed in the liver, followed by gills, intestine, and brain, but were also detected in the ovary and strongly colocalized with the dissolved Ag⁺. The quantified transfer efficiency of different Ag species was 1.56–5.07%. Long-term exposure of medaka to small size of AgNPs (20 nm) reduced the hatching rate attributable to the accumulation of AgNPs and their dissolved Ag⁺. The maternally transferred AgNPs were mainly concentrated in the Kupffer's vesicle of embryos, while their dissolved Ag⁺ was almost homogeneously distributed in the embryos. In contrast, the newly accumulated AgNPs were mainly absorbed at the chorion of embryos. During initial larval development, the maternally transferred AgNPs and their dissolved Ag⁺ were consistently concentrated in intestine. Significant dissolution of maternally transferred AgNPs occurred during larval development. Our results showed that long-term exposure to AgNPs caused distinct biodistribution in the next generation of medaka, and may have implications for assessing their potential adverse effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryzias latipes 3abrain 3achorion 3achronic exposure 3acitrates 3aintestines 3alarval development 3aliver 3ananosilver 0aMedaka 0aAgNPs 0aAg ions 0aDistribution 0aMaternal transfer1 aWang, Wen-Xiong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 July 05, v. 433 p.128862-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02023naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007300160300001800233520090000251592002801151650002401179650003001203650001301233650001201246650001101258650004401269650005801313650002201371700001901393700001301412700001301425700001601438773012401454856007401578852000901652655001201661IND60440515320221123034201.0151024e200510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051532DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029729772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Chun-Chao10aAntimicrobial constituents from fruits ofAilanthus altissima SWINGLE  ap. 1147-1151.  aA new naturally occurring sterol, compound5, and six known stigmasterols were isolated from fruits ofAilanthus altissima Swingle by repeated column chromatography and RP-HPLC.

However, methods for deciding the number and location of soil moisture sensors (SMS) per field still remain poorly explored in the scientific literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate a quantitative framework based on soil moisture‐based management zones (MZs) to determine the minimum number and tentative deployment location of SMS. Multiple spatially intensive (n > 100 observations) surveys of near‐surface (0–12 cm) soil moisture were conducted during the fallow periods and early growing seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019 on three agricultural fields using a calibrated handheld soil water reflectometer. The fuzzy C‐means (FCM) clustering method was used to delineate MZs based on the soil moisture surveys, and the silhouette clustering evaluation method was used to identify the optimal number of MZs per field. Then, a sensor location index that considered the distance to the MZ boundaries and the FCM membership grade was developed to identify the tentative optimal deployment location of SMS. The proposed method effectively identified field areas with distinct soil moisture regimes and revealed the complex soil moisture spatial patterns that were not captured with elevation or soil texture alone. Dividing the fields using soil moisture‐based MZ reduced the intrazone soil moisture spatial variability by about 50% compared with that of the entire field. In the three studied fields, a total of two SMS were sufficient to capture the salient soil moisture spatial regimes.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil texture 3asoil water 3avadose zone1 aCiampitti, Ignacio Antonio1 aHefley, Trevor1 aPatrignani, Andres1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5955-58770 tVadose zone journal.g2021 Nov., v. 20, no. 6 p.e20159-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02876naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245016800165520140500333592002801738650001601766650002501782650002501807650002301832650002001855650002601875650002101901650002101922650002701943650001501970650000901985650002001994650002502014653000902039653000902048653003102057653002002088653002402108700001602132700001502148700001702163700001702180773011402197856008602311852000902397655001202406IND60773126120221121055949.0220621e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077312612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Jun10aEvaluation of the ecological impacts of short- and long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids on constructed wetland systems: Perfluorobutyric acid and perfluorooctanoic acid  aPerfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) contamination of aquatic system has attracted widespread attention in recent years. From both plant and microbial perspectives, the ecological risk of CWs by comparing PFASs with different chain lengths have not been fully understood. In this study, the influences of perfluorobutyric acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) as typical of short- and long-chains on the ecological effect of CWs have been specifically studied. The results showed that plants produced oxidative stress response and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) in leaves were stimulated by 17.23–28.13% and 10.49–14.17% upon 10 mg/L PFBA and PFOA exposure. Under the high level of PFBA and PFOA stress, the chlorophyll content was reduced by 15.20–39.40% and lipid peroxidation was observed in leaves with the accumulation of malondialdehyde (MDA) at 1.20–1.22 times of the control. Dehydrogenase (DHA) exhibited the most sensitivity in the presence of PFBA and PFOA with an inhibition ratio of over 90%. The biotoxicity of PFOA was higher than that of PFBA in terms of the inhibition degree of several substrate enzymes. The information of Illumina Miseq sequencing indicated that the diversity and structure of microbial community in CWs were significantly altered by PFBA and PFOA addition and led to an enrichment of more PFASs-tolerant bacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3aconstructed wetlands 3aenvironmental impact 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amicrobial communities 3aoxidative stress 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3aperoxidase 3arisk 3astress response 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aPFOA 0aPFBA 0aAntioxidant defense system 0aEnzyme activity 0aMicrobial community1 aHuang, Juan1 aWang, Ying1 aQian, Xiuwen1 aCao, Meifang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 435 p.128863-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1288633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03445naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005900150245018800209300001600397520172500413592002802138650001302166650003202179650002102211650001202232650001302244650002002257650002902277650001902306650001502325650002002340650000902360650001302369650002102382650002502403650001602428653002702444653002302471653001802494653002802512653002802540653002102568700003002589700002102619700001802640700003002658700002302688700001802711773008102729856008402810852000902894655001202903IND60545226320221119225039.0160901e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054522632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaffer, Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2580-849810aInfluence of a compost layer on the attenuation of 28 selected organic micropollutants under realistic soil aquifer treatment conditions: Insights from a large scale column experiment  ap. 110-121.  aSoil aquifer treatment is widely applied to improve the quality of treated wastewater in its reuse as alternative source of water. To gain a deeper understanding of the fate of thereby introduced organic micropollutants, the attenuation of 28 compounds was investigated in column experiments using two large scale column systems in duplicate. The influence of increasing proportions of solid organic matter (0.04% vs. 0.17%) and decreasing redox potentials (denitrification vs. iron reduction) was studied by introducing a layer of compost. Secondary effluent from a wastewater treatment plant was used as water matrix for simulating soil aquifer treatment. For neutral and anionic compounds, sorption generally increases with the compound hydrophobicity and the solid organic matter in the column system. Organic cations showed the highest attenuation. Among them, breakthroughs were only registered for the cationic beta-blockers atenolol and metoprolol. An enhanced degradation in the columns with organic infiltration layer was observed for the majority of the compounds, suggesting an improved degradation for higher levels of biodegradable dissolved organic carbon. Solely the degradation of sulfamethoxazole could clearly be attributed to redox effects (when reaching iron reducing conditions). The study provides valuable insights into the attenuation potential for a wide spectrum of organic micropollutants under realistic soil aquifer treatment conditions. Furthermore, the introduction of the compost layer generally showed positive effects on the removal of compounds preferentially degraded under reducing conditions and also increases the residence times in the soil aquifer treatment system via sorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3abiodegradability 3acations 3acomposts 3adenitrification 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahydrophobicity 3apollutants 3aredox potential 3asoil 3asorption 3asulfamethoxazole 3awastewater treatment 3awater reuse 0aSoil aquifer treatment 0aColumn experiments 0aCompost layer 0aOrganic micropollutants 0aContaminant attenuation 0aRedox conditions1 aKröger, Kerrin Franziska1 aNödler, Karsten1 aAyora, Carlos1 aCarrera Ramírez, Jesús,1 aHernández, Marta,1 aLicha, Tobias0 tWater research.g2015 May 01, v. 74 p.110-121dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02422naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245009400159300001600253520121400269592002801483653001701511653001501528653001701543653001401560653001801574653001101592653002201603700002701625700003501652700001401687700002101701700002101722700001901743700002101762700002401783700002101807773010101828856007401929852000902003655001202012IND60131251920221122081941.0151127e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013125192DNAL7 a10.1672/07-112.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuller, Serge D.10aLong-Term Dynamics Of A Mediterranean Alkaline Vernal Pool (Rhone Delta, Southern France)  ap. 951-966.  aMediterranean vernal pools are threatened habitats that support a number of endangered/rare plant and invertebrate species. Conservation management of these important habitats is limited by a lack of knowledge, especially concerning their past and present ecological dynamics. A multidisciplinary palaeoecological investigation was conducted on one of the last alkaline vernal pools of the Rhone delta (southern France). Results highlighted the value of a multidisciplinary approach based on several complementary methods, and provide direction for subsequent palaeoecological studies in temporary wetlands. Despite some degradation, fossil assemblages provide an accurate reconstruction of the past ecological dynamics of the vernal pool studied. The pool originated c. 1100 years ago from the infilling of an abandoned palaeochannel and its subsequent fragmentation. It may thus be considered as a legacy of past natural fluvial activity, which ended with the complete channelization and confinement of the River Rhone in 1869 AD. With natural processes disrupted, new pools may need to be artificially constructed in order to preserve the biological communities of alkaline vernal pools of the Rhone delta.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBranchiopoda 0aCharophyta 0aconservation 0aOstracoda 0apalaeoecology 0apollen 0atemporary wetland1 aBruneton, Héélèène1 aSouliéé-Määrsche, Ingeborg1 aRey, Tony1 aThiééry, Alain1 aWaterkeyn, Aline1 aBrendonck, Luc1 aSchevin, Patrick1 aYavercovski, Nicole1 aGrillas, Patrick0 tWetlands.g2008 Dec., v. 28, no. 4 p.951-966dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F07-112.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01952naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245012800164300001800292520080400310592002801114650002201142650002101164650001601185650001201201650001201213650001301225650001601238700001901254700002001273700003601293700002501329700002101354773013101375856007501506852000901581655001201590IND60538546320221122034921.0160815e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053854632DNAL7 a10.1021/ja21192072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, Sebastian
M.10aIsothermal Calorimetric Titrations on Charge-Assisted Halogen Bonds: Role of Entropy, Counterions, Solvent, and Temperature  ap. 8507-8512.  aWe have conducted isothermal calorimetric titrations to investigate the halogen-bond strength of cationic bidentate halogen-bond donors toward halides, using bis(iodoimidazolium) compounds as probes. These data are intended to aid the rational design of halogen-bond donors as well as the development of halogen-bond-based applications in solution. In all cases examined, the entropic contribution to the overall free energy of binding was found to be very important. The binding affinities showed little dependency on the weakly coordinating counteranions of the halogen-bond donors but became slightly stronger with higher temperatures. We also found a marked influence of different solvents on the interaction strength. The highest binding constant detected in this study was 3.3 × 10⁶ M–¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3abinding capacity 3acalorimetry 3aentropy 3ahalides 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aKniep, Florian1 aRout, Laxmidhar1 aSchmidtchen, F.

In addition, our recent data show that these compounds may improve the cognitive functions of aged humans suggesting the potential ability to enhance memory in several neurodegenerative disorders. To examine the experimental hypothesis that two effective components ofEcklonia cava, dieckol and phlorofucofuroeckol (PFF), have memory-enhancing abilities, both were administered orally to mice before a passive avoidance test. The repeated administration of either dieckol or PFF dose-dependently reduced the inhibition of latency by the administration of ethanol. To investigate the mode of memory-enhancing actions, the levels of major central neurotransmitters in three different regions (striatum, hippocampus, and frontal cortex) of the mouse brain were measured. The levels of some of the neurotransmitters, were significantly changed by ethanol. Both dieckol and PFF altered the levels of some neurotransmitters modified by the ethanol treatment. It is noteworthy that both dieckol and PFF increased the level of acetylcholine, and they exerted anticholinesterase activities. Overall, the memory-enhancing abilities of dieckol and PFF may result from, at least in part, the increment of the brain level of acetylcholine by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase.  aPublisher supplied data 3acortex 3amemory 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aoral administration 3ahumans 3aacetylcholine 3amice 3aneurotransmitters 3acognition 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3ahippocampus 3aethanol 0aAlgae1 aShin, Hyeon-Cheol1 aBao, Hai Ying1 aYeo, Soo Jeong1 aLee, Bong Ho1 aKang, Jong Seong0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.691-698dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029693603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03210naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245021100167300001600378520155500394592002801949650001301977650001501990650001102005650002302016650001502039650001902054650002202073650001802095650001802113650001702131650001302148650001402161650001502175650002202190650002402212650001302236653001702249653001502266653002202281653003102303653001402334653002502348700002502373700002202398700002802420700001802448700002802466773008102494856008402575852000902659655001202668IND60545226420221119224958.0160901e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054522642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xuexiang10aDestruction of microcystins (cyanotoxins) by UV-254 nm-based direct photolysis and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs): Influence of variable amino acids on the degradation kinetics and reaction mechanisms  ap. 227-238.  aHepatotoxic microcystins (MCs) are the most frequently detected group of cyanobacterial toxins. This study investigated the degradation of common MC variants in water, MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR and MC-LA, by UV-254 nm-based processes, UV only, UV/H2O2, UV/S2O82− and UV/HSO5−. Limited direct photolysis of MCs was observed, while the addition of an oxidant significantly improved the degradation efficiency with an order of UV/S2O82− > UV/HSO5− > UV/H2O2 at the same initial molar concentration of the oxidant. The removal of MC-LR by UV/H2O2 appeared to be faster than another cyanotoxin, cylindrospermopsin, at either the same initial molar concentration or the same initial organic carbon concentration of the toxin. It suggested a faster reaction of MC-LR with hydroxyl radical, which was further supported by the determined second-order rate constant of MCs with hydroxyl radical. Both isomerization and photohydration byproducts were observed in UV only process for all four MCs; while in UV/H2O2, hydroxylation and diene-Adda double bond cleavage byproducts were detected. The presence of a tyrosine in the structure of MC-YR significantly promoted the formation of monohydroxylation byproduct m/z 1061; while the presence of a second arginine in MC-RR led to the elimination of a guanidine group and the absence of double bond cleavage byproducts. It was therefore demonstrated in this study that the variable amino acids in the structure of MCs influenced not only the degradation kinetics but also the preferable reaction mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abyproducts 3acarbon 3acylindrospermopsin 3aguanidines 3ahepatotoxicity 3ahydroxyl radicals 3ahydroxylation 3aisomerization 3amicrocystins 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aphotolysis 3areaction kinetics 3areaction mechanisms 3atyrosine 0aMicrocystins 0aUV-254 nm 0aHydrogen peroxide 0aSecond-order rate constant 0aMechanism 0aVariable amino acids1 ade la Cruz, Armah A.1 aHiskia, Anastasia1 aKaloudis, Triantafyllos1 aO'Shea, Kevin1 aDionysiou, Dionysios D.0 tWater research.g2015 May 01, v. 74 p.227-238dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094024002200120024001900142040001800161100002200179245007900201300001600280500001400296506007600310520154900386592002801935506003701963650001102000650001502011650002802026650002002054650000902074650001202083650001802095650001302113650001402126650001802140650001202158650001202170650002102182650001402203650001202217650001602229650001402245700002702259773009502286856007202381852000902453655001202462IND60689974820221207081318.0200424e20090415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068997482DNAL7 a10.4161/fly.80512doi7 aPMC34015382pmcid7 a192421142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinder, Jodell E.10aCross-generational fitness effects of infection in Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 143-150.  aNAL-light  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aActivation of the immune system is beneficial in defending against pathogens, but may also have costly side effects on an organism's fitness. In this study we examine the fitness consequences of immune challenge in female Drosophila melanogaster by examining both direct (within generation) and indirect (between generations) costs and benefits of immune challenge. Though passing immunity to offspring has been studied in mammals for many years, only recently have researchers found evidence for a cross-generational priming response in invertebrates. By examining both potential fitness costs and benefits in the next generation, we were able to determine what effect immune challenge has on fitness. In agreement with other studies, we found a direct cost to infection, where immune challenged females laid fewer eggs than unchallenged females in two of the three lines we examined. In addition, we found some evidence for indirect costs. Offspring from immune challenged mothers had shorter lifespans than those from unchallenged mothers in two of the three lines. Interestingly, we do not see any effect of maternal immune challenge on offspring's ability to overcome an infection, nor do we see an effect on other fitness traits measured, including egg size, egg-adult viability, and offspring resistance to oxidative stress. While previous studies in bumblebees and beetles have demonstrated cross-generation priming, our results suggest that it may not be a general phenomenon, and more work is needed to determine how widespread it is.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombus 3aColeoptera 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aadverse effects 3aeggs 3afemales 3aimmune system 3aimmunity 3ainfection 3ainvertebrates 3amammals 3amothers 3aoxidative stress 3apathogens 3aprogeny 3aresearchers 3aviability1 aPromislow, Daniel E.L.0 tFly.g2009 Apr. 15, v. 3, no. 2 p.143-150dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2251x1933-69427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.80513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245010100166300001600267520188000283592002802163650002602191650001902217650001202236650002102248650001902269650001602288650003102304650002902335650002102364650001202385650001802397650001202415650000902427651001002436653001902446653002902465653002902494653002602523653002202549653002102571700001502592700001702607700001502624700001402639700001402653700002002667700001702687700001902704773008802723856008602811852000902897655001202906IND60547258420221117193150.0160903e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054725842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aDifferences in CH4 and N2O emissions between rice nurseries in Chinese major rice cropping areas  ap. 220-228.  aStudies on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from paddy field have primarily focused on the post-transplanting period, however, recent researches raise new concerns about GHGs emission from rice nursery. In this study, CH4 and N2O fluxes were determined from different nurseries under major rice cropping systems in China. The tested nurseries included flooded nursery (FN), moist nursery (MN) and dry nursery (DN). Methane emissions from FN were significantly higher than those from MN and DN under all the rice cropping systems. When comparing with FN, MN decreased total CH4 emissions by 74.2%, 72.1% and 49.6% under the rice–upland rotation cropping system (RUR), and the double rice cropping system for the early rice (EDR) and the late rice (LDR), respectively. DN decreased CH4 emissions by 99.2%, 92.0%, 99.0% and 78.6% compared to FN under the single rice cropping system (SR), RUR, EDR and LDR, respectively. When comparing with FN, MN and DN increased N2O emissions by 58.1–134.1% and 28.2–332.7%, respectively. Ultimately, compared with FN across the cropping systems, MN and DN decreased net global warming potentials (GWPs) of CH4 and N2O by 33–68% and 43–86%, respectively. The mitigating effect of MN and DN on total GWPs varied greatly across the systems, ranging from 30.8% in the LDR to 86.5% in the SR. Chinese actual emission from rice nurseries was reduced to 956.66 × 103 t CO2 eq from the theoretical estimate of 2242.59 × 103 t CO2 eq if under the flooded nursery scenario in 2012. Taking into account the large rice nursery area (2032.52 × 103 ha) in China, the results of this study clearly indicate the importance to estimate and mitigate GHGs emission from flooded rice nursery. Being effective to reduce GHG emissions and increase rice yield, dry nursery technique is a promising candidate for climate smart rice cropping.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3acropping systems 3aglobal warming 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3anitrous oxide 3apaddies 3arice 3aChina 0aClimate change 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aGlobal warming potential 0aRice seedling nursery 0aIrrigation regime 0aCropping systems1 aLi, Zhijie1 aFeng, Jinfei1 aZhang, Xin1 aJiang, Yu1 aChen, Jin1 aZhang, Mingqian1 aDeng, Aixing1 aZhang, Weijian0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Oct., v. 96 p.220-228dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010500160300001800265520170000283592002801983650002202011650001502033650002302048650001502071650001602086650001402102650002202116650000902138650001302147650001102160650001302171650001402184650001102198650002202209650001602231700003002247700001402277700002202291700002102313700002202334700002102356700002002377700001702397700001802414700002002432773013102452856007502583852000902658655001202667IND60538546520170428000000.0160815e20120523xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053854652DNAL7 a10.1021/ja212104b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoutaboul, Lucie10aAltering the Static Dipole on Surfaces through Chemistry: Molecular Films of Zwitterionic Quinonoids  ap. 8494-8506.  aThe adsorption of molecular films made of small molecules with a large intrinsic electrical dipole has been explored. The data indicate that such dipolar molecules may be used for altering the interface dipole screening at the metal electrode interface in organic electronics. More specifically, we have investigated the surface electronic spectroscopic properties of zwitterionic molecules containing 12π electrons of the p-benzoquinonemonoimine type, C₆H₂(···NHR)₂(···O)₂(R = H (1), n-C₄H₉ (2), C₃H₆–S–CH₃ (3), C₃H₆–O–CH₃ (4), CH₂–C₆H₅ (5)), adsorbed on Au. These molecules are stable zwitterions by virtue of the meta positions occupied by the nitrogen and oxygen substituents on the central ring, respectively. The structures of 2–4 have been determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and indicate that in these molecules, two chemically connected but electronically not conjugated 6π electron subunits are present, which explains their strong dipolar character. We systematically observed that homogeneous molecular films with thickness as small as 1 nm were formed on Au, which fully cover the surface, even for a variety of R substituents. Preferential adsorption toward the patterned gold areas on SiO₂ substrates was found with 4. Optimum self-assembling of 2 and 5 results in ordered close packed films, which exhibit n-type character, based on the position of the Fermi level close to the conduction band minimum, suggesting high conductivity properties. This new type of self-assembled molecular films offers interesting possibilities for engineering metal–organic interfaces, of critical importance for organic electronics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3achemical structure 3aelectrodes 3aelectronics 3aelectrons 3afilms (materials) 3agold 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aquinones 3ascreening 3asilica 3aspectral analysis 3azwitterions1 aBraunstein, P.q(Pierre),1 aXiao, Jie1 aZhang, Zhengzheng1 aDowben, Peter A.1 aDalmas, Guillaume1 aDa Costa, Victor1 aFélix, Olivier1 aDecher, Gero1 aRosa, Luis G.1 aDoudin, Bernard0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 23, v. 134, no. 20 p.8494-8506dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja212104b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02231naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245008100154300002000235520107500255592002801330650001101358650001601369650002101385650001501406650001401421650001401435650000901449650001501458650001401473700001801487700001301505700002701518700001501545700001501560700001701575700002001592773012501612856007501737852000901812655001201821IND60641098720221120152426.0220402e20160908xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064109872DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17102h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Liang10aElectrochemical behavior of zirconium in molten LiF–KF–ZrF₄ at 600 °C  ap. 84472-84479.  aIn this paper, a detailed study of the electrochemical behavior of zirconium in the molten LiF–KF–ZrF₄ system on an inert molybdenum electrode was carried out at 600 °C. Several electrochemical techniques were employed such as cyclic voltammetry, chronoamperometry and square wave voltammetry. The reduction of zirconium was found to be a multi-step process that at the potentials of 1.15, 1.50 and 1.62 V versus Pt, the corresponding cathodic reactions of Zr⁴⁺/Zr²⁺, Zr²⁺/Zr⁺ and Zr⁺/Zr occurred. The result was further confirmed by the theoretical calculation of the number of transferred electrons according to the cyclic voltammetry and square wave voltammetry analysis. Moreover, based on the cyclic voltammograms, the diffusion coefficient of Zr⁴⁺ ions in the eutectic LiF–KF containing 1 wt% ZrF₄ at 600 °C was estimated to be about 8.31 × 10⁻⁶ cm² s⁻¹. The present electrochemical study on zirconium in the molten fluoride system will be a theoretical reference for future zirconium electrorefining from Zr alloy or scraps.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3adiffusivity 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectrons 3afluorides 3aions 3amolybdenum 3azirconium1 aXiao, Yanping1 aXu, Qian1 avan Sandwijk, Anthonie1 aLi, Jidong1 aZhao, Zhuo1 aSong, Qiushi1 aYang, Yongxiang0 tRSC advances.g2016 Sept. 08, v. 6, no. 87 p.84472-84479dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra17102h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02944naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012800159300001600287520168600303592002801989650002702017650001302044650001202057650002102069650001602090650002402106650001302130650002302143650000902166650002402175650001802199650001702217700001902234700001602253700001202269700001702281700002002298773012102318856007402439852000902513655001202522IND60440515720221120180343.0151024e200506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044051572DNAL7 a10.1007/BF029693622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yong-Xiao10aInduces vasodilatation of rat mesenteric arteryin vitro mainly by inhibiting receptor-mediated Ca2+-influx and Ca2+-release  ap. 709-715.  aThe purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of atropine on peripheral vasodilation and the mechanisms involved. The isometric tension of rat mesenteric artery rings was recordedin vitro on a myograph. The results showed that atropine, at concentrations greater than 1 μM, relaxed the noradrenalin (NA)-precontracted rat mesenteric artery in a concentration-dependent manner. Atropine-induced vasodilation was mediated, in part, by an endothelium-dependent mechanism, to which endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor may contribute. Atropine was able to shift the NA-induced concentration-response curve to the right, in a non-parallel manner, suggesting the mechanism of atropine was not mediated via the α₁-adrenoreceptor. The β-adrenoreceptor and ATP sensitive potassium channel, a voltage dependent calcium channel, were not involved in the vasodilatation. However, atropine inhibited the contraction derived from NA and CaCl₂ in Ca²⁺-free medium, in a concentration dependent manner, indicating the vasodilatation was related to the inhibition of extracellular Ca²⁺ influx through the receptor-operated calcium channels and intracellular Ca²⁺ release from the Ca²⁺ store. Atropine had no effect on the caffeine-induced contraction in the artery segments, indicating the inhibition of intracellular Ca²⁺ release as a result of atropine most likely occurs via the IP₃ pathway rather than the ryanodine receptors. Our results suggest that atropine-induced vasodilatation is mainly from artery smooth muscle cells due to inhibition of the receptor-mediated Ca²⁺-influx and Ca²⁺-release, and partly from the endothelium mediated by EDHF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aatropine 3acalcium 3acalcium chloride 3aendothelium 3amesenteric arteries 3amyocytes 3apotassium channels 3arats 3aryanodine receptors 3asmooth muscle 3avasodilation1 aZheng, Jian-Pu1 aHe, Jian-Yu1 aLi, Jie1 aXu, Cang-Bao1 aEdvinsson, Lars0 tArchives of pharmacal research.g2005 June, v. 28, no. 6 p.709-715dPharmaceutical Society of Koreax0253-62697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF029693623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03737naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245014600176520170100322592002802023650002602051650001902077650001602096650001602112650001802128650001302146650001102159651001102170653000802181653000902189653000702198653000902205653000902214653000902223653000902232653000902241653000902250653001002259653001002269653001002279653001002289653001002299653000802309653000802317653000902325653000902334653001302343653000602356653000902362653000802371653000902379653001002388653000602398653000602404653001102410653000602421653000802427653000802435653001002443653000602453653000702459653000802466653000802474653000802482653000802490653000802498653000802506653001402514653001402528653001902542653001102561653001602572653001302588700003002601700002402631773011902655856008802774852000902862655001202871IND60783351820221120023026.0220906e20221101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078335182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1573412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHirabayashi, Kaede10aPredicted impacts of climate change on wild and commercial berry habitats will have food security, conservation and agricultural implications  aClimate change is now a reality and is altering ecosystems, with Canada experiencing 2–4 times the global average rate of warming. This will have a critical impact on berry cultivation and horticulture. Enhancing our understanding of how wild and cultivated berries will perform under changing climates will be essential to mitigating impacts on ecosystems, culture and food security. Our objective was to predict the impact of climate change on habitat suitability of four berry producing Vaccinium species: two species with primarily northern distributions (V. uliginosum, V. vitis-idaea), one species with a primarily southern distribution (V. oxycoccos), and the commercially cultivated V. macrocarpon. We used the maximum entropy (Maxent) model and the CMIP6 shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) 126 and 585 projected to 2041–2060 and 2061–2080. Wild species showed a uniform northward progression and expansion of suitable habitat. Our modeling predicts that suitable growing regions for commercial cranberries are also likely to shift with some farms becoming unsuitable for the current varieties and other regions becoming more suitable for cranberry farms. Both V. macrocarpon and V. oxycoccos showed a high dependence on precipitation-associated variables. Vaccinium vitis-idaea and V. uliginosum had a greater number of variables with smaller contributions which may improve their resilience to individual climactic events. Future competition between commercial cranberry farms and wild berries in protected areas could lead to conflicts between agriculture and conservation priorities. New varieties of commercial berries are required to maintain current commercial berry farms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium vitis-idaea 3aclimate change 3acranberries 3aenvironment 3afood security 3ahabitats 3amodels 3aCanada 0aAUC 0aAICc 0aBC 0abdod 0abio1 0abio5 0abio6 0abio8 0abio9 0abio12 0abio16 0abio17 0abio18 0abio19 0aCBI 0acec 0acfvo 0aCMIP 0acoeffvar 0aD 0aGBIF 0aGCM 0ageom 0aGRASS 0aH 0aI 0aMaxent 0aL 0aocd 0aocs 0aphh2o 0aQ 0aRM 0aSDM 0asoc 0aSSP 0aSWD 0atpi 0aTSS 0aVaccinium 0aCranberry 0aClimate change 0aMaxent 0aLingonberry 0aBilberry1 aMurch, S.

The combination of these methods reveals not only landslide deposits, but also geomorphic and sedimentologic structures that give clues about landslide type and mode of emplacement. LiDAR and bathymetric data reveal the areal extent of landslide deposits as well as the orientation of ridges that differentiate between spreading and flowing kinematics. The subbottom profiles show two-dimensional structures of disturbed landslide deposits, including horst and grabens indicative of landslides classified as spreads. A preliminary computer tomography (CT) scan of a sediment core confirms the structures of one subbottom profile. We also use archival data from the Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure and resident interviews to better characterize historic landslides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aclay 3acomputed tomography 3ainterviews 3akinematics 3alakes 3alandslides 3alidar 3asediments 3aBritish Columbia 0aGlaciomarine sediment 0aLandslide 0aMultibeam sonar 0aAcoustic subbottom profile 0aLiDAR 0aLakelse Lake1 aBlais-Stevens, Andrée1 aKwoll, Eva1 aMenounos, Brian1 aVenditti, Jeremy G.1 aGrenier, Alain1 aWiebe, Kelsey0 tSedimentary geology.g2018 Feb., v. 364 p.217-227dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11737x0037-07387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sedgeo.2017.12.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005200150245009900202520116300301592002801464650001001492650001701502650001901519650001201538650001501550650001101565650002901576650002001605650001601625650001401641653001401655653002001669653003001689700001301719700001501732700001501747700005601762773009901818856008501917852000902002655001202011IND60659347820221117050011.0200210e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065934782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5982-214310aUse of probabilistic expert elicitation for assessing risk of appearance of grape downy mildew  aGrape downy mildew (GDM) is a major disease of grapevine and the date of appearance of its first symptoms is a determinant information for the protection of the vineyard. Probabilistic elicitation of experts has been used here to estimate this date. In 2017 and 2018, 29 experts were elicited to provide probability distributions of dates of GDM appearance between April and June, for different plots. The results of these elicitations show that the experts' forecasts and their uncertainty change over the season with possible consequences on the number of fungicide treatments. The elicited dates tend to be earlier at the beginning of the season and later at the end of the season, with an average difference of about 18 days. In April 2017 and 2018, most of the elicited dates are too early compared to observed dates of GDM symptom appearance. However, this bias becomes negligible in the month of May. Compared to qualitative scoring systems, our results indicate that probabilistic elicitation is a better tool for communicating expert judgments and their associated uncertainties in plant disease risk assessments and epidemiological alert bulletins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis 3adowny mildew 3aexpert opinion 3aexperts 3afungicides 3agrapes 3aprobability distribution 3arisk assessment 3auncertainty 3avineyards 0aGrapevine 0aExpert judgment 0aProbabilistic elicitation1 aBrun, F.1 aRaynal, M.1 aDebord, C.1 aMakowski, D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6385-37030 tCrop protection.g2019 Dec., v. 126 p.104926-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.1049263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245012300165300001800288520126200306592002801568650001501596650002101611650001801632650001301650650001201663700002001675700005901695700006201754773013601816856008001952852000902032655001202041IND60735904920221121023924.0210429e20210419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073590492DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c099962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Youngwoo10aSymmetric and Asymmetric Push–Pull Conjugates: Significance of Pull Group Strength on Charge Transfer and Separation  ap. 4067-4075.  aThe effect of acceptor strength on excited-state charge transfer (CT) and charge separation (CS) in central phenothiazine (PTZ)-derived symmetric 1 (PTZ-(TCBD-TPA)₂) and asymmetric 2 (PTZ-(TCBD/DCNQ-TPA)₂) push–pull conjugates, in which triphenylamine (TPA) acts as end capping and 1,1,4,4–tetracyanobuta–1,3–diene (TCBD) and cyclohexa–2,5–diene–1,4–ylidene–expanded TCBD (DCNQ) act as electron acceptor units, is reported. Due to strong push–pull effects, intramolecular CT was observed in the ground state, extending the absorption into the near-infrared region. Electrochemical, spectroelectrochemical, and computational studies coupled with energy-level calculations predicted both 1 and 2 to be efficient candidates for ultrafast CT. Subsequent femtosecond transient absorption studies along with global target analysis, performed in both polar and nonpolar solvents, confirmed such processes in which the CS was efficient in asymmetric 2, having both TCBD and DCNQ acceptors in polar benzonitrile, while in toluene, only CT was witnessed. This work highlights the significance of the number and strength of electron acceptor entities and the role of solvent polarity in multimodular push–pull systems to achieve ultrafast CS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aphenothiazine 3asolvents 3atoluene1 aRout, Yogajivan1 aMisra, Rajneesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3225-21251 aD’Souza, Francis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3815-89490 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2021 Apr. 19, v. 125, no. 16 p.4067-4075dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c099963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02690naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245008700159300002000246520144600266592002801712650001401740650001501754650001601769650001301785650001301798650001401811650001601825650001201841650002601853650001901879650002001898650001201918650002601930650001401956700002901970700001601999700001702015700001702032773012402049856007402173852000902247655001202256IND60641098820221120162518.0190505e20161005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064109882DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra17103f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xiao Ying10aMonodomain hydrogels prepared by shear-induced orientation and subsequent gelation  ap. 95239-95245.  aBiomimetic soft materials with well-ordered structures have received increasing attention due to their potential applications in artificial tissues, soft actuators, and optical devices. We demonstrate here the synthesis of anisotropic hydrogels from concentrated liquid crystalline solution of hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC; content ≥ 45 wt%) with high viscosity. Monodomain precursor solution of HPC, in the presence of reactants, is obtained by mechanical shearing, which is immediately subjected to UV light irradiation to trigger the polymerization and thus to freeze the ordered structure of HPC before severe structural relaxation. The as-prepared HPC-containing poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid) gels are transparent and show uniform birefringence, Δn of 1.7 × 10⁻³, and pronounced anisotropic mechanical properties, with larger tensile modulus and breaking stress, yet smaller breaking strain when stretched parallel to the shear direction than those perpendicular to the shear direction. The gels also show anisotropic swelling ratio, with larger value in the direction perpendicular to the shear direction. The swelling anisotropy decreases from 1.22 in water to 1.09 in 1.5 M saline solution, which is related to the weakening of optical and mechanical anisotropy of swollen gels. This approach to prepare anisotropic gels should be suitable to other LC natural and synthetic macromolecules with high viscosity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactuators 3aanisotropy 3abiomimetics 3afreezing 3agelation 3ahydrogels 3airradiation 3aliquids 3amechanical properties 3apolymerization 3asodium chloride 3atissues 3aultraviolet radiation 3aviscosity1 aWang, Z.

Atmospheric H2S concentration has been measured and studied but less is known about the natural sinks of the chemical. This study investigates the atmospheric depletion of H2S within a 35 km distance from two Icelandic power plants. The results showed that atmospheric oxidation by the OH radical was the largest sink in the area. The second largest sink was H2S uptake in surface water, in a neighboring lake, but it was, however, small compared to the reported difference of sulfur amount in the lake in- and outflow. Sulfur was found to accumulate in moss close to the power plants at a maximum rate of about 1500 mg S/kg moss per year and decreased exponentially from the source, being negligible at a distance of a few kilometers. Soil uptake was limited by diffusion of H2S into the porous media and was thus much smaller than the estimated soil uptake potential. Washout with precipitation was estimated to be the smallest sink due to the low H2S reactivity in the precipitation (pH = 5.6), compared to the surface water (pH ∼8). Depletion of H2S from the atmosphere in the study area was estimated to be about 1.2% of the 2012 power plants emissions of over 20,000 tons. Although the uncertainties in the depletion estimates were considerable, most of the H2S emitted from the power plants was strongly indicated to be transported out of the study area as H2S.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3aemissions 3ageothermal energy 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alakes 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxidation 3apH 3aporous media 3apower plants 3asoil 3asulfur 3asurface water 3auncertainty 3aIceland 0aHydrogen sulfide 0aAtmospheric sinks 0aGeothermal emission 0aNear field fate1 aGardarsson, S.M.1 aAndradottir, H.O.0 tAtmospheric environment.g2014 Oct., v. 96 p.236-244dElsevier Ltdx1352-23107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.07.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01584naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015300160300001600313520055100329592002800880650002400908650002600932650001300958650000900971650001200980650001200992650001401004650002001018700001801038773011901056856007401175852000901249655001201258IND60664707320221119175042.0190912e20131122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470732DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45024d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYadav, Priyanka10aRoom temperature metallogelation for a simple series of aminothiazole ligands with potential applications in identifying and scavenging mercury ions  ap. 563-566.  aA new class of aminothiazole based metallogels of mercury have been synthesized and characterized using various physico-chemical techniques.

The representation of thick tropical regolith in integrated hydrological models lacks consensus on aquifer geometries and parameter ranges. Our main objective was to determine the knowledge requirements on saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kₛ) to model the critical zone (CZ) of HRAs in WA. A parametric sensitivity analysis with a focus on the representation of the Kₛ heterogeneity of the regolith was conducted with a critical zone model (Parflow‐CLM [Community Land Model]) of the Upper Ouémé catchment in Benin (14,000 km²) at a 1‐ × 1‐km² resolution. The impact of parameter changes in the near subsurface (0.3‐to‐5‐m depth) and in the deeper regolith aquifer (24‐ and 48‐m maximum depth) was assessed in five modeling experiments. Streamflow was largely dependent on Kₛ and on clay distribution in the near subsurface and less on the properties of the deeper subsurface. Groundwater table depths and amplitudes were controlled by vegetation and topography as observed on instrumented hillslopes and for Kₛ within the literature range. Experiments with higher Kₛ suggested a Kₛ threshold where dynamics become less determined by one‐dimensional vertical and more determined by lateral processes. Such heterogeneity impacts from smaller scales need to be accounted for when hydrological models are upscaled to larger domains (1‐ × 1‐km² resolution or coarser). Our findings highlight the need for a new conceptual approach to represent clay distribution in order to develop catchment‐scale CZ models of HRAs in WA that capture the observed processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3aclay 3aregolith 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3astream flow 3atopographic slope 3avadose zone 3avegetation 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aBenin1 aHector, Basile1 aCohard, Jean‐Martial1 aVouillamoz, Jean‐Michel1 aLawson, Fabrice Messan Amene1 aPeugeot, Christophe1 ade Graaf, Inge0 tVadose zone journal.g2021 Nov., v. 20, no. 6 p.e20163-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03265naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245012400162300001800286520183900304592002802143650002202171650001302193650001902206650002402225650001902249650001302268650001202281650001902293650002902312650001702341650001602358650002102374650001202395650002302407650001102430650001502441650001502456650001102471700002502482700002102507700002002528700002502548773012602573856007502699852000902774655001202783IND60534411620221118052241.0160802e20120918xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053441162DNAL7 a10.1021/es301381n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoe-Wong, Claresta10aEstimation of Reactive Thiol Concentrations in Dissolved Organic Matter and Bacterial Cell Membranes in Aquatic Systems  ap. 9854-9861.  aOrganic thiols are highly reactive ligands and play an important role in the speciation of several metals and organic pollutants in the environment. Although small thiols can be isolated and their concentrations can be estimated using chromatographic and derivatization techniques, estimating concentrations of thiols associated with biomacromolecules and humic substances has been difficult. Here we present a fluorescence-spectroscopy-based method for estimating thiol concentrations in biomacromolecules and cell membranes using one of the soluble bromobimanes, monobromo(trimethylammonio)bimane (qBBr). The fluorescence of this molecule increases significantly when it binds to a thiol. The change in the sample fluorescence due to thiols reacting with qBBr is used to determine thiol concentration in a sample. Using this method, small thiols such as cysteine and glutathione can be detected in clean solutions down to ∼50 nM without their separation and prior concentration. Thiols associated with dissolved organic matter (DOM) can be detected down to low micromolar concentration, depending on the DOM background fluorescence. The charge on qBBr prevents its rapid diffusion across cell membranes, so qBBr is ideal for estimating thiol concentration at the cell membrane–water interface. This method was successfully used to determine the thiol concentration on the cell envelope of intact Bacillus subtilis to nanomolar concentration without any special sample preparation. Among the chemical species tested for potential interferences (other reduced sulfides methionine and cystine, carboxylate, salt (MgCl₂)), carboxylates significantly influenced the absolute fluorescence signal of the thiol–qBBr complex. However, this does not affect the detection of thiols in heterogeneous mixtures using the presented method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3achemical speciation 3achromatography 3acysteine 3acystine 3aderivatization 3adissolved organic matter 3afluorescence 3aglutathione 3ahumic substances 3aligands 3amagnesium chloride 3ametals 3amethionine 3apollutants 3athiols1 aShoenfelt, Elizabeth1 aHauser, Emily J.1 aCrompton, Nyssa1 aMyneni, Satish C.

In California, Botryosphaeriaceae species cause three major diseases, the panicle and shoot blight of pistachio; the canker, dieback, and blight of walnut; and, the band canker of almond. The control of Botryosphaeria diseases of pistachio and walnut by applying synthetic fungicides has been an effective management strategy. Conversely, because the unique disease cycle of almond band canker, attacking the almond trunk through the growth cracks, fungicide applications are not recommended for controlling this disease after expression of symptoms. Whatever the disease, integrating the different management practices, such as cultural practices, plant resistance, or biological control, is a necessity.

The generalized Mualem hydraulic conductivity model was evaluated using the mathematical approach of Priesack and Durner. Three types of modification to the multimodel were also proposed. Firstly, the derived conductivity equations can be simplified when the submodel parameters, hbi${h_{{{\rm{b}}_i}}}$ for the BC model, αi−1${{\alpha}}_i^{ - 1}$ for the VG model, and hmi${h_{{{\rm{m}}_i}}}$ for the KO model have the same (common) value (denoted as CH). Secondly, as in the case of the modified single VG and KO models, a hypothetical air‐entry head near saturation can be introduced for the multimodal VG and KO models to prevent unrealistic reductions in the hydraulic conductivity near saturation when the VG n parameter approaches its lower limit of n = 1. Furthermore, the multimodal hydraulic conductivity functions become a simple sum of conductivity subfunctions when the exponent r is unity (such as for Burdine's model), which leads to independent tortuosity effects for each submodel. The models are illustrated for two soils: a highly aggregated Kumamoto Andisol and a relatively unimodal dune sand. The dual‐(BC, VG, KO) and the VG₁BC₂ models equally represented the water retention data of the Andisol, with similar hydraulic conductivity curves. The dual‐BC‐CH, dual‐VG‐CH, and VG₁BC₂‐CH models fitted the water retention data of the dune sand well, with the hydraulic conductivity curves of the dual‐porosity model being similar to those of the Fayer and Simmons (FS) model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndisols 3adune sand 3ahead 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3avadose zone1 aToride, Nobuo1 aTh. van Genuchten, Martinus0 tVadose zone journal.g2022 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.e20168-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01416naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007500169300001600244520039700260592002800657650001200685650001200697650002400709650000900733650002800742653003300770653002300803653001900826700001800845773013300863856008500996852000901081655001201090IND60654911320221120154314.0190727e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065491132DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2019.16193242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlgburi, Omar10aClimate-responsive strategies in vernacular architecture of Erbil city  ap. 745-763.  aThis study examines residential architecture in the historic core of Erbil, a registered World Heritage Site, for its use of climate responsive strategies.

IR and ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopic data are reported, representing the first NMR data for a goup 6 alkane complex. Only binding of the methyl functionality of the pentane ligand was observed in (HEB)W(CO)₂(pentane). This contrasts with the previously reported binding of pentane to rhenium fragments, wherein both methylene and methyl groups were observed to bind, with a slight preference for binding of the former. The reason for the preference for binding through the methyl group is investigated, and the steric requirement for the pentane to adopt an unfavorable gauche conformation when bound via a methylene is identified as a contributing factor.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aligands 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apentane 3aphotolysis 3arhenium 3asolvents 3aspectral analysis 3atemperature 3atungsten1 aLawes, Douglas J.1 aHill, Anthony F.1 aBall, Graham E.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 May 23, v. 134, no. 20 p.8294-8297dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja300281s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03588naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245012100160500002000281520218900301592002802490650002002518650000902538650001502547650001502562650001402577650001502591650002902606650001402635650003702649650001702686650001602703700001402719700005802733700002202791700002102813700006702834700006002901773012102961856007503082852000903157655001203166IND60789271220221116212653.0220819e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078927122DNAL7 a10.1002/vzj2.201662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaiswal, Parakh10aParasite inversion for determining the coefficients and time‐validity of Philip's two‐term infiltration equation  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany different equations have been proposed to describe quantitatively one‐dimensional soil water infiltration. The unknown coefficients of these equations characterize soil hydraulic properties and may be estimated from a n record, {t∼i,I∼i}i=1n$\{ {\tilde t_i},{\tilde I_i}\} _{i = 1}^n$, of cumulative infiltration measurements using curve fitting techniques. The two‐term infiltration equation, I(t)=St+cKst$I(t) = S\sqrt t + c{K_{\rm{s}}}t$, of Philip has been widely used to describe measured infiltration data. This function enjoys a solid mathematical–physical underpinning and admits a closed‐form solution for the soil sorptivity, S [L T⁻¹/²], and multiple, c [−], of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, Kₛ [L T⁻¹]. However, Philip's two‐term equation has a limited time validity, tᵥₐₗᵢd [T], and thus cumulative infiltration data, I∼(t∼)$\tilde I(\tilde t)$, beyond t=tvalid$t = {t_{{\rm{valid}}}}$ will corrupt the estimates of S and Kₛ. This paper introduces a novel method for estimating S, c, Kₛ, and tᵥₐₗᵢd of Philip's two‐term infiltration equation. This method, coined parasite inversion, use as vehicle Parlange's three‐parameter infiltration equation. As prerequisite to our method, we present as secondary contribution an exact, robust and efficient numerical solution of Parlange's infiltration equation. This solution admits Bayesian parameter estimation with the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm and yields as byproduct the marginal distribution of Parlange's β parameter. We evaluate our method for 12 USDA soil types using synthetic infiltration data simulated with HYDRUS‐1D. An excellent match is observed between the inferred values of S and Kₛ and their “true” values known beforehand. Furthermore, our estimates of c and tᵥₐₗᵢd correlate well with soil texture, corroborate linearity of the c(β)$c({{\beta}})$ relationship for 0≤t≤tvalid$0 \le t \le {t_{{\rm{valid}}}}$, and fall within reported ranges. A cumulative vertical infiltration of about 2.5 cm may serve as guideline for the time‐validity of Philip's two‐term infiltration equation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aUSDA 3aalgorithms 3abyproducts 3aequations 3aguidelines 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aparasites 3asaturated hydraulic conductivity 3asoil texture 3avadose zone1 aGao, Yifu1 aRahmati, Mehdi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5547-64421 aVanderborght, Jan1 aŠimůnek, Jirka1 aVereecken, H.q(Harry),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8051-85171 aVrugt, Jasper A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2599-11650 tVadose zone journal.g2022 Jan., v. 21, no. 1 p.e20166-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3674032x1539-16637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/vzj2.201663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02964naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005700149245012700206520128300333592002801616650001101644650002001655650001801675650001201693650001301705653001301718653002001731653003301751653003301784653001501817653003201832653000801864653000801872653001001880653000701890653000801897653000701905653000701912653000801919653000701927653000801934653000701942653000801949653000801957653000801965653000701973653001201980653000701992653000801999653000702007700002202014700001502036700005602051700005602107773009402163856008402257852000902341655001202350IND60759080120221120082455.0220118e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075908012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1127352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBotelho, D.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8060-081X10aProsumer integration into the Brazilian energy sector: An overview of innovative business models and regulatory challenges  aConsidering the Brazilian energy policy's future, the perspective of a more decentralized energy system must be accounted for in the face of technological, business, and energy matrix changes. Therefore, the prosumer's figure combined with new Business Models (BM) brings opportunities and challenges for the sector. This paper aims to solidify knowledge, identify and understand the main regulatory barriers and enablers for the development of prosumers and prosumer-driven BMs in the Brazilian energy market. A comprehensive review of existing regulations provides a starting point for improving the relevant legal frameworks for prosumers' aggregation. Then, an analysis of innovative BMs in the Brazilian regulatory framework is carried out, seeking to guide the decisions for the country to develop its political and regulatory environment in the future. The paper concludes with policy recommendations to promote prosumers aggregation in the Brazilian energy sector. We conclude that the main barriers to prosumers' integration are of regulatory and technological nature, and the exploration of innovative BMs is crucial for the sector development. Redefining the role and responsibilities of utilities is a key factor, together with exploring collective self-consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aenergy industry 3aenergy policy 3amarkets 3apolitics 0aProsumer 0aBusiness models 0aBrazilian electricity sector 0aRenewable energy integration 0aRegulation 0aProsumer aggregation policy 0aACL 0aACR 0aANEEL 0aBM 0aCEE 0aDG 0aDR 0aDSO 0aEU 0aFiT 0aIT 0aMME 0aONS 0aP2P 0aPL 0aPROINFA 0aPV 0aRES 0aUK1 ade Oliveira, L.W.1 aDias, B.H.1 aSoares, T.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4708-45741 aMoraes, C.A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8094-64850 tEnergy policy.g2022 Feb., v. 161 p.112735-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1127353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02832naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003000151245013900181300001600320520106800336592002801404650002201432650002901454650002601483650002701509650002601536650001201562650001101574650002601585650002501611650002401636650001501660650001101675650002601686650001801712650001001730650004101740650001301781650003101794650001601825650000701841650001101848650001601859650001201875653001801887653001501905653001601920700002401936700002701960700001801987700002202005773013302027856008502160852000902245655001202254IND60654911420221120154310.0190727e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065491142DNAL7 a10.1080/00207233.2019.16205352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdel-Wareth, Marwa T.

Adult snails were maintained in plastic, mud and cement matrices. Three groups were prepared; under normal laboratory conditions, in slightly low pH conditions, and in high temperature (30°C) conditions. Nine fungal species were isolated from soft tissues of snails. Ethyl acetate and acetone extracts were prepared from each fungal species, and their biological activities were investigated. Paecilomyces variotii extracts were the most effective as antimicrobial agents, while acetone extract of Trichoderma harzianum showed high antioxidant activity. Acetone extracts of Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus niger were highly active against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the five effective extracts showed the presence of various compounds. B. alexandrina snails may be regarded as a newly discovered source of beneficial compounds through the metabolites produced by their endozoic fungal strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aBiomphalaria alexandrina 3aPaecilomyces variotii 3aTalaromyces islandicus 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aacetone 3aadults 3aanti-infective agents 3aantioxidant activity 3abioactive compounds 3acell lines 3acement 3aenvironmental factors 3aethyl acetate 3afungi 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahepatoma 3alaboratory experimentation 3ametabolites 3apH 3asnails 3atemperature 3atissues 0aantimicrobial 0aanticancer 0aantioxidant1 aEl-Hagrassi, Ali M.1 aAbdel-Aziz, Mohamed S.1 aNasr, Sami M.1 aGhareeb, Mosad A.0 tInternational journal of environmental studies.g2019 Sept. 3, v. 76, no. 5 p.780-799dRoutledgewJournal:12219x1029-04007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207233.2019.16205353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02473naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245010900168300001800277520136600295592002801661650001501689650001401704650002201718650002101740650001301761650001501774650000901789650000901798650001301807650001801820650001301838700002401851700002001875773012101895856007402016852000902090655001202099IND60664707620221119174910.0190912e20131202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066470762DNAL7 a10.1039/c3ra45029e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatthanaphanit, Anyarat12aA novel one-step synthesis of gold nanoparticles in an alginate gel matrix by solution plasma sputtering  ap. 1622-1629.  aWe report a novel strategy to produce stable colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in alginate aqueous solution which can be done in one step and without any chemicals. The AuNPs were produced by applying a voltage across a pair of gold electrodes which were immersed in alginate aqueous solution. Since the generation of AuNPs was caused by the sputtering of gold electrodes, the process was named the solution plasma sputtering (SPS) process. We utilize the alginate polymer in order to meet three important requirements: (1) to promote the generation of plasma in a liquid environment, (2) to endow biocompatibility to the AuNPs, and (3) to provide colloidal stability to the AuNPs-alginate aqueous suspensions. The alginate concentrations were varied as 0.2, 0.5, and 0.9 %w/v. The concentration-dependent effect on the particle size of AuNPs, the physical absorption property and the stability of the AuNPs-alginate suspensions were studied. Results indicate that preparation of chemical-free colloidal AuNPs-alginate aqueous suspension is successful by the SPS process. The obtained colloidal suspensions were stable and able to retain their strong plasmon absorption bands within a reasonable time period. As a consequence, this is a high-potential technique to produce AuNPs suspended in alginate aqueous solution appropriate for biomedical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aalginates 3aaqueous solutions 3abiocompatibility 3acolloids 3aelectrodes 3agels 3agold 3ananogold 3aparticle size 3apolymers1 aPanomsuwan, Gasidit1 aSaito, Nagahiro0 tRSC advances.g2013 Dec. 02, v. 4, no. 4 p.1622-1629dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra45029e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245007100175300001600246520095600262592002801218650002101246650002501267650001701292650002101309650001601330650001401346650001501360650001801375650001101393650001201404650002301416650001201439653002501451653001501476653001401491653001001505653001401515700006001529700003501589700005701624773014301681856008401824961000901908852000901917655001201926IND60612785020221121002912.0190426e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061278502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anres.2018.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumainum, Inna Martha10aFruit quality and antioxidant capacity of six Thai mango cultivars  ap. 208-214.  aFruits of six Thai mango (Mangifera indica L.) cultivars (‘Okrong’, ‘Nuan Chan’, ‘Thongdum’, ‘Namdokmai No. 4’, ‘Namdokmai Si-Thong’ and ‘Yaigrum’) were analyzed for their quality characteristics and antioxidant capacity. Sucrose was the main sugar in the mango fruit. Carotenoids were higher in ‘Thongdum’, (15 mg/100 g dry weight; DW) than other cultivars. The total flavonoids and total phenolics were in the ranges 33–67 mg/100 g DW and 8–22 mg/100 g DW, respectively. The antioxidant capacity was in the range 23–68 mg/(±)-6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchromane-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivalents per⋅100 g DW and was positively correlated with the flavonoid and phenolic contents, suggesting that these compounds mainly contribute to the antioxidant activity of mango fruits. There were genotypic differences in the antioxidant contents. Thai mangoes have great potential as an antioxidant source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMangifera indica 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acarboxylic acids 3acarotenoids 3acultivars 3aflavonoids 3afruit quality 3afruits 3amangoes 3aphenolic compounds 3asucrose 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aCarotenoid 0aFlavonoid 0aMango 0aPhenolics1 aWorarad, Kanjana1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3161-77971 aV.

Until recently, a major requirement has been the availability of relatively large, well diffracting crystals, which are often challenging to obtain. However, the advent of serial crystallography and a renaissance in multi-crystal data collection methods has meant that the availability of large crystals need no longer be a limiting factor. Here, we illustrate the use of the automated MeshAndCollect protocol, which first identifies the positions of many small crystals mounted on the same sample holder and then directs the collection from the crystals of a series of partial diffraction data sets for subsequent merging and use in structure determination. MeshAndCollect can be applied to any type of micro-crystals, even if weakly diffracting. As an example, we present here the use of the technique to solve the crystal structure of the Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) Cerulean.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aautomation 3acrystal structure 3acrystallography 3acrystals 3adata collection 3afluorescent proteins1 aSantoni, Gianluca1 aZander, Ulrich1 aFoos, Nicolas1 aAumonier, Sylvain1 aGotthard, Guillaume1 aRoyant, Antoine1 aMueller-Dieckmann, Christoph1 aLeonard, Gordon0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Mar. 19, , no. 145 p.e58594-e58594dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/585943Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58594/structure-solution-fluorescent-protein-cerulean-using  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245012500177520133400302592002801636650002301664650001801687650001001705650001501715650000901730650001001739650001401749650004301763650001301806700002501819700002501844700001801869773012701887856008502014852000902099655001202108IND60703355720221121043821.0200721e20200409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070335572DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80405442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConstantin, Maria  E.10aDiminished Pathogen and Enhanced Endophyte Colonization upon CoInoculation of Endophytic and Pathogenic Fusarium Strains  aRoot colonization by Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) endophytes reduces wilt disease symptoms caused by pathogenic Fo strains. The endophytic strain Fo47, isolated from wilt suppressive soils, reduces Fusarium wilt in various crop species such as tomato, flax, and asparagus. How endophyte-mediated resistance (EMR) against Fusarium wilt is achieved is unclear. Here, nonpathogenic colonization by Fo47 and pathogenic colonization by Fo f.sp. lycopersici (Fol) strains were assessed in tomato roots and stems when inoculated separately or coinoculated. It is shown that Fo47 reduces Fol colonization in stems of both noncultivated and cultivated tomato species. Conversely, Fo47 colonization of coinoculated tomato stems was increased compared to single inoculated plants. Quantitative PCR of fungal colonization of roots (co)inoculated with Fo47 and/or Fol showed that pathogen colonization was drastically reduced when coinoculated with Fo47, compared with single inoculated roots. Endophytic colonization of tomato roots remained unchanged upon coinoculation with Fol. In conclusion, EMR against Fusarium wilt is correlated with a reduction of root and stem colonization by the pathogen. In addition, the endophyte may take advantage of the pathogen-induced suppression of plant defences as it colonizes tomato stems more extensively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3acrops 3aendophytes 3aflax 3afungi 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3atomatoes1 aVlieger, Babette  V.1 aTakken, Frank  L.

Four samples of youtiao fried with sunflower oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and palm oil, respectively, differing in fatty acid composition, were selected to be investigated. A total of thirty‐five odorants were identified, among which twenty‐two odorants were quantitated by aid of authentic chemicals and with correction of recovery coefficients. Differences in odorants composition and aroma profile were observed among the four samples of youtiao fried with different oils. However, it was demonstrated in common thirteen compounds; that is, 3‐hydroxy‐2‐butanone, 3‐methylbutanal, furfural, 3‐(methylthio)propanal, 2‐furfurylthiol, phenylacetaldehyde, 2,5‐dimethyl‐4‐hydroxy‐3(2H)‐furanone, 2‐ethyl‐3,5‐dimethylpyrazine, 3‐ethyl‐2,5‐dimethylpyrazine, (E,E)‐2,4‐decadienal, 1‐octen‐3‐ol, (E,Z)‐2,6‐nonadienal, and (E)‐2‐nonenal contributed significantly to youtiao aroma.

Here, we aim at assessing the ability of zooplankton to induce UVR tolerance and disentangle the relative importance of local adaptations behind the expression of such tolerance. Two populations of Daphnia pulex, derived from environments strongly differing in UVR conditions, were exposed to UVR for 70 d to induce production of photo‐protective compounds and changes in behavioral responses. We expected greater tolerance to UVR in individuals from the high‐UVR (H‐U) environment as well as a refuge demand inversely related to the level of pigmentation. However, the complementarity between physiological and behavioral strategies was only observed on animals from the Low‐UVR environment (L‐U). L‐U animals developed photo‐protective compounds and decreased their refuge demand when re‐exposed to UVR, that is, tolerated more UVR, compared to their control siblings. Conversely, UVR‐exposed individuals from the H‐U environment even having developed higher levels of photo‐protective compounds increased their refuge demand staying deeper in the water column compared to the control animals, likely expressing an evolutionary memory to seek refuge in deeper waters irrespective of the UVR level. Stronger changes were observed in the H‐U population compared to the L‐U population; thus, our results suggest that although changes in tolerance after UVR exposure were evident for both populations, the strength of the inductions was more related to local adaptation independently of the rearing environment, showing that UVR tolerance is dependent on the evolutionary history of each population.  aPublisher supplied data  cSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA)  cUniversidad Mayor de San Simón (GIRH project)  cSwedish Research Council 3aDaphnia pulex 3aphenotypic variation 3apigmentation 3arearing 3asiblings 3aultraviolet radiation 3azooplankton1 aCampero, Melina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7878-42611 aBianco, Giuseppe1 aEkvall, Mikael T.1 aRejas, Danny1 aUvo, Cintia B.1 aHansson, Lars‐Anders1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3035-13170 tEcosphere.g2020 Apr., v. 11, no. 4 p.e03081-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:12363x2150-89257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.30813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011300169300001600282520097900298592002801277650003401305650001401339650001901353650002501372650001801397650001201415650002301427650001201450650002001462650002201482650002101504650001601525650002101541650004401562650002001606650001401626650002101640653002501661653001901686653002601705653002501731700002001756700001901776700001601795700001801811700001701829700001801846773013101864856008701995852000902082655001202091IND60529365920221118023948.0220628e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052936592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.10.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Peng-fei10aStructure elucidation and antioxidant activity of a novel polysaccharide from Polyporus umbellatus sclerotia  ap. 411-417.  aA novel water-soluble polysaccharide PUP60S2, with a molecular weight of 1.44×10⁴Da, was obtained from the sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus by hot water extraction, ethanol precipitation, anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. PUP60S2 was a polysaccharide comprised of about 22.3% glucuronic acid. Monosaccharide composition analysis showed that PUP60S2 was only comprised of glucose and glucuronic acid. Reduction of carboxyl groups, sugar analysis, methylation analysis, together with one and two dimension NMR spectra disclosed that the backbone of PUP60S2 consisted of (1→6)-β-d-glucopyranosyl, every second of which was substituted at O-3 by side chains consisting of terminal β-d-Glcp, (1→3)-β-d-Glcp, (1→3)-β-d-GlcpA, (1→4)-β-d-Glcp and (1→4)-β-d-GlcpA units.

By using the freeze-gelation technique, living cells can be immobilized within a mechanically and chemically stable ceramic-like matrix. Due to a freeze-drying step, the embedded microorganisms are converted into a preserved form. In that way, they can be stored under dry conditions, which comply better with storage, transport, and handling requirements. Thus, in contrast to other immobilization techniques, there is no need for storage in liquid or under humid atmosphere. The biological activity, mechanical strength, and the structure of the biologically active ceramic-like composites (biocers) produced by freeze gelation have been investigated by using the phenol-degrading bacteria Rhodococcus ruber as model organism. Samples of freeze-gelation biocers have been investigated after defined storage periods, demonstrating nearly unchanged mechanical strength of the immobilization matrix as well as good storage stability of the activity of the immobilized cells over several months of storage at 4 °C. Repeated-batch tests demonstrated further that the freeze-gelation biocers can be repeatedly used over a period of more than 12 months without losing its bioactivity. Thus, these results show that freeze-gelation biocers have high potential of being scaled up from laboratory test systems to applications in real environment because of their long bioactivity as well as mechanical stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodococcus ruber 3afreezing 3aimmobilized cells 3afreeze drying 3abioactive properties 3alaboratory techniques 3abioremediation 3abiofilters 3amicroorganisms 3astorage quality 3astorage time 3agelation 2aCells, Immobilizedxmetabolism 2aFiltrationxmethods 2aFreeze Drying 2aGels 2aPhenolxmetabolism 2aRhodococcusxmetabolism 0aatmosphere1 aMkandawire, Martin1 aSoltmann, Ulrich1 aPompe, Wolfgang1 aBöttcher, Horst,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Feb., v. 93, no. 4 p.1755-1767dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3489-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03602naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008100198300001800279500002000297520217500317592002802492650001702520650002102537650002402558650003102582650001302613650001802626650001102644650000902655650001602664650001002680650001202690651001402702700001802716700006002734700002502794700001802819700002102837700001702858700002002875700001902895773013602914856007303050852000903123655001203132IND60620627520221118050103.0181114e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062062752DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.127982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurley, Hugh M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0992-658510aPrimary productivity is related to niche width in the Australian Wet Tropics  ap. 1300-1313.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: A key ecological debate is whether ecosystem functions are distinctly influenced by biological diversity across broad scales. Although recent work has emphasized the importance of links between ecosystem functions and measures of ecological specialization as proxies of biodiversity, few studies have analysed macroecological relationships empirically in diverse environments. We tested whether gross primary productivity (GPP) in the Australian Wet Tropics (WT) was distinctly related to community‐level measures of the ecological specialization of component tree species across climate space, after accounting for climate drivers. LOCATION: Wet Tropics, Australia. TIME PERIOD: 1976–2012. MAJOR TAXA STUDIED: Nine hundred and forty‐eight WT tree species. METHODS: Using all geographically valid herbarium records for WT trees, we quantified the realized climatic niche widths using continental surfaces for maximum temperature of the warmest period and total annual rainfall. The median realized niche width for all tree species occurring at 510 sites was used to approximate ecological specialization within communities. To separate climatic effects on GPP, we applied a novel analysis using the difference in GPP and the difference in median community realized niche width between site pairs with similar climatic conditions. Linear models were then run on the difference in GPP between site pairs (response) and the difference in climatic niche widths (predictor). RESULTS: For climatically similar sites in drier areas, GPP was higher in sites composed of species with narrower temperature niches (average R² = 0.087, average t‐statistic = −3.45). Conversely, for climatically similar sites in drier areas, GPP was lower in sites composed of species with narrower rainfall niches (average R² = 0.171, average t‐statistic = 5.06). MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Wet Tropics sites with more thermal specialists had higher productivity, whereas sites with more moisture specialists had lower productivity. These findings suggest that physiological specialization across climate space can influence primary productivity at broad scales, but in inconsistent ways.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aclimatic factors 3aecological function 3agross primary productivity 3aherbaria 3alinear models 3aniches 3arain 3atemperature 3atrees 3atropics 3aAustralia1 aMokany, Karel1 aLaffan, Shawn W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5996-05701 aWilliams, Kristen J.1 aMetcalfe, Dan1 aMurphy, Helen T.1 aFord, Andrew1 aHarwood, Tom D.1 aFerrier, Simon0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2018 Nov., v. 27, no. 11 p.1300-1313dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3920180x1466-822X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.127983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03990naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002300169245007400192300001500266520306900281592002803350653002503378653002403403653002603427653001703453653001603470700002003486773006803506856011703574852000903691655001203700IND60125713220221119063419.0150428e200202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012571322DNAL7 a10.1650/0010-5422(2002)104[0092:DVAPIO]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUnderwood, Todd J.10aDemographic variables are poor indicators of wood thrush productivity  ap. 92-102.  aAbstractWe tested the ability of 29 indices of productivity to predict and track actual productivity of a Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) population for 21 years and to detect year-to-year changes in that productivity. Of 29 indices tested, only the productivity of nests initiated in May showed promise. This index reasonably predicted productivity, correctly tracked two out of three temporal trends in productivity, and detected a significant proportion of year-to-year changes in actual productivity. Although they were not useful for predicting annual productivity, other indices based on nest data tracked trends in productivity moderately well, and all, except percent nest success, detected a significant proportion of year-to-year changes in productivity. Productivity indices based on non-reproductive variables, such as abundance of males or females, return rates, and veteran:novice ratios, did not reflect productivity trends or changes. From these results, we recommend that only an intensive measure of actual productivity or a partial measure of it, such as May productivity, be used to make inferences about annual productivity of a population. Indices based on other nest data should be used only for tracking productivity trends. Non-reproductive indices are unreliable for making any inferences about productivity.Las Variables Demográáficas son Malas Indicadoras de la Productividad de Hylocichla mustelinaResumen.  Pusimos a prueba la capacidad de 29 ííndices de productividad para predecir y seguir las variaciones anuales en la productividad real de una poblacióón de Hylocichla mustelina por un perííodo de 21 años. De los 29 ííndices probados, sóólo el de la productividad de los nidos iniciados en mayo resultóó promisorio. Este ííndice predijo la productividad razonablemente bien y detectóó correctamente dos de tres tendencias temporales en la productividad y una proporcióón significativa de los cambios anuales en la productividad real. Aunque no fueron úútiles para predecir la productividad anual, otros ííndices basados en datos de nidos siguieron las tendencias en la productividad aceptablemente bien. Con excepcióón del porcentaje de nidos exitosos, todos estos ííndices detectaron una proporcióón significativa de las variaciones anuales de la productividad. Por su parte, los ííndices de productividad basados en variables no reproductivas como la abundancia de machos y hembras, las tasas de regreso y el cociente de aves veteranas: novatas no reflejaron las tendencias o cambios en la productividad real. Con base en estos resultados recomendamos que para hacer inferencias sobre la productividad anual de una poblacióón sóólo se utilice una medida intensiva de la productividad, o una medida parcial de éésta (i.e., la productividad en mayo). Los ííndices basados en otros datos de nidos deben ser utilizados úúnicamente para monitorear las tendencias en la productividad. Los ííndices no reproductivos son poco confiables para hacer inferencias sobre la productividad.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHylocichla mustelina 0aNeotropical migrant 0apopulation monitoring 0aproductivity 0aWood Thrush1 aRoth, Roland R.0 tThe Condor.g2002 Feb., v. 104, no. 1 p.92-102x1938-54227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1650%2F0010-5422%282002%29104%5B0092%3ADVAPIO%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245010200171300001600273520179900289592002802088650001702116650001102133650001102144650002102155650001602176650002202192650002302214650001102237650003002248651001002278653003702288653002602325653002802351653002702379653001402406700001602420773011902436856008802555852000902643655001202652IND60628232620221116145539.0190404e20190410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062823262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.4202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Jianhui10aSpatiotemporal evolution and driving factors of fertilizer reduction control in Zhejiang Province  ap. 650-659.  aFacing the non-point source pollution caused by fertilizer loss, study on the agricultural factors that have an influence on fertilizer reduction could provide a basis for the implementation of policies on fertilizer reduction control. Based on the panel data during 2002–2016 with cumulative contribution model and Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI), this paper innovatively comes up with reduction driving functions (including agricultural scale, intensification, fertilizer utilization, and labor productivity), studies the cumulative contribution rate and driving factors of fertilizer reduction in county units of Zhejiang Province. Main conclusions are: (1) 37 of 63 county units (58.73%) showed decreased in fertilizer application; top five county units contributed 50+%; top county units that contribute to fertilizer reduction are in plain area in Northern Zhejiang, coastal area in Eastern and Southern Zhejiang, valley and basin area in Western and Southern Zhejiang where arable land is relatively even. (2) Fertilizer application intensity (fertilizer application per unit area of land cultivation) in Zhejiang Province increased by 18.67%, but there are only 15 county units where fertilizer application intensity is reduced. In general, fertilizer reduction in Zhejiang Province kept developing steadily. (3) Factors (fertilizer efficiency, intensification and agricultural scale) drive fertilizer reduction while labor productivity triggers the growth in application intensity. In Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing in Northern and Eastern Zhejiang, the above factors all have a prominent driving effect, but labor productivity also promotes fertilizer increment. In the end, this paper proposes policies on fertilizer reduction control in terms of efficiency, inputs and compensations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarable soils 3abasins 3acoasts 3afertilizer rates 3afertilizers 3aissues and policy 3alabor productivity 3amodels 3anonpoint source pollution 3aChina 0aFertilizer application intensity 0aCoupling relationship 0aCumulative contribution 0aLog-Mean Divisia Index 0aReduction1 aLin, Yaoben0 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 660 p.650-659dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.4203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02413naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001700135245008200152300001500234520122200249592002801471650002201499650001001521650001701531650001201548650001701560650003101577650001701608650001301625650001401638700002201652700001901674773015201693856006901845856009301914990002302007852000902030655001202039IND60644386420221117052117.0190516e20181120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064438642DNAL7 a10.3791/585702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrespo, Rosa10aIn Vitro assay for studying the aggregation of tau protein and drug screening  ap. e58570.  aAggregation of tau protein and formation of paired helical filaments is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Compared to other proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, the reported in vitro aggregation kinetics for tau protein are less consistent presenting a relatively high variability. Here we describe the development of an in vitro aggregation assay that mimics the expected steps associated with tau misfolding and aggregation in vivo. The assay uses the longest tau isoform (huTau441) which contains both N-terminal acidic inserts as well as four microtubule binding domains (MBD). The in vitro aggregation is triggered by addition of heparin and followed continuously by thioflavin T fluorescence in a 96 well microplate format. The tau aggregation assay is highly reproducible between different wells, experimental runs and batches of the protein. The aggregation leads to tau PHF-like morphology which is very efficient in seeding the formation of de novo fibrillar structures. In addition to its application in studying the mechanism of tau misfolding and aggregation, the current assay is a robust tool for screening drugs that could interfere with the pathogenesis of tau.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3adrugs 3afluorescence 3aheparin 3amicrotubules 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apathogenesis 3aproteins 3ascreening1 aKoudstaal, Wouter1 aApetri, Adrian0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Nov. 20, , no. 141 p.e58570-e58570dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/585703Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58570/in-vitro-assay-for-studying-aggregation-tau-protein-drug  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002500151245011600176520154900292592002801841650002801869650002101897650002801918650001001946650001401956650002001970650001701990700002402007773012702031856008502158852000902243655001202252IND60703352720221121224011.0200721e20200404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070335272DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80405152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteingruber, Mirjam 14aThe Cytomegalovirus Protein Kinase pUL97: Host Interactions, Regulatory Mechanisms and Antiviral Drug Targeting  aHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) expresses a variety of viral regulatory proteins that undergo close interaction with host factors including viral-cellular multiprotein complexes. The HCMV protein kinase pUL97 represents a viral cyclin-dependent kinase ortholog (vCDK) that determines the efficiency of HCMV replication via phosphorylation of viral and cellular substrates. A hierarchy of functional importance of individual pUL97-mediated phosphorylation events has been discussed; however, the most pronounced pUL97-dependent phenotype could be assigned to viral nuclear egress, as illustrated by deletion of the UL97 gene or pharmacological pUL97 inhibition. Despite earlier data pointing to a cyclin-independent functionality, experimental evidence increasingly emphasized the role of pUL97-cyclin complexes. Consequently, the knowledge about pUL97 involvement in host interaction, viral nuclear egress and additional replicative steps led to the postulation of pUL97 as an antiviral target. Indeed, validation experiments in vitro and in vivo confirmed the sustainability of this approach. Consequently, current investigations of pUL97 in antiviral treatment go beyond the known pUL97-mediated ganciclovir prodrug activation and henceforward include pUL97-specific kinase inhibitors. Among a number of interesting small molecules analyzed in experimental and preclinical stages, maribavir is presently investigated in clinical studies and, in the near future, might represent a first kinase inhibitor applied in the field of antiviral therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHuman betaherpesvirus 5 3aantiviral agents 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3agenes 3aphenotype 3aphosphorylation 3atherapeutics1 aMarschall, Manfred 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Apr. 04, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80405153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013700166300001800303520124200321592002801563650001501591650002801606650001001634650002001644650002001664650001501684650001101699700001901710700001801729700001901747700002101766773012601787856008201913852000901995655001202004IND60743437220221116181617.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074343722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02818-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolajou, Amir10aOptimal Design and Feature Selection by Genetic Algorithm for Emotional Artificial Neural Network (EANN) in Rainfall-Runoff Modeling  ap. 2369-2384.  aRainfall-runoff (r-r) modeling at different time scales is considered as a significant issue in hydro-environmental planning. As a first hydrological implementation, for one-time-ahead r-r modeling of two watersheds with totally distinct climatic conditions, Genetic Algorithm (GA, as a global search technique) and Emotional Artificial Neural Network (EANN, as a new production of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based methods that simulated based on the brain neurophysiological structure) was combined. Determining the optimal architecture of AI-based networks is vital for increasing the accuracy of prediction by the network and also to reduce run-time. In the current study, GA has been implemented to choose the important features candidate as EANN input and automatically diagnose the optimal number of hidden nodes and hormones simultaneously. The acquired results indicated a better representation of the proposed hybrid GA-EANN model compared to the sole ANN and EANN. Numerical identification of obtained results revealed that the proposed hybrid GA-EANN model might enhance the better results than the EANN model up to 19% and 35% in terms of testing suitability criteria for Aji Chai and Murrumbidgee catchments, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3abrain 3aneural networks 3aneurophysiology 3aprediction 3arunoff1 aNourani, Vahid1 aAfshar, Abbas1 aKhosravi, Mina1 aBrysiewicz, Adam0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2369-2384dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02818-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03231naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005300147245008100200300001600281506011700297506007600414520130900490592002801799506003701827650001501864650001901879650001501898650001001913650004001923650002301963650001301986650001101999650002202010650000902032650001402041650001302055650001302068650002002081650001502101650002402116653003602140653001502176653001902191653002402210653001402234700005402248700005202302700005502354700005202409773012502461856008202586852000902668655001202677IND60729105120221207045852.0220621e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072910512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gpb.2019.11.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8120-940910aSPA: A Quantitation Strategy for MS Data in Patient-derived Xenograft Models  ap. 522-533.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWith the development of mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics technologies, patient-derived xenograft (PDX), which is generated from the primary tumor of a patient, is widely used for the proteome-wide analysis of cancer mechanism and biomarker identification of a drug. However, the proteomics data interpretation is still challenging due to complex data deconvolution from the PDX sample that is a cross-species mixture of human cancerous tissues and immunodeficient mouse tissues. In this study, by using the lab-assembled mixture of human and mouse cells with different mixing ratios as a benchmark, we developed and evaluated a new method, SPA (shared peptide allocation), for protein quantitation by considering the unique and shared peptides of both species. The results showed that SPA could provide more convenient and accurate protein quantitation in human–mouse mixed samples. Further validation on a pair of gastric PDX samples (one bearing FGFR2 amplification while the other one not) showed that our new method not only significantly improved the overall protein identification, but also detected the differential phosphorylation of FGFR2 and its downstream mediators (such as RAS and ERK) exclusively.

S.10aFictitious Component Free - Pressure Deficient Network Algorithm for Water Distribution Network with Variable Minimum and Required Pressure-Heads  ap. 2585-2600.  aThe pressure-driven analysis is essential for modelling the pressure deficient condition of water distribution networks. Owing to the complexity, the development of pressure-driven analysis algorithms remains a grey area over the past few decades. As a milestone, EPANET 2.0 got upgraded to EPANET 2.2 with the inclusion of pressure-driven analysis. However, EPANET 2.2 has a shortcoming of using only a single value for the parameters, minimum pressure-head and required pressure-head of the demand nodes. Ironically, when a water distribution network serves for a wide area or during a fire-fighting period, the demand nodes have variable values for each of these parameters. To address this, a new method named Fictitious Component Free - Pressure Deficient Network Algorithm (FCF-PDNA) is proposed in this paper. The FCF-PDNA does not require any additional fictitious components. It can be used for both steady-state and extended period simulations. The proposed method is applied to water distribution networks of different sizes and types and confirmed that the FCF-PDNA could deal with variable values of minimum and required pressure-head. The suitability of this method for different scenarios that will lead to pressure deficient conditions is also analysed and verified. Moreover, the computational time taken by the FCF-PDNA and the EPANET 2.2 pressure-driven analysis is similar.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aalgorithms 3afire fighting 3awater 3awater distribution0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2585-2600dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02852-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245007800167300001300245520148800258592002801746650002201774650001801796650002201814650001901836650001001855650001301865650001501878650001401893650001501907651001501922651000901937651001101946653001501957653002801972653002802000653003202028700002302060773013002083856008302213852000902296655001202305IND60637122420221120102807.0190416e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063712242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijgfs.2018.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOktay, Serdar10aGastronomic cultural impacts of Russian, Azerbaijani and Iranian cuisines  ap. 6-13.  aThe present day Russia, Azerbaijan and Iranian lands have been home to many empires and civilizations for centuries past. People of these countries have long been influenced by each other's gastronomic cultures due to their neighborhood and commercial ties. They have transferred some foods and traditions to their own country's culinary culture. Foods, materials, methods and traditions used in the cuisines are sometimes different and sometimes similar to each other. The similar foods mentioned here are understandably due to the fact that countries were under the rule of the same civilization in ancient times and old times. Although the languages of the countries are different, the names of similar foods are reminiscent of each other. The different food and culinary traditions have been found to originate from local traditions. There are many different societies in the world and a wide range of cultural features belonging to these societies. Food and culinary culture are also among the important cultural heritages that reveal the identities of communities, lifestyles, eating habits and authenticity. Over the last century, great advances have been made in food preservation, storage, production and shipping. For these reasons, traditional culinary cultures of countries have started to spread more easily. In this research we have studied the influenced gastronomic cultures of Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran, which have been living together for many years as neighbors.  aPublisher supplied data 3acultural heritage 3aeating habits 3afood preservation 3afood transport 3afoods 3afoodways 3agastronomy 3alifestyle 3atraditions 3aAzerbaijan 3aIran 3aRussia 0aGastronomy 0aIranian cuisine culture 0aRussian cuisine culture 0aAzerbaijani cuisine culture1 aSadıkoğlu, Saide0 tInternational journal of gastronomy and food science.g2018 July, v. 12 p.6-13dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21450x1878-450X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijgfs.2018.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02900naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003400092040001800126100002400144245012300168300001400291520157700305592002801882650001701910650001401927650001801941650002001959650001201979650002601991650000902017650002102026650001602047653001802063653002502081653003002106653001302136700002102149700002502170700002202195700001802217700002002235773012102255856008102376852000902457655001202466IND4472088620221121065201.0181115e201202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447208862DNAL7 a10.1177/19414064114298472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrenckpohl, Douglas12aA Randomized Trial of Micropreemies Receiving Higher Amounts of Intravenous Fat Emulsion During the First Week of Life  ap. 58-66.  aObjective. The goal of this study was to determine if micropreemies could tolerate higher infusion rates of intravenous fat emulsions (IVFEs) during the first week of life by maintaining their serum triglyceride levels at <200 mg/dL. Methods. This was a randomized controlled trial of 19 infants who were classified as appropriate for gestational age and had birth weights between 500 and 750 g. The primary clinical outcome was serum triglyceride levels; secondary outcomes also were monitored. Results. A total of 19 micropreemies completed the study (experimental group: n = 10; control group: n = 9). Of the infants in the experimental group, 100% had developed hypertriglyceridemia (>201 g/dL) during the first week of life compared with only 44.4% of the infants in the control group. The experimental group experienced a lower weight loss of 8.6% ± 3.10% as compared with 16.22% ± 8.04% in the control group during the first week of life. Initially, the experimental group was given significantly higher infusion rates of IVFEs, but at the end of the week, the control group was receiving significantly higher infusion rates of IVFEs. Calorie intake was significantly better initially for the experimental group, but because of the incidences of hypertriglyceridemia and a reduction of IVFEs, the control group had significantly better calorie intake at the end of the study period. Conclusions. Micropreemies do not tolerate initial higher infusion rates of IVFEs during the first week of life because of their potential risk for developing hypertriglyceridemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3aemulsions 3aenergy intake 3agestational age 3ainfants 3aintravenous injection 3arisk 3atriacylglycerols 3aweight loss 0amicropreemies 0ahypertriglyceridemia 0aintravenous fat emulsions 0acalories1 aNiehaus, Matthew1 aSchneider, Catherine1 aMcConnell, Connie1 aWang, Huaping1 aMacwan, Kamlesh0 tInfant, child & adolescent nutrition.g, v. 4, no. 1 p.58-66dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000000085x1941-40727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/19414064114298473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005700139245013400196300001600330500001400346500002000360520152500380592002801905596006901933596006902002650001802071650001402089650002302103650001002126650002402136650001502160650001502175650001302190650002202203650002002225650001002245700001302255700001202268700001902280700001402299700001602313700005202329700001402381773013102395856007302526852000902599655001202608IND60694775920221120042842.0200514e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069477592DNAL7 a10.1111/rda.136262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRan, Maoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1688-546X10amiR‐362 knock‐down promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in porcine immature Sertoli cells by targeting the RMI1 gene  ap. 547-558.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aImmature Sertoli cell proliferation determines the total number of mature Sertoli cells and further regulates normal spermatogenesis. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that microRNAs (miRNAs) play regulatory roles in immature Sertoli cell proliferation, while the functions and mechanisms of the Sertoli cells of domestic animals are poorly understood. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the roles of miR‐362 in cell proliferation and apoptosis of porcine immature Sertoli cells. The results showed that miR‐362 inhibition promoted the entrance of cells into the S phase and increased the expressions of cell cycle‐related genes c‐MYC, CNNE1, CCND1 and CDK4. Knock‐down of miR‐362 also promoted cell proliferation and inhibited apoptosis, which was demonstrated by the results from cell counting kit‐8 (CCK‐8), 5‐ethynyl‐2′‐deoxyuridine (EdU) and Annexin V‐FITC/PI staining assays. The recQ‐mediated genome instability protein 1 (RMI1) gene was identified as a potential target gene of miR‐362 via luciferase reporter assay, and miR‐362 repressed the protein expression of RMI1 in porcine immature Sertoli cells. siRNA‐induced RMI1 knock‐down further abolished the effects of miR‐362 inhibition on porcine immature Sertoli cells. Collectively, we concluded that miR‐362 knock‐down promotes proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in porcine immature Sertoli cells by targeting the RMI1 gene, which indicates that miR‐362 determines the fate of immature Sertoli cells.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018JJ3219cHunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China  a2018JJ2176cHunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China 3aSertoli cells 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3agenes 3agenetic instability 3ainterphase 3aluciferase 3amicroRNA 3aprotein synthesis 3aspermatogenesis 3aswine1 aLuo, Hui1 aGao, Hu1 aTang, Xiangwei1 aChen, Yao1 aZeng, Xinyu1 aWeng, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6498-01221 aChen, Bin0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2020 May, v. 55, no. 5 p.547-558dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44391x0936-67687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rda.136263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02128naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009300164300001800257520093200275592002801207596010001235596007201335650003001407650001201437650001101449650001001460650002301470700001201493700001801505700001801523700002001541773012601561856008201687852000901769655001201778IND60743437520221116181820.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074343752DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02793-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Tianwei10aRandom Walks Partitioning and Network Reliability Assessing in Water Distribution System  ap. 2325-2341.  aA novel network partition model is presented within the water distribution system (WDS). Firstly, random walk community detection (RWCD) is employed to divide WDS into different partitions concerning the average pressure of nodes. Then, network reliability is assessed based on hydraulic reliability estimation (HRE), mechanical reliability estimation (MRE), flow entropy function (FEF), and network resilience (NR), via optimizing boundary pipes by the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II). Finally, pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are set to pipes for acquiring optimized partitions. The Open Water Analytics (OWA) toolbox and Matlab-2018b is adopted as a hydraulic calculation tool for these extended period simulations (EPS). Seven cases of WDSs were used to verify the practicability of this model. The results demonstrate that network reliability is improved effectively after partitioning and optimizing.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014ZX07406-003cMajor Science and Technology Program for Water Pollution Control and Treatment  aKJYY20170413170501147cShenzhen Science and Technology Plan Program 3aadministrative management 3aentropy 3amodels 3awater 3awater distribution1 aLu, Yan1 aTan, Haoqiang1 aZhang, Haowen1 aZheng, Chengzhi0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2325-2341dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02793-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03125naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012300165300001800288520173900306592002802045650002402073650002202097650001602119650002202135650002402157650002302181650002102204650001002225650001202235650001002247650001502257650001602272650002302288650002302311650001702334650002002351650001402371650001302385650001002398700002102408700001802429700002002447773008602467856008102553852000902634655001202643IND60340700520221119032447.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034070052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-015-1442-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlszyk, David10aGlyphosate and dicamba herbicide tank mixture effects on native plant and non-genetically engineered soybean seedlings  ap. 1014-1027.  aCrops engineered to contain genes for tolerance to multiple herbicides may be treated with several herbicides to manage weeds resistant to each herbicide. Thus, nearby non-target plants may be subjected to increased exposure to several herbicides used in combination. Of particular concern are native plants, as well as adjacent crops which have not been genetically engineered for tolerance to herbicides. We evaluated responses of seven species of native plants grown in a greenhouse and treated less than field application rates of glyphosate and/or dicamba: Andropogon gerardii, Asclepias syriaca, Eutrochium purpureum, Oenothera biennis, Polyganum lapathifolium, Solidago canadensis and Tridens flavus, and non-herbicide resistant soybean (Glycine max, Oregon line M4). Herbicide concentrations were 0.03 or 0.1 × field application rates of 1122 g ha⁻¹ active ingredient (a.i) (831 g ha⁻¹ acid glyphosate) for glyphosate and 562 g ha⁻¹ a.i. for dicamba. In general, plant growth responses to combinations of glyphosate and dicamba were less than the sum of growth responses to the individual herbicides (i.e., antagonistic effect), primarily when one or both herbicides alone caused a large reduction in growth. E. purpureum, P. lapathifolium and S. canadensis were the most sensitive species to both herbicides, while A. gerardii was the most tolerant, with no response to either herbicide. The combinations of herbicides resulted in responses most similar to that from dicamba alone for G. max and from glyphosate alone for T. flavus. The results of this study indicated the need for more data such as effects on native plants in the field to assess risks to non-target plants from combinations of herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAndropogon gerardii 3aAsclepias syriaca 3aGlycine max 3aOenothera biennis 3aSolidago canadensis 3aactive ingredients 3aapplication rate 3acrops 3adicamba 3agenes 3aglyphosate 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3aindigenous species 3aplant growth 3arisk assessment 3aseedlings 3asoybeans 3aweeds1 aPfleeger, Thomas1 aLee, E.

Based on modified water footprint (WF) calculations for corn cultivation in China, WUE indices of water productivity (WP) and water efficiency (WE) for production capacity and the effective ratio of water resources were developed and quantified in the current study. Approaches to achieving national productive and effective improvements concurrently were sought by determining the spatial-temporal patterns and determinants of WP and WE during 1996–2015. The results show that the annual crop WF was estimated at 197.3 m³, including 14.1 % blue, 62.4 % green and 23.4 % gray components. WP and WE were calculated as 0.781 kg/m³ and 0.687, respectively, both of which increased over time in all subregions. Both WP and WE showed obvious spatial differences in the observed period. Low-value provinces were concentrated in the northwest and on the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, and most high-value regions were distributed in the southeastern coastal zone. Agricultural production technology improvements contributed to WF reductions in specific areas, while meteorological elements and planting structure were the main factors affecting the spatial distribution of WP and WE. WF suppression in northwestern China and expansion of the production scale in southern China were conducive to increasing productive and effective agricultural water resource use in corn cultivation nationally. Agricultural production technology progress and crop spatial arrangement optimization are equally important to agricultural WUE enhancement in the WF framework.  aPublisher supplied data  a51979074cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aB200202095cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 3aadministrative management 3aannuals 3acoasts 3acorn 3afood security 3aproduction technology 3awater 3awater footprint 3awater use efficiency 3aChina1 aXiao, Jianfeng1 aWu, Mengyang1 aZeng, Wen1 aHuang, Xuan0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2519-2535dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02845-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03561naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006600149245016300215500002200378520216800400592002802568650002002596650001302616650001902629650001302648650001602661650001502677650002502692650001502717651001102732653002602743653004302769653002202812653003302834700002902867700002602896700003302922700001802955773010702973856005003080852000903130655001203139IND60795620520221119064229.0221004e20220929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079562052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsase.2022.1008442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOldoni, Lucas Volochen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4434-346510aGeometric accuracy assessment and a framework for automatic sub-pixel registration of WFI images from CBERS-4, CBERS-4A, and Amazonia-1 satellites over Brazil  aPre-press version  aBrazil faces the challenge of conciliating food production with natural vegetation preservation, and the government has been investing in Earth Observation satellites to assist in this task. In this context, images from the Wide-Field Imager (WFI) sensor onboard the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4), CBERS-4A, and Amazonia-1 have been used in remote sensing applications in Brazil. However, the geometric accuracy of the WFI data has not yet been documented in the literature, as it was done for other satellites/sensors such as TERRA/MODIS, Landsat-8/OLI, and Sentinel-2/MSI. This work presents the first study to assess the geometric accuracy of WFI images along different spectral channels, from multi-temporal images, and taking Sentinel-2/MSI images as a reference. Surface reflectance WFI images, Level-4 (orthorectified) with spatial resolution of 55 m (CBERS-4A) and 64 m (CBERS-4 and Amazonia-1) were analyzed. Thousands of control points (CPs) were used to quantify the geometric accuracy of more than 300 WFI images and to construct multiple mapping functions to correct the displacements found. The NIR band was taken as a reference in the inter-channel (band-to-band) registration evaluation. In this case, all tiles had an RMSE average of fewer than 0.44 pixels. For the multi-temporal case, the CBERS-4A/WFI had the highest average RMSE (0.87 ± 0.34 pixels). Considering the Sentinel-2/MSI as a reference, there were observed shifts up to 1.45 pixels for CBERS-4/WFI and Amazonia-1/WFI and 2.5 pixels for CBERS-4A/WFI. Given the displacements found, image registration is needed for further time series analysis of WFI images for several applications that requiring precise sub-pixel registration (i.e., land use cover change). As a result, we propose a framework for the automatic registration of WFI images to properly foster the use of WFI images. This framework substantially reduced the misregistrations, decreasing the RMSE average to less than 0.29 pixels for the WFI images from the three satellites. The use of the 2nd degree polynomial as a mapping function proved to be appropriate for registering the WFI data.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood production 3ageometry 3aimage analysis 3aland use 3areflectance 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3avegetation 3aBrazil 0aMulti-sensor approach 0aBrazilian earth observation satellites 0aWide-field imager 0aSatellite images time series1 aDel’Arco Sanches, Ieda1 aPicoli, Michelle C.A.1 aRohden Prudente, Victor Hugo1 aAdami, Marcos0 tRemote sensing applications.g2022 Sept. 29,  p.100844-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23329x2352-93857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsase.2022.100844  aDNAL 7aarticle03648naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245014800171300001800319520191700337592002802254650001102282650002302293650001802316650003102334650001202365650001202377650001602389650001502405650001602420650001902436650002302455650002202478650002102500650001902521650002702540650001302567650001502580650001102595650001302606650001102619650002102630650002002651650001402671650001602685650001602701650001702717700002202734700002002756700002602776700002502802700002002827700002302847773008602870856008102956852000903037655001203046IND60340700720221119032307.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034070072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10646-015-1444-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Faveri, Caroline10aEffects of eutrophic seawater and temperature on the physiology and morphology of Hypnea musciformis J.

It also synthesizes substances with antiviral, anti-helminthic and anti-inflammatory potential and shows promise for use as a bioindicator of cadmium. In this study, we investigated the combined effects of seawater from three urbanized areas (area 1: natural runoff, NRA; area 2: urbanized runoff and sewage with treatment, RTA; area 3: urbanized runoff and untreated sewage, RUS) and three different temperatures (15, 25 and 30 °C) on the growth rate, photosynthetic efficiency, photosynthetic pigments and cell morphology of H. musciformis. After 4 days (96 h) of culture, the biomass of H. musciformis showed differences that fluctuated among the areas and temperature treatments. Specifically, the specimens cultivated in 35 °C had low values of ETRₘₐₓ, αETR, βETR, and F ᵥ/F ₘ photosynthetic parameters, as well as changes in cell morphology, with reduction in photosynthetic pigments and drastic reduction in growth rates. When combined with the extreme temperatures, high concentrations of ammonium ion in seawater effluent caused an inhibition of photosynthetic activity, as well as significant variation in chlorophyll a and carotenoid contents. As observed by light microscopy, the synergism between different temperatures and pollutants found in eutrophic waters caused changes in cellular morphology with increased cell wall thickening and decreased floridean starch grains. H. musciformis also showed important changes in physiological response to each factor independently, as well as changes resulting from the synergistic interaction of these factors combined. Therefore, we can conclude that extreme temperature combined with the effect of eutrophic waters, especially RUS, caused distinct morphological and physiological changes in the red alga H. musciformis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypnea 3aammonium compounds 3aanthelmintics 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acarotenoids 3acell walls 3achlorophyll 3aeutrophication 3agrowth retardation 3akappa carrageenan 3alight microscopy 3aphotosynthesis 3aphysiological response 3apigments 3apollutants 3arunoff 3aseawater 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3astarch granules 3asynergism 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3aurbanization1 aSchmidt, Éder C.1 aSimioni, Carmem1 aMartins, Cintia D.

Adverse effects may occur at other developmental stages, e.g. embryo development, hatching or growth. The species Enchytraeus crypticus is a model organism in the standard soil ecotoxicology test, where survival and reproduction are assessed. In the present study we optimized the test method to include additional endpoints. The proposed test started with synchronized age organisms’, and included additionally hatching success, growth, maturation status and full life cycle. This allowed for the calculation of cocoon production and population growth rate. Results indicated that Cd is embryotoxic, main effect occurs on the embryo developmental stage and maturity. Further, the full life cycle test can discriminate between pre- and post-embryo formation.

Lateral inflow is the recharge of groundwater to surface water during a river flood; this recharge is part of the GW-SW exchange. Hydrological engineers proposed the idea of modelling flood routing using the Muskingum-Cunge method, in which the GW-SW exchange is not fully considered. This study proposes an improved nonlinear Muskingum-Cunge flood routing model that considers lateral inflow; the new method is denoted as NMCL1 and NMCL2 and can simulate flood routing and calculate the GW-SW exchange. In addition, both the linear and nonlinear lateral inflows (with the channel inflows) are discussed, and the stable lateral inflows that occur due to the GW-SW exchange are considered for the first time. A sensitivity analysis shows that different parameters have different effects on the simulation results. Three different flood cases documented in the literature are selected to compare the four classical and two updated Muskingum-Cunge methods. Two different floods of the River Wye are selected to verify the accuracy of the calibrated model. The simulation results of the improved Muskingum-Cunge method are compared with the temperature inversion results measured from the Zhongtian River, China, to indicate the feasibility and reliability of the improved method. A comparison shows that, for several cases, the proposed method is capable of obtaining optimal simulation results. The proposed method inherits the ability of the Maskingum-Cunge method to simulate flood routing. Moreover, it can quantify the GW-SW exchange, and the reliability of the estimations is owed to the nonlinearity and sign flexibility of the calculated exchange process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3agroundwater 3amodels 3arivers 3arunoff 3asurface water 3atemperature inversion 3aChina1 aJi, Keyan1 aWang, Wanjie1 aZhang, Yong1 aEalotswe, Tema Koketso1 aQin, Wei1 aLu, Jiayun1 aLiu, Bo1 aShu, Longcang0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2649-2666dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02857-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02158naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001700159245012000176300001400296520098200310592002801292650002601320650002601346650002001372650002301392650001301415653002801428653002201456653001001478653001401488653001901502700002001521700005601541773009701597856009301694852000901787655001201796IND60556878020221120042608.0161102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055687802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Kai-Wei10aPoly[(R)3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB)/poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) blends with poly(PHB/PLLA urethane) as a compatibilizer  ap. 30-40.  aPoly(PHB/PLLA urethane) (poly(ester urethane), PEU) was synthesized with telechelic poly[(R)3-hydroxybutyrate]-diol (PHB-diol) and poly(l-lactic acid)-diol (PLLA-diol). The miscibility of cast PHB/PLLA blends was enhanced by adding PEU as a compatibilizer, as observed by DSC, WAXS, SAXS, alkaline solution etching test and mechanical properties measurement. It is shown that the crystalline unit cells of PHB and PLLA didn't interfere with each other and the biphasic separation was kept in the blends with PEU. However, the miscibility of PHB/PLLA in the amorphous phase of the blends was improved due to the presence of PEU. The changes of their thermal properties and morphology of the phase boundaries indicated the enhanced miscibility of PHB/PLLA blends by adding PEU. The mechanical properties of PHB/PLLA blends with PEU were amended due to the better entangled amorphous polymer chains. The results demonstrated that PEU was a good compatibilizer for PHB/PLLA blends.  aPublisher supplied data 3a3-hydroxybutyric acid 3amechanical properties 3apolylactic acid 3athermal properties 3aurethane 0aPoly(3-hydroxybutyrate) 0aPoly(lactic acid) 0aBlend 0aBio-based 0aCompatibilizer1 aLan, Ching-Hung1 aSun, Yi-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7779-87140 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2016 Dec., v. 134 p.30-40dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02619naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245014200155520155800297592002801855650002301883650001501906650001401921650001601935650002001951650001501971650002401986650001902010650001102029700001402040700001502054773012902069856007402198852000902272655001202281IND60677825520221116231346.0191213e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067782552DNAL7 a10.3390/rs112328582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCi, Tianyu10aAssessment of the Degree of Building Damage Caused by Disaster Using Convolutional Neural Networks in Combination with Ordinal Regression  aWe propose a new convolutional neural networks method in combination with ordinal regression aiming at assessing the degree of building damage caused by earthquakes with aerial imagery. The ordinal regression model and a deep learning algorithm are incorporated to make full use of the information to improve the accuracy of the assessment. A new loss function was introduced in this paper to combine convolutional neural networks and ordinal regression. Assessing the level of damage to buildings can be considered as equivalent to predicting the ordered labels of buildings to be assessed. In the existing research, the problem has usually been simplified as a problem of pure classification to be further studied and discussed, which ignores the ordinal relationship between different levels of damage, resulting in a waste of information. Data accumulated throughout history are used to build network models for assessing the level of damage, and models for assessing levels of damage to buildings based on deep learning are described in detail, including model construction, implementation methods, and the selection of hyperparameters, and verification is conducted by experiments. When categorizing the damage to buildings into four types, we apply the method proposed in this paper to aerial images acquired from the 2014 Ludian earthquake and achieve an overall accuracy of 77.39%; when categorizing damage to buildings into two types, the overall accuracy of the model is 93.95%, exceeding such values in similar types of theories and methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerial photography 3aalgorithms 3abuildings 3aearthquakes 3aneural networks 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3awastes1 aLiu, Zhen1 aWang, Ying0 tRemote Sensing.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 11, no. 23dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs112328583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245011000186520145900296592002801755650002001783650001501803650001701818650001001835650003601845650001401881651001101895700003101906700002801937700003501965700004602000700003002046700003302076700002902109700002202138700002702160773012702187856008502314852000902399655001202408IND60703353520221121033941.0200721e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070335352DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80405242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHernández Flores, José  Luis10aPhylogenetic Analysis of Bacillus cereus sensu lato Isolates from Commercial Bee Pollen Using tRNACys-PCR  aEndospore-forming bacteria related to the Bacillus cereus group produce toxins that cause illnesses in organisms from invertebrates to mammals, including foodborne illnesses in humans. As commercial bee pollen can be contaminated with these bacteria, a comprehensive microbiological risk assessment of commercial bee pollen must be incorporated into the relevant regulatory requirements, including those that apply in Mexico. To facilitate detection of members of this group of bacteria, we have developed a PCR strategy that is based on the amplification of the single-copy tRNACʸˢ gene and specific genes associated with tRNACʸˢ to detect Bacillus cereus sensu lato (B. cereus s.l.). This tRNACʸˢ-PCR-based approach was used to examine commercial bee pollen for endospore-forming bacteria. Our analysis revealed that 3% of the endospore-forming colonies isolated from a commercial source of bee pollen were related to B. cereus s.l., and this result was corroborated by phylogenetic analysis, bacterial identification via MALDI-TOF MS, and detection of enterotoxin genes encoding the HBL and NHE complexes. The results show that the isolated colonies are closely related phylogenetically to B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. bombysepticus. Our results indicate that the tRNACʸˢ-PCR, combined with other molecular tools, will be a useful approach for identifying B. cereus s.l. and will assist in controlling the spread of potential pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus cereus 3abee pollen 3aenterotoxins 3agenes 3amicrobiological risk assessment 3aphylogeny 3aMexico1 aSalinas Landaverde, Diana 1 aPacheco Huerta, Yonuen 1 aGuerra Castillo, Vania  Lizeth1 aBarrios Sánchez, María  de los Ángeles1 aArvizu Hernández, Iván 1 aRamos López, Miguel  Ángel1 aÁlvarez Hidalgo, Erika 1 aH.

In the present study, we investigated, for the first time, the distribution, sources and ecological risk of trace metals and organic pollutants, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), in surface sediments from a Southeastern European river (Someşu Mic River, Romania). Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Ni and Zn ranged from 0.04 to 0.4, 9.4 to 43.15, 7.2 to 65.6, 12.3 to 131.4, 14.7 to 47.7 and 42.1 to 236.8 mg kg−1 dw, respectively. Concentrations of total PAHs, PCBs and OCPs ranged from 24.8 to 575.6, 2.7 to 252.7 and 2.1 to 44.3 ng g−1 dw, respectively. Some sediment parameters, i.e., pH, total organic carbon (TOC) and total organic matter (OM) contents, played a significant role in the spatial distribution of contaminants. A combined analysis based on diagnostic ratios and multivariate analyses revealed PAHs originating mainly from pyrolytic sources. PCB compositions showed distinct contamination signatures for tri- to tetra-chlorinated PCBs, characteristic of contamination by Aroclor-1016 and -1254 technical mixtures. The dominant OCP congeners were α-HCH and p,p′-DDD, reflecting past use of technical HCHs and DDTs in agricultural practices. Metal source and pollution status was assessed using geoaccumulation index and enrichment factor, which indicate widespread pollution by Pb, Cd, Zn, Ni and Cu. The use of Sediments Quality Guidelines (SQGs), mean effect range-median quotient (m-ERM-Q) and toxic equivalent factor (TEF) indicated that the highest ecological risks occurred for PCBs and DDTs. This work presents not only initial baseline information on the extent of organic and inorganic contaminations in a river of ecological and economical interest, but also provides a diagnostic ratio/statistical combined approach that can be used to evaluate sediment quality in similar environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3afreshwater 3alead 3amultivariate analysis 3anickel 3apH 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3arivers 3asediment contamination 3asediments 3atotal organic carbon 3atoxicity 3azinc 3aRomania 0aSediments 0aMetals 0aOrganic pollutants 0aRisk assessment 0aSomeşu Mic River1 aBeldean-Galea, Mihail Simion1 aAl-Rawabdeh, Abdulla M.1 aRoba, Carmen1 aMartonos, Ildiko Melinda1 aBălc, Ramona1 aKahlaoui, Massoud1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4304-75221 aTouil, Soufiane1 aTedetti, Marc1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3212-68901 aDriss, Mohamed Ridha1 aBaciu, Călin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1142-06200 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Apr. 10, v. 660 p.660-676dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.4283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245015500208300001800363520223700381592002802618650003002646650000902676650001102685650001602696650001302712650001002725651000902735700002702744700002002771773012602791856008202917852000902999655001203008IND60743438020221116181857.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074343802DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02844-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimi, Reyhaneh1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0253-143013aAn Uncertainty-Based Regional Comparative Analysis on the Performance of Different Bias Correction Methods in Statistical Downscaling of Precipitation  ap. 2503-2518.  aStatistical downscaling of General Circulation Models (GCM) simulations is widely used for projecting precipitation at different spatiotemporal scales. However, the downscaling process is linked with different source of uncertainty including structural/parametric uncertainty of the model and output uncertainty. This research proposes a novel framework to assess the parametric uncertainty of downscaling model, and used this framework to assess the performance of different bias correction methods linked to the regression-based statistical downscaling model. The used downscaling framework in the current paper is Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM). The conventional bias correction method linked with SDSM is the Variance InFlation method (VIF), this paper substitutes this method with three different bias correction methods including Local Intensity Scaling (LOCI), Power Transformation (PT), and Quantile Mapping (QM) to assess the associated parametric and global uncertainty of each method in different climate by using a new approach. The proposed method is applied to six different stations located in Iran and United States with different climate status. Average Relative Interval Length (ARIL), P-level, and Normalized Uncertainty Efficiency (NUE) are used as uncertainty indicators to evaluate the results. Results represent that in every assessed climate class, LOCI, and PT, work better than conventional VIF in both amount and occurrence modules of SDSM framework. More precisely, LOCI works better in station that has wet summer, while PT performs well in the stations where there is no or very limited precipitation in summer. Substituting LOCI with VIF, result in increasing the value of NUE by at least factor of 3 in occurrence and amount model which means the significant reduction in structural uncertainty. Also applying PT in arid regions improves the NUE indicator at least by factor 2 in occurrence and amount model and by factor 3 in output uncertainty assessment, and results in less parametric and output uncertainty. Results illustrate the important role of bias correction approaches in reducing structural, and output uncertainty and improving the statistical efficiency of the downscaling model.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aaril 3asummer 3auncertainty 3avariance 3awater 3aIran1 aTavakol-Davani, Hassan1 aNasseri, Mohsen0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2503-2518dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02844-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02836naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008700172300001200259500001500271520131900286592002801605650002401633650001701657650002001674650002101694650001901715650001601734650001901750650002401769650001101793650001701804650002601821650002801847650001701875650003201892650001801924650001601942650002001958650001201978650001301990650002202003650001702025650000702042650001302049650001002062653001102072773013302083856008102216852000902297655001202306IND60340701120221119031853.0160312e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034070112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-015-4651-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgbinosa, Etinosa O.10aEffect of cassava mill effluent on biological activity of soil microbial community  ap. 418.  a2019-12-05  aThis study assessed the effect of cassava effluent on soil microbiological characteristics and enzymatic activities were investigated in soil samples. Soil properties and heavy metal concentrations were evaluated using standard soil analytical and spectroscopic methods, respectively. The microbiological parameters measured include microbial biomass carbon, basal soil respiration, catalase, urease, dehydrogenase activities and number of culturable aerobic bacteria, fungi and actinomycetes. The pH and temperature regime vary significantly (p < 0.05) throughout the study period. All other physicochemical parameters studied were significantly different (p < 0.05) higher than the control site. Soil organic carbon content gave significant positive correlations with microbial biomass carbon, basal soil respiration, catalase activity and dehydrogenase activity (r = 0.450, 0.461, 0.574 and 0.591 at p < 0.01), respectively. The quantitative analysis of soil microbial density demonstrates a marked decrease in total culturable numbers of the different microbial groups of the polluted soil samples. Soil contamination decreased catalase, urease and dehydrogenase activities. The findings revealed that soil enzymes can be used as indices of soil contamination and bio-indicator of soil quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil organic carbon 3aheavy metals 3asoil properties 3asoil respiration 3apolluted soils 3acorrelation 3asoil pollution 3asoil microorganisms 3aurease 3aspectroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3amicrobiological quality 3asoil quality 3abiological activity in soil 3asoil sampling 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3acassava 3acatalase 3amicrobial biomass 3asoil enzymes 3apH 3abacteria 3afungi 0acarbon0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 July, v. 187, no. 7 p.418-418dSpringer International Publishingx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-015-4651-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002100135245007500156300001500231520116300246592002801409650002201437650001201459650001801471650001501489650001001504650001501514650002401529650000901553650001401562650001201576650001701588700002401605700001701629700002201646700002401668700001901692773015201711856006901863856010701932990002302039852000902062655001202071IND60644386920221117052629.0190516e20181109xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064438692DNAL7 a10.3791/585762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDe Marco, Donata10aCell-based assay to study antibody-mediated tau clearance by microglia  ap. e58576.  aAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition in which aggregated tau and amyloid proteins accumulate in the brain causing neuronal dysfunction which eventually leads to cognitive decline. Hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in the neuron are believed to cause most of the pathology associated with AD. These aggregates are assumed to be released into the extracellular compartment and taken up by adjacent healthy neurons where they induce further tau aggregation. This "prion-like" spreading can be interrupted by antibodies capable of binding and "neutralizing" extracellular tau aggregates as shown in preclinical mouse models of AD. One of the proposed mechanisms by which therapeutic antibodies reduce pathology is antibody-mediated uptake and clearance of pathological aggregated forms of tau by microglia. Here, we describe a quantitative cell-based assay to assess tau uptake by microglia. This assay uses the mouse microglial cell line BV-2, allows for high specificity, low variability and medium throughput. Data generated with this assay can contribute to a better characterization of anti-tau antibody effector functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aamyloid 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3abrain 3acell lines 3acognitive disorders 3amice 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3atherapeutics1 aTaggenbrock, Renske1 aCrespo, Rosa1 aKoudstaal, Wouter1 aRamsburg, Elizabeth1 aApetri, Adrian0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Nov. 09, , no. 141 p.e58576-e58576dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/585763Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58576/cell-based-assay-to-study-antibody-mediated-tau-clearance-by-microglia  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245012200185520139500307592002801702650002901730650001401759650001901773650001401792650001901806650001701825650002601842650001301868650001501881650001101896650001101907700002701918700004301945700002701988700001802015700003102033773012702064856008502191852000902276655001202285IND60703353620221121024027.0200721e20200406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070335362DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms80405232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPorras-Agüera, Juan  Antonio10aAutophagic Proteome in Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae Strains during Second Fermentation for Sparkling Wine Elaboration  aA correlation between autophagy and autolysis has been proposed in order to accelerate the acquisition of wine organoleptic properties during sparkling wine elaboration. In this context, a proteomic analysis was carried out in two industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (P29, conventional sparkling wine strain and G1, implicated in sherry wine elaboration) with the aim of studying the autophagy-related proteome and comparing the effect of CO₂ overpressure during sparkling wine elaboration. In general, a detrimental effect of pressure and second fermentation development on autophagy-related proteome was observed in both strains, although it was more pronounced in flor yeast strain G1. Proteins mainly involved in autophagy regulation and autophagosome formation in flor yeast G1, and those required for vesicle nucleation and expansion in P29 strain, highlighted in sealed bottle. Proteins Sec2 and Sec18 were detected 3-fold under pressure conditions in P29 and G1 strains, respectively. Moreover, ‘fingerprinting’ obtained from multivariate data analysis established differences in autophagy-related proteome between strains and conditions. Further research is needed to achieve more solid conclusions and design strategies to promote autophagy for an accelerated autolysis, thus reducing cost and time production, as well as acquisition of good organoleptic properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aautolysis 3aautophagosomes 3aautophagy 3acarbon dioxide 3afermentation 3amultivariate analysis 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asherry 3ayeasts1 aMoreno-García, Jaime 1 aGonzález-Jiménez, María  del Carmen1 aMauricio, Juan  Carlos1 aMoreno, Juan 1 aGarcía-Martínez, Teresa 0 tMicroorganisms.g2020 Apr. 06, v. 8, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms80405233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001700171245011100188300001400299520136500313592002801678650002001706650001401726650002301740650001401763650002401777650001501801650001401816650002801830650002101858650003701879650003401916650002901950650001101979650000901990650004101999653001402040653001502054653001902069653002302088653001402111700001602125700001702141700001602158700001402174700001702188700001802205773010402223856008702327852000902414655001202423IND50060376420221122172321.0190402e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006037642DNAL7 a232654542pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.09.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Rongrong10aInhibition effects and induction of apoptosis of flavonoids on the prostate cancer cell line PC-3 in vitro  ap. 48-53.  aMyricetin and myricitrin are naturally occurring flavonoids have been suggested to play a role in inhibition of proliferation and transformation of carcinogenic cell. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of their activity have not yet to be revealed. The aim of the present study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis cell on the prostate cancer induced by myricetin, myricitrin, quercetin and quercitrin. The MTT assay confirmed that myricetin had the strongest inhibitory effect on human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, myricitrin was second, and quercitrin was the weakest. A noticeable synergistic effect was observed with the inhibition of cell proliferation when myricetin was used in combination with myricitrin. In the concentration range of 37.5–300μmol/L, the inhibitory effects of these flavonoids were enhanced with increasing dose and treatment time. The acridine orange analysis and annexin V–FITC/PI double-staining results confirmed that myricetin and myricitrin were effective in inducing PC-3 cell apoptosis. The results showed that myricetin was more effective than myricitrin in inducing cell apoptosis. The apoptosis rate increased with increasing flavonoid concentration in a dose dependent manner. A synergistic effect was observed on the apoptosis rate when myricetin was used in combination with myricitrin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacridine orange 3aapoptosis 3acell proliferation 3amyricetin 3aprostatic neoplasms 3aquercitrin 3asynergism 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aDown-Regulationxdrug effects 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aProstatic Neoplasmsxphysiopathology 0aMyricetin 0aMyricitrin 0aCell line PC-3 0aCell proliferation 0aApoptosis1 aZhang, Ying1 aYe, Xingqian1 aXue, Sophia1 aShi, John1 aPan, Jihhung1 aChen, Qiuping0 tFood chemistry.g2013 May 01, v. 138, no. 1 p.48-53dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.09.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002000169245010300189300001600292520117900308592002801487650001101515650001001526650001201536650001501548650001001563650001901573650001101592650001201603650001901615650003501634651000901669653002101678653001501699653001501714653002001729653001901749653002901768653001401797700001901811700001901830700001901849700002301868773008401891856010301975852000902078655001202087IND60125710320221119061627.0150428e200111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012571032DNAL7 a10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0746:HRATOT]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPratt, Thane K.10aHome Range and Territoriality of Two Hawaiian Honeycreepers, the ‘ĀKohekohe and Maui Parrotbill  ap. 746-755.  aHawaiian honeycreepers have radiated into a diversity of trophic niches and patterns of space-use. We investigated space-use in two honeycreeper species, the ‘Ākohekohe (Palmeria dolei), an endangered nectarivore, and Maui Parrotbill (Pseudonestor xanthophrys), an endangered wood excavator, by mapping the home ranges and dispersion of color-banded individuals at a study site in relatively undisturbed montane cloud forest on Maui Island, Hawai‘i. With 20% of outlying points excluded, home-range size averaged much smaller for adult male ‘Ākohekohe (0.56 ha) than for male Maui Parrotbill (2.26 ha). In both species, a female's home range mostly overlapped that of her mate. Adult male Maui Parrotbill defended year-round home ranges from which they excluded conspecifics except for their mates and dependent offspring. Although our data suggest that ‘Ākohekohe also maintained all-purpose territories, the evidence is less convincing because these birds were seen feeding in the home ranges of other individuals. By defending all-purpose territories, these two species depart from the more common honeycreeper pattern of sharing large, undefended home ranges.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abirds 3afemales 3ahome range 3amales 3anectar feeding 3aniches 3aprogeny 3aterritoriality 3atropical montane cloud forests 3aMaui 0a‘‘Ākohekohe 0adispersion 0ahome range 0aMaui Parrotbill 0aPalmeria dolei 0aPseudonestor xanthophrys 0aterritory1 aSimon, John C.1 aFarm, Brian P.1 aBerlin, Kim E.1 aKowalsky, James R.0 tThe condor.g2001 Nov., v. 103, no. 4 p.746-755wJournal:19632x1938-51297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1650/0010-5422(2001)103[0746:HRATOT]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03105naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009300164300001800257520147400275592002801749650001401777650001601791650002201807650002201829650001301851650001901864650001401883650003501897650001401932650002601946650001201972650001001984650000901994650002102003650002002024651001102044700001602055700002102071700002102092700001802113700002102131700001602152700002002168700001902188700001902207700002002226700002002246700002002266700001802286773014502304856008102449852000902530655001202539IND60519455420221122221052.0160429e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051945542DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-015-5946-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGou, Yan-You10aEstrogenic effects in the influents and effluents of the drinking water treatment plants  ap. 8518-8528.  aEstrogen-like endocrine disrupting compounds (EEDC) such as bisphenol A, nonylphenol, and phthalic acid esters are toxic compounds that may occur in both raw- and drinking water. The aim of this study was to combine chemical- and bioassay to evaluate the risk of EEDCs in the drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs). Fifty-six samples were collected from seven DWTPs located in northern-, central-, and southern Taiwan from 2011 to 2012 and subjected to chemical analyses and two bioassay methods for total estrogenic activity (E-Screen and T47D-KBluc assay). Among of the considered EEDCs, only dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) were detected in both drinking and raw water samples. DBP levels in drinking water ranged from <MDL to 0.840 μg/L and from <MDL to 0.760 μg/L in raw water. DEHP had higher detection rate (82.1 %) than other compounds and was present in both drinking water and raw water from all the DWTPs. The highest daily drinking water intake calculated for male and female were 0.0823 and 0.115 μg/kg per day. The two selected bioassays were conducted for the first batch of 56 samples and a detection rate of 23 % for estradiol equivalent (EEQ) lower than the LOQ to 1.3 and 15 % for EEQ lower than LOQ to 0.757 for the second 53 samples. Our results showed a good correlation between E-screen and chemical assay which indicates that a combination of both can be used in detecting EEDCs in environmental samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioassays 3abisphenol A 3achemical analysis 3adibutyl phthalate 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3aeffluents 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aestradiol 3aestrogenic properties 3afemales 3amales 3arisk 3atoxic substances 3awater treatment 3aTaiwan1 aLin, Susana1 aQue, Danielle E.1 aTayo, Lemmuel L.1 aLin, Ding-Yan1 aChen, Kuan-Chung1 aChen, Fu-An1 aChiang, Pen-Chi1 aWang, Gen-Shuh1 aHsu, Yi-Chyuan1 aZhuang, Guobin,1 aChuang, Chun-Yu1 aTsou, Tsui-Chun1 aChao, How-Ran0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 9 p.8518-8528dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-015-5946-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02472naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245013600160300001800296500001100314520127100325592002801596650002201624650002601646650001501672650001501687650001601702650001601718650002101734651001801755700002101773700002501794700002301819700002301842700001901865773012001884856007302004852000902077655001202086IND60620625720221118044436.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062062572DNAL7 a10.1111/ele.131572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedhead, John W.10aPotential landscape‐scale pollinator networks across Great Britain: structure, stability and influence of agricultural land cover  ap. 1821-1832.  aLETTER  aUnderstanding spatial variation in the structure and stability of plant–pollinator networks, and their relationship with anthropogenic drivers, is key for maintaining pollination services and mitigating declines. Constructing sufficient networks to examine patterns over large spatial scales remains challenging. Using biological records (citizen science), we constructed potential plant–pollinator networks at 10 km resolution across Great Britain, comprising all potential interactions inferred from recorded floral visitation and species co‐occurrence. We calculated network metrics (species richness, connectance, pollinator and plant generality) and adapted existing methods to assess robustness to sequences of simulated plant extinctions across multiple networks. We found positive relationships between agricultural land cover and both pollinator generality and robustness to extinctions under several extinction scenarios. Increased robustness was attributable to changes in plant community composition (fewer extinction‐prone species) and network structure (increased pollinator generality). Thus, traits enabling persistence in highly agricultural landscapes can confer robustness to potential future perturbations on plant–pollinator networks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abotanical composition 3aextinction 3aland cover 3apollination 3apollinators 3aspecies richness 3aGreat Britain1 aWoodcock, Ben A.1 aPocock, Michael J.O.1 aPywell, Richard F.1 aVanbergen, Adam J.1 aOliver, Tom H.0 tEcology letters.g2018 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1821-1832dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.131573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03028naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245011400168300001600282520142300298592002801721650001701749650002701766650002201793650001801815650001401833650002901847650001601876650001001892650002201902650001201924650001301936650001601949650001301965650001701978650001801995653001702013653003902030653001702069653001202086653001102098653001602109653001702125700002602142700002302168700001702191700002202208700002902230773013102259856008702390852000902477655001202486IND60529363920221118023711.0220628e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052936392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.10.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAzhar, Asim10aOxidized antithrombin is a dual inhibitor of coagulation and angiogenesis: Importance of low heparin affinity  ap. 541-550.  aEndogenous proteins that promote vascular endothelial cell based inhibition of angiogenesis are an attractive option for antitumor therapy. Inactive cleaved and latent conformations of antithrombin (AT) are antiangiogenic, but not its native form which is an inhibitor of proteases involved in blood coagulation. Unlike native, the cleaved and latent conformations are reactive center loop inserted conformations which binds heparin with very low affinity. We use a sulfoxy modified AT to assess the role of reactive center loop insertion and heparin affinity in antiangiogenic function. Chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM) shows that antiangiogenic activity of latent and oxidized AT are better than thalidomide, a potent antiangiogenic drug. Wound healing experiments suggest that latent and oxidized conformations can influence endothelial cell migration. Latent and cleaved conformations of AT shows an increase in α-helical content in the presence of unfractionated heparin, but not the oxidized AT. Unlike the loop inserted polymer, cleaved and latent conformations, oxidized AT has factor Xa inhibitory activity indicating that loop insertion is not necessary for antiangiogenic role. The results of our study establish that active conformation of AT can become antiangiogenic while maintaining its anticoagulant activity possibly through chelation of low affinity heparin in the vicinity of endothelial cell.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aanticoagulant activity 3ablood coagulation 3acell movement 3achelation 3achorioallantoic membrane 3acoagulation 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3aheparin 3apolymers 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3atherapeutics 3atissue repair 0aAngiogenesis 0aEndogenous antiangiogenic proteins 0aAntithrombin 0aHeparin 0aSerpin 0aCoagulation 0aTumor growth1 aKhan, Mohammad Sazzad1 aSwaminathan, Akila1 aNaseem, Asma1 aChatterjee, Suvro1 aJairajpuri, Mohamad Aman0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2016 Jan., v. 82 p.541-550dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2015.10.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245018800169300001800357520187100375592002802246650001402274650000902288650002402297650001502321650001402336650002802350650002302378650001402401650001002415650001502425700001902440700002202459773012602481856008202607852000902689655001202698IND60743438320221116181917.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074343832DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02832-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJhong, Bing-Chen10aAssessment of Effective Monitoring Sites in a Reservoir Watershed by Support Vector Machine Coupled with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Sediment Flux Prediction during Typhoons  ap. 2387-2408.  aEffectively assessing crucial monitoring sites with suspended sediment concentration (SSC) is a vital challenge for achieving accurate prediction of sediment flux on sluice gates at a dam in a reservoir watershed. To address this issue, an assessment framework based on a core concept of Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy is proposed in this study. First, for the reasonable training of the coupled method, a two-dimentional layer-averaged density current model, SRH2D, is applied to simulate reasonable SSC data. The limited SSC data at monitoring sites collected from the field and at dam face, inflow, and outflow discharges are collected for validation of a calibrated numerical model. Second, a well-known data-driven method, Support Vector Machine (SVM), is coupled with Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) as a sediment-flux-prediction (SFP) model in the proposed framework to evaluate effective monitoring sites with SSC. An application in the Shih-Men Reservoir is implemented to demonstrate the contribution of the proposed investigation framework. The results indicate that the spatial turbidity current movement is reasonably simulated by the numerical model and appropriate as reliable data for the SFP model. The SSCs at measured points located on the lower level at dam face are significantly higher. Moreover, the results also show that the simulated SSC at the monitoring sites located near the inflow point and dam face are relatively useful for SFP. The analyzed results are concluded that the well-established observation equipment at the inflow point and near the dam is necessary for obtaining high-quality measured data, which has become a significant key issue on reservoir operation management (ROM). Also, the proposed framework is expected to be helpful to improve the benefit of ROM as reference for decision makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aequipment 3aface 3amathematical models 3aprediction 3asediments 3asupport vector machines 3asuspended sediment 3aturbidity 3awater 3awatersheds1 aFang, Hsi-Ting1 aHuang, Cheng-Chia0 tWater resources management.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 8 p.2387-2408dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-021-02832-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03133naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245010000165300001600265520158400281592002801865650002101893650001101914650002501925650001601950650001801966650001501984650001301999650001402012650004302026650002402069650005202093650002802145650001202173653000902185653003902194653001402233700001402247700001502261700001702276700001902293700002002312700001902332700001802351700001802369700001602387773012102403856008202524852000902606655001202615IND60565401720221119223249.0170711e20170429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056540172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.0912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xiaolei10aVav1 expression is increased in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and indicates poor prognosis  ap. 571-576.  aRecently, Vav1 has been suggested to play an essential role in the progression of human cancers. However, the correlation between Vav1 expression and prognosis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate Vav1 expression and its prognostic value in ESCC. The expression of Vav1 was detected by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting in ESCC tissues and matched nontumorous tissues. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out to detect Vav1 expression in paraffin samples from 112 primary ESCC patients. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the correlation of Vav1 expression with prognosis of ESCC patients. The expression levels of Vav1 mRNA and protein in ESCC tissues were both significantly higher than those in adjacent nontumorous tissues. High Vav1 expression was significantly correlated with larger tumor size (P = 0.015), depth of tumor invasion (P = 0.023), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.008) and TNM stage (P < 0.001). The rate of overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in patients with high Vav1 expression than those with low Vav1 expression (P = 0.014). Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that Vav1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR = 1.660, 95%CI = 1.058–2.607, P = 0.028). In summary, our findings demonstrate that Vav1 may be a candidate molecular prognostic marker for patients with ESCC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3ahumans 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alymph nodes 3amessenger RNA 3ametastasis 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asquamous cell carcinoma 3atissues 0aVav1 0aEsophageal squamous cell carcinoma 0aPrognosis1 aJin, Huan1 aXia, Ziwei1 aWu, Xianxian1 aYang, Mingjian1 aZhang, Hongdian1 aShang, Xiaobin1 aCheng, Runfen1 aZhan, Zhongli1 aYu, Zhentao0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Apr. 29, v. 486 p.571-576dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.0913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02762naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001600272520143200288592002801720650001201748650002701760650001001787650001601797650002201813650000901835650001201844650002001856650001401876650001101890650002501901650001301926650000701939650001401946650001801960650001801978650002001996650001602016650002602032650001402058651000902072700001902081773009002100856008102190852000902271655001202280IND60340701620221119032442.0151024e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034070162DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617150300542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGholami, M.10aIsolation and characterization of a novel strain of genus Dietzia capable of multiple-extreme resistance  ap. 389-397.  aAn ultraviolet (UV) radiation resistant gram-positive bacterium, Dietzia sp. MG4 strain, was isolated from the Sirch Hot Spring (Kerman, Iran), then it was identified on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The effects of temperature, pH, desiccation, different percentage of NaCl, hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), mitomycin C (MMC) and high levels of radiation on viability or growth rate of MG4 strain were investigated. Also heavy metal tolerance of MG4 strain was assayed. 16S rDNA sequence of the isolate exhibited 99.69% similarity with Dietzia sp. and this result was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis. Viability of this strain was obtained D₉₁ according to D index after exposure to 25 J/cm² UV radiation dose, and D₃₀ after desiccation stress (for 28 days) using flow cytometery. The D₁₀ value for a microorganism is defined as the stress dose necessary to provide 10% survivors. Therefore, this strain showed high resistance to UV-C radiation and moderate resistance to desiccation. Optimal growth of MG4 strain was observed at pH 9, temperature of 30°C and 5% (w/v) NaCl. Isolated Dietzia was resisted up to 3 mM of nickel and 0.2 mM of mercury ions. Also this strain could tolerate 1–4% (v/v) H₂O₂ and 8 µg/mL of MMC as oxidant agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on multiple extreme resistant Dietzia sp.

Transcriptomic analysis of host–pathogen interaction is the first step to understand the molecular landscape of a disease. Previous works have reported the transcriptome profiling in response to HLB in different susceptible citrus species; however, similar studies in tolerant citrus species, including Mexican lime, are limited. In this work, we have obtained an RNA-seq-based differential expression profile of Mexican lime plants challenged against CLas infection, at both asymptomatic and symptomatic stages. Typical HLB-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are involved in photosynthesis, secondary metabolism, and phytohormone homeostasis. Enrichment of DEGs associated with biotic response showed that genes related to cell wall, secondary metabolism, transcription factors, signaling, and redox reactions could play a role in the tolerance of Mexican lime against CLas infection. Interestingly, despite some concordance observed between transcriptional responses of different tolerant citrus species, a subset of DEGs appeared to be species-specific.

Such plastids fulfill many crucial functions, such as assimilation of carbon, sulfur and nitrogen as well as synthesis of essential metabolites. These organelles consist of the following three key sub-compartments. The envelope, characterized by two membranes, surrounds the organelle and controls the communication of the plastid with other cell compartments. The stroma is the soluble phase of the chloroplast and the main site where carbon dioxide is converted into carbohydrates. The thylakoid membrane is the internal membrane network consisting of grana (flat compressed sacs) and lamellae (less dense structures), where oxygenic photosynthesis takes place. The present protocol describes step by step procedures required for the purification, using differential centrifugations and Percoll gradients, of intact chloroplasts from Arabidopsis, and their fractionation, using sucrose gradients, in three sub-compartments (i.e., envelope, stroma, and thylakoids). This protocol also provides instructions on how to assess the purity of these fractions using markers associated to the various chloroplast sub-compartments. The method described here is valuable for subplastidial localization of proteins using immunoblotting, but also for subcellular and subplastidial proteomics and other studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3afractionation 3agrana 3aimmunoblotting 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3aphotosynthesis 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asucrose 3asulfur 3athylakoids1 aMoyet, Lucas1 aSalvi, Daniel1 aKuntz, Marcel1 aRolland, Norbert0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Oct. 19, , no. 140 p.e58581-e58581dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/585813Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58581/preparation-chloroplast-sub-compartments-from-arabidopsis-for  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245009300158300001600251520167600267592002801943650001101971650001601982650002501998650002502023650001602048650001302064650001602077650001002093650002302103650001302126650001602139650001502155650001602170650002802186650002502214650002602239700002402265773009002289856008102379852000902460655001202469IND60340701720221119032408.0151024e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034070172DNAL7 a10.1134/S00262617150301692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRicha,10aSensitivity of two Nostoc species harbouring diverse habitats to ultraviolet-B radiation  ap. 398-407.  aThe effects of ultraviolet-B (UV-B; 280–315 nm) radiation on certain key physiological and biochemical processes were studied in two Nostoc species harbouring diverse habitats. Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2, a thermophilic cyanobacterium, was isolated from the hot-spring, Rajgir, whereas, Nostoc sp. HKAR-6 was a rice-field isolate from Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Complete killing of the cells occurred after 48 h of UV-B exposure in Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-6, whereas in case of Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2 death occurred only after 72 h. Chlorophyll a and phycocyanin content were found to be adversely affected by UV-B irradiation in both the test organisms. However, a progressive increase in carotenoids content was observed upto 10 h of UV-B exposure but subsequently declined after 12 h in both the Nostoc sp. The antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and peroxidase that scavenge the UV-B generated harmful reactive oxygen species were found to have multifold induction in their content in both the strains following UV-B exposure in comparison to non-irradiated control cultures. In addition, these organisms also synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs); able to carry out UV-screening. Porphyra-334 and shinorine were found to be the common MAAs in both the Nostoc sp., while an unknown MAAs with a retention time of 6.9 min (λₘₐₓ—334 nm) was found in Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2. Findings from this study suggest that both enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense mechanisms are being employed by Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-2 and Nostoc sp. strain HKAR-6 to counteract the damaging effects of UV-B radiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc 3aamino acids 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abiochemical pathways 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3adeath 3adefense mechanisms 3ahabitats 3airradiation 3aperoxidase 3aphycocyanin 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aultraviolet radiation1 aSinha, Rajeshwar P.0 tMicrobiology.g2015 May, v. 84, no. 3 p.398-407dPleiades Publishingx0026-26177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00262617150301693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03719naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245019900164300001800363500001500381520188200396592002802278650004402306650001202350650002202362650001502384650002102399650001102420650002402431650002602455650001102481650001802492650002402510650001902534650002102553650000902574650001502583650002502598650002702623650002002650650002502670650001302695650001802708650001902726650002002745651001002765653001702775653003702792700001802829700001702847700001602864700001402880773014502894856008103039852000903120655001203129IND60519455920221122221151.0160429e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051945592DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-6083-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Xiao-Hui10aTemporal and spatial variations of contaminant removal, enzyme activities, and microbial community structure in a pilot horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland purifying industrial runoff  ap. 8565-8576.  a2019-12-06  aA pilot-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSFCW) was operated to purify industrial runoff containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Guangzhou, China. Synthetic industrial runoff was fed into the HSSFCW with continuous flow at an average loading rate of 0.128 m³/(m²/day) for about 2 years. Pollutants such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and phenanthrene were mainly removed in the front quarter of the HSSFCW, and in the vertical direction, the average removal rates of COD, TP, total nitrogen (TN), ammonia, and phenanthrene of the upper layer were 64.23, 71.16, 50.81, 65.38, and 92.47 %, which were 1.23, 2.08, 1.48, 1.72, and 1.17 times higher than those of the bottom, respectively. Correlations among pollutant removal, soil environmental indexes, enzyme activities, and soil microbial community structure were evaluated. Enzyme assays (dehydrogenase, catalase, nitrate reductase, and polyphenol oxidase) showed significant associations between enzyme activities and pollutant removal (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05). Soil microbial community structure was assessed with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprinting method, and results demonstrated that bacterial communities remained relatively stable in different seasons. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were found to be the dominant phyla of the bacteria communities, and three clones which might be related to the biodegradation of phenanthrene were also detected. Results of the present work would broaden the knowledge of the purification mechanism of contaminants in the constructed wetlands (CWs), and identification of the treatment performances and temporal and spatial variations of biological activities of subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSFCWs) would help to improve the operations of CWs for surface water protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aammonia 3anitrate reductase 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen content 3aclones 3asoil microorganisms 3abacterial communities 3arunoff 3asurface water 3acommunity structure 3aProteobacteria 3acatechol oxidase 3asoil 3apollutants 3aconstructed wetlands 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenzyme activity 3abioactive properties 3acatalase 3aphenanthrenes 3abiodegradation 3asubsurface flow 3aChina 0aphenanthrene 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons1 aJing, Dan-Dan1 aWan, Jinquan1 aMa, Yongwen1 aWang, Yan0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2016 May, v. 23, no. 9 p.8565-8576dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-6083-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245010800163300001800271520154700289592002801836596011801864596007501982596005002057596013602107650003002243650001302273650001502286650002102301650001702322650001302339650001302352650002002365650001802385700001802403700002002421700001302441700001702454700001802471700002702489700001302516773012602529856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60743438720221116181831.0210707e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074343872DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-021-02858-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMo, Yuming10aEffects of the Deep Pool on Groundwater Flow and Salinization in Coastal Reservoir and Adjacent Aquifer  ap. 2667-2684.  aCoastal reservoirs can alleviate freshwater shortages occurring in the nearshore zone. Deep pools patched at the bottom of reservoirs at greater depths than their adjacent beds maintain a high salinity and possibly provide preferential paths for saltwater backfill. However, such processes are not well understood. Laboratory experiments and numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effect of the deep pool on subsurface flow and the salinization of coastal reservoir and adjacent aquifers. When seawater intruded into the initially fresh aquifer, the deep pool accelerated the uptake of saltwater to the reservoir from the salt wedge, forming a temporary salt plume around the pool. The saltwater plume also accelerated salt ingress and the evolution of the total salt mass in the coastal reservoir, resulting in the earlier attainment of a quasi-steady state (a classical saltwater wedge) than that when the deep pool was absent. Under steady-state conditions, the deep pool greatly enhanced the exchange of water across the reservoir-aquifer interface by 107% and raised the salinization level of the coastal reservoir by at least 10.3%. Sensitivity analysis suggested that a deeper pool and/or a pool located closer to the reservoir dam may enhance the water exchange and salinity level in the reservoir because it accelerates the water/salt inflow to the freshwater body to a greater extent. These findings may further contribute to improving the predictability and management of water quality in these coastal facilities.  aPublisher supplied data  aB17015c111 Project, Ministry of Education, and the State Administration of Foreign Experts Affairs, P.

Both LH2 complexes were nonamers and had the same elution volume Vₑ, coinciding with that for the LH2 complex of Rhodoblastus acidophilus (strain 10050). Their molecular weight was 150 kDa. Both pheophytinization of bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) at low pH and treatment with the detergent LDAO, which affects the hydrophobic interactions between the neighboring protomers, result in the fragmentation of the ring of the isolated LH2 complexes and formation of 55-kDa fragments with molecular weights corresponding to one-third of the initial value. Fragmentation caused by both pheophytinization and detergent treatment was much more rapid in DPA LH2 complexes than in the intact ones. The 55-kDa fragments formed at low pH values contained monomeric bacteriopheophytin, while the fragments of a similar molecular weight formed at pH 8.0 in the presence of the detergent contained monomeric BChl. The observed fragmentation was hypothesized to reflect the inherent C₃ symmetry of the LH2 complexes, with the preliminarily assembled trimers used as building blocks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllochromatium minutissimum 3aRhodoblastus acidophilus 3abacteria 3acarotenoids 3agel chromatography 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aprotein subunits 3asulfur1 aErokhin, Yu.

We collected data from interior Alaska and combined these with data for Lesser Scaup from midcontinent breeding areas (Afton and Ankney 1991), allowing a rangewide analysis for the species. We found little evidence that nutrient reserve use differed between Alaskan and midcontinent Lesser Scaup, except that subarctic birds used a small amount of protein reserves when forming eggs, whereas midcontinent birds did not. Mineral reserves contributed relatively little to the clutch, but endogenous lipid accounted for approximately two-thirds of the lipid in the clutch. Levels of endogenous lipid and protein at initiation of clutch formation declined with date of initiation. Also, absolute amounts of lipid and protein reserves used declined through the season, corresponding to smaller clutch sizes. Our data are consistent with a seasonally variable threshold of lipid reserves for initiation of clutch formation and considerable reliance on lipid reserves, suggestive of lipid control of productivity via effects on clutch size and initiation dates. However, our data cannot refute the hypothesis that clutch size or initiation dates are set by other factors that in turn dictate the amount of lipid reserves that are stored and used. Despite uncertainty regarding the role of nutrient limitations on productivity, maintenance of adequate food resources on winter, migration, and breeding areas should be a management concern, given the high costs of clutch formation by Lesser Scaup, evidence of recent population declines, and potential links between nutrition and productivity.Variacióón Intraespecíífica en el Uso de las Reservas de Nutrientes durante la Formacióón de Huevos en Aythya affinisResumen.  Estudiamos la dináámica en la reserva nutricional de hembras de Aythya affinis para identificar fuentes de variacióón intraespecíífica en las estrategias de adquisicióón de nutrientes. Estos nutrientes permiten afrontar los altos costos nutricionales y energééticos que demanda la produccióón de huevos. Colectamos datos en el interior de Alaska y los combinamos con informacióón sobre A. affinis para ááreas de críía del centro del continente (Afton y Ankney 1991), permitiendo un anáálisis para una extensa áárea de distribucióón de la especie. Encontramos escasa evidencia sobre variaciones en el uso de nutrientes de reserva entre A. affinis de Alaska y del centro del continente. Como excepcióón, las aves subáárticas usaron una pequeña cantidad de las reservas proteicas cuando produjeron los huevos, en contraposicióón con las aves del centro del continente que no las usaron. Las reservas minerales contribuyeron relativemente poco a la formacióón de huevos, pero los líípidos endóógenos representaron casi dos-tercios de los líípidos presentes en los huevos. Los niveles de líípidos endóógenos y de proteíínas al comienzo de la produccióón de huevos disminuyeron en relacióón con la fecha de inicio. Ademáás, las cantidades absolutas de reserva de líípidos y proteíínas usadas disminuyeron a lo largo de la estacióón, correspondiééndose con nidadas máás pequeñas. Nuestros datos son consistentes con la existencia de un umbral estacional variable en las reservas de líípidos que determina el inicio de la formacióón de huevos, y con la seguridad relativa que ofrecen las reservas de líípidos. Estos resultados sugieren que los líípidos controlan la productividad de las aves a travéés de efectos sobre el tamaño de la nidada y la fecha de inicio.

It is found that the economic value of “better” MVH estimates is negligible, and that optimal hedges are substantially different from MVHs when the usual MVH restrictions are relaxed. Among other things, findings suggest that the hedging research's recent emphasis on “better” MVHs has been a waste of resources. Investigating the consequences of relaxing the standard MVH assumptions seems to be much more important than recent literature contributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3aeconomic valuation 3awastes0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1995 May, v. 77, no. 2 p.353-364dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12435453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002300135245011000158300001500268520167100283592002801954650000801982650002201990650001602012650001402028650002002042650001102062650002202073650002902095650001802124650002002142700001702162700001902179700001802198700002602216700001702242700002202259773015202281856007002433856010202503852000902605655001202614IND60784272420221119155148.0220726e20220314xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078427242DNAL7 a10.3791/633072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalhi, Naseeb Kaur10aIsolation and profiling of human primary mesenteric arterial endothelial cells at the transcriptome level  ap. e63307.  aEndothelial cells (ECs) are crucial for vascular and whole-body function through their dynamic response to environmental cues. Elucidating the transcriptome and epigenome of ECs is paramount to understanding their roles in development, health, and disease, but is limited in the availability of isolated primary cells. Recent technologies have enabled the high-throughput profiling of EC transcriptome and epigenome, leading to the identification of previously unknown EC cell subpopulations and developmental trajectories. While EC cultures are a useful tool in the exploration of EC function and dysfunction, the culture conditions and multiple passages can introduce external variables that alter the properties of native EC, including morphology, epigenetic state, and gene expression program. To overcome this limitation, the present paper demonstrates a method of isolating human primary ECs from donor mesenteric arteries aiming to capture their native state. ECs in the intimal layer are dissociated mechanically and biochemically with the use of particular enzymes. The resultant cells can be directly used for bulk RNA or single-cell RNA-sequencing or plated for culture. In addition, a workflow is described for the preparation of human arterial tissue for spatial transcriptomics, specifically for a commercially available platform, although this method is also suitable for other spatial transcriptome profiling techniques. This methodology can be applied to different vessels collected from a variety of donors in health or disease states to gain insights into EC transcriptional and epigenetic regulation, a pivotal aspect of endothelial cell biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aendothelial cells 3aepigenetics 3aepigenome 3agene expression 3ahumans 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aLuo, Yingjun1 aTang, Xiaofang1 aSriram, Kiran1 aCalandrelli, Riccardo1 aZhong, Sheng1 aChen, Zhen Bouman0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2022 Mar. 14, , no. 181 p.e63307-e63307dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/633073Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/63307/isolation-profiling-human-primary-mesenteric-arterial-endothelial  aDNAL 7aarticle03621naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245008800162300001800250520153800268592002801806596005901834596005901893596005901952596005902011596006502070596006302135596010502198596008902303650001902392650002202411650000802433650001302441650002102454650002402475650001302499650002002512650001102532650001302543650002402556650003502580650001202615700001402627700001802641700002102659700001302680700001502693700001402708700001402722700001702736700005502753700001602808773011602824856008202940852000903022655001203031IND60613021020221122053504.0190314e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061302102DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-018-3872-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZang, Feng10aAssociation of CXCR2 genotype variations with HCV clearance in a Chinese population  ap. 2711-2718.  aChemokines are known to play a vital role in guiding and regulating the immune response to viral infections. The chemokine CXC subfamily is a major subfamily in the chemokine family. Outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, as well as the response to treatment, depend on virus and host factors. Here we recruited chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients to perform an association study between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (CXCR2 rs1126579, CXCL10 rs8878 and CXCL10 rs3921) and HCV infection outcomes and treatment responses among a Chinese population, using primarily a TaqMan assay. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the influencing factors on HCV infection outcome and treatment response. The results showed that subjects with the CXCR2 rs1126579 TT genotype had a significantly increased possibility of HCV spontaneous clearance (Dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.06-1.64; P = 0.013). Additionally, CHC patients carrying the CXCR2 rs1126579 TT genotype were also more likely to achieve a sustained virological response (SVR) (Dominant model: adjusted OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.29-0.84; P = 0.010). We also established a predictive model for HCV treatment response including the CXCR2 rs1126579 SNP status, albumin (ALB) levels and baseline HCV RNA levels, which produced an area under the curve (AUC) of about 0.660. These findings highlight that variant CXCR2 rs1126579 genotypes are associated with HCV clearance within the Chinese population.  aPublisher supplied data  a81473029cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81703273cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81502853cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a81473028cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aBK2017041691cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  aBK20151026cNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a2016NJMUZD012cthe Science and Technology Development Fund Key Project of Nanjing Medical University  aPAPDcPriority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions 3aCXCR2 receptor 3aHepatitis C virus 3aRNA 3aalbumins 3achemokine CXCL10 3achronic hepatitis C 3agenotype 3aimmune response 3amodels 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3aviruses1 aYue, Ming1 aZhuo, Lingyun1 aWu, Ching-Ching,1 aLiu, Mei1 aYao, Yinan1 aWang, Jie1 aFeng, Yue1 aXia, Xueshan1 aHuang, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0146-921X1 aYu, Rongbin0 tArchives of virology.g2018 Oct., v. 163, no. 10 p.2711-2718dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-018-3872-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03488naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005800127300001400185500001500199520264400214592002802858650001902886650001702905650002002922653001702942700001702959700001602976700002002992773010703012852000903119939003303128946001303161655001203174IND8403621420221122183053.0181002e198402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND840362142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCOY, E. L.10aToward understanding soil water uptake by plant roots  ap. 69-77.  a2019-12-05  aWe examine plant water uptake from a uniformly rooted soil volume by numerically solving the nonlinear diffusion equation for a soil cylinder bounded externally by an insulating surface, located at the half-distance between adjacent roots and internally by the root surface. A sinusoidally varying uptake rate is employed to simulate the diurnal evaporative demand, while the actual water flux across the inner surface is controlled by the root surface matric potential through a stomatal adjustment function. The analysis is conducted for Chino clay, Pachappa sand, and Indio silt loam, using hydraulic parameters determined from piecewise continuous exponential functions of the dependent variable matching data for these soils. The analysis uses root radii of 0.003, 0.005, 0.010, and 0.020 cm and root densities of 0.080, 0.142, 0.318, and 0.650 cm root length per cubic centimeter of soil.Results show that the transient matric potential distribution in the soil depends strongly on the precise nature of the hydraulic prameters for each soil: as the soil loses water by transpiration, the value of the bulk soil matric potential decreases monotonically at a rate dependent upon the specific water capacity of the soil. For initial bulk soil potentials of −0.3 bar in the Chino and Indio, and −0.2 bar in the Pachappa, the initial rate of potential decrease with time is greatest in the Chino, followed by the Pachappa and Indio, respectively. The corresponding radial potential distribution around individual roots depends upon the instantaneous value of the soil water diffusivity, which decreases as the soil dries, creating steep potential gradients adjacent to the root, with the largest initial gradients occurring in the Chino clay, followed by equivalent gradients in the Pachappa sand and Indio silt loam. The relative rate of decrease in the bulk soil potential and the drawdown around a root for the three soils, however, changes with time as the soil dries. The drawdown around a root is reduced by increasing root densities, so that at low densities the root surface potential depends more closely upon the diffusivity, whereas at high densities the root surface potential depends more closely upon the specific water capacity. In addition, roots of smaller radii exhibit greater drawdown as the total root surface area decreases and the flux of water at the root surface increases. The simulation of root water uptake using piecewise continuous functional relationships for the diffusivity and specific capacity produces results that form a coherent illustration of plant survival in three diverse soil environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil chemistry 3asoil physics 3aplant nutrition 0asoil science1 aBoersma, L.,1 aUNGS, M.

The original subjects of securitization are the risks emerging from the aftermaths of natural disasters. The range of securitized risks has broaden rapidly over the past decade. The reason of securitization’s feasibility in transfer of agricultural risks is the spatial correlation of harvests among the producers that can result in fatal loss suffered simultaneously by many producers and subsequent producer’s insolvency to settle the insurance claims. The paper proposes the reduction of the insurer’s risk exposure by its transfer to capital markets via catastrophe bonds. A catastrophic event is defined through the relative loss of the current national per hectare yield of the particular crop to the average yield from previous years. The number of years included in the average is subject to the minimization of the relative loss’ fluctuation over the given period. The triggering probability of the catastrophe bond is calculated from the kernel estimation of the loss distribution, with the relative loss being the loss index. The general case is upgraded by the factor of soil quality. The insurer is proposed to offer the coverage according to the producers’ soil. The soil classes are securitized separately, with the set of catastrophe bonds. Both cases are illustrated by the numerical example on the data set of wheat produced in the Slovak Republic over last 45 years. The outcome of the examples are the graphs of expected payoffs depending on various parameters.  aPublisher supplied data 3abankruptcy 3acapital 3acrop insurance 3adata collection 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil classification 3asoil quality 3awheat 3aSlovakia1 aLudovit, Pinda1 aKatarina, Sakalova0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 64, no. 3 p.131-140dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/156/2016-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02631naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245013000170300001600300520138900316592002801705650001101733650002201744650002801766650002401794650001101818650000901829650001301838650001301851650001201864650001601876650001101892700002501903700002101928700002501949700001901974700002301993700002902016773007102045856008402116852000902200655001202209IND60092396720221122055852.0141103e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009239672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, Jürgen,10aTowards the perfect graphene membrane? – Improvement and limits during formation of high quality graphene grown on Cu-foils  ap. 377-390.  aWe investigated the structure and crystalline quality of monolayer graphene grown by hydrogen and methane chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on polycrystalline Cu foils. Our data show that the high temperature hydrogen pretreatment of the Cu foil has to be performed at a sufficiently high H₂ pressure in order to avoid graphene (g) formation already during the pretreatment, which limits the achievable domain size during subsequent growth in the CH₄/H₂ mixture. Methane–hydrogen CVD sustains g growth but induces the faceting of the Cu substrate. Characterization by low energy electron microscopy evidenced a staircase Cu substrate morphology of alternating (410) and (100) planes interrupted by (n11) type facets. The g flakes cover the staircase shaped support as a coherent layer. The polycrystalline film mostly contains rotational domains that are preferentially, but not strictly, aligned with respect to the stepped support surface. The substrate induced corrugated morphology occurs also underneath large single crystalline flakes and is transferred to suspended membranes, produced by etching the Cu underneath the graphene. Thus, membranes manufactured from g-Cu are non flat. This explains their reported softened elastic response and the formation of so called nanorippled graphene after transfer from the Cu support which deteriorates its electrical conductivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper 3acrystal structure 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3afoil 3agraphene 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3atemperature 3avapors1 aBöcklein, Sebastian1 aReichelt, Robert1 aGünther, Sebastian,1 aSantos, Benito1 aMenteş, Tevfik O.1 aLocatelli, Andrea Maria,0 tCarbon.g2013 Nov., v. 64 p.377-390dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.0903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010900163300001800272520106500290592002801355650003101383650002001414650001001434650003001444650003301474650001501507650002201522650002901544650002701573700001601600700001501616700001701631700001801648700001701666773010401683856008101787852000901868655001201877IND60556190120221117200525.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055619012DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2196-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Zihao10aConstruction of genetic parts from the Corynebacterium glutamicum genome with high expression activities  ap. 2119-2126.  aOBJECTIVE: To construct effective genetic expression parts controlling transcription and translation initiation for synthetic biology and heterologous expression in Corynebacterium glutamicum. RESULT: Twelve highly expressed genes were identified from the proteomic data of C. glutamicum. Their related sequences were used to construct bicistronic genetic expression parts. Each part contain promoter, 5′-UTR, N-terminal sequence of the source gene and a conserved SD sequence, associated with target gene, forming the bicistronic expression cassette. The enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression levels controlled by these novel parts have 1.4 to 790-fold increase in C. glutamicum compared with corresponding promoter-5′-UTR part. One of the bicistronic parts is 1.35 times the EGFP expression of the constitutive-expression pXMJ19. These bicistronic parts had expression advantage compared with conventional promoter-5′-UTR parts. CONCLUSION: Various genetic parts for efficient gene expression can be quickly obtained via this new method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3agene expression 3agenes 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aheterologous gene expression 3aproteomics 3asynthetic biology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLiu, Xiuxia1 aZhang, Wei1 aYang, Yankun1 aDai, Xiaofeng1 aBai, Zhonghu0 tBiotechnology letters.g2016 Dec., v. 38, no. 12 p.2119-2126dSpringer Netherlandsx0141-54927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-016-2196-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245013200171520129000303592002801593650002101621650002601642650001501668650001501683650001201698650002801710650001201738650001701750650001401767650002101781650002501802650001801827650001401845653000901859653001101868653002401879653001501903653001801918653002601936700001701962700001701979773012301996856008902119852000902208655001202217IND60684124420221118054011.0211003e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068412442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1112652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGupta, Ankit10aYihA GTPases localize to the apicoplast and mitochondrion of the malaria parasite and interact with LSU of organellar ribosomes  aThe YihA TRAFAC GTPases are critical for late-stage assembly of the ribosomal large subunit (LSU). In order to explore biogenesis of the reduced organellar ribosomes of the malaria parasite, we identified three nuclear-encoded homologs of YihA in Plasmodium falciparum. PfYihA1 targeted to the parasite apicoplast, PfYihA2 to the mitochondrion, and PfYihA3 was found in both the apicoplast and cytosol. The three PfYihA, expressed as recombinant proteins, were active GTPases and interacted with surrogate E. coli ribosomes in a nucleotide-independent manner. In vivo complexation of PfYihA with parasite organellar and/or cytosolic LSU was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using specific antibodies. Mitochondrial PfYihA2 carries a large C-ter extension with a strongly positively charged stretch. We hypothesise that this is important in compensating for the absence of helices of the central protuberance in the fragmented rRNA of Plasmodium mitoribosomes and may provide additional contact sites to aid in complex assembly. Combined with previous reports, our results indicate that P. falciparum mitochondria are likely to assemble ribosomes with the aid of PfEngA, PfObg1 and PfYihA2 GTPases while apicoplast ribosomes might use PfYihA1 and 3 in combination with other factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aantibodies 3abiogenesis 3acytosol 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3amalaria 3amitochondria 3aparasites 3aprecipitin tests 3arecombinant proteins 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 0aYihA 0aGTPase 0aRibosome biogenesis 0aApicoplast 0aMitochondrion 0aPlasmodium falciparum1 aGupta, Kirti1 aHabib, Saman0 tMolecular and biochemical parasitology.g2020 Mar., v. 236 p.111265-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl32344x0166-68517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molbiopara.2020.1112653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03163naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005500140245011800195300001800313500002000331520160200351592002801953650002501981650001602006650003002022650001302052650002602065650001702091650001302108650002002121700005502141700005402196700005502250700005402305700005902359700005602418700005602474773013902530856007502669852000902744655001202753IND60777585420221123011214.0220517e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077758542DNAL7 a10.1111/jipb.132512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Huihui1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0955-026314aThe miR157‐SPL‐CNR module acts upstream of bHLH101 to negatively regulate iron deficiency responses in tomato  ap. 1059-1075.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIron (Fe) homeostasis is critical for plant growth, development, and stress responses. Fe levels are tightly controlled by intricate regulatory networks in which transcription factors (TFs) play a central role. A series of basic helix‐loop‐helix (bHLH) TFs have been shown to contribute to Fe homeostasis, but the regulatory layers beyond bHLH TFs remain largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the SQUAMOSA PROMOTER‐BINDING PROTEIN‐LIKE (SPL) TF SlSPL‐CNR negatively regulates Fe‐deficiency responses in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots. Fe deficiency rapidly repressed the expression of SlSPL‐CNR, and Fe deficiency responses were intensified in two clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR‐associated protein 9‐generated SlSPL‐CNR knock‐out lines compared to the wild‐type. Comparative transcriptome analysis identified 47 Fe deficiency‐responsive genes the expression of which is negatively regulated by SlSPL‐CNR, one of which, SlbHLH101, helps regulate Fe uptake genes. SlSPL‐CNR localizes the nucleus and interacts with the GTAC and BOX 4 (ATTAAT) motifs in the SlbHLH101 promoter to repress its expression. Inhibition of SlSPL‐CNR expression in response to Fe deficiency was well correlated with the expression of the microRNA SlymiR157. SlymiR157‐overexpressing tomato lines displayed enhanced Fe deficiency responses, as did SlSPL‐CNR loss‐of‐function mutants. We propose that the SlymiR157‐SlSPL‐CNR module represents a novel pathway that acts upstream of SlbHLH101 to regulate Fe homeostasis in tomato roots.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3ahomeostasis 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amicroRNA 3anutrient deficiencies 3aplant growth 3atomatoes 3atranscriptomics1 aWang, Jiayi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2338-44091 aJiang, Dan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4257-46541 aHong, Yiguo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3352-96861 aXu, Jiming1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3853-67861 aZheng, Shaojian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3336-81651 aYang, Jianli1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0385-57871 aChen, Weiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9682-03150 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2022 May, v. 64, no. 5 p.1059-1075dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949844x1672-90727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.132513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02424naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159072000900168072000900177100001600186245011700202300001600319500002400335500001500359520082900374650001601203650001901219650001001238650002201248650001901270650001301289650002001302650001201322650002001334650001301354650002501367650000901392650003201401650001701433651001401450651001401464653002701478653001301505653002301518653001901541700001701560773012101577852000901698856008001707930003301787945002501820946001301845655001201858IND4416471920221120065740.0090218e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441647192DNAL7 a191985312pmid7 a10.1603/033.046.01212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL200 0aL0011 aHamm, R.

However, descriptions of the linkage and frequency of M factors in different populations throughout the world are vastly incomplete. We collected house flies from a dairy in Ipswich, Australia, and determined that M was linked to chromosomes II, III, IV, and Y. Most males (69.8%) were homozygous for M on autosome II and/or III, and 92.3% of the males had multiple M factors. In all, there were 13 different male genotypes found. The high frequency of M, the presence of M on four different linkage groups, and the large number of male genotypes found in this population make it unique relative to other populations of house flies that have been examined. 3achromosomes 3alinkage groups 3amales 3asex determination 3agene frequency 3agenotype 3aMusca domestica 2aAnimals 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenotype 2aHousefliesxgenetics 2aMale 2aSex Determination Processes 2aY Chromosome 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0asex determining factor 0aM factor 0alinkage (genetics) 0amale genotypes1 aScott, J.

C-2,4-D rapidly mineralized in the two soils maintained at 0.1 and 0.33 bar of soil-water tension. Because the total amounts of metabolites in the solvent extracts never exceeded 5% of the total C activity, the disappearance rate of extractable C essentially represented the disappearance rate of extractable C-2,4-D. Extractable C in the C-2,4-D treated soils maintained at 1 bar and below disappeared rapidly, and at the same time nonextractable C rapidly formed, whereas extractable C in soils maintained at 15 bars disappeared at much slower rates, and the formation of nonextractable C was also slower. After 14 d of slow disappearance, however, extractable C in the Cecil soil held at 15 bars started disappearing at a constant rate of 3.6% of applied C per day. The disappearance rates in soils incubated at 35°C were generally smaller than those incubated at 25°C.Even though the initial most probable number (MPN) of 2,4-D degrading microorganisms in the Cecil soil was one fourth of that in the Webster soil, the organisms propagated more rapidly in the moist Cecil soil (0.33 bar) than in the moist Webster soil in response to the application of 10 μg 2,4-D/g of soil. As a result, 2,4-D in the Cecil soil degraded at a faster rate. The growth rates of 2,4-D degrading organisms in dry soils (15 bars) were small, in spite of the rapid degradation occurring in the Cecil soil after 14 d of incubation. In addition to forming nonextractable C residues in humus components, as much as 4.2% of applied C could be associated with microbial mass.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil biology 3aagrochemicals 3apesticides 0asoil science0 tSoil science.g1984 Feb., v. 137, no. 2 p.100-107dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840407c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01897naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100003500137245008100172300001600253500002000269520076000289592002801049650002701077650002401104650001801128650002001146650002601166650001801192650001701210650001101227650001401238650001101252651001801263700002001281773014201301856007101443852000901514655001201523IND60680398620221122043602.0200105e199505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068039862DNAL7 a10.2307/12435402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeterson, E.

The estimates incorporate varying theoretical assumptions about demand, supply, and firm pricing behavior; and utilize various data sources, time periods, and assumptions about the proper competitive benchmark. While the estimates of average allocative losses range widely, there is a high degree of congruence in the rankings of economic losses due to market power.

Here, we present a bioenergetics-informed kinetic model for the anaerobic degradation of macromolecular organic matter that accounts for extracellular hydrolysis, fermentation, and respiration. The catabolic energy generated by fermentation and respiration is allocated to biomass growth, production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes, and cellular maintenance. Microbial cells are assumed to exist in active or dormant states with marked differences in maintenance energy requirements. Dormant cells are further assumed to fulfill their maintenance energy requirements by utilizing their own biomass instead of relying on external substrates. When the catabolic Gibbs energy production for a given functional group of microorganisms exceeds the total maintenance energy requirement of the active cells, biomass growth, re-activation of dormant cells, and production of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes are possible. The latter, in turn, allows the microbial community to access more of the available external organic substrates. In the opposite case, active cells decay or become dormant. We apply the model to simulate the anaerobic degradation of cellulose by a hypothetical microbial community consisting of cellulolytic fermenting bacteria and sulfate-reducing bacteria, under conditions representative of those encountered in water-saturated subsurface environments.  aThis research was funded by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) in the framework of the international research training group ‘Integrated Hydrosystem Modelling’ under grant GRK 1829, the Canada Excellence Research Chair (CERC) in Ecohydrology at the University of Waterloo, and the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFRF) through the Global Water Futures (GWF) program.  aPublisher supplied data  aGRK 1829 3aGibbs free energy 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3acellulose 3aenergy 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3akinetics 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic matter 3asimulation models 0aBioenergetics 0acellulose hydrolysis 0aenergy limitation 0amaintenance 0aorganic matter degradation 0arespiration1 aSmeaton, Christina M.1 aMarkelov, Igor1 aMarkelova, Ekaterina1 aLu, Chuanhe1 aCirpka, Olaf A.1 aCappellen, Philippe Van0 tGeomicrobiology journal.g2022 Jan. 2, v. 39, no. 1 p.1-16dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12314x1521-05297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01490451.2021.19982563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02010naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011200166300001800278520067400296592002800970650002100998650001401019650002001033650001801053650001301071650002201084650004301106650003001149650002201179650002901201650002701230700002001257700001601277700001901293700001701312700001901329700001701348700001701365773010401382856008101486852000901567655001201576IND60556190220221117200541.0170725e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055619022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10529-016-2199-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xue-Mei10aComparation of the effects of different 5′-untranslated regions (UTRs) on gene expression in HEK293 cells  ap. 2051-2057.  aOBJECTIVES: To evaluate four 5′-UTRs on GFP expression in HEK293T cells. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmids were constructed by restriction enzyme digestion, digestion and DNA sequencing. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting results showed that the transcription and translation level of PPRV-GFP mRNA was significantly lower than that of the other reporters. The transcription and translation level of ChEF1-GFP was the highest in HEK293T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Different UTRs can significantly affect protein expression.

The stability and the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of B. glabra powders were evaluated. High retentions of betacyanins (77–86%) were obtained at 30 °C after 42 days of storage. At 50 °C, took place the highest betacyanins degradation, resulting in retentions ranging from 50 to 64% in the powders containing inulin and polydextrose, respectively. Total phenolic compounds had a final retention of 49–59% and antioxidant capacity varied from 45 to 53% at 50 °C. The betacyanins degradation followed the first-order kinetic and the degradation rates ranged from 0.0030 to 0.0163 days⁻¹. The simulation of gastrointestinal digestion showed a maximum release and stability of betacyanins and phenolics in the gastric phase; however the release was slower in the powders containing inulin.

Here we jointly use UV resonance Raman (UVRR) and NMR spectroscopy to comparatively explore how the strength and distribution of hydrogen bonding and the solvation of the components are modified in ChOAc:U and ChCl:U with increasing hydration. Overall, Raman and NMR data indicate that ChOAc:U is continuously affected by hydration and, even at low water concentrations, undergoes a breakage of DES–DES interactions, with rapid solvation of the urea portion and full exchange of mobile protons. On the contrary, ChCl:U seems to maintain its structure as small interplays gradually occur between urea in the DES and the surrounding water molecules. The combined approach provides a multifaceted consistent description of the systems, outlining the crucial role of the anion in driving the structure and dynamics of the materials and then yielding valuable data toward the exploitation of DESs as tunable systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3acholine 3agreen chemistry 3ahydrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvation 3asolvents 3aurea 0adeep eutectic systems 0aNADES 0aUV resonance Raman 0anuclear magnetic resonance 0ahydrogen bond 0astructure 0adynamics1 aTortora, Mariagrazia1 aBottari, Cettina1 aColombo Dugoni, Greta1 aPivato, Roberto Vittorio1 aRossi, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1357-80741 aPaolantoni, Marco1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6266-34971 aMele, Andrea1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0351-05380 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Sept. 01, v. 9, no. 36 p.12262-12273dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c038113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245004200168300001400210520147100224592002801695650002201723650002301745650002501768650001901793650002001812650001501832650001001847650003301857650001401890650001101904650001401915650001401929650001301943650001001956650000801966650001401974650001601988650001402004650001002018651001702028653000902045653000702054653000802061653000802069653000802077653000702085653000702092653003702099653001802136653001402154700001702168700005402185773015302239856008302392852000902475655001202484IND60541476520221122222247.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054147652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPretorius, Z.A.14aThe rusts of wild rye in South Africa  ap. 94-98.  aSecale strictum subsp. africanum, a self-fertile and perennial wild rye species, is endemic to the Roggeveld Mountains of the south-western Karoo, South Africa. Despite historical abundance on the Roggeveld plateau, S. strictum subsp. africanum is currently threatened with extinction. Many reasons have been given for its decline, including susceptibility to rusts.Leaves with stem, leaf and stripe rust pustules were sampled from cultivated and naturally occurring S. strictum subsp. africanum on the farm Kanariesfontein near Sutherland. Identity of the rust pathogens was determined through infection and sequencing studies.Inoculation studies showed that stem and leaf rust collected from wild rye were avirulent on bread wheat, but virulent on Secale cereale. The stripe rust specimen was virulent on bread wheat and was identified as Puccinia striiformis race 6E16A−. Using ITS sequencing, the wild rye leaf rust specimen was confirmed as Puccinia recondita, and the stripe rust specimen as P. striiformis. ITS sequences did not distinguish between Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis, respectively the causal organisms of wheat and rye stem rust. Inoculation of wild rye plants with P. graminis f. sp. tritici proved its susceptibility to stem rust races attacking wheat and triticale.This study established that S. strictum subsp. africanum is a host for both rye and wheat stem rust, rye leaf rust and wheat stripe rust.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia graminis 3aPuccinia recondita 3aPuccinia striiformis 3aSecale cereale 3aSecale strictum 3aextinction 3afarms 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaf rust 3aleaves 3amountains 3apathogens 3aplateaus 3araces 3arye 3astem rust 3astripe rust 3avirulence 3awheat 3aSouth Africa 0aAFLP 0aIT 0aITS 0aPgt 0aPgs 0aPr 0aPs 0aSecale strictum subsp. africanum 0aRust diseases 0aRoggeveld1 aBender, C.M.1 aVisser, B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9002-30860 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Jan., v. 96 p.94-98dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2014.10.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245012000209300002000329520163700349592002801986650004402014650001602058650001102074650001402085650002102099650001102120650001302131650002002144650002102164650001102185650002402196650002102220650001702241653002002258653002002278653002402298653001802322653001902340700002602359700005702385700002102442700002002463773014602483856008502629852000902714655001202723IND60750389920221121052121.0210913e20210830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075038992DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c038802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fu Ming,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4407-355410aSynthesis and Characterization of Chelidonic Acid and Chelidamic Acid as Organic Anode Materials for Energy Storage  ap. 12286-12299.  aOrganic materials (OMs) have great potential to accept alkaline ions and thus be used in energy storage systems. Owing to their low cost, easy synthesis, and wide applications, a green battery containing an OM without any considerable production of heavy pollutants such as graphite and transition-metal oxides can be expected in the near future. In this study, two new OMs, chelidamic acid (CDA) and chelidonic acid (CDO), were prepared and investigated for energy storage. CDA and CDO have a similar molecular weight and structure but differ in the electronegative heteroatoms, the secondary amine, and the oxygen atom. This research demonstrates that the different heteroatom dramatically dominates the electrochemical behavior of these two materials. After cycling with Li⁺, composite electrodes containing CDA and CDO exhibited capacities of 740.2 and 562.8 mAh g–¹, respectively, for 250 cycles with no capacity decade. The specific surface area of CDA (2.46 m² g–¹) is twice that of CDO (1.23 m² g–¹), implying that the secondary amine changes the three-dimensional structure and leads to an interesting electrochemical activity with Li⁺. The composite electrodes containing the two OMs, especially those containing CDA, exhibited rate performance (10 C) superior to that of graphite electrodes. Ex situ Fourier transform infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies were used to investigate the reaction mechanism of these two OMs. CDA and CDO not only provide outstanding capacity, rate performance, and cycle retention with Li⁺ but also display great potential in applications with other alkaline ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aanodes 3abatteries 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3agraphene 3agreen chemistry 3amolecular weight 3aoxygen 3areaction mechanisms 3asecondary amines 3asurface area 0achelidamic acid 0achelidonic acid 0alithium-ion battery 0aalkaline ions 0aenergy storage1 aWagari Guji, Kefyalew1 aRamar, Alagar1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9378-28431 aMerinda, Laurien1 aChien, Wen-Chen0 tACS sustainable chemistry & engineering.g2021 Aug. 30, v. 9, no. 36 p.12286-12299dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.1c038803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001500186245009600201300001600297506007600313520083300389592002801222506003701250650001601287650002601303650001301329650002001342650001401362650001401376650001401390650001301404650002401417650001501441700001801456700002701474700002301501700001901524700002201543700002101565773012501586856007901711852000901790655001201799IND60300777220221207064101.0150703e20121019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6030077722DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12259742doi7 aPMC35237062pmcid7 a229365672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, Hong10aProcessing and Subcellular Trafficking of ER-Tethered EIN2 Control Response to Ethylene Gas  ap. 390-393.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCleave and Leave Plants produce ethylene gas, which acts as a hormone and is essential for the ripening of fruit, the resistance of plants to pathogens, the adaptation of plants to stress conditions, and stem cell maintenance. Although many components of the ethylene gas signaling pathway have been well studied, little is known about how the ethylene receptors located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane can transmit the signal to the nucleus. Studying Arabidopsis , Qiao et al. (p. 390, published online 30 August) found that perception of ethylene gas in the ER promotes signal transduction via cleavage and rapid ER-nucleus translocation of the cytosolic portion of the transmembrane ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 protein, which activates ethylene-dependent gene expression and other ethylene response phenotypes in plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aethylene 3agene expression 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3areceptors 3aripening 3asignal transduction 3astem cells1 aShen, Zhouxin1 aHuang, Shao-shan Carol1 aSchmitz, Robert J.1 aUrich, Mark A.1 aBriggs, Steven P.1 aEcker, Joseph R.0 tScience.g2012 Oct. 19, v. 338, no. 6105 p.390-393dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12259743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03936naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005500148245013200203300001400335520183500349592002802184650002502212650002502237650001602262650002602278650001302304650002202317650001602339650001502355650001202370650002602382650001902408650001502427650002302442650001502465650002302480650002102503650001102524650001202535650001102547650002602558650000902584650001402593650003302607650001402640650002302654650001602677650001102693650001302704650001402717650001102731651001702742651001302759653002702772653001902799653001402818653002502832653002602857700001802883700001602901700001702917700001702934700001802951773015302969856008303122852000903205655001203214IND60541476620221122033829.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054147662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMashigo, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1513-256X10aChemical variations, trichome structure and antifungal activities of essential oils of Helichrysum splendidum from South Africa  ap. 78-84.  aThe chemical profiles of essential oils isolated from nine populations of Helichrysum splendidum were obtained by gas chromatography. Plants were harvested in both summer and winter seasons in two provinces of South Africa. Essential oils originating from Limpopo Province were characterized by high levels of β-phellandrene, 1,8-cineole, δ-cadinene, α-cadinol, τ-cadinol, and β-pinene. These could be clearly distinguished through multivariate analysis from those collected in Mpumalanga Province. The Mpumalanga oils contained germacrene D, spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene as major constituents. Seasonal variations in the volatile compositions and yields were observed. A prediction model obtained through orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis was used to compare the essential oil profiles to that of a commercial H. splendidum sample, in addition to those reported for Zimbabwean specimens. One of the specimens from Zimbabwe differed substantially from all the others, indicating the existence of more chemotypes. The structures of the oil-bearing trichomes, as observed on the leaf surfaces using scanning electron microscopy, were investigated and are described for the first time. Since this investigation forms part of an ongoing screening of plants to identify natural alternatives to synthetic fungicides, the essential oils were tested in vitro against several economically important pathogens of fruit. Essential oils from Mpumalanga specimens totally inhibited the growth of Alternaria alternata from avocado and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolated from mango at a concentration of 500μL/L in a toxic medium assay. The presence of high concentrations of germacrene D, spathulenol and bicyclogermacrene probably contributed to the antifungal properties of these essential oils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aGlomerella cingulata 3aHelichrysum 3aantifungal properties 3aavocados 3abeta-phellandrene 3abeta-pinene 3achemotypes 3acineole 3adiscriminant analysis 3aessential oils 3afungicides 3agas chromatography 3agermacrene 3agrowth retardation 3ain vitro studies 3aleaves 3amangoes 3amodels 3amultivariate analysis 3aoils 3apathogens 3ascanning electron microscopy 3ascreening 3aseasonal variation 3aspathulenol 3asummer 3atoxicity 3atrichomes 3awinter 3aSouth Africa 3aZimbabwe 0aHelichrysum splendidum 0aEssential oils 0aTrichomes 0aChemometric analysis 0aFruit decay pathogens1 aCombrinck, S.1 aRegnier, T.1 aDu Plooy, W.1 aAugustyn, W.1 aMokgalaka, N.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Jan., v. 96 p.78-84dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2014.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002200141245008200163300001300245520106700258592002801325650001601353650001301369650001101382650001701393650001001410653002101420653002101441653001601462773012201478856007601600852000901676655001201685IND60777586220221122235920.0220517e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077758622DNAL7 a10.1017/jwe.2021.272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOczkowski, Edward10aEstimating Supply Functions for Wine Attributes: A Two-Stage Hedonic Approach  ap. 1-26.  aA vast body of literature exists on estimating hedonic price functions, which relate the price of wine to its attributes. Some existing literature has employed producer-specific variables such as quantity sold and producer reputation in hedonic functions to potentially capture supply influences on prices. This practice is inconsistent with the original Rosen (1974) hedonic theoretic foundation. To overcome this deficiency, we extend the literature by using the Rosen two-stage approach, employing data from multi-markets for similar wines to estimate inverse supply functions. The application to Australian produced wines sold in different countries demonstrates the importance of a wine's quality and age as attributes in inverse supply functions. Results imply the additional costs of producing better quality and older wines are increased as both quality and age are increased. Estimates also suggest that lower marginal costs for attributes are associated with a smaller producer size and older more established producers.

This pest was one of the first to evolve resistance to Bt maize expressing Cry1Ab protein. A time-line of events and contributing factors are presented, from the commencement of efficacy testing through to the present situation, where the Cry1Ab toxin has lost its efficacy against B. fusca at many localities throughout the maize producing region, and single-gene Bt maize events often require insecticide treatments for which farmers are compensated. Significant levels of pest survival on Bt maize was observed in the first season after commercial release in 1998 and confirmed seven years later. Reduced selection pressure on the target pest is the objective of insect resistance management (IRM), and strategies to accomplish this should receive highest priority. Where resistance is prevalent, the only viable options to reduce selection pressure are withdrawal of the product and/or enforcement of high-dose/refuge requirements. The latter action may however be of no value under conditions where resistance is prevalent, since the value of refugia to an IRM strategy may be compromised. Remedial actions taken in South Africa included the propagation and enforcement of refuge compliance followed by the release of pyramided maize hybrids in 2011. These pyramids combine Cry1A.105 and Cry2Ab2 toxin-producing transgenes, replacing the ineffective single-transgene. However, it remains uncertain if cross-resistance occurs between Cry1A.105/Cry2Ab2 and the closely related Cry1Ab toxin, and for how long this pyramided event will endure. Cultivation of Cry1Ab-expressing hybrids continues in areas where resistance levels have been confirmed to be high. In retrospect, this case provides lessons regarding IRM, not only in South Africa, but wherever Bt crops are being introduced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aBusseola fusca 3aZea mays 3acompliance 3acorn 3acrops 3across resistance 3afarmers 3ahybrids 3ainsecticides 3ainsects 3apest resistance 3apests 3arefuge habitats 3aresistance management 3atransgenes 3aSouth Africa 0aBt crops 0aCry1Ab 0aCry proteins 0aInsect resistance management 0aTransgenic maize1 aHilbeck, A.q(Angelika),1 aBohn, Thomas,0 tCrop protection.g2013 Dec., v. 54 p.154-160dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2013.08.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008800165300001400253520117500267592002801442650001901470650002001489650001401509650001001523650001301533650001901546650002601565650001101591650001901602650001401621650001601635650002301651700001601674700001201690700001401702700001801716773010701734856008201841852000901923655001201932IND60085321120221120225934.0141101e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008532112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Shiliang10aTG-FTIR and Py-GC–MS analysis of a model compound of cellulose – glyceraldehyde  ap. 79-85.  aThe pyrolytic characteristics of glyceraldehyde as one of the important model compounds of cellulose were examined by TG-FTIR and Py-GC–MS analysis. According to the experimental observations, the glyceraldehyde pyrolysis could be represented through two routes: (i) direct decomposition of glyceraldehyde to light fragments (such as CO, CO₂, H₂O and glycolaldehyde) and polymerization to the intermediates at low temperatures; and (ii) intermediates decomposition to high-molecular weight volatiles (such as furanone, furfural, 5-methyl furfural and 5-hydroxymethyl furfural) at higher temperatures. The possible chemical pathways for the two-step pyrolysis reactions were systematically proposed, based on the distribution of typical products at different temperatures from Py-GC–MS analysis. A two step-consecutive kinetic model was proposed to describe the process of glyceraldehyde pyrolysis. The best-fit kinetic parameters were obtained and the sensitivities of the parameters were also analyzed. All of the results and findings would help further understanding of thermal behavior of cellulose and its thermo-chemical utilization for fuels and chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acellulose 3afuels 3afurfural 3aglyceraldehyde 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3amodels 3apolymerization 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aShen, Dekui1 aHu, Jun1 aXiao, Rui1 aZhang, Huiyan0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2013 May, v. 101 p.79-85dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04649naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245014600164300001600310520332100326592002803647650002503675650001603700650001403716650002103730650001703751650003803768650001003806650001103816650001003827650001003837650001703847650001103864650001803875650002403893650001203917700001403929700001403943700001603957700001703973773012703990856007704117852000904194655001204203IND60764806420221122150910.0220409e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076480642DNAL7 a10.17221/1562-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz Páez, A.,12aA study of serum insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1) concentrations in resting untrained Andalusian horses: influence of age and gender  ap. 231-242.  aGrowth rate, tissue repair and reproductive functions are mediated by the somatotrophic axis, the growth hormone (GH) being one of its main components. GH is released in a pulsatile manner and a single measurement does not provide accurate information on the activity of the somatotrophic axis. The actions of GH on tissues are mediated by insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), mainly released by the liver, and thus, the measurement of IGF-1 could be considered a good indicator of the activity of GH and the somatotrophic axis. Serum IGF-1 concentrations are relatively stable due to its long biological half-life without obvious diurnal rhythm. Additionally, many diseases significantly alter circulating IGF-1 concentrations, leading to potential diagnostic and prognostic uses in veterinary medicine. However, serum IGF-1 concentrations are affected by many factors, such as breed, age and sex. The present study analyzes the influence of these factors on serum IGF-1 concentrations in a population of 255 Andalusian horses (141 females and 114 males), divided into age groups: 1&ndash;2, 2&ndash;3, 3&ndash;4, 4&ndash;5, 5&ndash;6 and 6&ndash;12 months and 1&ndash;2, 2&ndash;4, 4&ndash;6, 6&ndash;10 and 10&ndash;14 years. The animals belonged to six different farms located in the same geographic location and were subjected to similar feeding and management protocols. Two measurements of body size were made: height at the withers (HW) and diameter of the thorax (DTx). Blood samples were taken always in the morning, in the month of July and serum IGF-1 concentrations were measured with a sandwich ELISA after dissociation of IGF-1 from its binding proteins. It was found that age and sex significantly influenced serum IGF-1 concentrations, whereas the effects of the farm and the time of blood withdrawal were not significant. Mean serum concentrations for both males and females respectively were: 246.3 and 231.0 (1&ndash;2 months), 201.9 and 194.7 (2&ndash;3 months), 174.2 and 170.4 (3&ndash;4 months), 161.7 and 155.4 (4&ndash;5 months), 166.1 and 136.9 (5&ndash;6 months), 127.2&ndash;114.5 (6&ndash;12 months), 103.3 and 89.01 (1&ndash;2 years), 104.3 and 73.41 (2&ndash;4 years), 105.4 and 64.40 (4&ndash;6 years), 53.29 and 68.27 (6&ndash;10 years) and 59.56 and 65.53 ng/ml (10&ndash;14 years). A progressive decrease in serum IGF-1 concentrations with increased age was found for both sexes. Males aged between five and 12 months and between two and six years had significantly higher serum IGF-1 concentrations than females of the same age. Coefficients of correlation between the indicators of body size (HW and DTx) and IGF-1 were &ndash;0.800 and &ndash;0.690 for the whole population of Andalusian horses, &ndash;0.860 and &ndash;0.750 for the males and &ndash;0.740 and &ndash;630 for the females. It is concluded that serum IGF-1 concentrations in Andalusian horses are reduced with ageing, male horses of determined age groups had higher IGF-1 than the females and there are negative correlations between body size and IGF-1 concentrations. The knowledge of the normal serum IGF-1 concentrations will help us to understand the role of the somatotrophic axis in several diseases and physiological situations and will provide information for further research on this equine breed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiological half-life 3ablood serum 3abody size 3acircadian rhythm 3adissociation 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afarms 3ahorses 3aliver 3amales 3asomatotropin 3athorax 3atissue repair 3aveterinary medicine 3awithers1 aTrigo, P.1 aRiber, C.1 aMalonda, V.1 aCastejon, F.0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 56, no. 5 p.231-242dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/1562-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01855naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100004800137245009400185300001600279500002000295520068600315592002801001650002701029650001501056650001201071650002201083650001101105650001801116650002101134650001201155650001101167650002501178651001401203651001801217700001201235773014201247856007101389852000901460655001201469IND60680399420221120071027.0200105e199505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068039942DNAL7 a10.2307/12435362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeghin, John C.q(John Christopher),d1954-10aDeclining U.S. Tobacco Exports to Australia: A Derived Demand Approach to Competitiveness  ap. 260-267.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe loss of competitiveness of U.S. tobacco leaf exports to Australia is empirically investigated, using industry‐level time‐series market data. Tobacco‐relative prices, market structure, scale, Australian market distortions, and changing characteristics of cigarettes are accounted for in the investigation. A decomposition analysis reveals that a switch to lighter cigarettes and changes in the Australian domestic tobacco content policy are the major contributors to the decline of U.S. tobacco exports. Tobacco price differences between the U.S. and its competitors, alone, cannot explain the loss of competitiveness of U.S. tobacco in Australian cigarette manufacturing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural economics 3acigarettes 3aexports 3aissues and policy 3aleaves 3amanufacturing 3amarket structure 3amarkets 3aprices 3atime series analysis 3aAustralia 3aUnited States1 aHu, Fan0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1995 May, v. 77, no. 2 p.260-267dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44932x0002-90927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/12435363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017000164300001400334520166500348592002802013650001102041650001702052650002602069650001502095650002002110650002602130650001502156650002102171650001102192650002702203650001002230650001102240650000902251650002702260650002002287650001102307700001502318700001702333700001402350773008902364856008102453852000902534655001202543IND60124478220221122000450.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012447822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2371-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiederer, M.10aPartitioning NEE for absolute C input into various ecosystem pools by combining results from eddy-covariance, atmospheric flux partitioning and 13CO 2 pulse labeling  ap. 61-76.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: The complexity of ecosystem processes, especially under continuously changing environmental conditions, requires high-resolution insight into ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes. It is essential to gain not only information about relative C balance and fluxes (common for partitioning studies), but also to obtain these in absolute mass units. METHODS: To evaluate absolute fluxes in belowground C pools, the results of 21-day eddy-covariance and stable isotope labeling experiment in summer 2010, were combined. Eddy-covariance based net ecosystem exchange was measured on extensively managed grassland and separated into underlying assimilation and ecosystem respiration through the use of a C flux partitioning model. Resultant CO₂assimilation served as absolute C input into the ecosystem and was further partitioned by applying the relative C distribution in subsidiary pools, gained by¹³C pulse labeling and tracing. RESULTS: The results form eddy-covariance measurements showed that the extensively managed grassland was a significant net C sink of −91 g C m⁻²a⁻¹in 2010. The mean daily assimilation of −7.1 g C m⁻²d⁻¹was partitioned into fluxes of 2.5, 0.8, 0.5, 2.3 and 1.0 g C m⁻²d⁻¹into shoots, roots, soil, shoot respiration and CO₂efflux from soil, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combination of EC measurements with isotope labeling techniques allowed determining the absolute C input into several ecosystem pools. Hence, the study demonstrates an approach to expand atmospheric flux measurements and to gain insight into the importance of individual ecosystem pools for soil C cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecosystem respiration 3aecosystems 3aeddy covariance 3aenvironmental factors 3agrasslands 3aisotope labeling 3amodels 3anet ecosystem exchange 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3astable isotopes 3asummer1 aPausch, J.1 aKuzyakov, Y.1 aFoken, T.0 tPlant and soil.g2015 May, v. 390, no. 1-2 p.61-76dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2371-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245009600157300001400253520149100267592002801758650001101786650002401797650001701821650001001838653001901848653002401867653001801891653001601909700001901925700002401944700001401968773012301982856007502105852000902180655001202189IND60777586420221123000616.0220517e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077758642DNAL7 a10.1017/jwe.2022.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Chenyu10aWine Review Descriptors as Quality Predictors: Evidence from Language Processing Techniques  ap. 64-80.  aThere is an ongoing debate on whether wine reviews provide meaningful information on wine properties and quality. However, few studies have been conducted aiming directly at comparing the utility of wine reviews and numeric measurements in wine data analysis. Based on data from close to 300,000 wines reviewed by Wine Spectator, we use logistic regression models to investigate whether wine reviews are useful in predicting a wine's quality classification. We group our sample into one of two binary quality brackets, wines with a critical rating of 90 or above and the other group with ratings of 89 or below. This binary outcome constitutes our dependent variable. The explanatory variables include different combinations of numerical covariates such as the price and age of wines and numerical representations of text reviews. By comparing the explanatory accuracy of the models, our results suggest that wine review descriptors are more accurate in predicting binary wine quality classifications than are various numerical covariates—including the wine's price. In the study, we include three different feature extraction methods in text analysis: latent Dirichlet allocation, term frequency-inverse document frequency, and Doc2Vec text embedding. We find that Doc2Vec is the best performing feature extraction method that produces the highest classification accuracy due to its capability of using contextual information from text documents.

The tests were carried out on the biomass components, their mixtures and real wood (birch wood), using thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) and pyrolysis coupled to mass spectrometry technique (Py-MS). The main criteria chosen to study the additivity of thermal behaviour were: the mass loss of the samples (C.R %), the temperature of the maximum mass loss (Tₘ) and the initial degradation temperature (Tᵢ). Furthermore, to highlight the primary reactions of thermal behaviour of the studied samples, the chemical composition of emitted vapours was analysed and the influence of some mineral salts (MgCl₂, NiCl₂) on pyrolysis primary mechanisms was also investigated. Considering the large data sets collected (integrated MS intensities of 19 selected ions), principal component analysis (PCA) was used to provide a tool to simplify pyrolysis data interpretation. Considering mineral effects, it is possible to favour some primary mechanisms: dehydration (inducing to char formation); ring opening (with gas and light vapours formation) and depolymerisation (with sugars, pyrans and furans formation). MgCl₂ catalyses inter (or intra) molecular dehydration. However, NiCl₂ does not catalyse the mentioned primary reactions but appreciably modifies the emitted gas and vapours composition. With the help of the PCA calculations, the effect of metallic salts on xylan and ternary mixtures was evidenced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3adata collection 3adepolymerization 3afurans 3aions 3amagnesium chloride 3amass spectrometry 3aprincipal component analysis 3apyrans 3apyrolysis 3asugars 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 3avapors 3awood 3axylan1 aBensakhria, A.1 aWeber, J.V.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2013 May, v. 101 p.111-121dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.02.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02030naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245011900168300001600287520075900303592002801062650002301090650001301113650001501126650001701141650000901158650001501167650001001182650001801192650002001210653003801230653001401268653001701282653001101299653002401310700001401334700001801348700001501366700001401381700001801395773007701413856008501490852000901575655001201584IND60563715920221119120417.0170713e20160401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056371592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2015.12.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Xiao-Jun10aSelective detection of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol based on a fluorescent nanoscale bis(8-hydroxyquinoline) metal complex  ap. 319-323.  aThe reliable and accurate detection of explosives such as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) is in high demand for homeland security and public safety. Although extremely high sensitivity towards TNT has been demonstrated, detection of TNP remains a challenge. In this work, a fluorescent nanoscale complex composed of bis(8-hydroxyquinoline) and Al3+ ions has been prepared, characterized and applied in detection of TNP. This complex exhibits the ability to sense the nitro explosive TNP via a fluorescence quenching mechanism with high selectivity. A simple paper test system for the rapid monitoring of TNP was also investigated. The results show that Bhq-Al is a quite ideal sensing material for trace-level detection of TNP.  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3aaluminum 3aexplosives 3afluorescence 3aions 3amonitoring 3apaper 3apublic safety 3atrinitrotoluene 0aBis(8-hydroxyquinoline)-Aluminium 0aExplosive 0aFluorescence 0aSensor 0aInner filter effect1 aQi, Liang1 aGao, Xiang-Yu1 aWang, Huan1 aHuo, Yuan1 aZhang, Zhi-Qi0 tTalanta.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 150 p.319-323dElsevier B.V.x0039-91407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2015.12.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002800153245016100181520167300342592002802015650001302043650002202056650001502078650001102093650002002104650001302124650002402137650001402161650001002175650001702185650001302202650001002215650001102225650001802236650001102254650001402265650001802279650001702297650001902314650001002333650001002343651001002353651001202363653001702375653002202392653001602414653001802430700002802448700003002476773011502506856008802621852000902709655001202718IND60684125620221118054126.0200509e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068412562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1049252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdeniran, Paul Olalekan12aA meta-analysis of Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence, genotypes and risk factors among food animals in West African countries from public health perspectives  aToxoplasma gondii has been incriminated as an important opportunistic zoonotic protozoan parasite in food animals. A West African meta-analysis was conducted to assess the seroprevalence, genotypes and risk factors of T. gondii infection in food animals. Databases were searched electronically, considering T. gondii infection in cattle, goats, sheep, pigs and chickens. These were conducted to estimate overall pooled seroprevalence, confidence intervals at 95 % (CI) and heterogeneity using quality effects model. Qualitative data on risk factors to determine effects on human populace and possible control strategies were evaluated. Pooled seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies for food animals was 25.5 % (18.9–32.8); and for each animal namely cattle, sheep, goats, pigs and chickens were 16.3, 29.1, 18.1, 35.9 and 36.0 %, respectively. Most studied food animals were observed in Nigeria, while the highest seroprevalence was observed in examined goats from Republic of Benin, the lowest was in cattle from the same country. Substantial variability (Q = 2759.5; I² = 98.3; Qi = 17.3; df = 48) among studies and lack of publication bias (LFK index = -0.08) in overall assessment was observed. In spite of the high seroprevalence in food animals, awareness and research activities in most endemic West African countries is low. Failure to associate the common risk factors have limited the reliable estimation of T. gondii infection. Therefore, more efforts are needed in awareness campaign, management practises, careful treatment of contaminated environment with cat faeces, among other measures to assist in the prevention of T. gondii in food animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aantibodies 3acattle 3acattle diseases 3achickens 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3afeces 3afood animals 3agenotype 3agoats 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3amodels 3aparasites 3apublic health 3arisk factors 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3aswine 3aBenin 3aNigeria 0aFood animals 0aToxoplasma gondii 0aWest Africa 0aMeta-analysis1 aOmolabi, Kehinde Foluke1 aAdemola, Isaiah Oluwafemi0 tPreventive veterinary medicine.g2020 Mar., v. 176 p.104925-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34182x0167-58777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2020.1049253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245011400170300001500284520141800299592002801717650001501745650001001760650001601770650002201786650001501808650001501823650001401838650001301852650004101865650001001906650001301916650001901929650001101948650001801959650001101977650001401988650001302002650001602015650002202031650001302053700002502066700002502091700002502116700001902141700002402160773010802184856008202292852000902374655001202383IND60085321520221120225613.0141101e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008532152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2013.02.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCandelier, Kévin10aThermodesorption coupled to GC–MS to characterize volatiles formation kinetic during wood thermodegradation  ap. 96-102.  aIdentification of volatile degradation products generated and released during wood mild pyrolysis is important to better understand thermodegradation mechanisms. Previous studies have shown that thermodesorption coupled to GC–MS is an attractive tool to characterize and quantify products formed during wood thermal treatment indicating higher susceptibility of hardwoods to thermodegradation compare to softwoods. The aim of this study is to elucidate wood thermodegradation pathways with special emphasis on the kinetics reactions. To achieve this objective, one hardwood species (beech) and one softwood species (Silver fir) were subjected to thermal treatment directly in the thermal desorption glass tube of thermodesorber connected to GC–MS using helium as carrier and at temperatures of 210 and 230°C for different times ranging from 10 to 80min. The volatiles compounds formed were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy. From GC–MS data collected in this study, the kinetic curves of the formation of some of the products as a function of thermal treatment duration were established. Assuming that acetic acid and furfural were formed from hemicelluloses and vanillin from lignin, Arrhenius equation was used to estimate the mean activation energy formation of these two degradation by-products allowing obtaining indirect information on the thermal stability of both polymer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbies alba 3aFagus 3aacetic acid 3aactivation energy 3abyproducts 3adesorption 3aequations 3afurfural 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglass 3ahardwood 3aheat treatment 3ahelium 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3apyrolysis 3asoftwood 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3avanillin1 aDumarçay, Stéphane1 aPétrissans, Anélie1 aPétrissans, Mathieu1 aKamdem, Pascal1 aGérardin, Philippe0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2013 May, v. 101 p.96-102dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2013.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009500165300001300260520141300273592002801686650001101714650001201725650001901737650001101756650001701767650001301784650001601797650001101813650001701824650001301841650001501854650001601869650001001885650000901895650001401904650003801918700002201956700002301978700002002001700002302021773008802044856008102132852000902213655001202222IND60124478520221122044034.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012447852DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-014-2375-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColzi, Ilaria10aLinking root traits to copper exclusion mechanisms in Silene paradoxa L. (Caryophyllaceae)  ap. 1-15.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Copper is one of the most important pollutants in mine-contaminated soils. This study tests the response in a sensitive population vs a tolerant one of the model species Silene paradoxa in order to understand the general mechanisms of tolerance at the micromorphological and ultrastructural level. METHODS: Two populations of Silene paradoxa were grown in hydroponics and exposed to different CuSO₄treatments. The roots were investigated with light, fluorescence and transmission electron microscope. Callose and lignin were spectrophotometrically determined. RESULTS: The tolerant population constitutively possessed a higher amount of mucilage and was able to reduce the length of the zone between the apex and the first lignified tracheids. Callose production decreased. It did not show remarkable copper-induced ultrastructural modifications, apart from the presence of precipitates in the tangential walls. The sensitive population showed huge nucleoli with a spongy periphery in the central cylinder together with the presence of electrondense granules in the mitochondria. Plastids were rarely observed and generally very electrondense and elongated. CONCLUSIONS: n the copper tolerant population of S. paradoxa some of the root traits concurring to generate metal-excluding roots were suggested to be mucilage and lignin production and the reduction of the subapical root zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSilene 3acallose 3acell nucleolus 3acopper 3afluorescence 3agranules 3ahydroponics 3alignin 3amitochondria 3aplastids 3apollutants 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil 3atracheids 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aPignattelli, Sara1 aGiorni, Elisabetta1 aPapini, Alessio1 aGonnelli, Cristina0 tPlant and soil.g2015 May, v. 390, no. 1-2 p.1-15dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2375-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02790naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245015200168300001400320500001500334520106100349592002801410650001701438650002201455650002101477650003201498650002201530650003101552650002401583650001201607650002501619650001501644650001801659653003701677653000801714653001701722653000801739653002901747653000801776653000801784653000801792653000801800653001201808653002301820653000801843653002901851653000801880653000701888653000801895653000801903700002101911700002301932773015301955856008302108852000902191655001202200IND60541477120221123004407.0190318e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054147712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2014.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhanati, Faezeh10aPartial clarification of signaling pathway of taxanes increase biosynthesis by low intensity ultrasound treatment in hazel (Corylus avellana) cells  ap. 65-70.  a2019-12-06  aThe formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and hydroxyl radicals after exposure of suspension-cultured hazel (Corylus avellana) cells to low intensity ultrasound and role of H2O2 signaling pathway in taxanes biosynthesis was investigated. Formation of reactive oxygen species was observed in the culture medium after sonication with 29KHz continuous ultrasound at 4mW/cm2 intensity for8–40min. Sonication of the cells for 20min remarkably increased the yields of three major taxanes, i.e., paclitaxel, 10-deacetyl baccatin, and baccatin III (up to 6.07, 2.76, and 1.7mg/kg, respectively). Enhancement of lipoxygenase, phenylalanine ammonialyase, and 1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase activities was also observed in ultrasound-treated cells. The results suggest that formation of H2O2 in the extracellular medium is induced by ultrasound and might first be recognized by the membrane associated receptor which then induces taxanes production by activating the signaling pathway of the plant defense response to transmit the eliciting signal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosynthesis 3ahydroxyl radicals 3aCorylus avellana 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alinoleate 13S-lipoxygenase 3asignal transduction 3ataxanes 3aultrasonic treatment 3apaclitaxel 3aculture media 0aPhenylalanine ammonialyase (PAL) 0aGAP 0alipoxygenase 0aMEP 0aHydrogen peroxide (H2O2) 0aLOX 0aPAL 0aDXP 0aLSD 0aTaxanes 0aLipoxygenase (LOX) 0aIPP 0aLow intensity ultrasound 0aPAM 0aMJ 0aDXR 0aDXS1 aSafari, Masoumeh1 aHajnorouzi, Abazar0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2015 Jan., v. 96 p.65-70dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2014.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011900166300001600285500001100301520070500312592002801017650002301045650001901068650001101087650002101098650001401119650001301133650002201146650002401168650001801192650001101210700001901221700001501240700001601255700001701271700002001288700002101308700001701329773007101346856008401417852000901501655001201510IND60092398520221122055821.0141103e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009239852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Rong10aSpray coating as a simple method to prepare catalyst for growth of diameter-tunable single-walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 537-540.  aLETTER  aSpray coating is proposed as an optional wet method for preparing nano-sized particles suitable for the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). The obtained SWCNT films are characterized by Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy, and are confirmed to be comparable to SWCNTs produced by the conventional dip-coating process in terms of crystallinity, tube diameter and carbon yield. The mean diameter of SWCNTs can be effectively reduced from 1.85 to 1.35nm by prolonging the deposition of Mo. In addition, spray coating allows catalyst preparation on supports other than flat wafers, as demonstrated by the synthesis of high-quality SWCNTs on Al₂O₃ fiber and quartz wool supports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aaluminum oxide 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3acatalysts 3acoatings 3acrystal structure 3aelectron microscopy 3ananoparticles 3aquartz1 aZeng, Haiqiang1 aSu, Yuquan1 aGui, Xuchun1 aWu, Tianzhun1 aEinarsson, Erik1 aMaruyama, Shigeo1 aTang, Zikang0 tCarbon.g2013 Nov., v. 64 p.537-540dElsevier Ltdx0008-62237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2013.07.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01600naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010100129300001600230520086300246592002801109650001201137650001201149700002101161773010901182852000901291939003301300946001301333655001201346IND8200000720221120041532.0181002e198112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820000072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWALDRON, L.

We measured Youngʼs moduli, tensile strengths, and diameters of pine and barley roots, finding that both moduli and strengths decreased with increasing root diameter. These data and root diameter distributions in the shear zone of 0.25-meter diameter (pine) and 0.1-meter diameter (barley) soil columns were applied to the model. Comparison of model simulations with experiments showed that ø', the strength of the soil-root bond, is the most important unmeasured model parameter. Its value, rather than root strength, limited root reinforcement in saturated clay loam with both plant species and was of the order of 25 grams per square centimeter.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasses 3alegumes1 aDAKESSIAN, SUREN0 tSoil science.g1981 Dec., v. 132, no. 6 p.427-435dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19820107c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03446naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245014800176300001400324520178300338592002802121650001702149650002102166650001902187650001802206650001602224650001302240650001202253650001902265650000702284650001502291650002002306650002402326650001102350650001602361653003202377653001502409653001602424653002002440653001602460653002502476653001802501653001302519653001602532700002502548700002302573700002102596700003002617700002902647773012502676856008202801852000902883655001202892IND60638022120221122200403.0190711e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063802212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ejbt.2019.04.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanyachanakul, Titiporn10aDevelopment of biodegradation process for Poly(DL-lactic acid) degradation by crude enzyme produced by Actinomadura keratinilytica strain T16-1  ap. 52-57.  aPlastic waste is a serious problem because it is difficult to degrade, thereby leading to global environment problems. Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, and it can be degraded by various enzymes produced by microorganisms. This study focused on the scale-up and evaluated the bioprocess of PLA degradation by a crude microbial enzyme produced by Actinomadura keratinilytica strain T16-1 in a 5 L stirred tank bioreactor.PLA degradation after 72 h in a 5 L bioreactor by using the enzyme of the strain T16-1 under controlled pH conditions resulted in lactic acid titers (mg/L) of 16,651 mg/L and a conversion efficiency of 89% at a controlled pH of 8.0. However, the PLA degradation process inadvertently produced lactic acid as a potential inhibitor, as shown in our experiments at various concentrations of lactic acid. Therefore, the dialysis method was performed to reduce the concentration of lactic acid. The experiment with a dialysis bag achieved PLA degradation by weight loss of 99.93%, whereas the one without dialysis achieved a degradation of less than approximately 14.75%. Therefore, the dialysis method was applied to degrade a commercial PLA material (tray) with a conversion efficiency of 32%, which was 6-fold more than that without dialysis.This is the first report demonstrating the scale-up of PLA degradation in a 5 L bioreactor and evaluating a potential method for enhancing PLA degradation efficiency.How to cite: Panyachanakul T, Sorachart B, Lumyong S, et al.

Useful tools for the identification of water sources and flow paths under different wetness conditions are isotope tracers. However, very few studies have been carried out so far in urbanized catchments with complex land use distributions where natural headwaters interact with engineered components, e.g. effluent discharge. We undertook spatio-temporal sampling of isotopes, combined with water quality measurements, to complement climatic and hydrometric data across the 220 km² peri-urban Erpe catchment near Berlin and assess seasonal changes in water sources during two exceptionally warm and dry years (2018 and 2019). The study showed a deterioration of water quality downstream of two municipal wastewater treatment plants; and the depletion of groundwater storage, along with isotopic enrichment of the stream, in summer 2019 (the second consecutive year with above-average temperatures and marked precipitation deficits). Streamflow in the upper reaches of the catchment was dominated by groundwater-fed tributaries in winter, but became increasingly dominated by wastewater in summer. In the lower catchment, flows were dominated by effluent from a large wastewater treatment plant, especially in summer. Young water from precipitation and urban storm runoff accounted for < 10 % of streamflow, despite the catchment being ~ 20 % urban. Similarities in the composition of wastewater and other runoff sources resulted in high uncertainties in end member separation and highlight the need for monitoring of other tracers to better characterize water impacts. Given climate change projections for the region are for drier, warmer summers, wastewater is likely to become a more dominant component of streams, which may have implications for environmental quality and ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3aisotopic enrichment 3aland use 3amunicipal wastewater 3astormwater 3astream flow 3astreams 3asummer 3aurbanization 3awastewater treatment 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awinter 0aEcohydrology 0aStable isotopes 0aHydrogeochemistry 0aTracers 0aPeri-urban catchments 0aWastewater effluents1 aTetzlaff, Doerthe1 aSoulsby, Chris0 tJournal of hydrology.g2021 Sept., v. 600 p.126685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl46539x0022-16947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2021.1266853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05303naa a2200781 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245011400200300001800314500002000332520202000352592002802372596007002400596004502470596008302515596008302598596008302681596003402764596003002798596005502828596005502883596005502938596005502993596005503048596004703103596005503150596005003205596004903255650001203304650001003316650001103326650001703337650002003354650001803374650001703392650001303409650001503422650002003437650002203457650002103479650002103500650001503521651001303536700001903549700002203568700005903590700006003649700006203709700006003771700002703831700006403858700006003922700002303982700006604005700002004071700006404091700007104155700002204226700005504248773012404303856007304427852000904500655001204509IND60620623120221118044637.0181114e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062062312DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.144432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLennox, Gareth D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4285-055110aSecond rate or a second chance? Assessing biomass and biodiversity recovery in regenerating Amazonian forests  ap. 5680-5694.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSecondary forests (SFs) regenerating on previously deforested land account for large, expanding areas of tropical forest cover. Given that tropical forests rank among Earth’s most important reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity, SFs play an increasingly pivotal role in the carbon cycle and as potential habitat for forest biota. Nevertheless, their capacity to regain the biotic attributes of undisturbed primary forests (UPFs) remains poorly understood. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of SF recovery, using extensive tropical biodiversity, biomass, and environmental datasets. These data, collected in 59 naturally regenerating SFs and 30 co‐located UPFs in the eastern Amazon, cover >1,600 large‐ and small‐stemmed plant, bird, and dung beetles species and a suite of forest structure, landscape context, and topoedaphic predictors. After up to 40 years of regeneration, the SFs we surveyed showed a high degree of biodiversity resilience, recovering, on average among taxa, 88% and 85% mean UPF species richness and composition, respectively. Across the first 20 years of succession, the period for which we have accurate SF age data, biomass recovered at 1.2% per year, equivalent to a carbon uptake rate of 2.25 Mg/ha per year, while, on average, species richness and composition recovered at 2.6% and 2.3% per year, respectively. For all taxonomic groups, biomass was strongly associated with SF species distributions. However, other variables describing habitat complexity—canopy cover and understory stem density—were equally important occurrence predictors for most taxa. Species responses to biomass revealed a successional transition at approximately 75 Mg/ha, marking the influx of high‐conservation‐value forest species. Overall, our results show that naturally regenerating SFs can accumulate substantial amounts of carbon and support many forest species. However, given that the surveyed SFs failed to return to a typical UPF state, SFs are not substitutes for UPFs.  aPublisher supplied data  aSEG:02.08.06.005.00cEmpresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária  aDP120100797cAustralian Research Council  a400640/2012-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a458022/2013-6cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a574008/2008-0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cThe Nature Conservancy Brasil  a17-023cDarwin Initiative  aNE/F015356/2cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/F01614X/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/G000816/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/K016431/1cNatural Environment Research Council  aNE/l018123/1cNatural Environment Research Council  a2013-1571cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas  aProject 691053-ODYSSEAcH2020‐MSCA‐RISE‐2015  a307788/ 2017-2cCNP productivity scholarships  a308205/2014-6cCNP productivity scholarships 3abiomass 3abirds 3acarbon 3acarbon cycle 3adata collection 3adeforestation 3adung beetles 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3aprimary forests 3asecondary forests 3aspecies richness 3atropical forests 3aunderstory 3aAmazonia1 aGardner, Toby,1 aThomson, James R.1 aFerreira, Joice1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4008-23411 aBerenguer, Erika1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8157-87921 aLees, Alexander C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7603-90811 aMac Nally, Ralph1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4473-16361 aAragão, Luiz E.

Trip duration was measured by electronic devices rather than human observation. Instrumentation had no significant effect on foraging trip duration. Most of the variation in foraging trip duration was attributed to individual and year. Males' trips were significantly shorter than females' in a subset of known-sex birds. No effect was evident in nesting success even for birds that wore instruments for >20 days.

Even though crayfish cannot directly specify the substances that cause water quality deterioration, they can immediately (within a few seconds) warn humans of water quality deterioration via acute changes in their cardiac and behavioral activities. In this study, we present a noninvasive method that is simple enough to be implemented under various conditions due to a combination of simplicity and reliability in one model. This approach, in which the biological organisms are implemented into environmental evaluation processes, provides a reliable and timely alarm for warning of and preventing acute water deterioration in an ambient environment. Therefore, this noninvasive system based on crayfish physiological and ethological parameter recordings was investigated for the detection of changes in an aquatic environment. This system is now applied at a local brewery for controlling quality of the water used for beverage production, but it can be used at any water treatment and supply facility for continuous, real-time water quality evaluation and for regular laboratory investigations of crayfish cardiac physiology and behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3abeverages 3acrayfish 3aenvironmental assessment 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3amodels 3aphysiology 3awater quality 3awater treatment1 aLožek, Filip1 aCísař, Petr1 aPautsina, Aliaksandr1 aBuřič, Miloš1 aKozák, Pavel,0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2019 Feb. 06, , no. 144 p.e58555-e58555dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/585553Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/58555/continuous-noninvasive-measuring-crayfish-cardiac-behavioral  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100006100189245013600250300001600386506007600402520158800478592002802066506003702094650002102131650002502152650001402177650002502191650001002216650003002226650000902256650001402265650002002279650001302299650002602312650001702338653002202355653001002377653001302387653003102400653001802431773012102449856008202570852000902652655001202661IND60565399320221207084620.0170711e20170429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056539932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.0662doi7 aPMC54621072pmcid7 a283227852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanungo, Jyotshna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0283-972910aPuromycin-resistant lentiviral control shRNA vector, pLKO.1 induces unexpected cellular differentiation of P19 embryonic stem cells  ap. 481-485.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRNA silencing is used as a common method for investigating loss-of-function effects of genes of interest. In mammalian cells, RNA interference (RNAi) or RNA silencing can be achieved by transient siRNA (small or short interfering RNA) transfection or by stable shRNA (short hairpin RNA) systems. Various vectors are used for efficient delivery of shRNA. Lentiviral vectors offer an efficient delivery system for stable and long-term expression of the shRNA in mammalian cells. The widely used lentiviral pLKO.1 plasmid vector is very popular in RNAi studies. A large RNAi database, a TRC (the RNAi Consortium) library, was established based on the pLKO.1-TRC plasmid vector. This plasmid (also called pLKO.1-puro) has a puromycin-resistant gene for selection in mammalian cells along with designs for generating lentiviral particles as well for RNA silencing. While using the pLKO.1-puro TRC control shRNA plasmid for transfection in murine P19 embryonic stem (ES) cells, it was unexpectedly discovered that this plasmid vector induced robust endodermal differentiation. Since P19 ES cells are pluripotent and respond to external stimuli that have the potential to alter the phenotype and thus its stemness, other cell types used in RNA silencing studies do not display the obvious effect and therefore, may affect experiments in subtle ways that would go undetected. This study for the first time provides evidence that raises concern and warrants extreme caution while using the pLKO.1-puro control shRNA vector because of its unexpected non-specific effects on cellular integrity.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3acell differentiation 3adatabases 3aembryonic stem cells 3agenes 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amice 3aphenotype 3aplasmid vectors 3aplasmids 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 0aLentiviral vector 0ashRNA 0aES cells 0aEndodermal differentiation 0aRetinoic acid0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2017 Apr. 29, v. 486 p.481-485dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.03.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013100166300001800297520158700315592002801902650001201930650003501942650001001977650002001987650001902007650001902026650002502045650002302070650001502093651000902108700006002117700002702177773012702204856008302331852000902414655001202423IND60679231320221122052329.0200304e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067923132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-019-02434-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeissi, Lamya10aSite Selection of Different Irrigation Systems Using an Analytical Hierarchy Process Integrated with GIS in a Semi-Arid Region  ap. 4955-4967.  aSite selection of different irrigation systems can lead to higher water productivity in drought conditions. The present study intends to evaluate suitable regions along the Izeh plain (Iran) for different pressurized and gravitational irrigation systems using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) based on Geographic Information System (GIS). To that end, a variety of inputs such as climate, topography, skilled labor and system costs, etc. were identified and classified into two main categories of socio-economic and environmental criteria. Each criterion was subdivided into several criteria to make the site selection more specific. A matrix of the pair-wise comparison was, in turn, used to compare these criteria and sub-criteria, and to evaluate them based on their relative importance based on the region’s suitability for different irrigation system alternatives. Geographical layers were then obtained for each sub-criterion to select the most suitable sites for different irrigation systems in the study area. Pressurized irrigation systems including wheel move irrigation system, drip irrigation system and solid-set sprinkler irrigation system, together with gravitational irrigation systems consisting of surface irrigation system, and low-pressure irrigation system were considered as irrigation system alternatives during the site selection process in this study. The result map of site selection for different alternatives showed that surface irrigation, drip irrigation and low pressure systems were the best irrigation system alternatives for the region studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3ageographic information systems 3alabor 3amicroirrigation 3asemiarid zones 3asocioeconomics 3asprinkler irrigation 3asurface irrigation 3atopography 3aIran1 aAlbaji, Mohammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5483-58341 aNasab, Saeed Boroomand0 tWater resources management.g2019 Nov., v. 33, no. 14 p.4955-4967dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02434-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02533naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245013900207500001900346520112400365592002801489650002901517650001101546650001101557650002201568650003501590650001701625650001201642651002001654653002601674653002101700653001601721653001901737653001701756653001901773700006101792700006201853773011701915856008202032852000902114655001202123IND60729103320221119065718.0210519e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072910332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1259822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Houdt, Shaya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4290-359310aStakeholder attitudes toward the incentives used to mitigate human-elephant conflict in southern Africa: A news media content analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAfrican elephant populations are under substantial anthropogenic pressure, but these are not spatially homogenous. Elephant densities are high in parts of southern Africa, leading to conflict with human populations. Conservationists working to mitigate impacts of human-elephant conflict (HEC) will turn to mechanisms or incentives to achieve this, mostly financial (such as compensation, or income generation through tourism). Little is known about the attitudes of stakeholders' (such as farmers) toward financial incentives used to mitigate conflict. Here we carried out a content analysis of stakeholder evaluative expression, or valence, using reports from the southern African news media. We sourced 428 separate news articles over the past ten years, and quantitatively assessed stakeholder valence on the financial mechanisms used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. We found that stakeholder attitudes or valence differed across countries and that stakeholders were generally positive, even with regard to controversial mechanisms such as trophy hunting. Our work has some implication for conservation policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3ahumans 3aincome 3aissues and policy 3anatural resources conservation 3astakeholders 3atourism 3aSouthern Africa 0aAfrican bush elephant 0aContent analysis 0aIvory sales 0aTrophy hunting 0aCompensation 0aPublic opinion1 aBrown, Richard P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2401-60771 aTraill, Lochran W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5704-108X0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2021 June, v. 61 p.125982-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2021.1259823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245009800165300001800263520176600281592002802047596010302075650002002178650001202198650001102210650002202221650002102243650001502264650001302279650001502292650000902307650001102316650001602327650002002343650001502363700003102378700001702409773012702426856008302553852000902636655001202645IND60679231420221122052226.0200304e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067923142DNAL7 a10.1007/s11269-019-02398-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShirisha, P.10aReal-Time Flow Forecasting in a Watershed Using Rainfall Forecasting Model and Updating Model  ap. 4799-4820.  aWatershed is the basic unit for studying different hydrologic processes. Flow forecasting in a watershed is dependent upon the rainfall. The effect of erroneous rainfall prediction is a source of uncertainty in flow forecasting. In this study, a model is proposed to improve the flow forecasting on real-time basis. The proposed model has three components (1) Adaptive Grey Rainfall Forecasting Model, (2) Rainfall-Runoff Model and (3) Fuzzy Updating Model. The proposed forecasting model is tested for lead periods of 1 to 3 h with hourly rainfall and discharge data. In this study, four different cases using combination of three models are discussed and the results are compared. The study has been carried out on three Indian watersheds namely Banha, Harsul and Khadakohol. The performance of the model is measured using Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (E), Correlation Coefficient (r), Error of Peak Discharge (EQₚₑₐₖ) and Error of Time to Peak (ETₚₑₐₖ). It is observed that the case with integration of all three models performed good with a forecasting efficiency of E = 0.950, 0.861, 0.564; and r = 0.991, 0.972, 0.897 for lead-1, 2, 3 respectively for Banha watershed. For Harsul watershed, E = 0.898, 0.704, 0.367; and r = 0.985, 0.949, 0.834 for lead-1, 2, 3 respectively. For Khadakohol watershed, E = 0.968, 0.932, 0.787; and r = 0.994, 0.987, 0.951 for lead-1, 2, 3 respectively. EQₚₑₐₖ is less than 10% for lead-1 for most of the events and increased slightly for lead-2 and lead-3. ETₚₑₐₖ is 0 h for all lead periods of the three watersheds. The proposed model is useful for farmers in planning and monitoring of water resources for crop management and helps in taking necessary actions during heavy rains and floods.  aPublisher supplied data  aDST/TM/WTI/2K12/47(G)cDepartment of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology () 3acrop management 3afarmers 3afloods 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3amonitoring 3aplanning 3aprediction 3arain 3arunoff 3auncertainty 3awater resources 3awatersheds1 aVeṅkaṭareḍḍi, Ke.,1 aPratap, Deva0 tWater resources management.g2019 Nov., v. 33, no. 14 p.4799-4820dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl44305x0920-47417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-019-02398-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245010100207300001200308520154800320592002801868596001501896650001801911650002201929650001501951650001701966650002401983650001502007700002202022700002902044700003802073700002802111700002002139700003202159700002402191773013302215856008302348852000902431655001202440IND60743435820221116181832.0210827e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074343582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-021-02833-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKappes, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0190-308X10aEvaluation of an electronic system for monitoring dairy cow rumination in a grazing-based system  ap. 379.  aThis research aimed to compare the rumination time estimated by an electronic monitoring system with direct visual observations of the rumination of dairy cows in a grazing-based system. Also, it aimed to estimate the agreement between different time intervals of the direct visual observations. To that end, we have observed twelve lactating cows for 16 h a day for 11 days. Then, we compared the data provided by the HealthyCow24® software with the visual observations to use as reference. After that, we estimated the Pearson’s correlation coefficients, the linear regression, and the Bland–Altman plot by using the SAS software. Results showed that the rumination data estimated by the HealthyCow24® software and the visual observations were highly correlated (0.81; P < 0.0001). In the Bland–Altman analysis, we observed that the average of the standard deviations between the visual observation and the electronic monitoring system was − 2.14 min during a 2-h period. The upper limit (95%) was 30.61 min/2 h and the lower limit (95%) was − 34.88 min/2 h. Moreover, visual observations at intervals of up to 15 min were correlated with the data estimated by the electronic monitoring system and observed at 5-min intervals. In conclusion, the Allflex SCR electronic monitoring system is efficient in measuring the rumination time of grazing cows. Also, direct visual observations with intervals no longer than 15 min are reliable when used for evaluating the behavior of cows without losing data accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data  a001cCAPES 3aanimal health 3acomputer software 3adairy cows 3adata quality 3aregression analysis 3arumination1 aKnob, Deise Aline1 aScheid, Angelica Leticia1 ade Castro Bessani, Daniella Thais1 aSchaitz, Luís Henrique1 aPerazzoli, Laiz1 aAlessio, Dileta Regina Moro1 aNeto, André Thaler0 tTropical animal health and production.g2021 July, v. 53, no. 3 p.379-379dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl706x0049-47477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-021-02833-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010300167520157100270592002801841650002101869650002601890650002601916650001901942653001601961653001801977653002901995653001902024653002302043653002602066700002402092700001802116700001802134700001802152773011502170856008302285852000902368655001202377IND60729103520221119065707.0210619e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072910352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Keunhyun10aTransit to parks: An environmental justice study of transit access to large parks in the U.S. West  aLarge parks—including regional parks, state parks, and national forests and parks—have particular health, social, and environmental benefits. Thus, promoting equal access to large parks is increasingly becoming a goal of environmental justice activists, planners, and policymakers. Disadvantaged populations (e.g., low-income people of color) have worse walking access to large parks than more privileged groups and might rely on public transportation to access such parks. But empirical studies on whether access to large parks via public transit is justly distributed are lacking. In this paper, we examine the relationship between a novel measure of public transit access to large parks (the T2P index) and neighborhood-level disadvantage (income, race/ethnicity, and age). Using network analysis with public transit feed data and park location data, we calculate the T2P index for every census block group in the 15 largest metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the U.S. West. We find some evidence of environmental injustice. A spatial filtering model shows that T2P access increases when a neighborhood has a larger share of non-Hispanic Whites and a smaller share of older adults, but that median household income is not associated with T2P in the entire sample. We also find that some regions present significant environmental injustices in T2P whereas others have fewer to no injustices. Transit agencies and park planners could use our T2P index and findings to prioritize transit investment for disadvantaged populations and promote healthy living.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahousehold income 3alow-income population 3apublic transportation 3aurban forestry 0aGreen space 0aGreen justice 0aEnvironmental inequality 0aTransit equity 0aPark accessibility 0aPublic transportation1 aRigolon, Alessandro1 aChoi, Dong-ah1 aLyons, Torrey1 aBrewer, Simon0 tUrban forestry & urban greening.g2021 May, v. 60 p.127055-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl893556x1618-86677nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.1270553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006200139245008200201300001600283500001400299500002000313520094400333592002801277596004801305650001801353650001101371650001901382650001101401650001501412650001501427700003201442700002501474700002601499773013401525856007301659852000901732655001201741IND60694774220221117221815.0200514e202005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069477422DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Eugene H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2237-967510aUltrastructural morphology of lymphocytes of the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx)  ap. 425-429.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAn ultrastructural study on the lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples from 20 healthy adult Arabian oryx (Oryx leucocoryx) was undertaken. Small lymphocytes ranged in size from 2–3.5 µm and exhibited the typical repertoire of organelles found in small lymphocytes of other animals but showed no evidence of azurophilic granules. Medium‐sized lymphocytes were 5–6.5 µm in diameter and occasionally demonstrated azurophilic granules. Microvilli were a common finding of lymphocytes. Of particular interest was the presence of multivesicular bodies, which have previously only been described in human lymphocytes. Both small‐ and medium‐sized lymphocytes of the Arabian oryx were smaller than those reported for other animals. Small lymphocytes exhibited short, thick microvilli, whereas medium‐sized lymphocytes had long thin microvilli, a single nucleolus and occasionally azurophilic granules and multivesicular bodies.  aPublisher supplied data  aIG/AGR/ANVS/17/01cSultan Qaboos University 3aOryx leucoryx 3aadults 3acell nucleolus 3ahumans 3amicrovilli 3aorganelles1 aAl‐Amri, Ahmed Saif Hilal1 aAl‐ Abri, Mohammed1 aAl‐Marzooqi, Waleed0 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 May, v. 49, no. 3 p.425-429dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02216naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100001700159245009200176300001600268520100400284592002801288650001301316650003301329650001301362650001801375650001101393653001901404653001601423653001701439653001501456700001701471700001701488700002601505700002301531700001801554700001501572700001801587773009901605856009301704852000901797655001201806IND60556875520221119073651.0161102e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055687552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTomasi, J.M.10aAccelerated hydrothermal aging of cycloaliphatic epoxy/graphene nanoparticle composites  ap. 131-135.  aCycloaliphatic epoxy (CE) resin systems are of primary interest in applications that require improved resistance to harsh conditions relative to other epoxy systems. Because other epoxy systems have demonstrated improved resistance to hydrothermal aging with the addition of carbon-based nanoparticle reinforcement, it is expected that the hydrothermal resistance of CE resins will likewise be improved with incorporation of nanoparticles. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine the influence of graphene nanoparticles (GNP) on the hydrothermal aging resistance of CE resins. CE specimens are fabricated with varying levels of GNP and exposed to elevated temperatures and moisture levels for varying amounts of time up to 400 h. The results from flexure and dynamical-mechanical testing indicate that the addition of GNP provides modest improvements in the stiffness and glass transition temperature for all aging levels, while the strength is improved for aging times below 400 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepoxides 3aglass transition temperature 3agraphene 3ananoparticles 3aresins 0aNanocomposites 0aDegradation 0aHygrothermal 0aWeathering1 aHelman, I.D.1 aPisani, W.A.1 aKlimek-McDonald, D.R.1 aChinkanjanarot, S.1 aMiskioglu, I.1 aKing, J.A.1 aOdegard, G.M.0 tPolymer Degradation and Stability.g2016 Nov., v. 133 p.131-135dElsevier Ltdx0141-39107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2016.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03471naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245009900172300001600271520217700287592002802464650002502492650001102517650001702528650001402545650001802559650002402577650002302601650002802624650002202652650001602674650001002690650001402700650002402714650002202738650001702760650001002777700003102787700002002818773007902838856008602917961001303003852000903016655001203025IND4475695220221119235616.0141111e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447569522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.08.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Kathryn E.10aMid-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy for the rapid analysis of plant root composition  ap. 197-203.  aRoots are an important contributor of recalcitrant organic carbon compounds for soil organic matter formation, but little is known about the composition of many species. There is a need for techniques capable of rapidly assessing significant, but often overlooked, carbon sinks such as roots. Diffuse reflectance mid-infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS) has great potential for the analysis and characterization of plant root composition. The objectives of this research were to compare the DRIFTS spectra of roots of different species using whole root samples and root fiber fractions and to identify spectral features indicative of important root macromolecules in order to evaluate the potential of DRIFTS to determine root composition. A wide variety of roots from agronomic and horticultural crops, ornamental plants, and native plants were collected and analyzed by DRIFTS. Samples were ground in a cyclone grinder to pass a 20 mesh screen and scanned without KBr dilution from 400 to 4000cmâ»Â¹ using KBr as the background. In addition, traditional fiber analysis of a subset of roots and DRIFTS analysis of the resulting fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and wax) were utilized to identify spectral features associated with those fractions. Results indicate that the roots of the same species are similar despite differences in climate, soil and fertilization, while important differences were noted between roots of different species. Tree root lignins appeared to be similar to their above ground counterparts based on comparison with published data. Root lignins for all studied species varied by species. Spectral analysis was consistent with chemical fiber analysis composition data and revealed features that may be indicative of root suberin content. Further research is necessary to confirm that these features are related to suberin. Overall, the results of this research demonstrate the potential of DRIFTS for the characterization of plant root composition and as a tool to rapidly screen large numbers of samples for more effective utilization of more time-consuming analytical procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid detergent fiber 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3acellulose 3ahemicellulose 3ahorticultural crops 3aindigenous species 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aornamental plants 3areflectance 3aroots 3ascreening 3asoil organic matter 3aspectral analysis 3aspectroscopy 3atrees1 aReeves, James B., IIIcIII1 aCoale, Frank J.0 tGeoderma.g2011 Nov., v. 167-168 p.197-203dElsevier B.V.x0016-70617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2011.08.0093Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245001100172300001200183520210300195592002802298650002502326650002202351650002802373650001402401650002302415650001202438650002902450650002102479650002002500650003802520650001102558650001302569650001302582650001402595650002702609650001302636650002602649650001202675650001602687650003302703650001002736650001502746650001202761650001602773650001202789700001502801700001702816700001502833700001802848773010202866856008602968852000903054655001203063IND60630900920221121172015.0190214e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063090092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.09.3542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBallesteros, D.10aC-2007  ap. 518.  aCryopreservation is the most promising option for the long-term germplasm conservation of recalcitrant-seeded species. The post-cryo success achieved with the excised zygotic explants used for cryopreservation is variable, and for some species dependent on the use of cryoprotectants and rapid drying. However, the efficacy of different cryoprotectants seems to be species dependent and there is a paucity of information on the mechanisms via which particular cryoprotectants protect zygotic embryos from recalcitrat seeds during partial drying and cryogenic cooling. The present study used Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Cryo-Scanning Electron Microscopy (Cryo-SEM) to characterise the behaviour of selected cryoprotectants in zygotic embryos during drying and cooling to cryogenic temperatures. These studies were carried out on a range ofrecalitrant-seeded species (Castanospermum australe, Trichilia dregeana, Amaryllis belladonna, Strychnos gerrardii) that show differential tolerance to cryoprotectants and cryopreservation. Exposure to glycerol or sucrose did not change the behaviour of water in zygotic explants of most of the species studied. DSC revealed little to no difference between fresh samples and those cryoprotected, showing very similar enthalpy of melting transitions (∼300J/gH2O) and amount of unfrozen water (∼0.30gH2O/gdm); except for Atropa belladonna treated with glycerol that showed a slightly higher amount of unfrozen water (∼0.45gH2O/gdm). However, Cryo-SEM images showed important changes in the mechanical properties of the cryoprotected tissue during rapid drying. In general, glycerol allowed for less destructive compaction of the zygotic tissues during desiccation, particularly in A. belladonna. Glycerol was also observed to help in membrane stabilization of Corynosoma australe, particularly during rehydration of the tissue. The results are discussed in relation to other studies on the mechanisms of cryoprotection in shoot tips and will inform the future cryopreservation protocols for zygotic germplasm of recalcitrant-seeded species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaryllis belladonna 3aAtropa belladonna 3aCastanospermum australe 3aStrychnos 3aTrichilia dregeana 3acooling 3acryo-electron microscopy 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adrying 3aenthalpy 3aexplants 3agermplasm 3agermplasm conservation 3aglycerol 3amechanical properties 3amelting 3arehydration 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aseeds 3ashoot tips 3asucrose 3atemperature 3atissues1 aNaidoo, S.1 aVarghese, B.1 aBerjak, P.1 aPammenter, N.0 tCryobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.518-518dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.09.3543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245014700170520152700317592002801844650001301872650002201885650001601907650001601923650003001939650000901969650001601978650000901994650001602003653003502019653002102054653001602075653001402091653001502105653002102120653002602141700001602167700001702183700001602200700002002216773011902236856008802355852000902443655001202452IND60770031720221122142214.0220509e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077003172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Peiling10aExperimental study on in situ remediation of Cr(VI) contaminated groundwater by sulfidated micron zero valent iron stabilized with xanthan gum  aMicron zero valent iron (mZVI) was an underground remediation material, which had great application potential to replace nano zero valent iron (nZVI) from the perspective of economic and health benefits. However, mZVI was highly prone to gravitational settling, which limited its wide application for in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater. This paper was devoted to develop an efficient and economical groundwater remediation material based on mZVI, which should possess excellent stability, reactivity, and transportability. Thereby xanthan gum (XG) stabilized and Na₂S₂O₄ sulfidated mZVI (XG-S-mZVI) was synthesized and characterized with SEM, XRD, XPS, and FTIR techniques. In terms of stability, the adsorbed XG and the dispersed XG worked together to resist the sedimentation of S-mZVI. In terms of reactivity, sulfidation enhanced the electron transfer rate and electron selectivity of XG-S-mZVI, thereby improved the reactivity of XG-S-mZVI. The hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) removal rate constant by XG-S-mZVI was determined to be 832.4 times than bare mZVI. In terms of transportability, the transportability of XG-S-mZVI was greatly improved (~80 cm in coarse sand and ~50 cm in medium sand). Straining was the main mechanism of XG-S-mZVI retention in porous media. XG-S-mZVI in situ reactive zone (XG-S-mZVI-IRZ) was only suitable to the media with a grain size larger than 0.25 mm. This study could provide theoretical support and guidance for the implementation of IRZ technology based on mZVI.  aPublisher supplied data 3achromium 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airon 3aremediation 3asand 3axanthan gum 0aMicron zero valent iron (mZVI) 0aXanthan gum (XG) 0aSulfidation 0aStability 0aReactivity 0aTransportability 0aIn situ reactive zone1 aXie, Jiayin1 aQin, Xueming1 aYang, Xinru1 aZhao, Yongsheng0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 01, v. 828 p.154422-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006200188245010200250300001200352506007600364520184300440592002802283596003702311506003702348650001302385650001602398650001102414650001502425650001702440650001502457650002202472650001302494650001102507650001602518650001602534650001102550651001002561700003202571700001802603700002202621700002202643700001902665700001902684700002002703700001702723773015102740856008202891852000902973655001202982IND60683787620221207104624.0200919e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068378762DNAL7 a320406392pmid7 aPMC70106252pmcid7 a10.1007/s10661-020-8118-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTagle D., Matías,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7782-601X10aField performance of a low-cost sensor in the monitoring of particulate matter in Santiago, Chile  ap. 171.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntegration of low-cost air quality sensors with the internet of things (IoT) has become a feasible approach towards the development of smart cities. Several studies have assessed the performance of low-cost air quality sensors by comparing their measurements with reference instruments. We examined the performance of a low-cost IoT particulate matter (PM₁₀ and PM₂.₅) sensor in the urban environment of Santiago, Chile. The prototype was assembled from a PM₁₀–PM₂.₅ sensor (SDS011), a temperature and relative humidity sensor (BME280) and an IoT board (ESP8266/Node MCU). Field tests were conducted at three regulatory monitoring stations during the 2018 austral winter and spring seasons. The sensors at each site were operated in parallel with continuous reference air quality monitors (BAM 1020 and TEOM 1400) and a filter-based sampler (Partisol 2000i). Variability between sensor units (n = 7) and the correlation between the sensor and reference instruments were examined. Moderate inter-unit variability was observed between sensors for PM₂.₅ (normalized root-mean-square error 9–24%) and PM₁₀ (10–37%). The correlations between the 1-h average concentrations reported by the sensors and continuous monitors were higher for PM₂.₅ (R² 0.47–0.86) than PM₁₀ (0.24–0.56). The correlations (R²) between the 24-h PM₂.₅ averages from the sensors and reference instruments were 0.63–0.87 for continuous monitoring and 0.69–0.93 for filter-based samplers. Correlation analysis revealed that sensors tended to overestimate PM concentrations in high relative humidity (RH > 75%) and underestimate when RH was below 50%. Overall, the prototype evaluated exhibited adequate performance and may be potentially suitable for monitoring daily PM₂.₅ averages after correcting for RH.  aPublisher supplied data  a17VEIPE-78921cInnovaChile Corfo0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aInternet 3aair quality 3acities 3amonitoring 3aparticulates 3aprototypes 3arelative humidity 3asamplers 3aspring 3atemperature 3aurban areas 3awinter 3aChile1 aRojas Ringeling, Francisca,1 aReyes, Felipe1 aVásquez, Yeanice1 aHallgren, Fredrik1 aLindén, Jenny1 aKolev, Dimitar1 aWatne, Ågot K.1 aOyola, Pedro0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Mar., v. 192, no. 3 p.171-171dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-8118-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02520naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002600149245004400175300001400219520139200233592002801625650001701653650002601670650001801696650001001714650002001724650001501744650001201759650001301771653001501784653002101799653001501820653001201835653001801847700002501865700001701890773012201907856008402029852000902113655001202122IND60623022820221120083043.0210108e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062302282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ympev.2018.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrouch, Nicholas M.A.10aTip-dating and the origin of Telluraves  ap. 55-63.  aDespite a relatively vast accumulation of molecular data, the timing of diversification of modern bird lineages remains elusive. Accurate dating of the origination of Telluraves—a clade of birds defined by their arboreality—is of particular interest, as it contains the most species-rich avian group, the passerines. Historically, neontological studies have estimated a Cretaceous origin for the group, but more recent studies have recovered Cenozoic dates, closer to the oldest known fossils for the group. We employ total-evidence dating to estimate divergence times that are expected to be both less sensitive to prior assumptions and more accurate. Specifically, we use a large collection of morphological character data from arboreal bird fossils, along with combined molecular sequence and morphological character data from extant taxa. Our analyses recover a Late Cretaceous origin for crown Telluraves, with a few lineages crossing the K-Pg boundary. Following the K-Pg boundary, our results show the group underwent rapid diversification, likely benefiting from increased ecological opportunities in the aftermath of the extinction event. We find very little confidence for the precise topological placement of many extinct taxa, possibly due to rapid diversification, paucity of character data, and rapid morphological differentiation during the early history of the group.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenozoic era 3aLate Cretaceous epoch 3aPasseriformes 3abirds 3aextinct species 3aextinction 3afossils 3atopology 0aTelluraves 0aDivergence times 0aTip dating 0aFossils 0aPhylogenetics1 aRamanauskas, Karolis1 aIgić, Boris0 tMolecular phylogenetics and evolution.g2019 Feb., v. 131 p.55-63dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl3945168x1055-79037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03173naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008000164300001600244520204100260592002802301650001702329650002302346650001102369650003502380650001302415653001702428653002302445653001102468653002802479653002402507653002502531653002402556700001802580773010702598856008502705852000902790655001202799IND60536128820221117231246.0190215e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053612882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJax, Kurt10aSearching for the place of biodiversity in the ecosystem services discourse  ap. 198-205.  aWith the growing popularity of the ecosystem services concept, the question of how biodiversity and ecosystem services are related to one another has increasingly been raised. Among other things, this entails asking whether or not biodiversity itself is an ecosystem service. Such questions are important for conservation planning, as they require clarification of whether ecosystem services protection replaces or complements biodiversity conservation. The answers given up to now have been equivocal. In our paper we demonstrate that, in order to analyse the role of biodiversity in the ecosystem services discourse, it is not enough to address only the way they are related to one another in biophysical terms. Instead, their interconnectedness needs to be discussed from additional, albeit rarely addressed, perspectives: a definitional one, a value-based perspective, and a strategic perspective. In seeking to bring into sharper relief the conceptual relations between biodiversity and ecosystem services we distinguish between a didactic motive, an item conservation motive, and a resource protection motive. Within the didactic motive, the aim of linking biodiversity to ecosystem services is generally to show that “life on earth” in its abundant variety is of existential value to human beings. The item conservation motive relates to particular ecological components (e.g. species) which are to be protected in their identity. Finally, the resource protection motive focuses on the role of ecological components as resources for humans. These motives imply fundamentally different ideas about biodiversity, values and place dependence. Adding these perspectives and clarifying motives to the analytic process can help avoid misunderstandings and enable research to be focused on more specific and answerable questions. It can also serve to avoid the potential drawbacks entailed by conservation strategies that are based on overly simplified assumptions regarding the relation between biodiversity and ecosystem services.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3aecosystem services 3ahumans 3anatural resources conservation 3aplanning 0aBiodiversity 0aEcosystem services 0aValues 0aConservation strategies 0aConceptual analysis 0aConservation motives 0aResource protection1 aHeink, Ulrich0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Nov., v. 191 p.198-205dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245008000180300001600260520086300276592002801139650002601167650002501193650002001218650003101238650001001269650001801279650004301297650001701340650001001357650001301367653003101380653002301411653002601434653001201460653002001472653002301492700002701515700002301542700002701565773008001592856008101672852000901753655001201762IND60630561220221120150407.0190210s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063056122DNAL7 a10.1163/15685411-000032052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeiml-Buchinger, Victoria V.10aJasmonic acid modulates Meloidogyne incognita – tomato plant interactions  ap. 171-180.  aMolecular aspects of the responses of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants to invasion by Meloidogyne incognita, as well as the nematode reproduction capacity, were investigated and the role of jasmonic acid (JA) in these interactions was evaluated.

However, there has never been a comprehensive survey which studied nineteen potentially toxic elements in sediments and plants and evaluated the associated potential risk. Thus, we aimed to study the total and potentially available content of As, Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Se, Sn, Tl, V, and Zn in the sediments and common reed (Phragmites australis) at thirty two sites along the entire lagoon and connected drains. Contamination Factor (CF), Pollution Load Index (PLI), Geo-accumulation Index (Igₑₒ), and Enrichment Factor (EF) were calculated to assess the grade of contamination. Element accumulation factor (AF) and bio-concentration ratio (BCR) were also calculated. Aluminum showed the highest median (mg kg⁻¹) total content (41,200), followed by Fe (30,300), Mn (704.7), V (82.0), Zn (75.5), Cr (51.2), Cu (47.8), Ni (44.3), As (31.9), Tl (24.6), Co (21.4), Se (20.3), Sb (17.6), Sn (15.6), Mo (11.3), and Hg (16.6 μg kg⁻¹). Values of the EF, CF, and Igₑₒ showed that the sediments were heavily contaminated with As, Sb, Se, Tl, Mo, Sn, Co, Ni, and Cu. The drained sediment had significantly higher values of total and potentially available element content than the lagoon sediments. Sediments of the middle and western area showed significantly higher contents of total and available elements than the eastern section. The BCR and AF values indicate that the studied plant is efficient in taking up high amounts of Zn, Fe, As, Sn, Tl, Ni, Mo, Mn; then Co, Cu, and V. The results exhibit a dramatic contamination at certain sites of the lagoon, and the studied PTEs have a predominant role in contamination-related ecological risk. Further investigations concerning redox-induced mobilization of PTEs in sediments, the risk of fish contamination and the potential health hazards are highly recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhragmites australis 3aaluminum 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acoastal water 3acobalt 3acopper 3afish 3ahealth hazards 3airon 3alakes 3amanganese 3amercury 3amolybdenum 3anickel 3apollution load 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3ariver deltas 3asalt marshes 3asediments 3asurveys 3atin 3atoxic substances 3avanadium 3azinc 3aEgypt 0aWetlands 0aToxic metal(loid)s 0aContamination indices 0aAccumulation factors1 aAbdelrazek, Mohamed A.S.1 aElthoth, Mahmoud1 aMoghanm, Farahat S.1 aRadi, Mohamed,1 aHamza, Ahmad1 aEl-Habashi, Nagwan1 aWang, Jianxu1 aRinklebe, Jörg,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7404-16390 tScience of the total environment.g2019 Feb. 01, v. 649 p.1237-1249dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.3593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012000169300001600289520134100305592002801646650001801674650001501692650001501707650001901722650001901741650001601760650001501776650001001791650001601801650001501817650002101832650001401853650002501867700002101892773012601913856008202039852000902121655001202130IND60772353320221119072734.0220403e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077235332DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954220300612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaluzhnaya, O. V.10aFeatures of Diversity of Polyketide Synthase Genes in the Community of Freshwater Sponge Baikalospongia fungiformis  ap. 336-346.  aIn the present study, we analyze the sequences of gene fragments of polyketide synthases (PKS) of microorganisms associated with the endemic Baikal sponge Baikalospongia fungiformis. PKSs are multienzyme complexes responsible for the synthesis of low molecular weight biologically active substances (BAS). Cloning and sequencing of the amplification products of the ketosynthase (KS) domain of PKS in the B. fungiformis microbiome reveal 18 unique sequences, most of which were highly identical (97–99%) to the genes of PKS of microorganisms from communities of other species of Baikal sponges. On phylogenetic trees, these groups of sequences form characteristic “Baikal clades.” Apparently, the basic sponge community that formed during the coevolution contains common groups of microorganisms that are potential producers of biologically active substances. BlastX analysis showed that the obtained fragments belong to bacterial polyketide synthases (phyla Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Latescibacteria, and Gemmatimonadates), as well as eukaryotic algae (divisions Haptophyta and Ochrophyta). This work indicates a significant biotechnological potential of freshwater sponge communities and the prospects for research in the direction of searching for new natural metabolites in complex freshwater microbiomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3aHaptophyta 3aOchrophyta 3aPlanctomycetes 3aProteobacteria 3acoevolution 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amicrobiome 3amolecular weight 3aphylogeny 3apolyketide synthases1 aItskovich, V.

The morphometric data of the Chinese populations were compared with all previously reported populations. The SEM observations of en face views indicated that H. chitwoodi and H. parasinensis have lip patterns belonging to type 1 and phylogenetically both species clustered with other Hemicriconemoides species that showed the same kind of lip pattern. On the other hand, H. fujianensis showed a lip pattern belonging to type 2 and phylogenetically appears basal to the above-mentioned clade. SEM observation of C. myungsugae showed that the first lip annulus forms a non-projecting uninterrupted disc and the labial annulus is a rectangular shape with slight dorsal and ventral indentations. Phylogenetic relationships among Criconemoides spp. are apparently not well resolved.

Results showed that apples in 5 ± 0°C group showed the lowest firmness decreasing level (15.86% for “Fuji”, 24.76% for “Golden Delicious”) coupled with the minimum ethylene production, and the slowest inter‐converting of chelate‐soluble pectin and sodium carbonate‐soluble pectin to water‐soluble pectin compared with that of 5 ± 5°C and 5 ± 1°C. Moreover, the enzymatic activities (PG, PME, β‐Gal, α‐L‐Af) were at the lowest level in 5 ± 0°C temperature fluctuation groups both of “Fuji” and “Golden Delicious”. Ultrastructural observations also revealed that constant temperature could restrain the solubilization of pectin and the dissolution of middle lamella. Besides, the impact of 5± 1°C on “Golden Delicious” was more significant relative to “Fuji”. In practical applications, the temperature supervision on “Fuji” could be appropriately relaxed compared with “Golden Delicious” during short‐term storage. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: Constant storage temperature retarded the firmness decreasing by delaying the solubilization of cell wall pectin and suppressed the activities of cell wall degrading enzymes of “Fuji” and “Golden Delicious” cultivars. Constant storage temperature Constant storage temperature retarded the dissolution of the middle lamella between the cell walls of “Fuji” and “Golden Delicious” cultivars. “Golden Delicious” cultivar was more sensitive to the variation of storage temperature compared with “Fuji” cultivar.  aPublisher supplied data  a18YFYSZC00030cTianjin Science and Technology Planning Project  a2020AB008cXPCC Financial science and technology planning project  aSN2020‐15cN Special Project 3aapples 3acell walls 3acultivars 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3apectins 3apostharvest storage 3asodium 3asolubilization 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3awater solubility1 aPan, Yanfang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8987-71101 aJia, Xiaoyu1 aWang, Xiaodong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4824-89211 aYuan, Junwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4469-254X1 aLi, Xihong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7045-92500 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.e15655-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.156553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245016600159300002000325520138200345592002801727650001501755650002101770650002101791650002201812650002401834650001301858650001901871650001801890650001901908650001501927650001301942650002101955700001201976700001701988700001602005700001502021700002002036700001602056773012402072856007402196852000902270655001202279IND60667109320221120110954.0190919e20150126xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066710932DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13809k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Qingping12aA green method to prepare TiO₂/MWCNT nanocomposites with high photocatalytic activity and insights into the effect of heat treatment on photocatalytic activity  ap. 13430-13436.  aNanocomposites consisting of well-defined anatase TiO₂ nanoparticles with an average diameter of 8 nm and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were fabricated by a facile two-step hydrothermal method using water as the main solvent, which is friendly to the environment and totally different from previous methods. The TiO₂ nanoparticles were uniformly grafted on the surface of MWCNTs via intimate chemical bonds, which was beneficial for the enhancement of photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activities of as-prepared TiO₂/MWCNT nanocomposites for degradation of rhodamine B under solar simulator illumination were investigated systemically. It was found that the photocatalytic activity of as-prepared TiO₂/MWCNT nanocomposites was 7 times higher than that of pure TiO₂ prepared via the same hydrothermal procedure. The enhancement was mainly due to the existence of MWCNTs, which could not only greatly improve the adsorption of rhodamine B, but also retard the recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and absorb more light. The photocatalytic performance was further enhanced after being annealed at 400 °C and 500 °C for 1 h because of the improved crystallinity of anatase TiO₂. Interestingly, the photocatalytic activities of samples annealed at 400 °C and 500 °C showed no difference, which was different from previous reports.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3achemical bonding 3acrystal structure 3ahot water treatment 3alighting 3ananocomposites 3ananoparticles 3aphotocatalysis 3arhodamines 3asolvents 3atitanium dioxide1 aLi, Hua1 aDuan, Huanan1 aGuo, Yiping1 aLiu, Xuefa1 aZhang, Yangyang1 aLiu, Hezhou0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 26, v. 5, no. 18 p.13430-13436dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13809k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02966naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245012600166300001600292520164500308592002801953650001001981650002201991650001502013650001702028650002202045650002502067650001602092650001402108650003502122650000902157651001002166700001802176700001402194700001902208700001502227700001602242700001502258700001102273700001902284773012602303856008202429852000902511655001202520IND60772353420221119072728.0220403e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077235342DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954220301032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPingcuo, Z.

In this study, the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of four yak populations in Tibet Naqu and Ali were assessed using mitochondrial cytochrome genes (CytB). Results showed that the full length of the CytB gene sequences of 129 yak individuals in the four populations was 1140 bp, and the average contents of T, C, A, and G were 26.3, 28.9, 31.7, and 13.1%, respectively. Twenty-one haplotypes were constructed with the full-length region of the CytB gene based on 29 single nucleotide polymorphism sites. The haplotype polymorphisms, nucleotide polymorphisms, and Tajima’s D of the four populations ranged from 0.59740 (Gaize Yak) to 0.69970 (Geji Yak), from 0.00214 (Geji Yak) to 0.00273 (Nima Yak), and from –1.4410 (Geji Yak) to –0.3370 (Gaize Yak), respectively. Specifically, the pairwise difference (FST) ranged from –0.03387 to 0.00383, indicating that the genetic divergence in these yak populations was low. The phylogeny and haplotype network analysis results implied that the four populations were mainly from two matrilineal origin linkages corresponding to two traditionally recognized matrilineal yak populations. Therefore, the genetic diversity in four yak populations with different geographical distributions was evaluated in this study to confirm the rich genetic diversity using CytB sequences. However, genetic differentiation among the populations was small. The result of this study will provide valuable theoretical basis for the diversity evaluation and conversion of domestic Tibet yaks.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3apastoralism 3aphylogeny 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3ayaks 3aChina1 aBasang, W.

The disease can be controlled by using clean propagation material and planting naturally resistant or tolerant varieties. However, eradication of the virus is also important. In order to eradicate the virus, several biotechnological methods including meristem culture, thermotherapy, chemotherapy, electrotherapy and cryotherapy can be utilized. Among them, chemotherapy and cryotherapy techniques are used to eradicate PPV-infected apricot in this study. Different chemotherapeutic agents such as 8-azaguanine, ribavirin and quercetin (1mg/l) were incorporated to 2mg/l BA and 0.5mg/l GA3 containing MS medium for chemotherapy. 80–100% of survival was achieved in infected apricot shoot tips after 4weeks of culture in ribavirin and quercetin containing medium, respectively, and all of the surviving ones found to be virus free with RT-PCR. However, no survival was obtained in the 8-azaguanine containing medium. In the case of cryotherapy, explants were pre-cultured in 1mg/l BA, 5% dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and 2% mg/l proline containing MS medium at 4°C and then treated with 40min in PVS2 solution. Slow cooling of shoot tips was achieved by transfer of the cryovials to a Mr. Frosty® device, which was kept in a −80°C freezer until the temperature was reduced to −40°C. Afterwards, cryovials were rapidly plunged to liquid nitrogen (LN). After storage for at least 1h in LN, explants were thawed rapidly in a water bath (1min at 40°C) and transferred to the washing solution (1.2M sucrose for 30min) and cultured in 2mg/l BA and 0.5mg/l GA3 containing MS medium for recovery. After 4weeks of culture, 10% survival was recorded in cryopreserved apricot shoot tips. RT-PCR analysis showed that PPV was eradicated in the surviving shoot tips after cryotherapy. Overall results showed that cryotherapy and chemotherapy could be used to eradicate PPV from infected apricots, however, survival rates should be increased by optimization and rapid freezing techniques may be of use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlum pox virus 3aapricots 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3acryosurgery 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adrug therapy 3aexplants 3afreezers 3afreezing 3ameristems 3anitrogen 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3aplanting 3aproline 3apropagation materials 3aquercetin 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3ashoot tips 3asucrose 3asurvival rate 3atemperature 3athermotherapy 3aviruses 3awashing1 aSüzerer, V.1 aŞeker, M.

Although regenerating forests recover biomass, biodiversity, and processes with time, the recovery trajectories may be uncertain due to past disturbances. Currently, there is a lack of knowledge to sustain the effectiveness of passive regeneration for the recovery of riparian forests and the adjacent waterbodies in the tropics, which may compromise the outcomes of ongoing and future tropical riparian restoration programs. We evaluated the drivers of riparian forest structural recovery and how this relates to stream conditions in 12 abandoned pasturelands in eastern Brazilian Amazonia. These pasturelands range across regeneration age (pasture (PA) — 0 to 4 years; young regeneration (YR) — 8 to 12 years; old regeneration (OR) — 18 to 22 years) and years of past land-use (PA — 23.25 average years of past land-use, YR — 18.25, OR — 7). We compared the conditions of these sites to 4 reference sites with conserved forests (REF, >100 years), where there was no recorded pasture use in the past. Short-term responses of forests and streams to passive regeneration indicated high ecosystem resilience after low to intermediate past land-use intensity, reflected in the improvement of stream ecosystems. Such high resilience is possibly attributable to low- to intermediate-intensity pasture-related disturbances, remaining forest matrix, and residual structures (e.g. roots, sprouts, and in-stream wood) observed in the area. Our results suggest a recovery by 12 to 20 years for riparian forests of this region. However, areas degraded by intensive land-use apparently showed delayed recovery. We conclude that seizing resilience windows (defined here as the period when ecosystems retain high potential resilience) is essential to foster passive recovery of riparian forests and streams more cost-effectively in the tropics.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiomass 3aecological resilience 3aenvironment 3aforest regeneration 3aland degradation 3aland use 3apastures 3ariparian forests 3astreams 3asurface water 3awood 3aAmazonia 0aLand-use change 0aRestoration 0aSecondary forests 0aStreams 0aEcosystem ecology 0aDisturbances1 aRuschel, Ademir Roberto1 aFelizzola, Juliana Feitosa1 aFrauendorf, Therese C.1 ade Barros Ferraz, Silvio Frosini1 aRichardson, John S.0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 01, v. 828 p.154425-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245009000162300001800252520112000270592002801390650004401418650001201462650001801474650001101492650001501503650001801518650004301536650001701579650001501596650002101611650001201632650006601644650001901710650004401729650001701773650002001790650001401810650001201824700001601836700002101852700001801873700001801891700001801909773012201927856007402049852000902123655001202132IND60667109420221120110917.0190919e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066710942DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13811b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShiny Renitha, T.10aWealth from waste – beef extract for microbiological media from tannery solid waste  ap. 9891-9897.  aLime fleshing waste is one of the major hazardous solid wastes from leather industry. Utilization of the waste is one of the appropriate strategies to address the environmental issues and to realize economical returns. A process of preparation of beef extract from limed fleshing waste has been developed. The beef extract prepared is intended for microbial application. According to the process developed, the alkalis present in the fleshing waste were neutralized and removed by washing. Then the fleshing waste was hydrolyzed thermally and the hydrolysate obtained was lyophilized. The prepared product was characterized. The characteristics of the prepared product were compared with those of a widely accepted market product (Hi-Media). The beef extract prepared was found to be in compliance with all the requirements of the relevant standard. The product was also found to perform similarly to Hi-Media beef extract. The chemistry of the product was studied using tools such as FT-IR, HPLC, Maldi-TOF, ¹³C NMR and ¹H NMR. The product chemistry was found to be akin to that of the beef extract of Hi-Media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aalkalis 3abeef extracts 3acarbon 3acompliance 3afreeze drying 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3aleather industry 3amarkets 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3aneutralization 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolid wastes 3astable isotopes 3atanneries 3awashing1 aSridevi, J.1 aGowthaman, M.

To gather information on the seasonal variations in glucocorticoid concentration, the authors sampled the effluent of a Japanese STP every other week for 12 mo. Six of 9 selected glucocorticoids were detected in the effluent, with clobetasol propionate and betamethasone 17‐valerate detected at the highest concentrations and frequencies. The present study's results indicated that effluent glucocorticoid concentration may depend on water temperature, which is closely related to the removal efficiency of the STP or to seasonal variations in the public's use of glucocorticoids. In a separate experiment, to clarify whether glucocorticoids in environmental water increase susceptibility to bacterial infection in fish, the authors examined the responses to bacterial infection (Aeromonas veronii) of common carp exposed to clobetasol propionate. Clobetasol propionate exposure did not affect bacterial infection‐associated mortality. In fish infected with A. veronii but not exposed to clobetasol propionate, head kidney weight and number of leukocytes in the head kidney were significantly increased (p < 0.05), whereas these effects were not observed in infected fish exposed to clobetasol. This suggests that clobetasol propionate alleviated bacterial infection‐associated inflammation. Together, these results indicate that susceptibility to bacterial infection in common carp is not affected by exposure to glucocorticoids at environmentally relevant concentrations.

Numerous spectral indices have been developed for chlorophyll estimation from leaf- and canopy-level reflectance. However, in most cases, these indices are negatively affected by variations in canopy structure and soil background. The objective of this study was to develop spectral indices that can reduce the effects of varied canopy structure and growth stages for the estimation of leaf Chl. Hyperspectral reflectance data was obtained through simulation by a radiative transfer model, PROSAIL, and measurements from canopies of barley comprising different cultivars across growth stages using spectroradiometers. We applied a comprehensive band-optimization algorithm to explore five types of spectral indices: reflectance difference (RD), reflectance ratio (RR), normalized reflectance difference (NRD), difference of reflectance ratio (DRR) and ratio of reflectance difference (RRD). Indirectly using the multiple scatter correction (MSC) theory, we hypothesized that RRD can eliminate adverse effects of soil background, canopy structure and multiple scattering. Published indices and multivariate models such as optimum multiple band regression (OMBR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machines for regression (SVR) were also employed. Results showed that the ratio of reflectance difference index (RRDI) optimized for simulated data significantly improved the correlation with Chl (R²=0.98, p<0.0001) and was insensitive to LAI variations (1–8), compared to widely used indices such as MCARI/OSAVI (R²=0.64, p<0.0001) and TCARI/OSAVI (R²=0.74, p<0.0001). The RRDI optimized for barley explained 76% of the variation in Chl and outperformed multivariate models. However, the accuracy decreased when employing the indices for individual growth stages (R²<0.59). Accordingly, RRDIs optimized for open and closed canopies improved the estimations of Chl for individual stages before and after canopy closure, respectively, with R² of 0.65 (p<0.0001) and 0.78 (p<0.0001). This study shows that RRDI can efficiently eliminate the effects of structural properties on canopy reflectance response to canopy biochemistry. The results yet are limited to the datasets used in this study; therefore, transferability of the methods to large scales or other datasets should be further evaluated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abarley 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3acultivars 3adata collection 3adevelopmental stages 3aleaf area index 3aleast squares 3aleaves 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anutritional status 3aradiative transfer 3areflectance 3asoil 3aspectroradiometers 3asupport vector machines 3ayield forecasting 0aLeaf chlorophyll 0aSpectral indices 0aPartial least squares 0aPrecision agriculture 0aRatio of reflectance difference index (RRDI) 0aSupport vector machines 0aSpring barley 0aLambda-by-lambda band optimization1 aLenz-Wiedemann, Victoria1 aChen, Xinping1 aBareth, Georg0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2014 Nov., v. 97 p.58-77dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The protein affects both the morphology and electrochemical activity of PEDOT. Specifically, P(EDOT:CLG) shows spherical-like nodules that have been attributed to the collagen rod aggregates organized in phases separated from that of PEDOT. This phase separation results in a reduction of the ability to exchange charge reversibly, even though collagen stabilizes the PEDOT matrix from electrochemical degradation. On the other hand, viability assays indicate that the bioactivity of P(EDOT:CLG) is significantly higher than that of PEDOT in terms of cellular adhesion and proliferation. Thus, the biocomposite promotes the formation of 3D biostructures formed by the superposition of cellular monolayers, mimicking the growth of biological tissues. In order to gain microscopic information about the formation of specific interactions between PEDOT and collagen molecules in the biocomposite, quantum mechanical calculations on complexes formed by their building blocks have been performed in different environments (i.e. vacuum, chloroform and aqueous solution). Results evidence the important role played by non-conventional C–H⋯O hydrogen bonds, which is consistent with previous findings on complexes involving DNA and dopamine. The environment affects considerably the binding energy, which decreases with increasing polarity of the environment. However, in all environments the repeating units of PEDOT form stronger interactions with l-hydroxyproline than with l-proline. On the other hand, intermolecular interaction patterns predicted using implicit and explicit solvation models present a remarkable agreement and have been identified by visualizing the reduced electron density gradient.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaqueous solutions 3abioactive properties 3abiocomposites 3acell adhesion 3achloroform 3acollagen 3adopamine 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3aproline 3aquantum mechanics 3aseparation 3asolvation 3atissues 3aviability assays1 aTorras, Juan1 adel Valle, Luis J.1 aEstrany, Francesc1 aAlemán, Carlos,0 tRSC advances.g2015 Jan. 09, v. 5, no. 12 p.9189-9203dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4ra13812k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245017500171300001600346520139100362592002801753650002101781650002901802650001701831650002101848650001101869650002301880650001501903650002401918650001401942650002901956650002201985650002002007650001302027650001102040650001102051650001302062650001902075650001602094650002302110653002702133653001602160653001702176653002002193653002102213653002102234700002502255700001702280773012202297856008502419852000902504655001202513IND60536129120221117231214.0190215e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053612912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEscobar, Luis E.10aAnthropogenic disturbance and habitat loss for the red-listed Asiatic black bear (Ursus thibetanus): Using ecological niche modeling and nighttime light satellite imagery  ap. 400-407.  aHabitat loss is a critical factor driving extinction of biodiversity worldwide, with models of future land use anticipating increases in rates of destruction of native habitats worldwide. The Asian black bear (Ursus thibetanus) is a red-listed species with a broad geographic range that has been fragmented dramatically by land use change. Remaining populations of U. thibetanus occupy diverse habitats, ranging from highlands to coastal regions. We integrated ecological niche models (ENMs) with nighttime satellite imagery to identify areas suitable for U. thibetanus after anthropogenic alteration. We found that at least 10% of the potential distributional area for the species is not suitable owing to urban or suburban encroachment. U. thibetanus seems to persist in highland areas, characterized by low temperature and high precipitation, whereas humans concentrate in lowlands and less-extreme climatic conditions. ENMs based solely on climate frequently overestimate suitable areas available for species; nighttime light imagery offers a robust alternative to refining estimates of species' ranges, designing protected areas and corridors, prioritizing threatened species, and determining areas of human–wildlife conflict across broad areas. Our approach is transferable to other taxa and contexts, and should be considered in conservation planning and policy implementation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsus thibetanus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiodiversity 3aclimatic factors 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3aextinction 3ahabitat destruction 3ahighlands 3ahuman-wildlife relations 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alowlands 3amodels 3aniches 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3atemperature 3athreatened species 0aEcological niche model 0aDisturbance 0aHabitat loss 0aLand use change 0aNighttime lights 0aUrsus thibetanus1 aAwan, Muhammad Naeem1 aQiao, Huijie0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Nov., v. 191 p.400-407dElsevier LtdaElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245011300163300001600276520214700292592002802439650002402467650001802491650001302509650002002522650002202542650001402564650002002578650001202598650001602610650001102626650001002637650001002647650001402657650001202671650002502683650002102708650001802729650001402747650001002761650001302771650001702784700002302801700002102824700002302845700002002868700003002888700002502918700002302943773010602966856007203072852000903144655001203153IND60516511220221119061242.0160325e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051651122DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.31472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoenfuss, Heiko L.10aComplex mixtures, complex responses: Assessing pharmaceutical mixtures using field and laboratory approaches  ap. 953-965.  aPharmaceuticals are present in low concentrations (<100 ng/L) in most municipal wastewater effluents but may be elevated locally because of factors such as input from pharmaceutical formulation facilities. Using existing concentration data, the authors assessed pharmaceuticals in laboratory exposures of fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) and added environmental complexity through effluent exposures. In the laboratory, larval and mature minnows were exposed to a simple opioid mixture (hydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone), an opioid agonist (tramadol), a muscle relaxant (methocarbamol), a simple antidepressant mixture (fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine), a sleep aid (temazepam), or a complex mixture of all compounds. Larval minnow response to effluent exposure was not consistent. The 2010 exposures resulted in shorter exposed minnow larvae, whereas the larvae exposed in 2012 exhibited altered escape behavior. Mature minnows exhibited altered hepatosomatic indices, with the strongest effects in females and in mixture exposures. In addition, laboratory‐exposed, mature male minnows exposed to all pharmaceuticals (except the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor mixture) defended nest sites less rigorously than fish in the control group. Tramadol or antidepressant mixture exposure resulted in increased splenic T lymphocytes. Only male minnows exposed to whole effluent responded with increased plasma vitellogenin concentrations. Female minnows exposed to pharmaceuticals (except the opioid mixture) had larger livers, likely as a compensatory result of greater prominence of vacuoles in liver hepatocytes. The observed alteration of apical endpoints central to sustaining fish populations confirms that effluents containing waste streams from pharmaceutical formulation facilities can adversely impact fish populations but that the effects may not be temporally consistent. The present study highlights the importance of including diverse biological endpoints spanning levels of biological organization and life stages when assessing contaminant interactions.

Because long-term banking of MSCs is critical for their clinical applications, we sought to determine whether the viability, proliferation potential, capacity for differentiation, migration ability and amenability for genetic manipulation are maintained in MSCs cryopreserved for up to five years. MSCs were established from the mononuclear cell fraction of an umbilical cord blood (CB) sample. Primary adherent MSC monolayers were sub-cultured until passage 12 and aliquots of various cell passages were frozen at −70°C in the presence of 10% dimethylsulfoxide (Me2SO) and 10% fetal bovine serum. MSCs were thawed rapidly at 37°C, sub-cultured to about 80% confluency, trypsinized, and subjected to trypan blue viability test, seeded in the presence of osteogenic and chondrogenic media, analyzed by flow cytometry for expression of surface markers and by RT-PCR for gene expression of tissue markers, and assessed for migration response. We found that although the viability decreased by up to 20% post-thaw, the proliferation potential of CB-MSCs as measured by population doubling level of 7 was not affected by cryopreservation, nor was their ability to differentiate to osteoblasts (by staining of calcium deposits using Alizarin red) and to chondrocytes (by staining of proteoglycans using Alcian blue). The MSCs retained positive expression for the stromal markers CD73, CD90 and CD105 and negative expression for the hematopoietic markers CD34 and CD45. In addition, they expressed pluripotency genes and early tissue markers for muscle, bone and cartilage. Furthermore, the MSCs retained their migratory response towards the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor, which is up-regulated at sites of tissue injury. In conclusion, CB-derived MSCs cryopreserved for up to 5years at −70°C in the presence of 10% Me2SO demonstrate high-efficiency recovery of viable, proliferative and functional cells which can be employed for clinical transplantation or manipulated for gene therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalizarin 3abone formation 3acalcium 3acartilage 3achemokines 3achondrocytes 3acryopreservation 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afetal bovine serum 3aflow cytometry 3agene therapy 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amuscles 3aosteoblasts 3aproteoglycans 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astaining 3aumbilical cord 3aviability 3aviability assays1 aXu, A.1 aJanowska-Wieczorek, A.0 tCryobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.519-519dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.09.3593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006500148245015900213300001800372520118700390592002801577650003301605650001401638650002301652650001301675650001601688650001101704650002701715650002501742650001301767650001401780650001301794650001301807650001201820700002201832700002301854700002001877700002301897700001901920773011501939856008302054852000902137655001202146IND60741392020221120232050.0210731e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074139202DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-021-05043-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazid, Abdel-Hamid I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0994-186510aAdjuvant effect of saponin in an oil-based monovalent (serotype O) foot-and-mouth disease virus vaccine on the antibody response in guinea pigs and cattle  ap. 1977-1984.  aTo enhance the potency of a foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) vaccine, saponin was included in the vaccine formula. In this study, the combined effect of Montanide ISA 50 and saponin was evaluated. Two experiments were performed in guinea pigs and one in cattle to determine the optimal antigen and saponin doses. Only serotype O of foot-and-mouth disease virus (O/PanAsia-2 of ME-SA topotype) was employed in preparation of the monovalent vaccine. All animals were immunized twice with a four-week interval, except for the negative controls. Blood was collected 10 days after the second booster, and the immune response was evaluated using a serum neutralization test. Oil-based FMD vaccines containing saponin induced higher neutralizing antibody levels than formulations lacking saponin. The addition of saponin to formulations with low antigen payload (2.5 µg of inactivated whole virus particles [146S particles] per dose) gave significantly higher neutralizing antibody levels (p < 0.005) than 5 µg of 146S without saponin, suggesting that it can be used to improve FMD vaccine potency in susceptible animals. No adverse effects were observed in vaccinated cattle or guinea pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFoot-and-mouth disease virus 3aadjuvants 3aantibody formation 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3acattle 3afoot-and-mouth disease 3aneutralization tests 3asaponins 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3avirology 3aviruses1 aEl-Alfy, Hayam A.1 aEl-Didamony, Gamal1 aElfeil, Wael K.1 aEl-Sayed, Magdy M.1 aFawzy, Mohamed0 tArchives of virology.g2021 July, v. 166, no. 7 p.1977-1984dSpringer ViennawJournal:jnl6093x0304-86087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05043-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245019300170520201700363592002802380650001302408650001202421650001102433650002202444650001602466650002502482650001202507650002302519650001002542650001602552650001402568650000702582650001802589650001902607650001502626650001102641653002902652653003302681653001802714653001202732653000702744653002202751700001702773700001402790700001702804700001302821700001602834700001402850773011902864856008802983852000903071655001203080IND60770032320221122142315.0220509e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077003232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Zisha10aMedium-chain fatty acids production from carbohydrates-rich wastewater through two-stage yeast biofilm processes without external electron donor addition: Biofilm development and pH impact  aThe production of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) is considered promising for carbon resource recovery from waste streams. However, a large quantity of external electron donors are often required, causing great cost and environmental impact. Therefore, in this study, a two-stage technology was developed to produce MCFAs from carbohydrate-rich wastewater without external electron donor addition, with the biofilm development and pH impact being explored. Stage I aimed at converting organics into ethanol and a yeast biofilm reactor is innovatively applied. The results showed that the yeast biofilm could quickly form on carriers with steady-state thickness reaching 50–200 μm. However, the attachment of yeast biofilm was weak at the initial stage so that the violent turbulence should be avoided during operation. The polyurethane foam was the most suitable for yeast biofilm development among the tested carriers, as evidenced by the highest ethanol production, accounting for 74.2% of soluble organics. The Nakaseomyces was the main fungal genus in the steady-state biofilm, while lactic acid bacteria were also developed, resulting in lactate and acetate production. In Stage II, the yeast biofilm reactor effluent was applied for MCFA production at different pH (5–8). However, the MCFA production selectivity was significantly affected by pH, with 65.2% at pH of 5 but decreasing substantially to 3.0% at pH of 8. Both the microbial and electron transfer efficiency analysis suggested that mildly acidic pH can promote the electron transfer from ethanol toward the chain elongation process instead of its excessive oxidation. Thus, if conditions of online extraction or microbial tolerance permit, a lower pH should be recommended for Stage II in the developed technology as well as other ethanol-based MCFA production process. This is a conceptual study that eliminated external electron donor addition in MCFAs production and provide a sustainable and reliable way in carbon resources recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3abiofilm 3acarbon 3aelectron transfer 3aenvironment 3aenvironmental impact 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afoams 3alactic acid 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolyurethanes 3aturbulent flow 3awastewater 3ayeasts 0aMedium-chain fatty acids 0aCarbohydrate-rich wastewater 0aYeast biofilm 0aEthanol 0apH 0aelectron transfer1 aNi, Bing-Jie1 aZhang, Lu1 aLiu, Zhitong1 aFu, Weng1 aDai, Xiaohu1 aSun, Jing0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 01, v. 828 p.154428-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245010800172300001600280520215400296592002802450650001102478650001502489650001902504650001002523650001902533650002002552650002202572653000902594653002402603653000802627653001302635700002502648700003802673700002502711773012602736856008702862852000902949655001202958IND50067952420221123044929.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006795242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2013.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBøe, Knut Egil10aIndividual distance during resting and feeding in age homogeneous vs. age heterogeneous groups of goats  ap. 112-116.  aThe aim of this experiment was to investigate the individual distance during resting and feeding in homogenous and heterogeneous age groups of young and adult goats. Thirty-six young (<2 years) and thirty-six adult goats (>3 years) were allotted into 6 groups of young goats (YOUNG), 6 groups of adult goats (ADULT) and 6 heterogeneous age groups (HETERO), with 4 individuals in each group. Each group was tested in an experimental pen (12.0m×2.0m) for three days where a 24h video recording was conducted on the last day. The distance between all goats in the group (6 possible pairs) during resting was scored every 10min for 12h (from 18.00h to 06.00h) and during feeding every second minute for 2h after each feeding (09.00h and 15.00h).There was no significant effect of age composition or activity per se, but there was a clear interaction between age composition and activity regarding individual distance. Individual distance was significantly larger during feeding than during resting in the HETERO groups, but there was no such effect in the YOUNG and ADULT groups. The goats in the YOUNG groups had shorter individual distance when feeding than the HETERO and ADULT groups (1.71±0.12m, 2.93±0.09m and 2.87±0.16m respectively), but there was no significant difference between HETERO and ADULT. In the HETERO treatment, the individual distance between pairs of young goats was significantly lower than between pairs of adult goats and pairs of young–adult goats irrespective of activity (1.49±0.24m, 2.13±0.24m and 2.65±0.12m respectively). Variation in individual distance was lower during resting than during feeding in the YOUNG treatment, but not in the HETERO and ADULT treatment. To conclude, the individual distance was shorter during resting than feeding in the heterogeneous age groups, but this difference was not present in the adult or young, homogenous age groups. There were no differences in individual distance during resting between the different age groups. Overall, young goats appear to be more tolerant to having other individuals of similar age in close proximity and keep the longest distance to adult goats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aanimal age 3aanimal feeding 3agoats 3agroup behavior 3aresting periods 3aspatial variation 0aGoat 0aIndividual distance 0aAge 0aActivity1 aEhrlenbruch, Rebecca1 aJørgensen, Grete Helen Meisfjord1 aAndersen, Inger Lise0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2013 July, v. 147, no. 1-2 p.112-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2013.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245019600166300001400362520071800376592002801094650001901122650001001141650001001151650001201161650001001173650001601183650001801199650001001217650001101227700001801238773012301256856008201379852000901461655001201470IND60772353920221119073117.0220403e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077235392DNAL7 a10.1134/S10674136220200592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLapteva, E.

It was established that, in the Early Holocene, arboreal birches and Siberian spruce (which in the Middle Holocene, together with larch, formed taiga forests) migrated to this territory. In the Late Holocene, forests were replaced by tundras. The overgrowth of the paleo water body began in the Early Holocene. This led to the formation of lowland bogs, which at the end of the Middle Holocene transformed into oligotrophic bogs through a transitional stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolocene epoch 3aLarix 3aPicea 3aecology 3alakes 3apaleobotany 3asurface water 3ataiga 3atundra1 aKorona, O.

It is used for transportation and cell banking. However, the impact of cryopreservation on the genetic and epigenetic profile of frozen cells is still unclear. Here, we try to explore the alterations caused to cryopreserved mesenchymal stem cells and its possible implications. Our freezing protocol showed that the cells frozen with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at all passages (early, mid and late) had the best post thaw survivability in terms of MTT assay and adherence capacity. 1% and 15% Me2SO concentrations proved to be sub-optimal after thawing the cells. Adipogenic differentiation of MSCs showed that cells frozen in all concentrations of Me2SO could differentiate to adipocytes. Cells frozen with 5%, 10% and 15% Me2SO showed comparable oil droplet formation. DNA methylation plays a critical role in health and disease. Changes in DNA methylation has been seen in cancer, ageing and auto immune diseases. Alterations in the 5-mC% content of DNA were observed in the frozen samples as compared to control (unfrozen cells, never exposed to Me2SO). Further studies need to be conducted so as to determine the implication of these alterations. In total, cryopreservation seemed to cause changes in the mRNA expressions, global DNA methylation which could alter the cell fate at a later time point. Therefore, there is a need for comprehensive and orderly studies to determine the possible impact of subtle genomic/epigenomic and proteomic changes resulting from cryopreservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA methylation 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3abiological specimen banks 3acryopreservation 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3adroplets 3aepigenetics 3afreezing 3agenomics 3amesenchymal stromal cells 3amessenger RNA 3aneoplasms 3aoils 3aproteomics 3athawing 3atoxicity testing 3atransportation1 aHofmann, N.1 aMueller, T.1 aNiemann, H.1 aGlasmacher, B.0 tCryobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.519-519dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.09.3613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245010000160300001200260500001900272520160300291592002801894596006401922650001301986650002001999650002002019650002402039650000902063650000902072650001102081650001602092650001702108650000902125650000902134650001902143651001002162700001502172700001502187700001502202700001302217773015102230856008302381852000902464655001202473IND60704682820221119205634.0201127e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070468282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-020-08510-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Dan10aAssessment of soil and maize contamination by TE near a coal gangue–fired thermal power plant  ap. 541.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCoal preparation by-products, such as coal gangue, are inferior fuels enriched with trace elements (TEs). Owing to the issues surrounding the disposal of coal preparation by-products and energy shortages, Chinese researchers have strongly advocated harvesting energy from by-products. However, the secondary environmental pollution caused by such by-products has been overlooked. In this study, we aimed to assess the contamination of soil and maize (Zea mays L.) near a coal gangue–fired power plant (CGPP) in Liupanshui City, Guizhou Province, China, by TEs. The contents of 11 TEs (Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, V, and Zn) in soil samples and different maize tissues were measured, and their chemical speciation in soil was also determined. The results showed that the soil in the study area was polluted by the above elements to varying degrees at a very high potential ecological risk. The Cr and Pb levels in niblets of partial samples exceeded the Chinese food safety standards. The TE contents of maize tissues largely depend on the bioavailable fraction of the same elements in the soils, rather than their total contents. Pearson’s correlation and hierarchical cluster analyses resulted in three clusters:(1) Pb–Zn–Cd; (2) Co–Cu–Mn–Sb–V–Be; and (3) Cr–Ni. Coal preparation by-products should not be directly combusted without pre-treatment. These results will aid readers and engineers in understanding the adverse effect of CGPPs and provide regulators and policymakers with relevant data to scientifically guide the utilisation of coal preparation by-products.  aPublisher supplied data  a41173115cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN) 3aZea mays 3aadverse effects 3abioavailability 3achemical speciation 3acoal 3acorn 3aenergy 3afood safety 3apower plants 3arisk 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3aChina1 aWu, Daishe1 aXu, Feigao1 aLai, Jinhu1 aShao, Li0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2020 Aug., v. 192, no. 8 p.541-541dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08510-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012400170300001600294520084400310592002801154650002001182650001701202650001801219650001201237650001401249650002601263650002101289650001601310650001701326650000901343650002901352650002901381653002701410653002401437653001901461653001301480653001001493700001601503700006501519773011501584856008601699852000901785655001201794IND60635251620221119210656.0190410e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063525162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.03.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadi, Adnan A.10aIn-vitro metabolic profiling study of potential topoisomerase inhibitors ‘pyrazolines’ in RLMs by mass spectrometry  ap. 125-133.  aTaking into consideration of the cytotoxicity and topo-IIα inhibitory activity of pyrazoline derivatives (1–3) against HCT15 cells, and known topo-IIα inhibitor, etoposide, respectively, the compounds were biotransformed in rat liver microsomes.

The convergence points among hormone signal transduction cascades are considered as cross-talk which are crucial for plant development as well as for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Hormones interact by activating either a second messenger or through a phosphorylation cascade. These transduction cascades lead to the regulation of gene expression that directly affects the biosynthesis or action of different hormones and developmental processes in coordination with multiple stimuli. Hormone synthesis, signal transduction, perception and cross-talk create a complex network. Interaction of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) which form intimate association with the roots of higher plants also modulate the level of endogenous phytohormones and demonstrate a new paradigm for hormonal interaction. The ratio of hormones changes with ontogeny of plant and the specific ratio of growth promoting and growth inhibiting hormones determine the response of plants. Furthermore, the sensitivity of plant tissue to each hormone changes with the exposure to stresses. This review is a compilation of the interactions between phytohormones and plant development. The cross talk between different hormones under abiotic and biotic stresses will be enumerated. Hormone and stress-responsive cis elements and the trans-regulation capabilities of miRNAs for the coordination of multiple hormonal responses will be discussed. Finally the role of PGPR will be evaluated under various environmental stresses with particular emphasis on phytohormone production and its interaction with host plant physiology. PGPR provides cross protective properties through improvement in defense mechanism controlling pathogen resistance through induced systemic resistance (ISR) and alleviating abiotic stress through influencing the phytohormones metabolism. PGPR isolates from stressed soil/stressed host plants impart tolerance to plants against abiotic and biotic stresses by modulating the production of phytohormones and alteration in their sensitivity to respond. Bacteria communicate with each other through quorum sensing molecules which also regulate gene expression and phytohormone production. The intricate relationship between other microbes/fungi and their residual effects on plant rhizosphere phytohormones need further investigation for better understanding of bacterial coordination with plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabiotic stress 3abiosynthesis 3abiotic stress 3afungi 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3ahormones 3ahost plants 3amicroRNA 3aontogeny 3aorganic compounds 3apathogens 3aphosphorylation 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant hormones 3aplant response 3aplant tissues 3aquorum sensing 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asecond messengers 3asoil 3asystemic acquired resistance1 aBano, Asghari1 aAli, Shahid1 aBabar, Md.

Yet, the existing reviews of accumulated knowledge about the multifaceted effects associated with exposure to ALAN focus on distinct ecosystem components. As a result, our understanding of potential system-wide impacts of ALAN exposure is insufficient. OBJECTIVES: This paper attempts to bridge this knowledge gap by reviewing a wide range of studies, with a particular focus on identifying the impacts of ALAN exposure that are common to different species. METHODS: The survey is conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and covers peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2019. RESULTS: Seventy-four eligible articles, out of 1223 initially identified, were selected and synthesized. 20% of them focus on humans, while the rest explore other living organisms, such as vertebrates, avian species, arthropods, aquatic organisms, and vegetation. The review demonstrates that similar adverse effects of ALAN exposure, ranging from sleep disturbance, depression, weight gain, eating and movement disorders, to elevated risk of cancer, are manifested across different components of the ecosystem, and therefore entail wider and more complex risks to its stability and integrity. CONCLUSION: To reduce ecosystem risks, associated with constantly increasing ALAN levels, illumination policies should be based on directional and reduced nighttime lighting, which can help to avoid unnecessary exposures. The study highlights knowledge gaps that warrant further research attention.  aPublisher supplied data  a400/18cIsrael Science Foundation 3abirds 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental health 3ahumans 3alandscape ecology 3alighting 3ameta-analysis 3arisk 3asleep deprivation 3asurveys 3avegetation 3aweight gain1 aPortnov, Boris A.1 aTrop, Tamar0 tLandscape ecology.g2020 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1725-1742dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870067x0921-29737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-01053-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03194naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245010500175520162200280592002801902650002301930650001801953650001601971650001201987650002301999650002502022650001102047650003302058650001202091650001802103650001502121650001702136650001302153650001902166650001302185650002702198650003002225653001402255653002102269653001802290653002202308700002202330700002402352700002302376700002102399700002202420700002502442773010202467856008602569852000902655655001202664IND60649503420221121223227.0200503e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064950342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1052032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlmeida, Viviane O.10aMolecular structure of amylopectin/amylose from Solanum lycocarpum starch after enzymatic hydrolysis  aThe fruit of Solanum lycocarpum is a rich source of starch which remains unexploited despite its promising chemical and rheological properties. In this study, the molecular structures of amylopectin and amylose from S. lycocarpum starch were evaluated by HPAEC-PAD, being determined their chain length and degree of polymerization (DP). In addition, the starch was submitted to enzymatic hydrolysis using immobilized α-amylase (PANI-AMY) and glucoamylase (PANI-GLU). The enzymes immobilization onto polyaniline-glutaraldehyde derivatives was optimized through a Central Composite Rotatable Design (CCRD) and the hydrolysis products were characterized by Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) and HPAEC-PAD. Results showed that amylopectin from S. lycocarpum starch had a maximal DP of 86, being observed a predominance of chains with type B1 (DP 13–24). On the other hand, the amylose is composed by short chain polymers, presenting DP of 57. Results from serial hydrolysis evidenced that the PANI-AMY reactor produced a set of malto-oligosaccharides, with predominance of pentoses (348.11 μg mL⁻¹), while in the PANI-GLU reactor it was produced high levels of glucose. In addition, hydrolysis tests using high starch concentration (10% w/v) evidenced that the reactors can be efficiently used to hydrolyze starch at the similar concentration to that used in industrial processes, being able to efficiently produce starch liquefaction. Therefore, the results obtained in this work contribute to improve the information about the properties and potentialities of native and hydrolyzed starches from S. lycocarpum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycocarpum 3aalpha-amylase 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3achemical structure 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3afruits 3aglucan 1,4-alpha-glucosidase 3aglucose 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrolysis 3aliquefaction 3apentoses 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3arheological properties 3athin layer chromatography 0aHPAEC-PAD 0aOligosaccharides 0aNative starch 0aHydrolyzed starch1 aPascoal, Aline M.1 aFerreira, Mayara C.1 aMorais, Ricardo R.1 aMoraes, Moemy G.1 aBatista, Karla A.1 aFernandes, Kátia F.0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2020 Mar., v. 100 p.105203-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1052033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03047naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001400146245010800160300001600268500002400284500001500308520164800323650001801971650002201989650002002011650002402031650001502055650001802070650002402088650002302112650001802135650001002153651001002163653002302173653001302196653001202209700002102221773011702242852000902359856007602368856008602444930003302530945001302563946001302576655001202589IND2207846420221120224224.0001117e200008  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220784642DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-29.4.7732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, C.10aEffects of surface wax variation in Pisum sativum on herbivorous and entomophagous insects in the field  ap. 773-780.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSeven accessions or varieties of cultivated pea Pisum sativum L. varying in surface waxbloom characteristics were grown in replicated small plots (1 m2) for two seasons to monitor natural infestations of insect herbivores and abundance of predatory insects. Waxbloom was quantified on the basis of the amount of waxes extractable from leaf surfaces, densities of wax crystals visible with scanning electron microscopy, and visual appearance. During each season, pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris) (Homoptera: Aphidae), densities per plant were significantly lower on peas with reduced surface waxbloom as compared with peas with standard or 'normal' surface waxbloom. This difference was greatest between two near isolines of peas differing in expression of a mutation that reduces surface waxes. Although reduced-waxbloom plants had lower end-of-season above ground biomass and vine lengths, including these variables as covariates did not affect the significance of the waxbloom effects on aphid densities. Damage to leaves and stipules by the pea leaf weevil Sitona lineatus (L.) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) was greater on reduced-waxbloom peas than normal-waxbloom peas. Thus, as occurs in other crops, reduced waxbloom in peas is associated with lower natural infestations of an aphid, but also with increased susceptibility to a folivorous beetle. Populations of predatory coccinellids did not differ consistently between years on reduced-waxbloom versus normal-waxbloom peas, failing to support a hypothesis that predator populations are higher on reduced waxbloom peas, contributing to the lower aphid populations on these plants. 3aCoccinellidae 3apredatory insects 3aSitona lineatus 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aherbivores 3aplant cuticle 3avarietal resistance 3apopulation density 3aPisum sativum 3awaxes 3aIdaho 0aepicuticular waxes 0awaxbloom 0ainsects1 aEigenbrode, S.D.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2000 Aug., v. 29, no. 4 p.773-780dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-29.4.7733Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03289naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009600169300001400265520137000279592002801649650001901677650003501696650002501731650001701756650001501773650001501788650002801803650002601831650002501857650004101882650002001923653001001943653001201953653000801965653000801973653000901981653001201990653000702002653000702009653000802016653000802024653000902032653000702041653000902048653001002057653001202067653001002079653001202089653002302101653001302124653001302137653001302150653001302163700002302176700001702199700002302216700002002239700002302259700001902282700002102301700002402322700001802346773010802364856008602472852000902558655001202567IND60635251820221119210613.0190425e20190515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063525182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.03.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Cindy X.10aQuantification of residual AEBSF-related impurities by reversed-phase liquid chromatography  ap. 19-23.  aDuring research of a broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb) for HIV-1 infection, site-specific clipping was observed during cell culture incubation. Protease inhibitor, 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), was supplemented to the cell culture feeding to mitigate clipping as one of the control strategies. It led to the need and development of a new assay to monitor the free AEBSF-related impurities during the purification process. In this work, a reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC-UV) method was developed to measure the total concentration of AEBSF and its major degradant product, 4-(aminoethyl) benzenesulfonic acid (AEBS-OH). This quantitative approach involved hydrolysis pre-treatment to drive all AEBSF to AEBS-OH, a filtration step to remove large molecules, followed by RPLC-UV analysis. The method was qualified and shown to be capable of measuring AEBS-OH down to 0.5 μM with good accuracy and precision, which was then applied for process clearance studies. The results demonstrated that a Protein A purification step in conjunction with a mock ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) step could remove AEBSF-related impurities below the detection level. Overall, this study is the first to provide a unique approach for monitoring the clearance of free AEBSF and its related degradant, AEBS-OH, in support of the bNAb research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHIV infections 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3abenzenesulfonic acid 3acell culture 3ahydrolysis 3amonitoring 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aproteinase inhibitors 3apurification methods 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3aultrafiltration 0aAEBSF 0aAEBS-OH 0aTFA 0amAb 0abNAb 0aRPLC-UV 0aUV 0aCV 0aRSD 0aPBS 0aMWCO 0aQC 0aLLOQ 0aUF/DF 0aRPLC-UV 0aAEBSF 0aAEBS-OH 0aProtease inhibitor 0aAntibody 0aClipping 0aImpurity 0aResidual1 aSchneck, Nicole A.1 aHarris, Doug1 aBlackstock, Daniel1 aIvleva, Vera B.1 aCheng, Kuang-Chuan1 aCharlton, Adam1 aArnold, Frank J.1 aCooper, Jonathan W.1 aLei, Q.

Rabbit meat patties were divided into five experimental groups: C (control, add nothing), B (add 0.02% w/w BHT), T1 (add 0.1% w/w PE), T2 (add 0.3% w/w PE), and T3 (add 0.5% w/w PE). The changes in the quality index were as follows: increasing PE incorporation levels lowered pH values, L* values, and a* values, while increased b* values indexes of rabbit meat patties compared to the C group. The purslane extract showed high efficiency against lipid oxidation and microbial growth, and also could retard the change rates of quality indices (p < .05). The models also indicated that purslane extract could reduce the rate parameter of lipid oxidation and extend the microbial growth lag time (p < .05). Besides, PE could enhance the rabbit meat patties' texture and had a greater preference by the panelists and the panelists' evaluations, and also could retard the change rates of sensory attributes. Based on the findings mentioned above, purslane extract is expected to become a promising natural additive to maintain meat products' quality and prolong their shelf‐life. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In recent decades, many studies were devoted to the development of natural antioxidants to replace synthetic antioxidants. PE showed a preservative effect on exerting a protective effect against lipid oxidation under chilled storage conditions. Our findings demonstrated that purslane extract is expected to become a promising natural additive to maintain meat products' quality and prolong their shelf‐life.  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS‐43‐E‐1cEarmarked Fund for China Agriculture Research System  aY201706cChongqing Herbivorous livestock Industry Technology System 3acold storage 3alipid peroxidation 3amicrobial growth 3apH 3aprotective effect 3arabbit meat 3ashelf life 3atexture1 aHe, Zhifei1 aZhang, Dong1 aChen, Xiaosi1 aLi, Hongjun0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.e15644-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.156443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002900138245013100167300001600298520171800314592002802032650001302060650002402073650001602097650001702113650001802130650001802148650001502166650002202181650002002203650001502223650001502238650002002253650001902273650001202292650002002304650001502324650001702339700002902356700003002385773010602415856007202521852000902593655001202602IND60516511720221119061207.0160325e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051651172DNAL7 a10.1002/etc.32402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRibas, João Luiz Coelho10aEffects of trophic exposure to diclofenac and dexamethasone on hematological parameters and immune response in freshwater fish  ap. 975-982.  aThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of diclofenac and dexamethasone on hematological parameters and immune response in the fish species Hoplias malabaricus after trophic exposure. Fish were fed twice every week with Astyanax sp., which were given an intraperitoneal inoculation with diclofenac (0 μg/kg, 0.2 μg/kg, 2.0 μg/kg, or 20.0 μg/kg) or dexamethasone (0.03 μg/kg, 0.3 μg/kg, or 3.0 μg/kg). After 12 doses, the hematological parameters and lipopolysaccharide‐induced nitric oxide production by head kidney monocytic lineage were evaluated. Exposed fish also received 1 mg/kg of carrageenan intraperitoneal, and cell migration to the peritoneal cavity was evaluated after 4 h. Diclofenac and dexamethasone altered the red blood cell count, as well as hematocrit and hemoglobin levels. The total blood leukocyte count decreased in all groups. A significantly reduced carrageenan‐induced leukocyte migration to the peritoneal cavity, particularly of polymorphonuclear cells, was observed at all tested doses, suggesting a possible immunosuppressive effect. The basal nitric oxide synthesis of head kidney cell cultures was reduced at the highest dose of diclofenac and was increased at the highest dose of dexamethasone. The lipopolysaccharide‐stimulated nitric oxide production was reduced in all treatments, thus corroborating the immunosuppressive effect. Although some fish responses were variable for different drugs, the results suggested that trophic exposure to diclofenac and dexamethasone can lead to hematological changes and immunotoxic effects, causing negative impacts in aquatic organisms.

The production of these popular nuts leaves a large amount of environmental pollutants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheological, physicochemical, and sensorial properties of ice cream by replacement of milk cream with watermelon exocarp powder (WEP) at 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% levels. The results showed that although all samples showed the pseudo‐plastic behavior rheologically, the replacement of cream with WEP significantly affected the physicochemical properties. Adding the WEP increased the textural properties and melting resistance of the samples, whereas overrun, draw temperature, and the flow behavior index decreased, significantly (p < 0.5). Hedonic evaluation showed not only that adding the WEP at 20% level does not have a significant effect on sensory properties, but also received the highest scores. Finally, regarding the high amount of fiber and minerals in WEP can lead to produce lower calorie ice cream with higher nutritional value. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: A new look on using Jaban watermelon environmental pollutants to produce economically and nutritionally valuable by‐products. Investigation of macro‐ and micro compounds in watermelon exocarp powder. Producing of low calorie and high nutritional value ice cream by replacing cream with WEP.  aPublisher supplied data  a3/48866cFerdowsi University of Mashhad 3acream 3aexocarp 3ahedonic scales 3aice cream 3amilk 3anutritive value 3arheology 3atemperature 3awatermelons 3aIran1 aShahidi, Fakhri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5257-82051 aRoshanak, Sahar1 aNassiri Mahallati, Marzieh0 tJournal of food processing and preservation.g2021 Sept., v. 45, no. 9 p.e15768-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl45214x0145-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfpp.157683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002000169245007700189300001600266520172700282592002802009650002602037650001602063650001902079650001202098650001102110650002402121650001402145650001302159650002502172650001602197700002302213700002502236700002102261700003002282700001802312773012302330856007302453852000902526655001202535IND60132611120221119165613.0150505e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013261112DNAL7 a10.1111/een.121782doi7 a10.1111/een.121782chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANDOW, DAVID A.10aDynamics of cannibalism in equal‐aged cohorts of Spodoptera frugiperda  ap. 229-236.  a1. Antagonistic interactions in herbivorous insects are often density‐dependent, so rates are predicted to vary dynamically over time as density changes. Fatal intraspecific interactions, especially cannibalism, occur between equal‐aged larvae in young first‐ and second‐instar Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith). 2. A cannibalism experiment was conducted, starting with seven different densities of neonate S. frugiperda larvae, each replicated 50 times. Larvae were examined daily for the duration of the first and second instars (7 days). Seven‐day mortality was density‐dependent. 3. A stochastic mathematical model was developed in which per‐capita mortality from antagonistic interactions among equal‐aged larvae varies dynamically as density changes. A maximum likelihood method was developed to estimate the conditional per‐capita mortality rate from antagonistic interactions given an intraspecific encounter. An alternative model with mean‐mortality from antagonistic interactions that depends only on the initial larval density was also developed. 4. The models were fitted to the experimental data, and compared using log‐likelihood. The dynamic model fitted the cannibalism data significantly better than the time‐averaged mortality model for all starting densities for the experimental data, implying that density‐dependent mortality varied dynamically over time even within short 7‐day periods. 5. The conditional per‐capita mortality rate from antagonistic interactions was also density‐dependent, possibly because encounters became more aggregated at higher density, or because the probability that a larva died from the interaction was higher at higher density, or both.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3acannibalism 3adynamic models 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amathematical models 3amortality 3aneonates 3aphytophagous insects 3aprobability1 aFARIAS, JULIANO R.1 aHORIKOSHI, RENATO J.1 aBERNARDI, DANIEL1 aNASCIMENTO, ANTONIO R.

Shoot cultures were cold-hardened at 5°C on 1/2 MS medium for 30days. Shoot tips with basal plate (1.5–2.0×1.0mm) were excised from shoot cultures and precultured at 5°C for 3days on solidified 1/2 MS medium containing 0.3M sucrose. Precultured shoot tips were placed on aluminium cryo-plate with 10 wells (diameter 1mm) and embedded in calcium alginate gel. Osmoprotection was performed by immersing the cryo-plates for 30min at 25°C in a loading solution (2M glycerol +1.0M sucrose). In the D-cryo-plate procedure, the shoot tips were dehydrated by placing the cryo-plates in the air current of a laminar flow cabinet for 30–150min. In the V-cryo-plate procedure, buds were dehydrated by immersing the cryo-plates in PVS2 vitrification solution for 40min at 25°C. In both procedures, cooling was performed by placing the cryo-plates in uncapped cryotubes, which were immersed in liquid nitrogen. For rewarming, shoot tips attached to the cryo-plates were rewarmed by immersion in a petri dish containing 1.0M sucrose solution at 25°C. Regrowth of cryopreserved shoot tips using D-Cryo-plate and V-Cryo-plate procedures, was 90% and 80%, respectively. The two procedures were applied to 20 additional chrysanthemum lines. This protocol appears to be a promising technique for cryopreservation of chrysanthemum genetic resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum 3aair 3aaluminum 3abiological safety cabinet 3abuds 3acalcium alginate 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3agenetic resources 3aglycerol 3anitrogen 3aregrowth 3ashoot tips 3asucrose 3avitrification 3awells1 aAkimoto-Kato, A.1 aNiino, T.1 aMatsumoto, T.0 tCryobiology.g2014 Dec., v. 69, no. 3 p.520-521dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl45487x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2014.09.3663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245014700213300001400360520145300374592002801827650004401855650002201899650002601921650001501947650002001962650004301982650001802025650002002043650003302063650003302096650001302129650001302142650001002155653000702165653000802172653001002180653000802190653000802198653001202206653000902218653000902227653000802236653001002244653000802254653000902262653000902271653003802280653000902318653001802327653001802345700002502363700002402388700002902412700002202441773011302463856008602576852000902662655001202671IND60635252120221119210434.0190410e20190501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063525212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.03.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRahimpoor, Razzagh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7481-292310aFacile and sensitive determination of urinary mandelic acid by combination of metal organic frameworks with microextraction by packed sorbents  ap. 45-54.  aIn this study, two hybrid metal organic frameworks including MOF-5@ Fe3O4-NH2 and MOF-5@ SBA-15 for the first time were synthetized and combined with microextraction by packed sorbent (MEPS) to extract of mandelic acid (MA) from urine samples. The synthetized sorbents were characterized using FE-SEM, XRD and FT-IR techniques. The important parameters in MEPS procedure including sample volume, extraction draw_discard cycles, elution solvent volume and desorption draw-eject cycles were optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) with central composite design (CCD). The results indicated that the volume of elution solvent was the most important parameter in the recovery of MA by MOF-MEPS procedure. The optimized MOF-MEPS method offered an acceptable efficiency for the recovery of MA from urine samples (MOF-5@Fe3O4-NH2 and MOF-5@SBA-15: 94.5% and 90.3%, respectively, RSD < 3.54%). The limit of detection (LOD) of MA calculated by MOF-MEPS procedure combined with high performance liquid chromatography for MOF-5@ Fe3O4-NH2 and MOF-5@ SBA-15 were calculated to be 0.10 and 0.13 μg mL−1, respectively. The linearity dynamic ranges (LDRs) determination of urinary MA by MOF-5@ Fe3O4-NH2 and MOF-5@ SBA-15 were 0.2–100 and 0.2–90 μg mL−1, respectively. The results of the present study implied that the proposed technique is a fast and sensitive procedure for extraction and determination of MA from urine samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoordination polymers 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amandelic acid 3amicroextraction 3aresponse surface methodology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolvents 3asorbents 3aurine 0aMA 0aBEI 0aACGIH 0aLLE 0aSPE 0aHF-LPME 0aSPME 0aMEPS 0aMOF 0aAPTES 0aDMF 0aTEOS 0aHPLC 0aMicroextraction by packed sorbent 0aMOFs 0aMandelic acid 0aUrine samples1 aBahrami, Abdulrahman1 aNematollahi, Davood1 aShahna, Farshid Ghorbani1 aFarhadian, Maryam0 tJournal of chromatography.g2019 May 01, v. 1114-1115 p.45-54dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12459x1570-02327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jchromb.2019.03.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245018900158300002000347520046900367592002800836650001400864650002300878650002700901650001900928650001300947700001800960700001600978700001800994773012501012856007401137852000901211655001201220IND60667110420221120085940.0190919e20141124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066711042DNAL7 a10.1039/c4ra13826k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWan, Jie-Ping10aMetal-free synthesis of cyano acrylates via cyanuric chloride-mediated three-component reactions involving a cascade consists of Knoevenagel condensation/cyano hydration/esterification  ap. 63997-64000.  aThe synthesis of cyano acrylates has been achieved via an organocatalytic domino Knoevenagel reaction, hydration and esterification under metal-free conditions without using any additional solvent.

Yet, the impacts of fire in wet forests can be high and therefore understanding the drivers of fire in these systems is vital. OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify and rank by importance the factors plausibly driving flammability in wet eucalypt forests, and describe relationships between them. In doing so, we formulated a set of research priorities. METHODS: Conceptual models of forest flammability in wet eucalypt forests were elicited from 21 fire experts using a combination of elicitation techniques. Forest flammability was defined using fire occurrence and fireline intensity as measures of ignitability and heat release rate, respectively. RESULTS: There were shared and divergent opinions about the drivers of flammability in wet eucalypt forests. Widely agreed factors were drought, dead fine fuel moisture content, weather and topography. These factors all influence the availability of biomass to burn, albeit their effects and interactions on various dimensions of flammability are poorly understood. Differences between the models related to lesser understood factors (e.g. live and coarse fuel moisture, plant traits, heatwaves) and the links between factors. CONCLUSIONS: By documenting alternative conceptual models, we made shared and divergent opinions explicit about flammability in wet forests. We identified four priority research areas: (1) quantifying drought and fuel moisture thresholds for fire occurrence and intensity, (2) modelling microclimate in dense vegetation and rugged terrain, (3) determining the attributes of live vegetation that influence forest flammability, (4) evaluating fire management strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3abiomass 3adrought 3afire behavior 3aflammability 3aforests 3afuel moisture index 3aheat 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3amicroclimate 3atopography1 aHemming, Victoria1 aAckland, Andrew1 aAnderson, Wendy1 aBowman, David1 aBradstock, Ross1 aBrown, Tegan P.1 aBurton, Jamie1 aCary, Geoffrey J.1 aDuff, Thomas J.1 aFilkov, Alexander1 aFurlaud, James M.1 aGazzard, Tim1 aKilinc, Musa1 aNyman, Petter1 aPeacock, Ross1 aRyan, Mike1 aSharples, Jason1 aSheridan, Gary1 aTolhurst, Kevin1 aWells, Tim1 aZylstra, Phil1 aPenman, Trent D.0 tLandscape ecology.g2020 Aug., v. 35, no. 8 p.1775-1798dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870067x0921-29737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-01055-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002100190245005700211300001600268520166500284592002801949653000801977653000901985653001201994653000902006653000802015653000802023653000902031653000702040653000802047653001002055653000902065653001102074653001102085653000702096653000802103653000702111653001302118653000802131653001202139653001702151653002602168653001102194653001802205653000802223653000802231700002102239700002002260700002302280773007302303856008302376852000902459655001202468IND60554999720221117041514.0161026s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055499972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2012.11.0022doi7 aPMC37576742pmcid7 a240241542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHickok, Jason R.10aOxygen dependence of nitric oxide-mediated signaling  ap. 203-209.  aNitric oxide (NO) is a biologically important short-lived free radical signaling molecule. Both the enzymatic synthesis and the predominant forms of cellular metabolism of NO are oxygen-dependent. For these reasons, changes in local oxygen concentrations can have a profound influence on steady-state NO concentrations. Many proteins are regulated by NO in a concentration-dependent manner, but their responses are elicited at different thresholds. Using soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and p53 as model NO-sensitive proteins, we demonstrate that their concentration-dependent responses to NO are a function of the O2 concentration. p53 requires relatively high steady-state NO concentrations (>600nM) to induce its phosphorylation (P-ser-15), whereas sGC responds to low NO concentrations (<100nM). At a constant rate of NO production (liberation from NO-donors), decreasing the O2 concentration (1%) lowers the rate of NO metabolism. This raises steady-state NO concentrations and allows p53 activation at lower doses of the NO donor. Enzymatic NO production, however, requires O2 as a substrate such that decreasing the O2 concentration below the Km for O2 for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) will decrease the production of NO. We demonstrate that the amount of NO produced by RAW 264.7 macrophages is a function of the O2 concentration. Differences in rates of NO production and NO metabolism result in differential sGC activation that is not linear with respect to O2. There is an optimal O2 concentration (≈5–8%) where a balance between the synthesis and metabolism of NO is established such that both the NO concentration and sGC activation are maximal.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBH4 0acGMP 0aDETA/NO 0aeNOS 0aFAD 0aFMN 0aiNOS 0aKm 0aLPS 0aNADPH 0anNOS 0aNO3− 0aNO2− 0aNO 0aODQ 0aO2 0aP-Ser-15 0asGC 0aSper/NO 0aNitric oxide 0aNitric oxide synthase 0aOxygen 0aAutooxidation 0asGC 0ap531 aVasudevan, Divya1 aJablonski, Kate1 aThomas, Douglas D.0 tRedox Biology.g2013, v. 1 p.203-209dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2012.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001900147245014000166300001800306500002400324500001500348520156800363650001801931650002201949650002601971650001101997650002102008650002302029650001302052650002502065650001502090650001602105650001802121650002302139650001002162650001202172651001402184653003002198653002602228653002202254653001402276700001702290773011902307852000902426856007602435856008702511930003302598945001302631946001302644655001202657IND2331530120221121184945.0030321e200112  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233153012DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-30.6.10172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolwine, A.E.10aPotential of winter cover crops to increase abundance of Solenopsis invicta (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and other arthropods in sugarcane  ap. 1017-1020.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA 3-yr study was conducted in Louisiana sugarcane field plots to determine the potential of vegetation management and winter cover crops to enhance abundance of the fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren, other arthropods, gastropods, and spring sugarcane density. Treatments included pea, clover, and vetch cultivars, a weed-free herbicide treatment, a vetch with herbicide on the row tops; and a mixed weeds treatment arranged in a randomized complete block design. Compared with similar studies conducted during the summer months, spring collections of arthropods in pitfall traps were very low and few differences in arthropod densities occurred. Neither cover crop cultivar nor biomass substantially influenced arthropod density or cane stand density. Slugs (Limacidae) and earwigs (Dermaptera) were most abundant in mixed weed plots. The highest numbers of carabids in 1994 were found in vetch plots, which tended to have higher biomass than other treatments. Soybean oil-soaked bait cards attracted more ants in clover plots than in the plots with vetch plus herbicide. Compared with previous summer studies, we feel that harsher winter weather and other density independent mortality factors during this study period superseded effects of cover crops, vegetation management and quantity of biomass on arthropod densities during the winter. Although positive impacts of winter cover crops were not detected for the variables measured during the study period these data should not be used to suggest that cover crops do not provide agronomic benefit to farmers. 3aVicia villosa 3aVigna unguiculata 3aSaccharum officinarum 3awinter 3aTrifolium repens 3aSolenopsis invicta 3aLathyrus 3apredatory arthropods 3ametribuzin 3acover crops 3astand density 3apopulation density 3aweeds 3abiomass 3aLouisiana 0apredators of insect pests 0avegetation management 0alathyrus hirsutus 0apredators1 aReagan, T.E.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2001 Dec., v. 30, no. 6 p.1017-1020dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3Tables on contents40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-30.6.10173Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02706naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001900190245012900209300001200338520130200350592002801652653000901680653000801689653000901697653001001706653000901716653000901725653000901734653000901743653000801752653001001760653001001770653000801780653000801788653000901796653000801805653000801813653000801821653000801829653001801837653002001855653001001875653002801885653001701913653001701930700002901947700001501976773006901991856008302060852000902143655001202152IND60554999820221117042021.0161026s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055499982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.redox.2012.11.0032doi7 aPMC37576852pmcid7 a240241322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiers, Anne R.10aNitrosative stress and redox-cycling agents synergize to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in endothelial cells  ap. 1-7.  aNitric oxide production by the endothelium is required for normal vascular homeostasis; however, in conditions of oxidative stress, interactions of nitric oxide with reactive oxygen species (ROS) are thought to underlie endothelial dysfunction. Beyond canonical nitric oxide signaling pathways, nitric oxide production results in the post-translational modification of protein thiols, termed S-nitrosation. The potential interplay between S-nitrosation and ROS remains poorly understood and is the focus of the current study. The effects of the S-nitrosating agent S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) in combination with redox-cycling agents was examined in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). CysNO significantly impairs mitochondrial function and depletes the NADH/NAD+ pool; however, these changes do not result in cell death. When faced with the additional stressor of a redox-cycling agent used to generate ROS, further loss of NAD+ occurs, and cellular ATP pools are depleted. Cellular S-nitrosothiols also accumulate, and cell death is triggered. These data demonstrate that CysNO sensitizes endothelial cells to redox-cycling agent-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death and identify attenuated degradation of S-nitrosothiols as one potential mechanism for the enhanced cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBAEC 0aBSO 0acGMP 0aCysNO 0aDMNQ 0aDMSO 0aDPBS 0aDTPA 0aDTT 0aGAPDH 0aGSHee 0aLDH 0aNAC 0aN.D. 0aNOS 0aOCR 0aROS 0aSEM 0aS-nitrosation 0aS-nitrosylation 0aThiol 0aReactive oxygen species 0aNitric oxide 0aMitochondria1 aBroniowska, Katarzyna A.1 aHogg, Neil0 tRedox Biology.g2013, v. 1 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.x2213-23177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2012.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02840naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013100168300001800299500001900317520160500336592002801941650002501969650001201994650001602006650001902022650001702041650001902058650002402077650000902101650001802110650001202128700003002140700002302170700002202193773014702215856008302362852000902445655001202454IND60729754320221117201244.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072975432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-03119-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzigeti, Marton10aRapid capillary gel electrophoresis analysis of human milk oligosaccharides for food additive manufacturing in-process control  ap. 1595-1603.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIndustrial production of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) represents a recently growing interest since they serve as key ingredients in baby formulas and are also utilized as dietary supplements for all age groups. Despite their short oligosaccharide chain lengths, HMO analysis is challenging due to extensive positional and linkage variations. Capillary gel electrophoresis primarily separates analyte molecules based on their hydrodynamic volume to charge ratios, thus, offers excellent resolution for most of such otherwise difficult-to-separate isomers. In this work, two commercially available gel compositions were evaluated on the analysis of a mixture of ten synthetic HMOs. The relevant respective separation matrices were then applied to selected analytical in-process control examples. The conventionally used carbohydrate separation matrix was applied for the in-process analysis of bacteria-mediated production of 3-fucosyllactose, lacto-N-tetraose, and lacto-N-neotetraose. The other example showed the suitability of the method for the in vivo in-process control of a shake flask and fermentation approach of 2′-fucosyllactose production. In this latter instance, borate complexation was utilized to efficiently separate the 2′- and 3-fucosylated lactose positional isomers. In all instances, the analysis of the HMOs of interest required only a couple of minutes with high resolution and excellent migration time and peak area reproducibility (average RSD 0.26% and 3.56%, respectively), features representing high importance in food additive manufacturing in-process control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aborates 3abreast milk 3aculture flasks 3afermentation 3afood additives 3agel electrophoresis 3agels 3ahydrodynamics 3alactose1 aMeszaros-Matwiejuk, Agnes1 aMolnar-Gabor, Dora1 aGuttman, András,0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2021 Mar., v. 413, no. 6 p.1595-1603dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-03119-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02574naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245011000160520114600270592002801416650000801444650001501452650001101467650001501478650001601493650002001509650002001529650002101549650001301570650001101583650001501594650001401609650002101623650001401644653005901658653003101717653002201748653000901770653002001779700001701799700001401816700001501830700001501845700001501860773011301875856008301988852000902071655001202080IND60646704520221118040128.0200607e20190915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064670452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2019.1113972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Ya12aA catalytic molecule machine-driven biosensing method for amplified electrochemical detection of exosomes  aNowadays, exosomes that carry abundant information have attracted increasing attention as potent biomarkers of liquid biopsy and ideal candidates for early diagnosis and treatment of cancers. In this work, we propose a “principle-of-proof” biosensing method for amplified electrochemical detection of exosomes by using HepG2-derived exosomes as models. Specifically, target exosomes are enriched on anti-CD63-functionalized immunobeads and then recognized by a DNA chain containing CD63 aptamer region, which subsequently initiates a catalytic molecule machine that relies on cascade toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction. Benefiting from high efficiency of the molecule machine, the method shows a linear range from 1 × 10⁵ to 5 × 10⁷ particles/mL and a detection limit of 1.72 × 10⁴ particles/mL toward target exosomes, better than most existing detection methods. Moreover, the method demonstrates a high specificity even in serum samples and suggests a potential use in clinic, which may provide sufficient information for disease diagnosis, especially early detection and prognosis monitoring of tumors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiomarkers 3abiopsy 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3adetection limit 3aearly diagnosis 3aelectrochemistry 3aexosomes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aneoplasms 3aoligonucleotides 3aprognosis 0aCascaded toehold-mediated strand displacement reaction 0aCatalytic molecule machine 0aExosome detection 0aCD63 0aClick chemistry1 aLi, Lingling1 aHan, Bing1 aWang, Ying1 aDai, Yuhao1 aZhao, Jing0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2019 Sept. 15, v. 141 p.111397-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11631x0956-56637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2019.1113973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001200149245012600161500002200287520139400309592002801703650001101731650001901742650002201761650001101783650002401794650001701818651001001835653002401845653003601869653001901905653002801924700002101952700001401973700001501987773005802002856008302060852000902143655001202152IND60581099620221121025215.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058109962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zhi10aDoes government transparency contribute to improved eco-efficiency performance? An empirical study of 262 cities in China  aPre-press version  aConsidering the properties of environment from the perspective of a public good, this paper aims to examine the relationship between government transparency and eco-efficiency performance (EEP). By applying a conditional slack-based measure (SBM) model, local linear regression (LLR) and a nonparametric significance test, we conduct an empirical analysis based on 262 cities in China during the period of 2005–2012. The results demonstrated that: (1) the overall eco-efficiency of China was low due to the fact that the EEP scores of most of the cities were below 0.5; (2) the eco-efficiency performances of a majority of the municipalities & sub-provincial (M&S) cities were better than those of the prefecture-level cities, and the former showed greater improvements than the latter on eco-efficiency performances, although the M&S cities experienced faster paces of urbanization and consumed more resources; (3) there exists a nonlinear relationship between government transparency and eco-efficiency performance. In other words, if the government information was more transparent, it would be more beneficial to the improvement of eco-efficiency, and the phenomena were more significant in M&S cities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. Policy implications are thus drawn in this paper for promoting eco-efficiency improvement in China's M&S cities and prefecture-level cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aeco-efficiency 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aSlack-based measure 0aConditional efficiency analysis 0aEco-efficiency 0aGovernment transparency1 aOuyang, Xiaoling1 aDu, Kerui1 aZhao, Yang0 tEnergy Policy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03769naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002700191245006000218300001600278500001500294506007600309520178900385592002802174506003702202650002202239650002402261650001902285650003002304650004302334650002002377650002902397650002302426650002502449650001102474650000802485650001702493650001102510650001202521650002402533650001402557650001302571650002102584650001702605653002402622653001602646653003902662653002502701653002502726653002102751700002702772700001402799700002102813700002302834700002602857700002002883773012202903856008503025852000903110655001203119IND60598539220221207114705.0190403e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059853922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.12.0162doi7 aPMC62925152pmcid7 a294080232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDehghanpir, Shannon D.10aBroad anti-herpesviral activity of α-hydroxytropolones  ap. 125-131.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHerpesviruses are ubiquitous in animals and cause economic losses concomitant with many diseases. Most of the domestic animal herpesviruses are within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, which includes human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Suppression of HSV-1 replication has been reported with α-hydroxytropolones (αHTs), aromatic ring compounds that have broad bioactivity due to potent chelating activity. It is postulated that αHTs inhibit enzymes within the nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (NTS). These enzymes require divalent cations for nucleic acid cleavage activity. Potential targets include the nuclease component of the herpesvirus terminase (pUL15C), a highly conserved NTS-like enzyme that cleaves viral DNA into genomic lengths prior to packaging into capsids. Inhibition of pUL15C activity in biochemical assays by various αHTs previously revealed a spectrum of potencies. Interestingly, the most potent anti-pUL15C αHT inhibited HSV-1 replication to a limited extent in cell culture. The aim of this study was to evaluate three different αHT molecules with varying biochemical anti-pUL15C activity for a capacity to inhibit replication of veterinary herpesviruses (BoHV-1, EHV-1, and FHV-1) and HSV-1. Given the known discordant potencies between anti-pUL15C and HSV-1 replication inhibition, a second objective was to elucidate the mechanism of action of these compounds. The results show that αHTs broadly inhibit herpesviruses, with similar inhibitory effect against HSV-1, BoHV-1, EHV-1, and FHV-1. Based on immunoblotting, Southern blotting, and real-time qPCR, the compounds were found to specifically inhibit viral DNA replication. Thus, αHTs represent a new class of broadly active anti-herpesviral compounds with potential veterinary applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSouthern blotting 3amechanism of action 3aimmunoblotting 3aBovine alphaherpesvirus 1 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aDNA replication 3aHuman alphaherpesvirus 1 3aaromatic compounds 3abioactive properties 3acapsid 3aDNA 3acell culture 3ahumans 3acations 3afinancial economics 3apackaging 3agenomics 3adomestic animals 3atransferases 0aHuman herpesvirus 1 0aHerpesvirus 0aNucleotidyltransferase superfamily 0aα-hydroxytropolones 0aBovine herpesvirus 1 0aAnti-herpesvirus1 aBirkenheuer, Claire H.1 aYang, Kui1 aMurelli, Ryan P.1 aMorrison, Lynda A.1 aLe Grice, Stuart F.J.1 aBaines, Joel D.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2018 Feb., v. 214 p.125-131dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8205x0378-11357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2017.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009400154300001800248520135800266592002801624650002201652650002201674650002101696650001901717650001501736650001401751650001001765650001601775650001501791650001801806650001901824650001601843650001201859650001401871650001801885650001901903650001701922650002401939700001701963700001701980700001401997700001702011700001702028700001602045773014102061856007402202852000902276655001202285IND60670665220221119234136.0191002e20131106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067066522DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb20715c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qi10aEngineering magnetic-molecular sequential targeting nanoparticles for anti-cancer therapy  ap. 6402-6410.  aNanoparticle drug delivery to tumors via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect is usually limited by the step of blood circulation and extravasation. Only less than 10% of the administered dose would eventually reach the tumor tissue. To enhance the drug delivery efficiency, we report the approach of magnetic plus molecular dual targeting nanoparticles to combine tumor targeting, drug delivery, and in situ imaging together. The surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) was coated with biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol)–poly(lactic acid) and then anchored with folic acid (FA). Despite the presence of FA, the hydrodynamic size of SPIONs was less than 100 nm. Increasing the surface FA density sacrificed the aqueous stability of SPIONs, but 20% FA did not induce noticeable particle aggregation. The existence of 20% FA maintained the superparamagnetic property of SPIONs with a saturation magnetization level at ca. 30 emu g⁻¹. The drug release profile was not significantly different between SPIONs with (20%) and without FA. However, the presence of FA dramatically increased the intracellular uptake of SPIONs when using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. These results highlighted the role of surface ligand optimization in the design of desired magnetic-molecular dual tumor-targeting nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministered dose 3ablood circulation 3abreast neoplasms 3acancer therapy 3acell lines 3achemistry 3adrugs 3aengineering 3afolic acid 3ahydrodynamics 3aimage analysis 3airon oxides 3aligands 3amagnetism 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apermeability 3apolyethylene glycol1 aZhu, Jundong1 aSong, Lichao1 aZhang, Ju1 aKong, Deling1 aZhao, Yanjun1 aWang, Zheng0 tJournal of materials chemistry B.g2013 Nov. 6, v. 1, no. 46 p.6402-6410dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3tb20715c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02446naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001300145245010400158300001800262520127200280592002801552650002401580650001301604650002001617650001901637650002901656650001301685650001401698650003701712650001601749650001601765700001601781700001601797700001701813700001501830773012501845856008101970852000902051655001202060IND60571083720221119122710.0170710e20170620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057108372DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.6b054772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Li10aCompatibility of Surfactants and Thermally Activated Persulfate for Enhanced Subsurface Remediation  ap. 7055-7064.  aLimited aqueous availability of hydrophobic organic contaminants and nonaqueous phase liquids in subsurface environment may seriously impair the effectiveness of traditional in situ chemical oxidation (ISCO). To tackle the issue, a combination of surfactants and thermally activated persulfate was proposed to enhance the aqueous availability and consequent oxidation of organic contaminants. The compatibility of eight representative nonionic, monovalent anionic, and divalent anionic surfactants with persulfate at various temperatures was first studied, to identify suitable surfactants that have high aqueous stability and low oxidant demands to couple with thermally activated persulfate. C₁₂-MADS (sodium dodecyl diphenyl ether disulfonate, a representative divalent anionic surfactant) stands out as the most compatible surfactant. Batch treatability study with coal tar, an example of challenging scenarios for traditional ISCO, was then conducted. The results show that C₁₂-MADS can significantly enhance not only the oxidation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons contained in coal tar but also oxidant utilization efficiency, indicating the potential of the proposed coupling process for the treatment of organic contaminants with low aqueous availability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3acoal tar 3adiphenyl ethers 3ahydrophobicity 3anonaqueous phase liquids 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aremediation 3atemperature1 aPeng, Libin1 aXie, Liling1 aDeng, Peiyan1 aDeng, Dayi0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 June 20, v. 51, no. 12 p.7055-7064dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b054773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02328naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006300171500002200234520115500256592002801411650001901439650002501458650001101483650001301494650002201507650001901529650001201548650000901560650001601569651002501585653000801610653000801618653000801626653002201634653002801656653002001684700002101704700001901725773005801744856008301802852000901885655001201894IND60581099820221121025224.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058109982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBastianin, Andrea10aOil supply shocks and economic growth in the Mediterranean  aPre-press version  aWe study how oil supply shocks affect the output growth of selected countries in the Mediterranean region. We focus on the effects of oil supply shocks on economic activity, as measured by real gross value added, for the whole economy, as well as for specific industries. We show that the response of real gross value added growth is negative and often statistically significant for net energy importers, while for net energy exporters it is not distinguishable from zero. This result holds for the aggregate economies, as well as for the selected industries. Moreover, the effects of oil supply shocks increase with the degree of energy dependence in the Mediterranean countries belonging to the European Union. Our results have several policy implications. First, the European Union should encourage projects on the efficient use of energy in the Mediterranean area. Second, European financial markets should promote appropriate financial instruments to stimulate investments in the Mediterranean energy sector. Third, international investors should consider the country-specific reactions to major macroeconomic shocks in the Mediterranean region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aeconomic development 3aenergy 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3amacroeconomics 3amarkets 3aoils 3avalue added 3aMediterranean region 0aC22 0aE32 0aQ43 0aOil supply shocks 0aMediterranean countries 0aEconomic growth1 aGaleotti, Marzio1 aManera, Matteo0 tEnergy Policy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245014400174500001900318520156500337592002801902650001101930650001801941650001601959650001401975650001301989650000902002650001102011650001502022651001302037653002502050653001502075653002302090700001802113700001702131700001602148700001502164700001902179700002102198700003902219700002202258700002202280773011302302856008702415852000902502655001202511IND60728987120221117221105.0210415e20210601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072898712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1076582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWasson, Robert J.10aEpisodically volatile high energy non-cohesive river-floodplain systems: New information from the Ping River, Thailand, and a global review  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aVolatile rivers that involve floodplain stripping and subsequent floodplain reconstruction by vertical accretion are poorly known worldwide. This paper aims to partially fill this knowledge gap by a review of existing information and the provision of the currently most detailed account of such a river, namely the Ping River of northern Thailand. Recognition of this river type depends upon stratigraphic and morphostratigraphic analysis and so does not come within the ambit of those who focus only on river form and modern flood hydrology, and also not within the ambit of ‘traditional’ palaeoflood hydrology. A morphostratigraphic analysis of the Ping River adds to the small but valuable corpus of existing studies and provides an indication of the level of detail that is required for an in-depth understanding. A global review shows that extreme rainfall is always involved in floodplain stripping, although the sensitivity to rainfall extremes of catchments is not understood, including the contributions of land use, topography and alluvial resistance to erosion. The Ping River has the same characteristics as other volatile rivers, with an average interarrival time for stripping events of about three centuries probably caused by different combinations of wet periods, tropical lows, typhoons, and atmospheric rivers. As the intensity of extreme rainfall increases as Earth warms, the frequency of floodplain stripping events may increase with implications for both the pace of change in some fluvial landscapes and flood mitigation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aflood control 3afloodplains 3ahydrology 3aland use 3arain 3arivers 3atopography 3aThailand 0aFloodplain stripping 0aPing River 0aMorphostratigraphy1 aZiegler, Alan1 aLim, Han She1 aTeo, Elisha1 aLam, Daryl1 aHiggitt, David1 aRittenour, Tammy1 aRamdzan, Khairun Nisha Bte Mohamed1 aJoon, Chuah Chong1 aSinghvi, Ashok K.0 tGeomorphology.g2021 June 01, v. 382 p.107658-dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.1076583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245016000161300001800321500001900339520127900358592002801637596005901665650001501724650002701739650002501766650002301791650001401814650001601828650001001844650001601854650001301870650001101883650002101894650000701915650002601922650002401948650000901972650001101981700001501992700001502007700001302022700001302035700001702048773014702065856008302212852000902295655001202304IND60729754620221117201211.0210304e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072975462DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-020-03136-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Sha12aA pH-responsive bioassay for sensitive colorimetric detection of adenosine triphosphate based on switchable DNA aptamer and metal ion–urease interactions  ap. 1533-1540.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA facile and economic colorimetric strategy was designed for ATP detection by rationally using urease, a pH-responsive molecule, and a metal-mediated switchable DNA probe. By utilizing metal ions as a modulator of urease activity, the concentration of ATP is translated into pH change, which can be readily visualized by naked eye. An unmodified single-stranded DNA probe was designed, which consists of a target binding sequence and two flanked cytosine (C)-rich sequences. This C-rich single-stranded DNA can form a hairpin structure triggered by Ag⁺ ions via C-Ag⁺-C base mismatch. Upon introduction of ATP, Ag⁺-coordinated hairpin DNA structure will be broken and release the included Ag⁺, thus inhibiting the activity of urease. Conversely, urease can hydrolyze urea and raise pH value of the solution, resulting in the color change of the sensing solution. The proposed assay allows determination of ATP as low as 1.6 nM and shows a satisfactory result in human serum. Because of simple operation and low cost of this method, we believe it has a potential in point-of-care (POC) testing in resource-limited areas.

It was found that coating SBA-15-Pr-SO₃H with the hydrophobic and acidic ionic liquid [OMIm]HSO₄ at a loading of 0.8 mL g⁻¹ of silica, afforded paths for faster mass transfer of the starting materials into the active sites. At the same time it might also increase the Brønsted acid strength as a result of an acid site cooperativity mechanism.

Several scholars have begun advocating the socio-technical approach to energy by noting that the mainstream conceptualization of energy challenges in strictly technological or economic terms does not capture the complexity and inertia inherent to energy systems. Moreover, the article also seeks to examine how well have recent interventions integrated pro-poor and low-carbon concerns, two of the major tenets of UN's Sustainable Development Goal 7. Findings suggest that initiatives studied take only partial consideration of key aspects of a socio-technical approach to the energy problem. Nonetheless, the initiatives have taken on board pro-poor and low-carbon concerns to a certain extent. Two main policy implications are drawn from this study: a continued focus on status quo approaches has the potential to generate investment inefficiencies; and an effective low-carbon transition will require a broader discussions about the types of lifestyles people in sub-Saharan Africa aspire to.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited Nations 3aenergy 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3asustainable development 3aSub-Saharan Africa 0aEnergy transitions 0aSub-Saharan Africa 0aElectricity access 0aRenewable energy 0aSocio-technical approach1 aPlananska, Jana0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 Nov., v. 110 p.1-8dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245008600167500001900253520147600272592002801748650001001776650002201786650000901808650001401817650001101831650001201842650002401854650001201878653001001890653002101900653001001921700002401931773012001955856008302075852000902158655001202167IND60713922520221119161558.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071392252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKline, Kyle E.10aEvaluation of a Commercial Activity Monitor for Determining Step Counts in Horses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMonitoring activity level has become popular in people and animals. In the horse, these monitors may be helpful for the detection of disease, monitor limb loading after surgery, and assist in rehabilitation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a commercial activity monitor (AM) (FitBit Zip) in horses. In Part 1, four stalled horses had five AMs placed (head, chest, withers, and left forelimb and hindlimbs) with stride length setting of 60.96 cm and were monitored for 24 hours with AM and video. In Part 2, four stalled horses had two AMs placed (left forelimb and hindlimbs) with stride length setting of 30.48 cm and were monitored for 24 hours with AM and video. In Part 3, three horses with two AMs (left forelimb and hindlimbs) had step data collected at the walk and trot in hand by AM and video. AM and video data were compared using Pearson’s correlation coefficients and by calculating AM to video step count ratios. In Part 1, there was considerable movement of AMs at the chest and withers, but head and limb mounted AMs were more secure. In Part 2, video and AM activity counts were moderate to high for forelimb and hindlimbs with R² values of 0.82 and 0.74, respectively. From Part 3, AMs mounted on either forelimb or hindlimbs approximately doubled the step counts compared to the video. While this AM did not accurately count steps, it may be able to provide general information on activity level in the stalled horses.  aPublisher supplied data 3achest 3adisease detection 3ahead 3ahindlimbs 3ahorses 3asurgery 3aveterinary medicine 3awithers 0aHorse 0aActivity monitor 0aSteps1 aMoorman, Valerie J.0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Dec., v. 95 p.103272-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02077naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013600173300001400309520104600323592002801369650001301397650001401410650002401424650001501448700001801463700002101481700002101502700002301523773008701546856008601633990002301719852000901742655001201751IND60092036920221118033731.0141103e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009203692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Roux, Nicolas10aReduced-scale study of transient flows inside mechanically ventilated buildings subjected to wind and internal overpressure effects  ap. 18-32.  aTo study transient mass transfers inside buildings equipped with ventilation systems, reduced-scale experiments have been performed by applying the scaling down methodology developed for studying isothermal airflows in a steady or a transient state [1].

The benefit of mobilising community level action in addressing climate change action has already been seen in many European countries. While Irish governmental policy envisions as necessary greater community involvement in energy projects and other efforts to reduce carbon emissions, little progress has been encouraging or supporting such action. Using the Q-method, this study examined and identified where commonalities exist in Irish communities that have successfully implemented sustainable development goals, in terms of their motivation, attitudes, perceived barriers and opportunities for continued action. Results indicate that participants’ main motivations are derived from a sense of responsibility to future generations and the need to live more balanced lifestyles. Results further suggest that short-term central government strategy, poor support, bureaucracy, and a lack of collaboration are seen as key limitations in developing and achieving effective community level sustainability action. This study contributes in understanding how climate change policy can be aligned to the preferred future vision of communities in bringing about effective change in transitioning to a low-carbon society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3acommunity service 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3amotivation 3asustainable development 3aIreland 0aClimate policy 0aCommunity action 0aQ-method 0aBarriers to action 0aSustainable development1 aByrne, Susan1 aRyan, Raymondq(Raymond Stanley),1 aO’Regan, Bernadette0 tEnergy Policy.g2017 Nov., v. 110 p.40-50dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03388naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245016500153300001600318500002000334520195000354592002802304650001802332650001902350650001902369650002102388650001402409650002002423650001802443650001002461650001102471650001902482650001502501650002102516650001902537650001902556650001902575650001302594650002902607700002202636700001902658700002802677700002402705773009502729856007302824852000902897655001202906IND60572193120221122065653.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057219312DNAL7 a10.1111/tpj.134882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ru10aImpact of light intensity and quality on chromatophore and nuclear gene expression in Paulinella chromatophora, an amoeba with nascent photosynthetic organelles  ap. 221-234.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPlastid evolution has been attributed to a single primary endosymbiotic event that occurred about 1.6 billion years ago (BYA) in which a cyanobacterium was engulfed and retained by a eukaryotic cell, although early steps in plastid integration are poorly understood. The photosynthetic amoeba Paulinella chromatophora represents a unique model for the study of plastid evolution because it contains cyanobacterium‐derived photosynthetic organelles termed ‘chromatophores’ that originated relatively recently (0.09–0.14 BYA). The chromatophore genome is about a third the size of the genome of closely related cyanobacteria, but 10‐fold larger than most plastid genomes. Several genes have been transferred from the chromatophore genome to the host nuclear genome through endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT). Some EGT‐derived proteins could be imported into chromatophores for function. Two photosynthesis‐related genes (psaI and csos4A) are encoded by both the nuclear and chromatophore genomes, suggesting that EGT in Paulinella chromatophora is ongoing. Many EGT‐derived genes encode proteins that function in photosynthesis and photoprotection, including an expanded family of high‐light‐inducible (ncHLI) proteins. Cyanobacterial hli genes are high‐light induced and required for cell viability under excess light. We examined the impact of light on Paulinella chromatophora and found that this organism is light sensitive and lacks light‐induced transcriptional regulation of chromatophore genes and most EGT‐derived nuclear genes. However, several ncHLI genes have reestablished light‐dependent regulation, which appears analogous to what is observed in cyanobacteria. We postulate that expansion of the ncHLI gene family and its regulation may reflect the light/oxidative stress experienced by Paulinella chromatophora as a consequence of the as yet incomplete integration of host and chromatophore metabolisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyanobacteria 3acell viability 3achromatophores 3aeukaryotic cells 3aevolution 3agene expression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3amodels 3anuclear genome 3aorganelles 3aoxidative stress 3aphotostability 3aphotosynthesis 3aplastid genome 3aproteins 3atranscription (genetics)1 aNowack, Eva C.

It is used in gastrointestinal disorders, as detoxifying the organism, antifebrile properties and amidaglitis.To identify the chemical constituents of the hydroethanolic extract obtained from the aerial parts of V. litoralis and to evaluate the acute and sub-acute toxicity in male and female rats.The single dose (2000 mg/kg) of the extract was administered orally to male and female rats. In the subacute study the extract was given at doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg during 28 days orally. Biochemical, hematological and histological analyzes were performed, oxidative stress markers were tested and chemical constituents were identified through UHPLC-ESI-HRMSSix classes of metabolites were identified: iridoids glycosides, flavonoids, phenylpropanoids-derived, phenylethanoid-derived, cinnamic acid-derived and triterpenes. In the acute treatment, the extract was classified as safe (category 5), according to the OECD guide. Our results demonstrated that subacute administration of the crude extract of V. litoralis at 400 mg/kg resulted in an increase in AST in males, whereas ALT enzyme showed a small increase in males that received 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg of the extract.The extract of the aerial parts of Verbena litoralis did not present significant toxicity when administered a single dose. However, when different doses were administered for 28 days, were observed changes in hematological, biochemical and histological parameters in rats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVerbena 3aaerial parts 3aalanine transaminase 3aaspartate transaminase 3achemical composition 3adigestive system diseases 3afemales 3aflavonoids 3aglycosides 3ahistology 3aindigenous species 3airidoids 3amales 3ametabolites 3aoxidative stress 3arats 3asubacute toxicity 3atraditional medicine 3atriterpenoids 3aSouth America 0a9-Hydroxysemperoside (PubChem CID: 101098710) 0a10-Hydroxycornin (PubChem: 101637374) 0aTheviridoside (PubChem CID: 179396) 0aHastatoside (PubChem: 92043450) 0aVerbenalin (PubChem CID: 73467) 0aIsoverbascoside (PubChem CID: 13889686) 0aVerbascoside (PubChem CID: 15736674) 0aLuteolin 7-glucoside (PubChem CID: 5280637) 0aGriselinoside (PubChem CID: 91895355) 0aPedalin (PubChem CID: 73981696) 0aIristectorin A (PubChem CID: 11968629) 0aAcetylacteoside (PubChem CID: 21629996) 0aLuteolin (PubChem CID: 5280445 0aScutellarein (PubChem CID: 185617) 0aNodifloretin (PubChem CID: 5320181) 0aApigenin (PubChem CID: 5280443) 0aNuchensin (PubChem CID: 373260) 0aDemethoxycentaureidin (PubChem CID: 5469524) 0aJaceosidin (PubChem CID: 5379096) 0aTormentic acid (PubChem CID: 73193) 0aAsiatic acid (PubChem CID: 119034) 0aVerbena litoralis, Gervãozinho-do-campo, Acute toxicity, Subacute toxicity, UHPLC-ESI-HRMS1 aGuex, Camille Gaube1 ada Silva, Andreia Regina Haas1 aLhamas, Cibele Lima1 ados Santos Moreira, Karen Luise1 aCasoti, Rosana1 aDornelles, Rafaela Castro1 ada Rocha, Maria Izabel Ugalde Marques1 ada Veiga, Marcelo Leite1 ade Freitas Bauermann, Liliane1 aManfron, Melânia Palermo0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 224 p.76-84dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02160naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245011900160300001800279520089300297592002801190650001801218650001101236650002301247650001201270650001501282650001001297650001601307650001101323650001901334650001301353650001601366651001001382653001301392653001501405653001801420700001701438700001501455700001701470773015301487856007701640852000901717655001201726IND60679829920221121082000.0200102e20191231xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067982992DNAL7 a10.11158/saa.24.12.152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Zhuhui10aDescription of four new species of the genus Neumania Lebert, 1879 (Acari, Hydrachnidia, Unionicolidae) from China  ap. 2503-2526.  aFour new species of the water mite genus Neumania Lebert are described from the Hanma National Nature Reserve, Genhe City, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China.

The assay is based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of nucleic acid biomarkers and shows for the first time the ability to rapidly quantify human-specific mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from raw untreated wastewater samples. mtDNA provides a model population biomarker associated with carcinogenesis including breast, renal and gastric cancers. To enable a sample-to-answer, field-based technology, we integrated a filter to remove solid impurities and perform DNA extraction and enrichment into a low cost lateral flow-based test. We demonstrated mtDNA detection over seven consecutive days, achieving a limit of detection of 40 copies of human genomic DNA per reaction volume. The assay can be performed at the site of sample collection, with minimal user intervention, yielding results within 45 min and providing a method to monitor public health from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3adetection limit 3aepidemiology 3ahumans 3aloop-mediated isothermal amplification 3amitochondrial DNA 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3awastewater1 aXu, Gaolian1 aReboud, Julien1 aKasprzyk-Hordern, Barbara1 aCooper, Jonathan M.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2017 Sept. 19, v. 89, no. 18 p.9941-9945dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.7b022573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002000135245006000155300001500215520175800230592002801988650001202016650003102028650001902059650002702078650001002105650002202115650001902137650001902156650001402175650001302189650004302202650005202245650001802297650001802315650001802333650001702351700001902368700002902387700001902416700002202435700001802457700002302475700002002498700002202518773015202540856006902692856009002761990002302851852000902874655001202883IND60691444620221121105428.0200430e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069144462DNAL7 a10.3791/604602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabiiti, Wilber12aA tuberculosis molecular bacterial load assay (tb-mbla)  ap. e60460.  aTuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a pathogen classified by the United Nations (UN) as a dangerous category B biological substance. For the sake of the workers’ safety, handling of all samples presumed to carry Mtb must be conducted in a containment level (CL) 3 laboratory. The TB molecular bacterial load assay (TB-MBLA) test is a reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) test that quantifies Mtb bacillary load using primers and dual-labelled probes for 16S rRNA. We describe the use of heat inactivation to render TB samples noninfectious while preserving RNA for the TB-MBLA. A 1 mL aliquot of the sputum sample in tightly closed 15 mL centrifuge tubes is boiled for 20 min at either 80 °C, 85 °C, or 95 °C to inactivate Mtb bacilli. Cultivation of the heat inactivated and control (live) samples for 42 days confirmed the death of TB. The inactivated sample is then spiked with 100 µL of the extraction control and RNA is extracted following the standard RNA isolation procedure. No growth was observed in the cultures of heat treated samples. The isolated RNA is subjected to real-time RT-qPCR, which amplifies a specific target in the Mtb 16S rRNA gene, yielding results in the form of quantification cycles (Cq). A standard curve is used to translate Cq into bacterial load, or estimated colony forming units per mL (eCFU/mL). There is an inverse relationship between Cq and the bacterial load of a sample. The limitation is that heat inactivation lyses some cells, exposing the RNA to RNases that cause a loss of <1 log10eCFU/mL (i.e., <10 CFU/mL). Further studies will determine the proportion of very low burden patients that cause false negative results due to heat inactivation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacilli 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aUnited Nations 3afalse negative results 3agenes 3aheat inactivation 3aheat treatment 3amicrobial load 3apathogens 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribonucleases 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3atuberculosis1 aMtafya, Bariki1 aDe Lima, Daniela Alferes1 aDombay, Evelin1 aBaron, Vincent O.1 aAzam, Khalide1 aOravcova, Katarina1 aSloan, Derek J.1 aGillespie, S.

Here we report a stable consortium, HJ-4, composed of Anaerospora hongkongensis (85%) and facultative anaerobe, Comamonadaceae (15%), which can process ferrihydrite reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation driven by sulfur redox cycling. In this process, A. hongkongensis reduces elemental sulfur, sulfite, and polysulfides to sulfide, which fuels ferrihydrite reduction. Sulfide, elemental sulfur, sulfite, and polysulfides serve as electron shuttles, completing the sulfur cycle between A. hongkongensis and ferrihydrite. In addition, Comamonadaceae shows ammonium oxidation potential under aerobic conditions, with nitrite as the main product. We inferred that Comamonadaceae mediates simultaneous nitrification–denitrification coupled to iron redox cycling through nitrate/nitrite-dependent ferrous oxidation under anaerobic conditions. Hence, we discovered a novel pathway for ferric iron reduction coupled to ammonium oxidation, highlighting the key role of electron shuttles and nitrate/nitrite-dependent ferrous oxidation in this process. The biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, iron, and nitrogen could be coupled in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aComamonadaceae 3aaerobic conditions 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3aanaerobic conditions 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aferrihydrite 3airon 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3aoxidation 3asulfides 3asulfites 3asulfur 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aLi, Guo-Xiang0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2017 June 20, v. 51, no. 12 p.6691-6698dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.est.6b059713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01886naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010300166300001300269520079600282592002801078650001201106650001001118650001401128650001501142650001401157650001201171650002001183650001201203651001401215653002801229653001501257653001301272700002201285773011401307856008201421852000901503655001201512IND60516795020221121032949.0190727e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051679502DNAL7 a10.1017/S00242829140005652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBREUSS, Othmar10aThree new lichen species from Nicaragua, with keys to the known species of Eugeniella and Malmidea  ap. 9-20.  aEugeniella palleola, Graphis paraschiffneri, and Malmidea cineracea are described from Nicaragua.

The framework includes three main impact types: 1) chemical-specific impacts directly comparable to conventional life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) human health categories, 2) non-chemical health impacts, and 3) productivity/performance impacts. The first part of the framework related to contaminant specific impacts was explored using a green university building as a case study, while the remaining categories will be the subject of future work. Results showed that including IEQ aspects in whole-building LCA revealed LCIA internal impacts in some categories comparable to external impacts. For human health respiratory effects, building-specific indoor impacts from the case study were 12% of global external impacts in conventional LCA. Building-specific indoor cancer toxicity impacts were greater than external impacts by an order of magnitude, and building-specific indoor noncancer toxicity impacts were lower than external impacts by an order of magnitude. Although internal impacts were greater than external impacts in one category – cancer toxicity, the source of the contamination in the other two categories – respiratory effects and noncancer toxicity – was related to intake of outdoor air. The findings of this study underscore the importance of filtration or other treatment of mechanically supplied outdoor or recirculated indoor air, as well as control of pollution from indoor sources such as building materials or cleaning products. These findings may support the use of green building rating systems which include acknowledgment of the aforementioned IEQ-related features.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3abuildings 3acase studies 3acleaning agents 3aconstruction materials 3afiltration 3ahuman health 3aindoor environmental quality 3alife cycle impact assessment 3apollution control 3atoxicity1 aLandis, Amy E.1 aJones, Alex K.1 aSchaefer, Laura A.1 aBilec, Melissa M.0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Apr., v. 62 p.182-190dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.01.0153Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04450naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245010900210500001900319520276400338592002803102650002103130650001303151650002503164650001003189650001103199650001503210650001303225650001403238650001103252650001603263650002203279650001403301650001203315650001603327650001303343650001103356650002403367653002903391653002303420653001603443653001103459700002403470700002403494700002903518700002403547700002603571700002403597700002703621700002403648773012003672856008303792852000903875655001203884IND60713922820221119161955.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071392282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpagnolo, Julio D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0341-503910aNephrosplenic Space Ablation in Horses After Homologous Pericardium Implant Using a Laparoscopic Stapler  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to describe and evaluate a laparoscopic technique to promote nephrosplenic space ablation in horses using a homologous pericardium implant, preserved in 98% glycerin and fixed using laparoscopic polydioxanone staples. In this experimental study, six Arabian horses without previous related abdominal diseases were used. The surgical procedures were performed in the standing position under sedation with alpha-2 agonists and opioids, associated with local infiltration of the local anesthetic in the portal sites. The horses were restrained in a stock, and the left flanks were clipped and aseptically prepared. Three portals were created on the left flank, and the homologous pericardium implant, measuring 10 × 5 cm, was introduced into the abdominal cavity covering the nephrosplenic space, positioned between the dorsal border of the spleen and perirenal fascia, fixed with polydioxanone staples using a laparoscopic stapler. Physical examination and blood and peritoneal fluid sample collection were performed on days 0, 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 60 of the postoperative period, and an exploratory laparoscopy was performed on day 60 to assess the effectiveness of the technique and eventual complications. There were no difficulties or significant complications during the surgical procedure, and the total average time to perform was 49.83 minutes (±10.19). In the postoperative period, there was a significant increase (P < .05) in the plasma fibrinogen concentration on days 7 and 14 compared with the preoperative moment. The total nucleated cell count in the peritoneal fluid increased (P < .05) on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 30. After 60 days of the surgical procedure, the physical examination and laboratory data were within the normal range. Exploratory laparoscopy performed on day 60 revealed complete occlusion of the nephrosplenic space, and it was not possible to differentiate the pericardium implant from the scar tissue, not even in the histological evaluation performed on the collected samples. In two horses, omentum adhesion was observed in the region where the implant was fixed, and in two others, a synechia was observed between the implant area and mesocolon without association with clinical complications. The animals were followed up for 36 months at surgery, and no colic signs were observed along this period. It was concluded that the technique of ablation of the nephrosplenic space, using homologous pericardium preserved in 98% glycerin, fixed by polydioxanone staples by laparoscopy, was simple to perform, effective, and free of clinical complications during the period of evaluation, and its use may be indicated as a surgical option in clinical cases of horses with recurrent nephrosplenic entrapment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabdominal cavity 3aadhesion 3aclinical examination 3acolic 3afascia 3afibrinogen 3aglycerol 3ahistology 3ahorses 3alaparoscopy 3alocal anesthetics 3anarcotics 3aomentum 3apericardium 3asedation 3aspleen 3aveterinary medicine 0aNephrosplenic entrapment 0aBiological implant 0aEndostapler 0aEquine1 aCastro, Leonardo M.1 aCorrêa, Rodrigo R.1 aGarcia Filho, Sérgio G.1 aAmbrósio, Aline M.1 aBaccarin, Raquel Y.A.1 aHagen, Stefano C.F.1 ade Sá, Lilian Marques1 aSilva, Luis C.L.

However, in recent years this field has been developing to a much more advanced stage by carefully controlling the size, shape, and surface-modification of nanoparticles. This review provides an overview of two classes of nanoparticles, namely iron oxide and NaLnF₄, and synthesis methods, characterization techniques, study of biocompatibility, toxicity behavior, and applications of iron oxide nanoparticles and NaLnF₄ nanoparticles as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. Their optical properties will only briefly be mentioned. Iron oxide nanoparticles show a saturation of magnetization at low field, therefore, the focus will be MLnF₄ (Ln = Dy³⁺, Ho³⁺, and Gd³⁺) paramagnetic nanoparticles as alternative contrast agents which can sustain their magnetization at high field. The reason is that more potent contrast agents are needed at magnetic fields higher than 7 T, where most animal MRI is being done these days. Furthermore we observe that the extent of cytotoxicity is not fully understood at present, in part because it is dependent on the size, capping materials, dose of nanoparticles, and surface chemistry, and thus needs optimization of the multidimensional phenomenon. Therefore, it needs further careful investigation before being used in clinical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3abiocompatibility 3acytotoxicity 3adysprosium 3agadolinium 3aholmium 3airon oxides 3amagnetic fields 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3ananoparticles 3aoptical properties1 avan Veggel, Frank C.

This has encouraged the present study based on the design of experiments to optimize the two operating factors: the bio coagulant dosage and initial pH. The effect of these considered factors on turbidity and chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction performances was investigated to treat sewage wastewater from plants by the coagulation/flocculation process using the response surface methodology (RSM) based on a central composite faced design (CCFD). The effect of the pH on the supernatant turbidity removal and the COD reduction was very significant whereas that of the coagulant dosage was insignificant on the COD removal efficiency. Experimental results revealed that the maximum reduction of turbidity and COD could be reached at a coagulant dosage of 28 mg/l and a pH of 12. At these optimal conditions, the removal efficiency of turbidity and COD was 98.33% and 96.55% respectively. By the end of the treatment, final values of 0.84 NTU and 20.8 mg/l were obtained for turbidity and COD, respectively. A notable decrease of orthophosphate (O- PO₄⁻²), nitrite (N-NO₃⁻), ammonium (N-NH₄⁺) and suspended matter (SM) was observed. The study also showed that the quadratic regression model could be used as a theoretical basis for the process based on a high coefficient of determination R² value > 0.96, obtained from the analysis of variances (ANOVA).  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acacti and succulents 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3aflocculation 3ahuman health 3anitrites 3aorthophosphates 3apH 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3asewage 3asustainable development 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment1 aArris, Sihem1 aAbbaz, Amina1 aBencheikh-Lehocine, Mossaab1 aMeniai, Abdeslam Hassen0 tEnvironmental management.g2021 Mar., v. 67, no. 3 p.489-497dSpringer USwJournal:jnl8014x0364-152X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00267-020-01407-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02988naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006100148245015100209500001900360520148400379592002801863650001501891650002101906650001901927650001801946650002901964650001401993650001002007650001102017650006602028650002502094650001402119650002402133653003602157653001302193653001002206653001702216700005802233700002002291700001902311773012002330856008302450852000902533655001202542IND60713922920221119161910.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071392292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchida-Fujii, Eri1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4127-143510aMatrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization–Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) for Identification of Bacterial Isolates From Horses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is used for bacterial identification by analyzing the spectra of isolates and comparing them against a database of reference spectra; it is known for its rapidity and accuracy.

In this study, we used a commercial MALDI-TOF MS identification system to examine 3724 bacterial isolates from horses and their environments. Isolates that could not be identified with MALDI-TOF MS were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence taxonomic analysis. MALDI-TOF MS could identify 86.2% of the isolates from horses to the species level, showing that this method could be successfully applied for bacterial identification in horses. However, some species known to be equine pathogenic agents including Taylorella equigenitalis and Rhodococcus equi were difficult to identify with MALDI-TOF MS, which might be the result of an inadequate reference database. Some Prevotella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus isolates, which could not be identified with either MALDI-TOF MS or 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, formed clusters in the 16S rRNA phylogenic tree, and might be unknown species isolated from horses. Adding the spectra of isolates identified in this study to an in-house database might make MALDI-TOF MS a more useful tool for identifying equine isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrevotella 3aRhodococcus equi 3aStaphylococcus 3aStreptococcus 3aTaylorella equigenitalis 3adatabases 3agenes 3ahorses 3amatrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aveterinary medicine 0a16S rRNA gene sequence analysis 0aBacteria 0aHorse 0aMALDI-TOF MS1 aNiwa, Hidekazu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-84011 aKinoshita, Yuta1 aNukada, Toshio0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Dec., v. 95 p.103276-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02897naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245012100153300001500274520144800289592002801737650001801765650001601783650001201799650002601811650002001837650001001857650004201867650001201909650001101921650003001932650002601962650003001988650001502018650001502033700001902048700001702067700002002084773015202104856006902256856009402325990002302419852000902442655001202451IND60691444820221121065707.0200430e20200429xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069144482DNAL7 a10.3791/609602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Tian V.10aIdentification of enhancer-promoter contacts in embryoid bodies by quantitative chromosome conformation capture (4c)  ap. e60960.  aDuring mammalian development, cell fates are determined through the establishment of regulatory networks that define the specificity, timing, and spatial patterns of gene expression. Embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from pluripotent stem cells have been a popular model to study the differentiation of the main three germ layers and to define regulatory circuits during cell fate specification. Although it is well-known that tissue-specific enhancers play an important role in these networks by interacting with promoters, assigning them to their relevant target genes still remains challenging. To make this possible, quantitative approaches are needed to study enhancer-promoter contacts and their dynamics during development. Here, we adapted a 4C method to define enhancers and their contacts with cognate promoters in the EB differentiation model. The method uses frequently cutting restriction enzymes, sonication, and a nested-ligation-mediated PCR protocol compatible with commercial DNA library preparation kits. Subsequently, the 4C libraries are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and analyzed bioinformatically, allowing detection and quantification of all sequences that have contacts with a chosen promoter. The resulting sequencing data can also be used to gain information about the dynamics of enhancer-promoter contacts during differentiation. The technique described for the EB differentiation model is easy to implement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA libraries 3achromosomes 3acutting 3aembryonic germ layers 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amammals 3amodels 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative analysis 3arestriction endonucleases 3asonication 3astem cells1 aVidal, Enrique1 aGraf, Thomas1 aStik, Grégoire0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Apr. 29, , no. 158 p.e60960-e60960dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/609603Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/60960/identification-enhancer-promoter-contacts-embryoid-bodies  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245017400159300001800333520114400351592002801495650002301523650002401546650001701570650001401587650001901601650001501620650002101635650002001656650001701676650001601693650002001709700001601729700001701745700001801762700001601780700001701796773014201813856007401955852000902029655001202038IND60670666320221119234718.0191002e20130828xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067066632DNAL7 a10.1039/c3tb20743a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Zhi-Gang10aNovel 3D flowerlike hierarchical γ-Fe₂O₃@xNH₄F·yLuF₃ core–shell microspheres tailor-made by a phase transformation process for the capture of phosphopeptides  ap. 4845-4854.  aNovel three-dimensional (3D) flowerlike hierarchical γ-Fe₂O₃@xNH₄F·yLuF₃ core–shell architectures were synthesized by a simple phase transformation route under mild conditions. The evolution of the flowerlike structure assembled by thin xNH₄F·yLuF₃ nanosheets has been investigated in detail. We found that an appropriate amount of NH₄F and a suitable phase transformation reaction temperature are crucial for the formation of the flowerlike structure, while the calcination treatment is essential to maintain the well-defined core–shell structure. A possible formation mechanism was proposed for the phase transformation reaction and the self-assembly growth in situ. The novel composite material with large open pores, a specific surface area (26.2 m² g⁻¹), strong reversible magnetic response (Mₛ = 27.99 emu g⁻¹), and good structural stability has been primarily applied for the selective and effective capture of phosphopeptides and it showed good performance.

In particular, the problem of efficient temperature control, is formulated as a model predictive control scheme employing a parameter matching technique. A key contribution of the paper is the development of an on-line modelling method, which, in contrast to previously reported techniques, requires no prerequisite knowledge of the thermodynamic behaviour of a given controlled zone and a training period of only 48 h. Moreover, it is shown that excellent performance is obtained without the normal requirements for measurements of site weather or input from other external sources of weather data, thereby reducing system cost and complexity. The proposed techniques are applied in a controlled zone using a BS EN 442 oil filled heat emitter, whose input power is closely controlled using a PWM power converter within an instrumented test cell, and also in an occupied dwelling. Results demonstrated MPC can be implemented in a dwelling with minimal perquisite modelling and still achieve set point tracking when compared to more conventional solutions resulting in an energy saving of up to 22%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acontrol methods 3aenergy conservation 3aheat 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amonitoring 3aoils 3atemperature1 aFoster, Martin1 aBingham, Chris0 tBuilding and environment.g2013 Apr., v. 62 p.33-44dElsevier Ltdx0360-13237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.01.0043Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245009600177520198000273592002802253650001602281650002002297650001402317650001302331650000902344650001302353650001602366651002802382651001102410651001002421651002502431651001002456653002302466653001802489653001102507653001902518653001802537700002502555700002602580700002602606773010502632856008702737852000902824655001202833IND60728988320221117221010.0211114e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072898832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1055212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInsua-Costa, Damián10aClimatology and ranking of hazardous precipitation events in the western Mediterranean area  aThe western Mediterranean region often suffers from the devastating effects of flooding, caused by enormous rain accumulations that sometimes resemble the values produced by tropical systems. Despite the climatic and social relevancy of this type of episodes, there are some fundamental questions that would still be difficult to answer today, for example: where within the region are more cases recorded? or, which were the most potentially dangerous episodes? In this study, we identify, and then gather and unify information from, all the daily events occurred from 1980 to 2015. Using the MESCAN high-resolution gridded rainfall dataset, events are detected and for each case, the date and affected regions are recorded. Subsequently, events are ranked according to their magnitude and classified by weather type. In addition, flood data from the FLOODHYMEX and EM-DAT databases are used to check whether the precipitation episodes resulted in flooding. All this information is collected into a publicly available single database. Results show that the highest number of events per year is recorded in the Languedoc-Roussillon region (France) and in the Valencian Community (Spain). The cases of greatest magnitude, which are associated with a larger number of floods, present a very marked seasonality, with about 80% of them occurring in September, October and November. Finally, we show that only four weather types are present in most of the days with hazardous rainfall in the western Mediterranean. The most hazardous situation is characterized by a low-pressure area at all tropospheric levels in the eastern Atlantic, forming a block pattern with an anticyclonic ridge that tends to extend from the Central Mediterranean to Central Europe. About 40% of the most extraordinary cases are associated with this configuration. As an example, the infamous Piedmont (Italy) 1994 episode, in the top 10 of the ranking, was produced by an atmospheric pattern of this type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3adatabases 3apiedmont 3arain 3aresearch 3atroposphere 3aCentral European region 3aFrance 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region 3aSpain 0aHazardous rainfall 0aMediterranean 0aFloods 0aEvents ranking 0aWeather types1 aLemus-Cánovas, Marc1 aMiguez-Macho, Gonzalo1 aLlasat, María Carmen0 tAtmospheric research.g2021 June 15, v. 255 p.105521-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11823x0169-80957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.1055213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245012100170500002200291520119200313592002801505650002401533650002901557650001101586650001901597650001601616650001801632650002901650650002101679650002501700650001101725651001201736653001101748653002601759653002901785653002501814653001101839700002001850773005801870856008301928852000902011655001202020IND60581100720221119205152.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058110072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOehmichen, Katja10aFostering renewable energy provision from manure in Germany – where to implement GHG emission reduction incentives  aPre-press version  aLivestock production makes up a major share of agriculture sector and the manure it produces significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. One option to lower these emissions significantly is using the manure to produce biogas which is used to generate power. Our model calculations show, that per kWh power from manure-based biogas –about 1.448kg of CO2 eq. of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission can be avoided due to the improved manure management and the substitution of electricity from the grid under actual German conditions. This form of utilization is supported under the German Renewable Energy Act; however, only the minor share of the manure is processed so far. Thus the question arises as to whether instruments in agricultural policy or instruments in energy policy are better to unlock this remaining potential. The elaborated allocation shows, that both sectors cause a comparable amount of GHG emissions reductions, at around 50% each. However, based on expected developments, the relevance of agriculture-related emissions is slated to increase. This leads to the conclusion that implementing instruments in both agricultural and energy policies would make sense.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural policy 3aanimal manure management 3abiogas 3acarbon dioxide 3aelectricity 3aenergy policy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3alivestock production 3amodels 3aGermany 0aBiogas 0aLife cycle assessment 0aGreenhouse gas emissions 0aMitigation potential 0aManure1 aThrän, Daniela0 tEnergy Policy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245008300167300001400250520145600264592002801720650001801748650003101766650002901797650002101826650003301847650002001880650002601900650002501926650002101951650001401972650001701986650002002003650002902023650001602052650001202068650003702080650001602117653003202133653001602165653001402181653001202195700001702207700001202224700001502236773011102251856008802362852000902450655001202459IND60566029220221119194533.0181010e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056602922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Hong10aBiosynthesis of the fatty acid isopropyl esters by engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 49-52.  aThe fatty acid methyl esters and fatty acid ethyl esters are known as biodiesels which are considered to be renewable, nontoxic and biodegradable biofuels. However, the conventional biodiesels show a high crystallization temperature which is one of the most critical obstacles against the widespread biodiesel usage. The high crystallization temperature of biodiesel can be reduced by replacing the methyl or ethyl ester with an isopropyl moiety. Here we report on a strategy to establish biosynthesis of the fatty acid isopropyl esters(FAIPEs) from the simple substrate glucose in Escherichia coli with heterologous coexpression of atoB encoded acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and atoAD encode acetoacetyl-CoA transferase from E. coli, ADC encode acetoacetate decarboxylase from Clostridium acetobutylicum, ADH encoded NADP-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Clostridium beijerinckii, ‘TesA encoded a truncated fatty acyl-ACP thioesterase and FadD encoded fatty acyl-CoA synthetase from E. coli, and the WS/DGAT encoded acyltransferase from Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1. It was found that the yield of FAIPEs was up to 203.4mg/L and accounted for around 6.4% (wt/wt) of the dry cell weight. Our results indicates that it is a feasible strategy to improve the yield of FAIPEs by increasing fatty acyl-CoA availability in biosynthetic pathway and exhibit a promising method for production of biodiesels with good low‐temperature flow properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aClostridium acetobutylicum 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aEscherichia coli 3aacetyl-CoA acetyltransferase 3aacyl coenzyme A 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiochemical pathways 3abiodegradability 3abiodiesel 3abiosynthesis 3acrystallization 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3along-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase 3atemperature 0aFatty acid isopropyl esters 0aIsopropanol 0aBiodiesel 0aWS/DGAT1 aZhang, Lihua1 aLi, Xun1 aGuo, Daoyi0 tEnzyme and microbial technology.g2017 July, v. 102 p.49-52dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12419x0141-02297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enzmictec.2017.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04061naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245013000168500001900298520285500317592002803172650001303200650000903213650001103222650000903233650000903242650002403251650001003275650002403285653002703309653002303336653001903359653001903378653001303397700001903410700002203429773012003451856008303571852000903654655001203663IND60713923220221119161917.0201209e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071392322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBornmann, Tanja10aComparison of the Head and Neck Positions in Ridden Horses Advertised in an Australian Horse Sales Magazine: 2005 Versus 2018  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe impact of head and neck position (HNP) on horse welfare has received much attention in the scientific literature within the last two decades. Studies have identified physiological and behavioral signs of distress in horses ridden for prolonged time in an HNP with their noseline behind the vertical (BTV), which may compromise their welfare. The objective of this study was to compare potential differences of HNPs shown in horse sales photographs advertised in an Australian horse sales magazine (Horse Deals) from the years 2005 and 2018. In addition, factors potentially impacting HNPs, such as type of tack presented in (e.g., noseband type), riding discipline, and competition experience of the horse, were investigated. The sample population (n = 570) comprised horses ridden with headgear and bit in walk, trot, or canter/gallop, advertised in an Australian horse sales magazine. Issues from April 2005 and October/November 2018 were selected. Head and neck position was categorized as BTV, on the vertical (OV), slightly in front of the vertical (IFV), or extremely in front of the vertical (EIFV; any HNP >30° IFV). Data were analyzed using the chi-squared test and post hoc testing via a multiple regression approach through SPSS and test of proportions via the Z-score calculator for two independent population proportions. Analysis of combined data from years 2005 and 2018 showed 47.0% (n = 570) of the horse sample population were advertised with HNPs BTV. Behind-the-vertical HNP was observed as the predominant HNP (57.8%; n = 268) in the warmblood/eventers/show/performance (WESP) category (P < .0005). In 2005, 53.4% (n = 303) of the sample population were ridden BTV compared with 39.7% (n = 267) in 2018 (P < .001), 12.9% (n = 303) were OV in 2005 compared with 15.0% (n = 267) in 2018 (P > .05), and 10.9% (n = 303) were IFV in 2005 compared with 27.3% (n = 267) in 2018 (P < .0004). These results suggest a positive development with fewer vendors/riders selecting images where the horse’s nose was BTV. However, this may be explained by the larger proportion of horses advertised in the WESP category in 2005 (63.0%; n = 303) versus 2018 (28.5%; n = 267), and the WESP category predominantly comprised of dressage, jumper, and eventing horses. In addition, the reduction of HNPs BTV from 53.4% (n = 303) in 2005 to 39.7% (n = 267) in 2018 could be attributed to the observation that in 2018, a larger proportion of horses were listed in categories that do not require the horses to be worked with a flexed HNP referred to as “on-the-bit” (e.g., western, endurance, Australian sStock horses). The HNP BTV remains preferential by a substantial proportion of the horse-owning public when advertising horses for sale, particularly in disciplines where the horse is worked in a flexed HNP or “on-the-bit.”  aPublisher supplied data 3adistress 3ahead 3ahorses 3aneck 3anose 3aregression analysis 3asales 3aveterinary medicine 0aHead and neck position 0aEquitation science 0aEquine welfare 0aHorse training 0aDressage1 aWilliams, Jane1 aRichardson, Karen0 tJournal of equine veterinary science.g2020 Dec., v. 95 p.103280-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl33309x0737-08067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jevs.2020.1032803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245010500165500002200270520133300292592002801625650001501653650001201668650001801680650001101698650002901709650002101738650001601759651001001775653000801785653000801793653000801801653000801809653000801817653002101825653001701846653002601863653002001889653002001909700002401929700002201953700002201975773005801997856008302055852000902138655001202147IND60581100820221119205218.0171005s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058110082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Mattia12aA comprehensive ex-post assessment of res deployment in italy: jobs, value added and import leakages  aPre-press version  aTaking a retrospective look at Italy's experience over the period 2006-2014, this paper investigates to what extent the deployment of renewable energy sources (RES) contributed to value added and employment in the economy. From the methodological point of view, our study combines an input-output approach with a comprehensive bottom-up analytical model in which detailed product information from external trade statistics is used to account for imports.Although during the period under consideration Italy experienced an expansion in RES capacity that went beyond the rosiest expectations, it appears that the resulting demand for plant components was met to a very significant extent by imports. We find that the contribution to sectoral value added and employment was not as large as envisioned by ex-ante analyses. In net terms, the resources absorbed by RES plants in the construction, installation and manufacturing phase seem to have made a smaller contribution to the domestic economy than they would have in several counterfactual scenarios. The opposite is true for the resources used in the subsequent operation and management phase. Finally, our results suggest that variation in domestic content of manufactured products may limit the portability of RES employment and value added factor estimates across countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemployment 3aimports 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3arenewable energy sources 3atrade statistics 3avalue added 3aItaly 0aJ08 0aO13 0aQ40 0aQ42 0aQ48 0arenewable energy 0ajob creation 0ainput-output analysis 0aimport leakages 0asupport schemes1 aCusumano, Niccolò,1 aLorenzoni, Arturo1 aPontoni, Federico0 tEnergy Policy.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0301-42157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2017.08.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245008100160300001800241520053100259592002800790650001500818650001500833650001600848650001400864650001600878650001000894650001600904650002800920650002300948651001000971653001600981653001800997653002001015653001301035700002501048700001601073700001801089773015201107856007601259852000901335655001201344IND60679830620221121110959.0200102e20191206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067983062DNAL7 a10.11158/saa.24.12.42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQin, Fengping10aThree new species of eriophyoid mites (Acari: Eriophyoidea) from South China  ap. 2329-2347.  aThree new species of eriophyoid mites from South China are described and illustrated: Acadicrus sterculussp. nov. infesting Sterculia lanceolata Cav.

We used quantitative ethnobotany to rank culturally important taxa and subsequent pharmacological and phytochemical studies to assess bioactivity.Antidiabetic plants identified in field interviews with traditional healers were ranked by syndromic importance value (SIV) based on 15 symptoms of diabetes. Species ranked with high SIV were tested in an assay relevant to many diabetes complications, the advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) inhibition assay. Active principles were identified by phytochemical analysis and bioassay.We collected over 70 plant species having a promising SIV score. The plants represented a broad range of neotropical taxa. Selected Q’eqchi’ antidiabetic plants with high SIV were collected in bulk and tested in the advanced glycation endproduct (AGE) inhibition assay. All plant extracts showed AGE inhibition and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranged from 40.8 to 733 µg/mL, while the most active species was Tynanthus guatemalensis Donn (Bignoniaceae). A linear regression showed a significant relationship between 1/ IC50 and SIV. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of verbascoside, as a major component and active principle of the T guatemalensis which had an IC50 = 5.1 µg/mL, comparable to the positive control quercetin.The results reveal a rich botanical tradition of antidiabetic symptom treatments among the Q’eqchi’. Study of highly ranked plants revealed their activity in AGE inhibition correlated with SIV. T. guatemalensis was identified as a promising species for further evaluation and local use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTynanthus 3aadvanced glycation end products 3achemical constituents of plants 3adiabetic complications 3aethnobotany 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterviews 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aplant extracts 3aregression analysis 3atraditional medicine 3averbascoside 3aBelize 0aAGE 0aIC50 0aSIV 0aT2D 0a4-HBA 0aAntidiabetic ethnobotany 0aTynanathus guatemalensis 0aVerbascoside 0aAdvanced glycation endproduct 0aSyndromic importance value1 aSaleem, A.1 aCarter Ramirez, A.1 aLiu, R.1 aChen, E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5367-72591 aPesek, T.1 aCal, V.1 aBalick, M.1 aArnason, J.T.0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2018 Oct. 05, v. 224 p.504-511dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2018.06.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03018naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100001800135245004900153300001500202520176500217592002801982650003402010650001802044650001102062650001302073650002802086650001202114650001802126650002002144650001302164650001602177650002702193700002002220700001602240700001902256773015202275856006902427856008002496990002302576852000902599655001202608IND60691445020221121065606.0200430e20200430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069144502DNAL7 a10.3791/610242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudich, Paige10aMeasuring ran peptide toxicity in C. elegans  ap. e61024.  aC. elegans is commonly used to model age-related neurodegenerative diseases caused by repeat expansion mutations, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington’s disease. Recently, repeat expansion-containing RNA was shown to be the substrate for a novel type of protein translation called repeat-associated non-AUG-dependent (RAN) translation. Unlike canonical translation, RAN translation does not require a start codon and only occurs when repeats exceed a threshold length. Because there is no start codon to determine the reading frame, RAN translation occurs in all reading frames from both sense and antisense RNA templates that contain a repeat expansion sequence. Therefore, RAN translation expands the number of possible disease-associated toxic peptides from one to six. Thus far, RAN translation has been documented in eight different repeat expansion-based neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. In each case, deciphering which RAN products are toxic, as well as their mechanisms of toxicity, is a critical step towards understanding how these peptides contribute to disease pathophysiology. In this paper, we present strategies to measure the toxicity of RAN peptides in the model system C. elegans. First, we describe procedures for measuring RAN peptide toxicity on the growth and motility of developing C. elegans. Second, we detail an assay for measuring postdevelopmental, age-dependent effects of RAN peptides on motility. Finally, we describe a neurotoxicity assay for evaluating the effects of RAN peptides on neuron morphology. These assays provide a broad assessment of RAN peptide toxicity and may be useful for performing large-scale genetic or small molecule screens to identify disease mechanisms or therapies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3aantisense RNA 3amodels 3amutation 3aneuromuscular disorders 3aneurons 3aneurotoxicity 3apathophysiology 3apeptides 3astart codon 3atranslation (genetics)1 aSnoznik, Carley1 aPuleo, Noah1 aLamitina, Todd0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2020 Apr. 30, , no. 158 p.e61024-e61024dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3791/610243Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/61024/measuring-ran-peptide-toxicity-in-c-elegans  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03980naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245009900208300001100307520213000318592002802448596006402476596008002540650003102620650001302651650002902664650002002693650001902713650002502732650001902757650000902776650001702785650002002802650001002822650002902832650002002861650001202881650003202893650002402925650001102949650001302960650002202973650001302995650001803008650002303026650000903049650001903058651001103077700002203088700001903110700002003129700001503149773013403164856008303298852000903381655001203390IND60704679520221119203949.0201230e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070467952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-020-01651-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrudhomme, Rémi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7042-465610aAssessing the impact of increased legume production in Europe on global agricultural emissions  ap. 91.  aThe increased use of legumes is viewed as a promising option to mitigate climate change, as they are a source of proteins and provide nitrogen to the soil. In this paper, we evaluate a strategy for the increased use of legumes in Europe until 2050 by integrating a large array of food and natural system processes into a consistent modeling framework. Three contrasting scenarios are studied: a supply-side scenario entailing a change in the animal feed mix, a demand-side scenario entailing a shift in human diet, and a combination of the shift in human diet with a reforestation in Europe. We find that mitigated emissions are much higher in the two diet shift scenarios (-231 and -259 MtCO₂ₑq, respectively) than in the supply-side scenario (-10 MtCO₂ₑq). Therefore, the main environmental benefit of legumes is to provide proteins as a substitute for animal products rather than enabling a lower consumption of synthetic fertilizer through increased leguminous nitrogen fixation. Diet shift scenarios require a lower use of lands that can then be used to either reduce intensification or reforest. In the former case, the reduction in emissions concerns almost exclusively non-CO₂ emissions, mainly through enteric fermentation and manure management, and occurs largely outside Europe. In the latter case, the livestock sector still represents a substantial share of the emission reduction but is outpaced by CO₂ emissions through carbon sequestration. An increase in legume production substantially reduces greenhouse gas emissions from the AFOLU sector only when combined with a change in diet, and its combination with reforestation allows the emission reduction to be relocated to Europe through carbon sequestration. Our study concludes that an increase in legume production accompanied by appropriate measures on both the supply and demand side can be effective in reducing emissions. These results can be used to design the European Commission’s “Farm to Fork” strategy for sustainable food and to support climate-friendly farming practices of the post-2020 European common agricultural policy.  aPublisher supplied data  aLauréat du Concours de l'Ecole Doctorale ABIES 2015cMESRI  aANR-16-CONV-0003cMinistère de la Transition écologique et Solidaire (FR) 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3aFabaceae 3aanimal manure management 3aanimal products 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3aclimate change 3adiet 3afarm to fork 3afarming systems 3afeeds 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ahuman nutrition 3alegumes 3alivestock and meat industry 3amineral fertilizers 3amodels 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fixation 3aproteins 3areforestation 3arumen fermentation 3asoil 3asupply balance 3aEurope1 aBrunelle, Thierry1 aDumas, Patrice1 aLe Moing, Anais1 aZhang, Xin0 tRegional environmental change.g2020 Sept., v. 20, no. 3 p.91-91dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-020-01651-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03325naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013600163300001600299520166500315592002801980650000802008650001002016650002302026650000902049650001002058650004202068650001502110650001202125650002102137650001902158650002502177650001402202650001402216650002602230650002902256650001802285650002502303651001102328653001202339653002502351653002902376653001802405700001702423700005602440700001502496700001602511700001702527700002402544773011202568856008202680852000902762655001202771IND60623021020221120072316.0190411e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062302102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.11.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPierron, F.10aTranscriptome-wide analysis of wild Asari (=Manila) clams affected by the Brown Muscle Disease: Etiology and impacts of the disease  ap. 179-185.  aRecently, we reported an emerging pathology named Brown Muscle Disease (BMD) affecting Asari clams inhabiting the most productive area for this species in France, the Arcachon Bay.

Contrary to healthy clams, infected animals are always found at the surface of the sediment and exhibit 30 nm virus-like particles in muscle, granulocytic and rectal cells. In order to get more insights on the etiology and impacts of the BMD on clams, we took advantage in the present study of next generation sequencing technologies. An RNA-Seq approach was used (i) to test whether viral RNA sequences can be specifically found in the transcriptome of diseased animals and (ii) to identify the genes that are differentially regulated between diseased and healthy clams. Contrary to healthy buried animals, in diseased clams one sequence showing extensive homologies with retroviridae-related genes was detected. Among the biological processes that were affected in diseased clams, the synaptic transmission process was the most represented. To deepen this result, a new sampling was carried out and the transcription level of genes involved in synaptic transmission was determined in healthy and diseased clams but also in clams with no visible sign of pathology but located at the surface of the sediment. Our findings suggest that muscle atrophy is a latter sign of the pathology and that nervous system could be instead a primary target of the BMD agent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aclams 3aetiological agents 3afish 3agenes 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aimmunology 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3anervous system 3anucleotide sequences 3asediments 3ashellfish 3asynaptic transmission 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3avirus-like particles 3aFrance 0aRNA-Seq 0aBrown Muscle Disease 0aRuditapes phillippinarum 0aNeurotoxicity1 aGonzalez, P.1 aBertucci, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5727-72281 aBinias, C.1 aMérour, E.1 aBrémont, M.1 aMontaudouin, X. de,0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Mar., v. 86 p.179-185dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.11.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01949naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245007000166300001800236520098300254592002801237650000801265650001801273650001901291650001101310650001301321650001001334650001601344700001801360700002501378700002001403773010401423856007501527852000901602655001201611IND60534169120170629000000.0160802e20140619xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053416912DNAL7 a10.1021/ef402476r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchönborn, Alessandro10aAutoignition of Dimethyl Ether and Air in an Optical Flow-Reactor  ap. 4130-4138.  aAutoignition of dimethyl ether in air was studied in a turbulent flow-reactor with optical access, at conditions relevant to micro gas turbine combustors. The ignition process was visualized using OH*-chemiluminescence imaging, showing the formation of multiple autoignition kernels along the central axis of the reactor. Ignition delays in the range of τ = 112–310 ms were measured at temperatures of T = 739–902 K, pressures of P = 0.2–0.4 MPa, equivalence ratios of ϕ = 0.225–0.675, and initial flow velocities of Uᵢ = 8–46 m/s. The effect of adding nitrogen to the reactants as a diluent was investigated for mole fractions of additional nitrogen ranging from 0 < XN₂ < 0.1. The experimental ignition delays were compared with homogeneous gas-phase chemical kinetic modeling. Comparison between the modeling and experiments showed significant discrepancies, but agreement was improved when heat transfer in the reactor was taken into account in the modeling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aheat transfer 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aseeds 3atemperature1 aSayad, Parisa1 aKonnov, Alexander

The wetlands are considered to be important roles in microplastic migration in water bodies. Nevertheless, knowledge about the occurrence and fate of microplastics in urban natural wetland is still limited for us to better understand how they become a sink of microplastics. In this study, the distribution and characteristics of microplastics in surface water, surface sediments, and sediment cores of the Lalu Wetland watershed, China's highest urban wetland, were investigated in August 2020 and January 2021. The abundances of microplastics in the surface water were 0.06–3.05 MPs/L. Microplastic abundance in the surface sediment and sediment core was 0.01–1.10 MPs/g and 0–16.23 MPs/g, respectively. The abundance of microplastics in the water was significantly lower in the wetland than that in the channel in the watershed. Comparing the wetland inlet and outlet water, the microplastic interception rates were 53% in January and 95% in August. The characteristics and seasonal variation of microplastics in the Lalu Wetland implied that urban natural wetlands were good at intercepting microplastics, and vegetation growth might play an important role on the interception of microplastics by the wetland. The increasing of microplastics from bottom to top in the sediment cores of Lalu Wetland also indicated that the ecological risks of microplastics accumulation in sediments of urban natural wetland required further attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironment 3amicroplastics 3aseasonal variation 3asediments 3asurface water 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aChina 0aMicroplastics 0aWetland 0aWater 0aSediment 0aIntercept1 aHu, Hongjuan1 aXiong, Xiong1 aZhao, E,1 aWang, Kehuan1 aWu, Chenxi0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 01, v. 828 p.154399-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1543993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03571naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002800164245009600192300001600288520164200304592002801946650001201974650001601986650000802002650001302010650002102023650002502044650002302069650001702092650002002109650002602129650001502155650001602170650001502186650001302201650002702214650001202241650001202253650001402265650002702279650004502306650005102351651001902402700002902421700002302450700001602473700002302489700001802512700002002530700002702550700001602577700003002593700002402623700002502647700001602672700002702688700003002715773010702745856004802852852000902900655001202909IND4467424520221120045019.0120323e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446742452DNAL7 a216710232pmid7 a10.1007/s10695-011-9525-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez-Martinez, L.

However, larviculture remains as the main bottleneck for massive production. In this sense, our objective was to determine the changes of digestive enzymes activities using biochemical and electrophoretic techniques during 36 days of Common snook larviculture fed with live preys (microalgae, rotifers, and Artemia). During larviculture, all digestive enzymatic activities were detected with low values since yolk absorption, 2 days after hatching (dah) onwards. However, the maximum values for alkaline protease (6,500 U mg protein−1), trypsin (0.053 mU × 10−3 mg protein−1), and Leucine aminopeptidase (1.4 × 10−3 mU mg protein−1) were detected at 12 dah; for chymotrypsin at 25 dah (3.8 × 10−3 mU mg protein−1), for carboxypeptidase A (280 mU mg protein−1) and lipase at 36 dah (480 U mg protein−1), for α-amylase at 7 dah (1.5 U mg protein−1), for acid phosphatases at 34 dah (5.5 U mg protein−1), and finally for alkaline phosphatase at 25 dah (70 U mg protein−1). The alkaline protease zymogram showed two active bands, the first (26.3 kDa) at 25 dah onwards, and the second (51.6 kDa) at 36 dah. The acid protease zymogram showed two bands (RF = 0.32 and 0.51, respectively) at 34 dah. The digestive enzymatic ontogeny of C. undecimalis is very similar to other strictly marine carnivorous fish, and we suggest that weaning process should be started at 34 dah.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aCentropomus 3aMus 3aRotifera 3aacid phosphatase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acarboxypeptidase A 3achymotrypsin 3aenzyme activity 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3alive feeds 3amarine fish 3amicroalgae 3aontogeny 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3atrypsin 2aAnimals 2aDigestion 2aHydrolasesxmetabolism 2aLarvaxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aPerciformesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 3aGulf of Mexico1 aAlvarez-González, C.

The majority of these cells express a cholinergic phenotype and utilize the taste signaling system to monitor the mucosal environment for potentially harmful substances, triggering protective reflexes. We report the identification of cells with a putative chemosensory role in the uterus. Presumptive chemosensory cells were immunoreactive to key components of the taste transduction, including the transient receptor potential channel M5 (TRPM5) and the phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCB2). These cells localized to endometrial glandular and luminal epithelia, while absent from myometrium and perimetrium. Double immunofluorescence revealed co-expression of chemosensory cell markers with the acetylcholine (ACh) synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Further, we investigated the regional distribution and expression of chemosensory cells at different stages of the estrous cycle. Uteri were collected postmortem from gilts and stages of the ovarian cycle were determined macroscopically. The uteri were classified into three groups: prepubertal (PB), follicular (FOL), or luteal (LUT). The number of ChAT-immunoreactive cells was increased in the luminal epithelium in the caudal compartment compared to the cranial region of the uterine horn, and at the LUT compared to PB and FOL stages. An increase in ChAT protein abundance in LUT uterine homogenates was noted, although not followed by an increase in ACh content. In summary, our study has identified a hitherto unrecognized cholinergic cell in the uterus that has chemosensory traits and may be involved in a multitude of biological processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a1OT2OD026582cNational Institutes of Health 3aacetylcholine 3acholine acetyltransferase 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3aestrous cycle 3afluorescent antibody technique 3amyometrium 3aphenotype 3aphospholipases 3apuberty 3aresearch 3ataste 3atransient receptor potential channels1 aLiao, Yan-Shin1 aReznikov, Leah R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4074-90700 tCell and tissue research.g2022 Apr., v. 388, no. 1 p.33-47dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl14430x0302-766X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-022-03585-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245010000205500002000305520167400325592002801999596008602027596008502113596006702198650002402265650002402289650001402313650002102327650002202348650001302370650001902383650002802402650001602430650001102446700002202457700002102479700002702500700002802527700002102555700002402576700002502600773014402625856007402769852000902843655001202852IND60750363320221118051417.0210913e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075036332DNAL7 a10.1111/jfpp.157562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Ludmilla C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7717-124410aExtending the functionality of arrowroot starch by thermally assisted high hydrostatic pressure  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe modification of native arrowroot starch (NAS) properties by thermally assisted high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) was investigated. Changes in the structure of the granules were produced by HHP. This was enhanced when HHP was applied together with a temperature increase to 50℃, for 15 or 25 min. Processing at 400 MPa/25℃ had minimal effect. As pressure and/or temperature increased, processed arrowroot starches progressively lost the Maltese cross and granular structure. There was also a decrease in the enthalpy of the gelatinization which occurred between 61.3 and 80.3℃. The relative crystallinity of NAS was reduced, depending on the severity of treatment, by 6.81%–35.74%. A principal components analysis showed a clear trajectory depending on processing conditions. The most severe treatment 650 MPa/50℃ did not produce complete gelatinization. Thermally assisted HHP demonstrated advantages over at 25℃ and produced a physically modified version of the arrowroot starch, with potential as a clean label ingredient. NOVELTY IMPACT STATEMENT: This study with arrowroot starch (AS) has revealed a pronounced effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) when applied together with mild temperature (50℃), compared with conventional processes at room temperature, and consequent lowering of onset pressure for structural changes of starch. Modified AS with a several different functionalities may be produced by thermally assisted HHP, whose techno‐functional properties correspond well with the measurements of structural order. The results of this work support the industrial potential of this unconventional starch as a clean label ingredient.  aPublisher supplied data  a150021/2018‐6.cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  a408005/2017‐3cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel 3aSilene chalcedonica 3aambient temperature 3aarrowroot 3aarrowroot starch 3acrystal structure 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aingredients 3astarch1 aMacnaughtan, Bill1 aGouseti, Ourania1 aVillas‐Boas, Flávia1 aClerici, Maria T.

The transition, which reside in social sciences narrative, defines the human context of urban space from different behavioral perspectives. The analytical frame of this narrative shows that the fundamentally polysemic meaning of the terms space, place and territory are used interchangeably to designate urban space. The urban space is therefore construed as ‘public space’ or ‘urban place’ where community activities find expression. There exists potential concern in the search for sustainable urban development that this social narrative of urban space is most probably not disposed to exact leverage on land use policy for enhanced spatial integration. This paper argue that the social narrative, which sustain conceptual planning, is antithetical to spatial planning and land use integration. The absence of the spatial context of urban space is a fundamental gap in knowledge that subordinates land use integration. Scientists lean on the principle of totality to consider the conception of urban space as a natural system that is compliant with integration. Accordingly, this paper attempts to conceptualize urban space as a natural spatial system that encourages land use policy change in which individual right for instance is subordinated to spatial integration. The paper engages triangulation of mixed research methods to examine existing notions of urban space (environment).  aPublisher supplied data 3aland policy 3aland use 3aplanning 3aresearch methods 3asocial sciences 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aNigeria 0aSustainability 0aTransition 0aUrban space 0aSpace economy 0aUrban form 0aPlanning 0aAfrica1 aIfeoma, Ukonze1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3564-08520 tLand use policy.g2019 Sept., v. 87 p.104074-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1040743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03496naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245010300206300001400309520185400323592002802177650002602205650002302231650001102254650000902265650001302274650001502287650001502302650003502317650001602352650001602368650001402384650001402398650001502412651002202427653003302449653001202482653001802494653001802512653002602530653002702556653002302583653002002606700001802626700001902644700001902663700002002682700001902702700002202721773010502743856008502848852000902933655001202942IND60536127520221117231553.0190215e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053612752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoada, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3815-625X10aHotspots of predation persist outside marine reserves in the historically fished Mediterranean Sea  ap. 67-74.  aThe Mediterranean Sea has sustained historically high levels of fishing since pre-Roman times. This once-abundant sea has witnessed major declines in apex predators, now largely restricted to isolated pockets within marine reserves. This depletion could critically impact macrophyte communities that are strongly structured by top-down processes. We evaluated rates of predation on the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, a key herbivore of macroalgal and Posidonia oceanica seagrass seascapes, across a large stretch of the Western Mediterranean coastline. Fish predation was generally higher inside reserves, but was equally high at several locations outside these boundaries. Although critically low at some locations compared to reserves, predation was functionally ubiquitous in most habitats, seasons and sites. Fish were still primarily responsible for this predation with no clear evidence of meso-predator release. Macroalgal habitats were consistently subject to higher predation than in seagrass meadows, functionally critical given the vulnerability of macroalgal systems to overgrazing. Predation hotspots were clearly associated with high fish predator numbers and low refuge availability. Taken together, these results suggest that long-term overfishing may not necessarily reflect a complete loss of trophic function. Pockets of fish predation may still persist, linked to habitat complexity, predator behavioral adaptations and landscape-level features. Given the essential role top-down control plays in macroalgal communities, regulating fishing at these predation hotspots is vital to effectively conserve habitats from future hysteretic shifts. Even historically fished seas may retain areas where trophic function persists; identifying these areas is critical to preserving the remaining ecological integrity of these coastlines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aParacentrotus lividus 3aPosidonia oceanica 3acoasts 3afish 3ahabitats 3aherbivores 3amacroalgae 3anatural resources conservation 3aoverfishing 3aovergrazing 3apredation 3apredators 3aseagrasses 3aMediterranean Sea 0aPredator–prey interactions 0aRefugia 0aRhizome layer 0aCanopy height 0aParacentrotus lividus 0aMacroalgal communities 0aPosidonia oceanica 0aDiplodus sargus1 aArthur, Rohan1 aFarina, Simone1 aSantana, Yaiza1 aMascaró, Oriol1 aRomero, Javier1 aAlcoverro, Teresa0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Nov., v. 191 p.67-74dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03529naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245005700164300001600221520229800237592002802535650001702563650001702580650001502597650002102612650001202633650001202645650001502657650001302672650001202685650001302697650001502710650001602725650001402741650001402755651001102769700001802780700002102798700002302819700001602842773014302858856007303001852000903074655001203083IND60132608420221117043627.0150505e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013260842DNAL7 a10.1111/mam.120362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodrigues, Patrícia12aA biogeographical regionalization of Angolan mammals  ap. 103-116.  aWe developed a biogeographical regionalization of Angolan mammals based on data collected before major declines occurred during the civil war (1975–2002). In terms of its biodiversity, Angola is one of the least known of all African countries. We used 9880 grid records of 140 species (rodents, ungulates and carnivores) collected mainly in 1930–80, at a quarter degree cell resolution. Biogeographical regions were identified by using cluster analysis, based on βₛᵢₘdissimilarity matrices and a hierarchical classification using Ward's method. An indicator value analysis was used to identify species characterizing each region. Distance‐based redundancy analysis was used to investigate the environmental correlates of mammalian assemblages. Four biogeographical subdivisions emerged from ungulate distributions, while rodent and carnivore data were largely uninformative. In the north, the Zaire‐Lunda‐Cuanza region was mainly characterized by ungulate species associated with Congolian forests. In the south, the Namibe and Cunene‐Cuando Cubango regions were mainly characterized by ungulates widespread in south‐western and southern Africa. In between these regions, the Central Plateau region was mainly characterized by a few widespread ungulate species that are relatively common in dense miombo woodlands. Biogeographical patterns were significantly associated with a dominant north–south gradient of decreasing humidity and increasing temperature, and with a concurrent gradient from dense forests and woodlands to open savannas, grasslands and deserts. The biogeographical regions we identified in Angola were largely consistent with other bioregionalizations developed using various taxonomic groups at larger spatial scales. Biogeographical patterns reflected the southward penetration of Congolian forest species in the north, and the northward penetration of southern African desert/grassland species in the south‐west and of open savanna species in the south. These processes seem to be controlled by the distribution of vegetation types, which in turn are associated with climatic gradients and soil types. The stronger patterns observed for ungulates than for other mammals may reflect the close association of ungulates to specific vegetation types.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acarnivores 3acluster analysis 3adeserts 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahumidity 3arodents 3asavannas 3asoil types 3atemperature 3aungulates 3awoodlands 3aAngola1 aFigueira, Rui1 aVaz Pinto, Pedro1 aAraújo, Miguel B.1 aBeja, Pedro0 tMammal review.g2015 Apr., v. 45, no. 2 p.103-116dPublished for the Mammal Society by Blackwell Scientific Publications.x0305-18387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mam.120363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002600153245009700179300001600276520178000292592002802072650001502100650001502115650002202130650001802152650001902170650001302189653002902202653003102231653002702262653002502289653002302314700002102337700002202358773020602380856008702586852000902673655001202682IND60600655920221119004311.0180703e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060065592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2014.06.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTheiler, Pascal Willy10aKeypoint-based 4-Points Congruent Sets – Automated marker-less registration of laser scans  ap. 149-163.  aWe propose a method to automatically register two point clouds acquired with a terrestrial laser scanner without placing any markers in the scene. What makes this task challenging are the strongly varying point densities caused by the line-of-sight measurement principle, and the huge amount of data. The first property leads to low point densities in potential overlap areas with scans taken from different viewpoints while the latter calls for highly efficient methods in terms of runtime and memory requirements.A crucial yet largely unsolved step is the initial coarse alignment of two scans without any simplifying assumptions, that is, point clouds are given in arbitrary local coordinates and no knowledge about their relative orientation is available. Once coarse alignment has been solved, scans can easily be fine-registered with standard methods like least-squares surface or Iterative Closest Point matching. In order to drastically thin out the original point clouds while retaining characteristic features, we resort to extracting 3D keypoints. Such clouds of keypoints, which can be viewed as a sparse but nevertheless discriminative representation of the original scans, are then used as input to a very efficient matching method originally developed in computer graphics, called 4-Points Congruent Sets (4PCS) algorithm. We adapt the 4PCS matching approach to better suit the characteristics of laser scans.The resulting Keypoint-based 4-Points Congruent Sets (K-4PCS) method is extensively evaluated on challenging indoor and outdoor scans. Beyond the evaluation on real terrestrial laser scans, we also perform experiments with simulated indoor scenes, paying particular attention to the sensitivity of the approach with respect to highly symmetric scenes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aautomation 3acomputer graphics 3aleast squares 3aremote sensing 3ascanners 0aPoint cloud registration 0aTerrestrial laser scanning 0a3D keypoint extraction 0aCongruent point sets 0aGeometric matching1 aWegner, Jan Dirk1 aSchindler, Konrad0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2014 Oct., v. 96 p.149-163dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

The granulation experiment was conducted in four sequencing batch reactors (SBR), of which two were conventional SBRs (RC1, RC2) used as control, and two were photo-SBRs (R1, R2). R1 and RC1 were operated with a 40-min feeding during the reactors´ anaerobic cycle period, whereas R2 and RC2 with a 60-min feeding. All the reactors were operated in two phases with a C:N = 4:1 in Phase I and 8:1 in Phase II. In Phase I, AGS in RC1 and RC2 was formed 15 days before the AAGS development in R1 and R2. However, the AAGS generally presented better stability and higher diameter. On the other hand, AGS presented greater abundance of extracellular polymeric substances producing organisms, such as Xanthomonadacea and Rhodocyclaceae. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH₄⁺-N removal efficiencies were similar in all the four reactors of approximately 70% and 60%, respectively. In this phase, despite the good biomass structure, the reactors were not able to completely oxidize the high influent concentration of NH₄⁺-N (100 mg.L⁻¹) and COD (400 mg.L⁻¹). This can be associated to the short time of the aerobic phase and low biomass content. In Phase II in all the reactors, a good increase in COD and NH₄⁺-N removal efficiencies to values above 95% and 93%, respectively, was achieved under a higher C:N ratio of 8 with lower influent concentration of NH₄⁺-N (50 mg.L⁻¹). The 60-min anaerobic feeding period in R2 and RC2 resulted in greater removal efficiency of nitrogen, confirming that small variation on cycle periods can affect the biomass composition; the biomass presented more compact granules and larger diameters under 60 min-feeding when compared with those obtained with 40 min-feeding in Phase I.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhodocyclaceae 3aalgae 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3achemical oxygen demand 3aenvironment 3anitrogen 3apolymers 3asludge 0aNitrification and denitrification 0aC:N ratios 0aSimultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal 0aGranular stability 0aEPS-producing organisms1 aMarinho, Talita1 aMarinho, Idayana C.1 aGavazza, Savia1 aKato, Mario T.1 aMagnus, Bruna S.1 aFlorencio, Lourdinha0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 01, v. 828 p.154402-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245006300176300001600239520145600255592002801711650001901739650002601758650001501784650001001799650001301809653002801822653001001850653002501860653001801885700002501903700002101928700002701949700002501976773014102001856008702142852000902229655001202238IND50067952220221120044042.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006795222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.applanim.2013.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugnaseelan, Sumita10aVisual discrimination learning and spatial acuity in sheep  ap. 104-111.  aVisual acuity is an important component of environmental recognition in sheep, yet knowledge about it is limited in this or other herbivorous species. We tested the ability of British Friesland×Texel female lambs to discriminate black and white square-wave gratings, presented vertically or horizontally, from a grey stimulus. Animal and environmental conditions were optimised for detection of visual acuity. Sheep could rapidly learn to discriminate some gratings from a grey stimulus. There was no difference in the ability of sheep to discriminate vertical or horizontal stimuli from a grey stimulus. Visual acuity, determined at between 11.7 and 14.0cycles/degree, was greater than that previously predicted from anatomical measurements (7–10 cycles/degree), and considerably greater than that measured for sheep by the Landoldt C ring technique (2.6–5.7 cycles/degree). It was also greater than that measured previously in most research using ungulates and other herbivores, with a variety of techniques. It is concluded that sheep visual acuity is potentially greater than hitherto realised, but that standardisation of techniques is required to make accurate comparisons with data gathered previously. Additionally, the ability to gauge an animal's awareness and its response(s) to various visual optotypes in its macro-environment will enable us to design livestock housing, handling and transport facilities that promote animal welfare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3aenvironmental factors 3aherbivores 3alambs 3alearning 0aDiscrimination learning 0aSheep 0aSquare-wave gratings 0aVisual acuity1 aPrescott, Neville B.1 aBroom, Donald M.1 aWathes, Christopher M.1 aPhillips, Clive J.C.0 tApplied animal behaviour science.g2013 July, v. 147, no. 1-2 p.104-111dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35407x0168-15917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2013.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02804naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245014200163300001600305520146000321592002801781650001401809650002301823650001001846650001201856650003501868650001401903650002201917650001201939653001701951653002101968653002301989653001502012653000902027653002802036700001602064700005602080700001902136700001402155773010702169856008502276852000902361655001202370IND60536127620221117231653.0190215e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053612762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGasc, A.10aAcoustic indices for biodiversity assessments: Analyses of bias based on simulated bird assemblages and recommendations for field surveys  ap. 306-312.  aRapid acoustic surveys aim to estimate biodiversity based on the diversity of sounds produced by animal communities, and interest in this approach among conservation planners is increasing. Several indices of acoustic diversity have been proposed as proxies for species richness. However, in the field, the animal activity may be responsible for acoustic diversity to varying degrees. To evaluate how measures of acoustic diversity may depart from actual species richness, we selected seven acoustic indices and applied them to simulated recordings of bird assemblages under different field conditions. For a given sound, defined here as the song composition emitted by a species assemblage, we determined if the indices were i) only driven by animal sounds, ii) insensitive to species identity, and iii) independent of species evenness. Under the field conditions evaluated, none of the indices fulfilled the three criteria necessary for a perfect proxy of species richness. However, some indices may be appropriate as a measure of biodiversity under a more broad definition including phylogenetic and/or functional aspects of diversity. We provide recommendations for the application of these indices for biodiversity measurement under field conditions, such as the application of appropriate audio filters, the increase of the repetition rate of the recordings, and the identification of the main taxonomic groups occurring in the recorded communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanimal communities 3abirds 3afilters 3anatural resources conservation 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 0aBiodiversity 0aAcoustic indices 0aAcoustic diversity 0aSimulation 0aBias 0aConservation management1 aPavoine, S.1 aLellouch, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3718-300X1 aGrandcolas, P.1 aSueur, J.0 tBiological conservation.g2015 Nov., v. 191 p.306-312dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2015.06.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03407naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245009900168520194200267592002802209650001502237650002402252650002102276650001502297650001902312650000902331650002002340650001602360650001202376650001502388650000902403650001202412650001102424651001002435653001702445653001702462653001902479653001702498653001602515653001602531653001302547700002002560700002802580700001902608700001702627700002902644773011902673856008802792852000902880655001202889IND60770030220221121100046.0220509e20220701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077003022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMas, Maria10aWinter bat activity: The role of wetlands as food and drinking reservoirs under climate change  aBat arousals during hibernation are related to rises in environmental temperature, body water loss and increasing body heat. Therefore, bats either hibernate in cold places or migrate to areas with mild winters to find water and insects to intake. During winter, insects are relatively abundant in wetlands with mild climates when low temperatures hamper insect activity in other places. However, the role of wetlands to sustain winter bat activity has never been fully assessed. To further understand bat behaviour during hibernation, we evaluated how the weather influenced hibernating bats, assessed the temperature threshold that increased bat arousals, and discussed how winter temperatures could affect bat activity under future climate change scenarios. The effects of weather and landscape composition on winter bat activity were assessed by acoustically sampling four different habitats (wetlands, rice paddies, urban areas and salt marshes) in the Ebro Delta (Spain). Our results show one of the highest winter bat foraging activities ever reported, with significantly higher activity in wetlands and urban areas. Most importantly, we found a substantial increase in bat activity triggered when nocturnal temperatures reached ca. 11 °C. By contrasting historical weather datasets, we show that, since the 1940s, there has been an increase by ca. 1.5 °C in winter maximum temperatures and a 180% increase in the number of nights with mean temperatures above 11 °C in the Ebro Delta. Temperature trends suggest that in 60–80 years, winter months will reach average temperatures of 11 °C (except maybe in January), which suggest a potential coming interruption or disappearance of bat hibernation in coastal Mediterranean habitats. This study highlights the significant role of wetlands in bat conservation under a climate change scenario as these humid areas represent one of the few remaining winter foraging habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3abody water 3aclimate change 3acold 3adata collection 3ahibernation 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3arice 3aweather 3awinter 3aSpain 0aBat activity 0aBioacoustics 0aClimate change 0aEcholocation 0aHabitat use 0aHibernation 0aWetlands1 aFlaquer, Carles1 aPuig-Montserrat, Xavier1 aPorres, Xavier1 aRebelo, Hugo1 aLópez-Baucells, Adrià,0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 July 01, v. 828 p.154403-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1544033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03387naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245010300202300001800305500001900323500002000342520137700362592002801739596006101767596006101828596006101889596006101950596006102011596006102072650001602133650001702149650001702166650001502183650001602198650001402214650001602228650002002244650001602264650001802280650001102298650002602309650001202335650001402347650001902361650001602380650004302396650001402439700001402453700001502467700002202482700001602504700006602520773012902586856007302715852000902788655001202797IND60734756020221119065422.0210422e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073475602DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.139882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIdrīs, Muḥammad,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5545-920110aUV‐B signalling in rice: Response identification, gene expression profiling and mutant isolation  ap. 1468-1485.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResponses of rice seedlings to UV‐B radiation (UV‐B) were investigated, aiming to establish rice as a model plant for UV‐B signalling studies. The growth of japonica rice coleoptiles, grown under red light, was inhibited by brief irradiation with UV‐B, but not with blue light. The effective UV‐B fluences (10⁻¹‐10³ μmol m⁻²) were much lower than those reported in Arabidopsis. The response was much less in indica rice cultivars and its extent varied among Oryza species. We next identified UV‐B‐specific anthocyanin accumulation in the first leaf of purple rice and used this visible phenotype to isolate mutants. Some isolated mutants were further characterized, and one was found to have a defect in the growth response. Using microarrays, we identified a number of genes that are regulated by low‐fluence‐rate UV‐B in japonica coleoptiles. Some up‐regulated genes were analysed by real‐time PCR for UV‐B specificity and the difference between japonica and indica. More than 70% of UV‐B‐regulated rice genes had no homologs in UV‐B‐regulated Arabidopsis genes. Many UV‐B‐regulated rice genes are related to plant hormones and especially to jasmonate biosynthetic and responsive genes in apparent agreement with the growth response. Possible involvement of two rice homologs of UVR8, a UV‐B photoreceptor, is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data  a24657037(MI)cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a12F02081(MI)cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a25120724(MI)cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a25120702(JH)cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a17H01872(JH)cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science  a20H04330(JH)cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aArabidopsis 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3ablue light 3acoleoptiles 3acultivars 3aenvironment 3agene expression 3airradiation 3ajasmonic acid 3aleaves 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3aphenotype 3aphotoreceptors 3apurple rice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3ared light1 aSeo, Nobu1 aJiang, Lei1 aKiyota, Seiichiro1 aHidema, Jun1 aIino, M.q(Moritoshi),1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2068-80470 tPlant, cell and environment.g2021 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1468-1485dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.139883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02748naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002900140245018500169300001600354500002000370520133700390592002801727650002101755650002301776650002301799650001401822650000901836650001501845650001201860650003201872650001601904650002101920650000901941650001901950650001401969650000701983650002001990650001602010700003502026700002502061773013302086856007402219852000902293655001202302IND60572002020221120074528.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057200202DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.123722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRueda‐López, Servando10aBiochemical Characterization and Comparison of Pancreatic Lipases from the Pacific Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus orientalis; Totoaba, Totoaba macdonaldi; and Striped Bass, Morone saxatilis  ap. 156-165.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aLipolytic activity from pancreatic crude extracts from the Pacific bluefin tuna (PBT), Thunnus orientalis; totoaba, Totoaba macdonaldi; and striped bass, Morone saxatilis, were biochemically characterized to detect possible differences in the digestive capacity of each fish. The maximum activity was at temperatures ranging from 35 to 45 C and at pH 8.0; the activity decreased significantly at a pH lower than 7.0. Lipases from PBT and totoaba showed an increase in activity with the presence of sodium taurocholate (NaTC; 6 mM). However, no increase in activity could be observed when a mixture of bile salts or natural bile extracts was used in the reaction mixture, which was observed in the presence of NaTC. In contrast, the lipase activity from striped bass increased accordingly when NaCl was added at different levels (0–1.5 M). Calcium was not required in the reaction mixture for any of the fish species tested. We concluded that all three lipases have different physicochemical properties and ionic strength and emulsifier requirements to obtain their maximum activity. Striped bass was far too sensitive to NaCl, while totoaba and PBT were sensitive to NaTC. The differences in activity shown here suggest the possibility of studying the use of different additives on feed formulations to maximize lipase efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMorone saxatilis 3aThunnus orientalis 3aTotoaba macdonaldi 3aadditives 3abile 3abile salts 3acalcium 3acarboxylic ester hydrolases 3aemulsifiers 3afeed formulation 3afish 3aionic strength 3alipolysis 3apH 3asodium chloride 3atemperature1 aMartínez‐Montaño, Emmanuel1 aViana, María Teresa0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.156-165dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02117naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001600247500001100263520096200274592002801236650001101264650001801275650001901293650002501312650002301337650001301360650001901373650001601392650001501408650001801423650001701441650002701458700001701485700001701502773011001519856008101629852000901710655001201719IND60572617120221119155800.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057261712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-016-2462-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Cong10aMicroRNAs in regulation of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells  ap. 229-238.  aReview  aMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), also referred to as multipotent stromal cells, have been isolated from various adult tissue sources because of their capabilities of differentiating into multiple cell lineages including osteoblasts, thus providing a novel approach for treating bone diseases and metabolic disorders. Despite extensive potential in cell therapy and widespread interest in clinical applications of MSCs, the molecular mechanisms with regard to the regulation of their therapeutic properties and osteoblast differentiation remain to be fully elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a novel class of endogenous small noncoding RNAs, regulate gene expressions by translational repression or degradation of their targets. Recently, emerging evidence has shown that miRNAs are closely involved in controlling the key steps of osteoblast differentiation in MSCs. This review focuses on miRNAs and their roles in regulating osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abone diseases 3abone formation 3amedicinal properties 3ametabolic diseases 3amicroRNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aosteoblasts 3astem cells 3astromal cells 3atherapeutics 3atranslation (genetics)1 aGeng, Junnan1 aJiang, Siwen0 tCell and tissue research.g2017 May, v. 368, no. 2 p.229-238dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-016-2462-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011000157300001800267500002000285520189600305592002802201650002502229650001102254650001902265650001302284650001202297650001902309650001402328650001202342650001502354650001302369650001302382650000802395650001402403650001402417650001102431650002402442650001402466650001502480650001202495650001302507650000902520651001502529700002502544700002102569773012302590856007302713852000902786655001202795IND60587815520221122221014.0180102e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058781552DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.135382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbadi, Fitsum10aIntegrated population modeling reveals the impact of climate on the survival of juvenile emperor penguins  ap. 1353-1359.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEarly‐life demographic traits are poorly known, impeding our understanding of population processes and sensitivity to climate change. Survival of immature individuals is a critical component of population dynamics and recruitment in particular. However, obtaining reliable estimates of juvenile survival (i.e., from independence to first year) remains challenging, as immatures are often difficult to observe and to monitor individually in the field. This is particularly acute for seabirds, in which juveniles stay at sea and remain undetectable for several years. In this work, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model to estimate the juvenile survival of emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), and other demographic parameters including adult survival and fecundity of the species. Using this statistical method, we simultaneously analyzed capture–recapture data of adults, the annual number of breeding females, and the number of fledglings of emperor penguins collected at Dumont d'Urville, Antarctica, for the period 1971–1998. We also assessed how climate covariates known to affect the species foraging habitats and prey [southern annular mode (SAM), sea ice concentration (SIC)] affect juvenile survival. Our analyses revealed that there was a strong evidence for the positive effect of SAM during the rearing period (SAMR) on juvenile survival. Our findings suggest that this large‐scale climate index affects juvenile emperor penguins body condition and survival through its influence on wind patterns, fast ice extent, and distance to open water. Estimating the influence of environmental covariates on juvenile survival is of major importance to understand the impacts of climate variability and change on the population dynamics of emperor penguins and seabirds in general and to make robust predictions on the impact of climate change on marine predators.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAptenodytes forsteri 3aadults 3abody condition 3abreeding 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afecundity 3afemales 3afledglings 3aforaging 3ahabitats 3aice 3aimmatures 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3apopulation dynamics 3apredators 3aprediction 3arearing 3aseabirds 3awind 3aAntarctica1 aBarbraud, Christophe1 aGimenez, Olivier0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.1353-1359dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.135383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100002000168245011100188300001800299500001500317520103200332592002801364650001301392650001201405650001501417650002501432650001301457650003501470650001501505650002001520650001201540650003001552650001201582650004701594650004101641650002201682650001601704650002501720651001201745651001201757653001401769700002101783700002001804700002101824700002301845700001601868700002101884700001901905700001801924700002101942700002001963700001801983700002702001773010902028856008502137852000902222655001202231IND4473076820221118040409.0141111e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447307682DNAL7 a212886302pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMustajoki, Jyri10aUse of decision analysis interviews to support the sustainable use of the forests in Finnish Upper Lapland  ap. 1550-1563.  a2019-12-06  aControversy between alternative uses of forests in Finnish Upper Lapland has been going on for decades, and in recent years it has been escalated to a serious conflict. The core of the conflict is the adverse impacts of forestry on old forests which are important grazing areas for reindeer and which are regarded as intact nature and wilderness areas. This paper describes the experiences of applying multi-criteria decision analysis interview approach on this conflict. The approach provides tools for structuring the problem and preferences of the stakeholders as well as for analyzing the effects of different alternatives in a common framework. We focus on the practical experiences gained from the application of this approach in this context. Multi-criteria decision analysis was found to be a useful approach to evaluate the economic, ecological and cultural aspects of this intense conflict. The obtained experiences also support the view that the approach works best when tightly integrated into the planning process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplanning 3agrazing 3ainterviews 3asustainable forestry 3areindeer 3amulti-criteria decision making 3awilderness 3aproblem solving 3aforests 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aDecision Support Systems, Management 2aForestryxmethods 2aNegotiating 2aReindeerxphysiology 3aLapland 0aFinland 0aeconomics1 aSaarikoski, Heli1 aMarttunen, Mika1 aAhtikoski, Anssi1 aHallikainen, Ville1 aHelle, Timo1 aHypponen, Mikko,1 aJokinen, Mikko1 aNaskali, Arto1 aTuulentie, Seija1 aVarmola, Martti1 aVatanen, Eero1 aYlisirniö, Anna-Liisa0 tJournal of environmental management.g2011 June, v. 92, no. 6 p.1550-1563dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2011.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02355naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245008900170300001400259500001500273520113200288592002801420650002001448650001101468650002001479650002301499650001401522650000801536650001101544650001901555650001801574650001701592650001201609653001501621700002001636700002301656700002001679700003101699773010701730856008701837852000901924655001201933IND50060210320221118040410.0150810e20121215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006021032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2012.05.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKilinc, Musa13aAn analysis of the surface energy budget above the world's tallest angiosperm forest  ap. 23-31.  a2019-12-06  aEddy covariance measurements were conducted over the worlds’ tallest angiosperm forest (>90m) for the first time at an old-growth Eucalyptus regnans (Mountain Ash) site at Wallaby Creek, Victoria, Australia. At this challenging site we examined half-hourly exchanges of the turbulent energy balance components between the surface and atmosphere over an 18-month period. Detailed estimates of the storage flux components were made, with emphasis on the biomass heat flux components. Near complete closure was attained for the site, with the best surface energy balance (SEB) closure occurring in summer and poorest in autumn, 0.96 and 0.84, respectively. The addition of storage fluxes significantly improved closure by 6–10%. Storage of heat within the vegetation and air column were found to be the two largest components of the total storage flux. The ‘ensemble block’ time averaging analysis, together with cospectral and Ogive analysis suggested that a 30-min averaging period was sufficient in capturing the majority of the turbulent fluxes, though an averaging period of 60-min may be more suitable for this site.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeddy covariance 3aautumn 3aenergy transfer 3aEucalyptus regnans 3amountains 3aair 3asummer 3aenergy balance 3aheat transfer 3aMacropodidae 3aforests 0aatmosphere1 aBeringer, Jason1 aHutley, Lindsay B.1 aHaverd, Vanessa1 aTapper, N.

Four isonitrogenous (51% crude protein) diets were formulated to contain 0 (control), 5, 10, or 15% Chlorella meal (CM) (designated as Con, CM5, CM10, and CM15, respectively) and fed to triplicate groups of fish (104.4 g) to apparent satiation twice daily for 8 wk. At the end of the feeding trial, significant enhancement (P < 0.05) in growth performance was obtained at over 10% CM compared to fish fed the control diet. No significant changes in dorsal muscle and liver proximate composition were found following CM administration. The groups fed CM‐containing diets revealed significantly lower plasma cholesterol concentration than those fed the control diet. Dietary CM affected antioxidant enzyme activity; significantly higher plasma catalase activity was found in fish fed ≥10% CM and total antioxidant capacity increased in CM5 and CM10 groups compared to the control. However, plasma glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were not significantly influenced by dietary CM. Also, significant enhancement in 1,1‐diphenyl‐2‐picryl‐hydrazyl radical scavenging activity was found in dorsal muscle of fish fed CM15 diet compared to the control. The findings in this study showed that dietary inclusion of 10–15% CM can enhance growth performance and affect antioxidant enzyme activity and lipid metabolism in olive flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3ablood chemistry 3abody composition 3acatalase 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3aenzyme activity 3aflounder 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3alipid metabolism 3aliver 3amuscles 3aproximate composition 3asatiety 3asuperoxide dismutase1 aLee, Sang‐Min1 aPark, Heum‐Gi1 aChoi, Jin0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.103-112dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02755naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012500169300001800294500001900312520144200331592002801773596004101801650001901842650001401861650002401875650001501899650002001914650001301934650003101947650000901978650002001987650001602007700006302023700006502086773012702151856008202278852000902360655001202369IND60685988720221117004204.0200312e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068598872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-020-04210-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaguire, Zachary10aRetreat but no surrender: net-spinning caddisfly (Hydropsychidae) silk has enduring effects on stream channel hydraulics  ap. 1539-1551.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAnimals and plants engineer their physical environment by building structures that create or modify habitat. Biotic effects on physical habitats can influence community composition, trophic dynamics, and ecosystem processes; however, the scales and mechanisms regulating the importance of biotic engineering effects are not well documented. We used a laboratory experiment with common and abundant silk net-spinning caddisflies (Trichoptera:Hydropsychidae) to investigate how biotic structures built in riverbeds influence fluid dynamics at micro spatial scales (1 cm) over 2 months. We made velocity measurements with acoustic doppler velocimetry around caddisfly silk structures to test how they influence flow velocity and whether these effects are maintained after the structure is abandoned. We found that caddisfly retreats reduced flow downstream by 85% and upstream by 17% compared to gravels without caddisfly retreats. We also found that experimentally abandoned caddisfly retreats could persist for at least 60 days, suggesting legacy effects of the structures. Although aquatic insects are rarely accounted for in hydrological models, our study suggests that small, but numerous caddisfly larvae could have substantial hydraulic effects. Future work could address variation in the magnitude and duration of biotic engineering among different silk-producing species, densities through space or time, and hydrologic regimes.  aPublisher supplied data  a1556684cNational Science Foundation 3aHydropsychidae 3aacoustics 3acommunity structure 3aecosystems 3afluid mechanics 3ahabitats 3alaboratory experimentation 3asilk 3astream channels 3avelocimetry1 aTumolo, Benjamin B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7605-93141 aAlbertson, Lindsey K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0270-63250 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Mar., v. 847, no. 6 p.1539-1551dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04210-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008200166300001600248520156500264592002801829650001301857650003501870650002801905650000901933650001301942650001001955650002401965650002601989650001802015650001302033650002302046650001002069700002102079700002302100700001702123773011002140856008102250852000902331655001202340IND60572617520221119160158.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057261752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-016-2561-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishimura, Kei10aGlucagon-like peptide-1 is co-localized with neurotensin in the chicken ileum  ap. 277-286.  aGlucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and neurotensin (NT) are distributed throughout the chicken ileum. Here, we attempt to determine if GLP-1 and NT co-localize in the chicken ileum by using immunofluorescence, immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization techniques. Three types of enteroendocrine cells, GLP-1⁺/NT⁺, GLP-1⁺/NT⁻ and GLP-1⁻/NT⁺ cells, were detected in the mucosal epithelium by the double immunofluorescence method. The ratio of GLP-1⁺/NT⁺ cells at the crypts in the distal ileum was significantly higher than that in the proximal ileum. The ratios of the three cell types were similar along the crypt–villous axis in the proximal ileum but the percentage of GLP-1⁺/NT⁺ cells significantly decreased at the middle part of villi relative to crypts and the bottom part of villi in the distal ileum. Enteroendocrine cells that were immunoreactive to both GLP-1 and NT peptides and showed both proglucagon and NT precursor mRNA signals were found in the crypts of the distal ileum but not in the villous epithelium. The results from performing an immunocytochemical method with colloidal gold indicated that the GLP-1 content within GLP-1⁺/NT⁺ cell secretory granules decreased stepwise from the crypt to the middle part of the villus but the NT content in these granules increased in this direction. These findings reveal that the cells producing both GLP-1 and NT are mainly localized in the crypts of the chicken ileum but these endocrine cells specialize in NT-producing cells at the villous epithelium of the distal ileum.  aPublisher supplied data 3achickens 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aglucagon-like peptide 1 3agold 3agranules 3aileum 3aimmunocytochemistry 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3apeptides 3asecretory granules 3avilli1 aHiramatsu, Kohzy1 aWatanabe, Takafumi1 aKita, Kazumi0 tCell and tissue research.g2017 May, v. 368, no. 2 p.277-286dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-016-2561-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02693naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012000168300001600288520102200304592002801326650003401354650001701388650002501405650001901430650002501449650001701474650001901491650001201510650002801522650001101550650004101561650003201602650001101634650001001645650001001655653002701665653001801692653002501710653001601735653002701751653001401778700001401792700002101806700001601827700002201843700002201865700002701887700001901914773011201933856008502045852000902130655001202139IND60573691820221119142951.0170724e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369182DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2017.13131782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavakoli, S.10aChemical composition and biological activities of the essential oils from different parts of Ferulago trifida Boiss  ap. 407-419.  aAs a result of GC and GC-MS analysis of the essential oils from different parts of Ferulago trifida Boiss., a total of thirty-three compounds were identified in the flowers (Fl), stems (S), leaves (L) and fruits (Fr) essential oils, of which (E)-β-ocimene (Fl: 37.3, S: 20.7, L: 25.7, Fr: 30.5%), α-pinene (Fl: 16.3, S: 22.6, L: 19.6, Fr: 18.0%) and bornyl acetate (Fl: 9.4, S: 8.5, L: 16.7, Fr: 11.0%) were main compounds.

Nov.  ap. 59-69.  aWe analyze the geographical and elevational ranges and the habitats of 30 species and two varieties of Lejeunea Lib. recorded from Malaysia. The greatest diversity of Lejeunea in Malaysia is found on Mt. Kinabalu with 27 species. The majority of the species are Malesian in distribution with a high number (8) belonging to the West Malesian element. Widely distributed species are often autoicous and produce spores freely; those with narrow distributions are more often dioicous and rarely produce spores. Dispersal of dioicous species seems to be promoted by asexual reproduction, being more common in wide-ranging dioicous species than in narrow-ranging ones. Endemism is 10% with three species being known only from Mt. Kinabalu. Range sizes of species decrease towards higher elevation and endemic species occur exclusively in the mountains. About half of the species occur in the lower montane rainforest belt, which is the elevational zone with the highest diversity of Lejeunea in Malaysia. The majority of the species are epiphytes, either corticolous or ramicolous. One species (L. dimorpha) is an obligate epiphyll. The new species Lejeunea tamaspocsii G. E.

As histidine kinases can function as inputs for a two‐component signaling system, we examined loss‐of‐function mutants involving two‐component signaling elements. We find that mutants of phosphotransfer proteins and type‐B response regulators exhibit a defect in their ethylene growth recovery response similar to that found with the loss‐of‐function ethylene receptor mutant etr1‐7. The ability of two‐component signaling elements to regulate the growth recovery response to ethylene functions independently from their well‐characterized role in cytokinin signaling, based on the analysis of cytokinin receptor mutants as well as following chemical inhibition of cytokinin biosynthesis. Histidine kinase activity of the receptor ETR1 also facilitates growth recovery in the ethylene hypersensitive response, which is characterized by a transient decrease in growth rate when seedlings are treated continuously with a low dose of ethylene; however, this response was found to operate independently of the type‐B response regulators. These results indicate that histidine kinase activity of the ethylene receptor ETR1 performs two independent functions: (a) regulating the growth recovery to ethylene through a two‐component signaling system involving phosphotransfer proteins and type‐B response regulators and (b) regulating the hypersensitive response to ethylene in a type‐B response regulator independent manner.  aPublisher supplied data  a#IOS‐1456487cNSF  a#MCB‐1716279cNSF  a#IOS‐1022053cNSF  a#LT000757/2009‐LcHuman Frontier Science Program  a# IBS‐R013‐D1cInstitute for Basic Science 3aArabidopsis 3abiosynthesis 3acytokinins 3aethylene 3ahistidine kinase 3ahypersensitive response 3aloss-of-function mutation 3amutants1 aKim, Hyo-jung,1 aMathews, Dennis E.1 aHutchison, Claire E.1 aKieber, Joseph J.1 aSchaller, G.

It was found that RMPC at 10 and 14% protein content was more UHT stable as compared to lower protein content RSMP (3.25, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8%). Matching the total solids and mineral composition of 7.5-RMPC with 7.5-RSMP by addition of minerals and lactose markedly reduced its UHT stability (UHT run-time reduced to 66 min from >120 min). The RP-HPLC analysis showed increased casein dissociation but similar whey protein aggregation in 7.5-RSMP as compared to 14-RMPC. UHT processing lead to formation of larger particles in case of 7.5-RSMP (1.84 μm D(0.9)) as compared to 14-RMPC (0.23 μm D(0.9)). It was observed that mineral environment affected protein interactions leading to the differences in UHT behavior of RSMP and RMPC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUHT treatment 3acasein 3adispersions 3adissociation 3afouling 3aheat 3alactose 3amilk protein concentrate 3amineral content 3aminerals 3aprotein content 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3atotal solids 3awhey protein 0aMilk powders 0aUltra high temperature processing 0aMilk proteins 0aFouling 0aMilk minerals1 aPrakash, Sangeeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1297-39481 aBhandari, Bhesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8800-62951 aBansal, Nidhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2266-61240 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Apr., v. 246 p.86-94dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006000142245016000202500001400362520140100376592002801777650001901805650001301824650001301837650002201850650001601872650001101888650001601899650001601915650002501931650001401956650001701970650001301987650001502000650001002015650001402025651001302039700002602052700002402078773010802102856007602210852000902286655001202295IND60723047420221120163408.0210111e20201228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072304742DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88377942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGashaw, Zigyalew1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6162-233510aCorrelation and Path Coefficient Analysis in Yield and Yield-Related Components of Black Cumin (Nigella Sativa L.) Accessions, at Jimma, Southwest Ethiopia  aNAL-light  aMany research works have been done on black cumin focusing on its nutritional and medicinal properties. But, there is inadequate information on the association of yield and yield-constituting traits of black cumin to improve its production. Therefore, correlation analysis was made on thirty-six black cumin accessions evaluated at Jimma in simple lattice design during 2016, to quantify the relationship between traits. The result of the analysis showed that seed yield ha⁻¹ had positive and highly significant correlation with number of effective capsules (0.88), secondary branches (0.73), plant height (0.72), total branches (0.71), steam thickness (0.58), primary branches (0.52), tertiary branches (0.52), harvesting index (0.47), and biological yield (0.43). Path coefficient analysis revealed that harvesting index, biological yield, and number of effective capsules exerted high and favorable direct contribution to seed yield at phenotypic level, whereas harvesting index, biological yield, primary and tertiary branches, number of effective capsules, and stem thickness showed positive direct effect at genotypic level. The favorable direct effects of these traits on grain yield indicate that keeping other variables constant, improvement of these traits will increase black cumin yield. Therefore, these traits should be kept in mind in the future breeding program of black cumin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNigella sativa 3aagronomy 3abranches 3abreeding programs 3acorrelation 3adesign 3agrain yield 3ainformation 3amedicinal properties 3aphenotype 3aplant height 3aresearch 3aseed yield 3asteam 3athickness 3aEthiopia1 aGebreselassie, Wosene1 aHailemichael, Girma0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2020 Dec. 28, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88377943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245012400166520151500290592002801805650001901833650001101852650001901863650001601882650002501898650001501923650002101938651001001959653002301969653002601992653002102018653002402039653002202063653002502085700001802110773011902128856008802247852000902335655001202344IND60761074620221118151943.0220222e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076107462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1525912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Gang10aAsymmetrical warming of growing/non-growing season increases soil respiration during growing season in an alpine meadow  aSoil respiration (Rₛ) is an important carbon flux in the global carbon cycle, and understanding the influence of global warming on Rₛ is critical for precise prediction future climate change. Actually, global warming is expected to be seasonally asymmetric, however, it is still unclear on the response of Rₛ to asymmetrical warming of growing/non-growing season in alpine regions. In this study, an experiment with asymmetrical warming of growing/non-growing season (including three treatments, CK: control; GLNG: warming magnitude of growing season lower than non-growing season; GHNG: warming magnitude of growing season higher than non-growing season) was performed in an alpine meadow of the Northern Tibet since June 2015. The ‘GLNG’ and ‘GHNG’ treatments increased mean Rₛ by 71.22% (1.89 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) and 34.32% (0.91 μmol CO₂ m⁻² s⁻¹) during growing season in 2019, respectively. However, the ‘GLNG’ and ‘GHNG’ treatments did not significantly affect mean Rₛ during growing season in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The variation coefficient of growing season mean Rₛ was 32.95% under the CK treatment in 2015–2019. Therefore, warming may have a lagging effect on Rₛ. The warming scene with a greater warming during non-growing season may have a stronger effect on Rₛ than the warming scene with a greater warming during growing season. Inter-annual variation of Rₛ may be greater than the warming effect on Rₛ in alpine meadows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine meadows 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aenvironment 3aglobal carbon budget 3aprediction 3asoil respiration 3aChina 0aAsymmetric warming 0aIncreased temperature 0aSoil respiration 0aAboveground biomass 0aAlpine grasslands 0aPhenological changes1 aShen, Zhen-Xi0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 812 p.152591-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1525913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02990naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012600163300001800289520148100307592002801788650002201816650003701838650001501875650000801890650001901898650001601917650001501933650002301948650001901971650002201990650001502012650002902027650003302056650001102089650002102100650003702121650003702158700001802195700001902213700001802232700001602250700002302266700001602289773010102305856008102406852000902487655001202496IND60556255320221120143925.0161031e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055625532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-016-0414-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Shanfu10aOne-step thermal synthesis of Ag-modified g-C3N4/N-doped TiO2 hybrids with enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity  ap. 1183-1193.  aA series of silver nanoparticle-modified graphitic carbon nitride/N-doped TiO₂ hybrids (Ag/g-C₃N₄/N-TiO₂ or ACTs) were prepared by one-step in situ calcination process at 550 °C for 3 h in air atmosphere. The morphology, structure, and optical properties of ACTs with different Ag contents were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectra, and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Ag nanoparticles with grain size of about 5 nm are anchored on the surface of ACTs. In UV–vis absorption test, a red-shift of light absorption edge and more visible light absorption (compared to N-TiO₂ and g-C₃N₄/N-TiO₂) are observed for ACTs. Moreover, the dependence of photocatalytic activity on Ag contents was investigated, and ACTs-3 presents the highest photocatalytic activity as the optimal Ag content under visible light irradiation. Remarkably enhanced UV–visible light photoelectrochemical response was also confirmed for ACTs compared with TiO₂, N-TiO₂, and g-C₃N₄/N-TiO₂. Ag-decorated g-C₃N₄/N-TiO₂ composites result in enhanced light absorption capacity and improved transfer of charge carriers, which prominently contribute to the improvement of photoactivity. This work demonstrates that Ag/g-C₃N₄/N-TiO₂ is a promising photocatalytic material for organic pollutant degradation under visible light irradiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3aair 3acarbon nitride 3airradiation 3ananosilver 3aoptical properties 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotoluminescence 3apollutants 3areflectance spectroscopy 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aSun, Mingxuan1 aKong, Yuanyuan1 aLiu, Fangchao1 aYu, Zhishui1 aAnandan, Sambandam1 aChang, Chun0 tJournal of materials science.g2017 Jan., v. 52, no. 2 p.1183-1193dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-016-0414-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001100140245012000151300001600271500002000287520162200307592002801929650003201957650002501989650001702014650001502031650001502046650001002061650001602071650001402087650001102101650002402112650001502136700001602151700001502167700001402182700001502196773013302211856007402344852000902418655001202427IND60572002720221122052819.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057200272DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.123462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Li14aThe Effect of Bilateral Eyestalk Ablation on Signal Transduction Pathways of Ion Regulation of Litopenaeus vannamei  ap. 145-155.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA study was performed on the effects of bilateral eyestalk ablation on signal transduction pathways of ion regulation of Litopenaeus vannamei. The study included three treatments (starvation group, bilateral eyestalk ablation, and starvation and bilateral eyestalk ablation) in addition to a control group. The shrimp were sampled at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h. Results showed that the ablation of bilateral eyestalk had significant effects on the contents of three kinds of biogenic amines (BAs), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), and the activities of three kinds of ion‐transport enzymes (P < 0.05). According to these results, bilateral eyestalk ablation had significant effects on the ion signal pathway of L. vannamei. The same changes were observed in 5‐hydroxytryptamine (5‐HT) contents, Na⁺‐K⁺‐ATPase, and HCO₃ ⁻‐ATPase activities, suggesting that crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) regulated the changes in ion‐transport enzymes, mediated by BAs and cGMP. The specific pathways may be 5‐HT → cGMP → Na⁺‐K⁺‐ATPase, HCO₃ ⁻‐ATPase, and BAs → cGMP → V‐ATPase. 5‐HT contents, Na⁺‐K⁺‐ATPase, and HCO₃ ⁻‐ATPase activities in the starvation group were ultimately higher than those in the bilateral eyestalk ablation group, while the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) contents increased slightly. Study results suggested that under the situation of bilateral eyestalk ablation, the shrimp could also use feed or its metabolites to increase 5‐HT or cAMP contents to regulate the Na⁺‐K⁺‐ATPase and HCO₃ ⁻‐ATPase activities in gills.  aPublisher supplied data 3aH-transporting ATP synthase 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3abicarbonates 3acyclic AMP 3acyclic GMP 3agills 3ametabolites 3aserotonin 3ashrimp 3asignal transduction 3astarvation1 aPan, Luqing1 aHu, Dongxu1 aLiu, Dong1 aLiu, Maoqi0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.145-155dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012500204300001800329500001900347520131100366592002801677596013801705596005501843596004901898650001801947650002201965650002001987650001002007650000902017650001202026650001502038650001302053650001302066650001602079650001402095650000902109650002202118650001602140700002202156700002002178700001902198700002002217700001902237700001802256700002002274700002002294700001802314773012702332856008202459852000902541655001202550IND60685989020221117004300.0200312e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068598902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-020-04198-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŽák, Jakub1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2845-832310aSexual segregation in European cyprinids: consequence of response to predation risk influenced by sexual size dimorphism  ap. 1439-1451.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFish respond to predation threat by size/cohort-dependent presence in particular habitats and this may contribute to sexual segregation between habitats in species with sexual size dimorphism (SSD). The present study examines the validity of the “predation risk hypothesis” and importance of SSD on habitat (pelagic/inshore) segregation and dietary differences between sexes in three cyprinids with various magnitudes of SSD-roach (Rutilus rutilus), freshwater bream (Abramis brama) and bleak (Alburnus alburnus). Fish were sampled using gillnets over five consecutive years in the Římov Reservoir. Habitat segregation with female overrepresentation in the pelagic habitat was found in the most sexually dimorphic species with 26% bigger females—the roach. When analysis of habitat segregation was size-controlled, this segregation ceased to confirm the importance of SSD. Freshwater bream sexes (2% SSD) differed in diet but did not differ in habitat occupation. Bleak sexes were not segregated. Larger roach individuals (predominantly females) are less threatened by gape-limited predators and consequently they can occupy the risky but optimal (for zooplankton acquisition) pelagic habitat. Our results demonstrate that habitat segregation is present in the species with the most pronounced SSD.  aPublisher supplied data  a(No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16_025/0007417)cERDF/ESF project Biomanipulation as a tool for improving the water quality of dam reservoirs  aP505-12-P647cGrantová Agentura České Republiky  aSVV 260 434/2020cUniverzita Karlova v Praze 3aAbramis brama 3aAlburnus alburnus 3aRutilus rutilus 3abream 3adiet 3afemales 3afreshwater 3agillnets 3ahabitats 3aoccupations 3apredation 3arisk 3asexual dimorphism 3azooplankton1 aPrchalová, Marie1 aŠmejkal, Marek1 aBlabolil, Petr1 aVašek, Mojmír1 aMatěna, Josef1 aŘíha, Milan1 aPeterka, Jiří1 aSeďa, Jaromír1 aKubečka, Jan0 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Mar., v. 847, no. 6 p.1439-1451dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04198-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003100164245006500195300001600260520091500276592002801191650003001219650002101249650001801270650001101288650001801299650001101317650001601328650001101344650001201355650004901367650001101416650003201427650002601459650000901485650002401494650000901518650001601527650004601543651001101589651002601600700002001626773011401646856004801760852000901808655001201817IND4476325520221118040412.0121003e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447632552DNAL7 a213697292pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-011-0419-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoelho, Micheline S.

We used a negative binomial model that considers hospital daily admissions due to leptospirosis as the dependent variable, and the climatic variables of daily precipitation pattern, and maximum and minimum temperature as independent variables. We calculated the monthly leptospirosis admission probabilities from the precipitation and maximum temperature variables. The month of February showed the highest probability, although values were also high during the spring months. The month of February also showed the highest number of hospital admissions. Another interesting result is that, for every 20 mm precipitation, there was an average increase of 31.5% in hospital admissions. Additionally, the relative risk of leptospirosis varied from 1.1 to 2.0 when the precipitation varied from 20 to 140 mm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aclimatic factors 3aleptospirosis 3amodels 3arelative risk 3aspring 3atemperature 2aCities 2aClimate 2aHospitalizationxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aLeptospirosisxepidemiology 2aMultivariate Analysis 2aRain 2aRegression Analysis 2aRisk 2aTemperature 2aUrban Healthxstatistics & numerical data 3aBrazil 0aBrazilxepidemiology.1 aMassad, Eduardo0 tInternational journal of biometeorology.g2012 Mar., v. 56, no. 2 p.233-241dSpringer-Verlagx0020-71287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-011-0419-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245009200156300001800248500001900266500002000285520138700305592002801692596006501720596006501785596005901850650001601909650001101925650002201936650001601958650001601974650000901990650001201999650001702011650002602028700001302054700005502067773012902122856007302251852000902324655001202333IND60734756720221119065339.0210422e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073475672DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.140002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Yuerong10aFIT and bHLH Ib transcription factors modulate iron and copper crosstalk in Arabidopsis  ap. 1679-1691.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAlthough the crosstalk between iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) homeostasis signalling networks exists in plants, the underlined molecular mechanism remains unclear. FIT (FER‐LIKE IRON DEFICIENCY‐INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR) and four bHLH Ib members (bHLH38, bHLH39, bHLH100 and bHLH101) are the key regulators of Fe homeostasis. Here, we reveal that FIT and bHLH Ib control the up‐regulation of Cu‐uptake genes (COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5) by Fe deficiency, and Cu is required for improving plant growth under Fe‐deficiency conditions. The induction of Cu‐uptake gene expression and the elevation of Cu concentration are inhibited in the fit‐2 or bhlh4x (the quadruple mutant of four bHLH Ib genes) under Fe‐deficiency conditions. The dual overexpression of both bHLH38 (or bHLH39) and FIT activates the expression of COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5 and increases Cu accumulation. Furthermore, bHLH Ib proteins directly bind to the promoters of COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5. Either Cu supplement or overexpression of COPT2 or FRO4 improves the growth of fit‐2 under Fe‐deficiency conditions. Moreover, the induction of COPT2, FRO4 and FRO5 by Fe deficiency is independent of SPL7, a central regulator of Cu‐deficiency responses. This work through the link between bHLH Ib/FIT and COPT2/FRO4/FRO5 under Fe‐deficiency conditions establishes a new relationship between Cu and Fe homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018FA011cApplied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province  a2019FB028cApplied Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province  a31770270cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArabidopsis 3acopper 3acopper deficiency 3aenvironment 3ahomeostasis 3airon 3amutants 3aplant growth 3atranscription factors1 aLi, Yang1 aLiang, Gang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0622-40430 tPlant, cell and environment.g2021 May, v. 44, no. 5 p.1679-1691dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl11406x0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.140003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245016800171300001600339520096200355592002801317650003401345650004001379650002501419650002501444650001701469650002901486650001401515650001901529650001201548650002801560650000901588650001201597650003301609650001001642650002301652650001101675653003301686653002501719653003301744653002501777653002801802700002001830700002901850773011201879856008501991852000902076655001202085IND60573692120221119143037.0170724e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369212DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2017.13220092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahraoui, Naima10aEffects of microwave heating on the antioxidant and insecticidal activities of essential oil of Origanum glandulosum Desf. obtained by microwave steam distillation  ap. 420-429.  aResponse surface methodology (RSM) was used for the first time to investigate the efficiency of a new process developed in our laboratory: Microwaves Steam Distillation (MSD) on the oregano essential oil extraction. The selected parameters are steam flow, microwave power and extraction time, the response is essential oil yield. According to the statistical method, a second-order polynomial function was assumed to approximate the yield. The coefficient of determination R2 (91.33%), revealed a quite agreement between experimental and predictive values. Optimal conditions were: 6 g. min-1 for steam flow, 300 W for microwave power and 8 min for time. DPPH tests showed that MSD oil was the most efficient than eugenol, SD oil and the main compounds (carvacrol and thymol), and has comparable antioxidant activity to that of BHT. In the other hand, MSD and SD oils have an insecticidal effect against Rhizopertha dominica , but SD oil was most efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aOriganum vulgare subsp. glandulosum 3aRhyzopertha dominica 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3acarvacrol 3aessential oils 3aeugenol 3ainsecticidal properties 3aoils 3aoregano 3aresponse surface methodology 3asteam 3asteam distillation 3athymol 0aMicrowave steam distillation 0aOriganum glandulosum 0aresponse surface methodology 0aantioxidant activity 0ainsecticidal properties1 aHazzit, Mohamed1 aBoutekedjiret, Chahrazed0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 29, no. 5 p.420-429dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2017.13220093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014600171300001400317520103100331592002801362650002401390650002301414650003801437650001901475650001601494650002201510650002501532650001701557650001501574650001501589650001301604650001201617650001701629650001601646653001801662653001501680653003201695653002201727653002301749700001401772700002201786700002201808700001701830700001501847773010401862856008701966852000902053655001202062IND60536668520221122043629.0190409e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053666852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiaofeng10aValorisation of mixed bakery waste in non-sterilized fermentation for l-lactic acid production by an evolved Thermoanaerobacterium sp. strain  ap. 47-54.  aIn this study, an advanced biorefinery technology that uses mixed bakery waste has been developed to produce l-lactic acid using an adaptively evolved Thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense LA1002-G40 in a non-sterilized system. Under these conditions, mixed bakery waste was directly hydrolysed by Aspergillus awamori and Aspergillus oryzae, resulting in a nutrient-rich hydrolysate containing 83.6g/L glucose, 9.5g/L fructose and 612mg/L free amino nitrogen. T. aotearoense LA1002-G40 was evaluated and then adaptively evolved to grow in this nutrient-rich hydrolysate. Using a 5-L fermenter, the overall lactic acid production from mixed bakery waste was 0.18g/g with a titer, productivity and yield of 78.5g/L, 1.63g/L/h and 0.85g/g, respectively. This is an innovative procedure involving a complete bioconversion process for l-lactic acid produced from mixed bakery waste under non-sterilized conditions. The proposed process could be potentially applied to turn food waste into l-lactic acid in an economically feasible way.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus awamori 3aAspergillus oryzae 3aThermoanaerobacterium aotearoense 3aamino nitrogen 3abiorefining 3abiotransformation 3aeconomic feasibility 3afermentation 3afermenters 3afood waste 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahydrolysates 3alactic acid 0al-lactic acid 0aFood waste 0aNon-sterilized fermentation 0aFungal hydrolysis 0aAdaptive evolution1 aZhu, Muzi1 aHuang, Xiongliang1 aLin, Carol Sze Ki1 aWang, Jufang1 aLi, Shuang0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Dec., v. 198 p.47-54dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02399naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245013100155500002000286520106500306592002801371650002001399650002201419650002701441650002501468650001801493650001401511650002201525650001301547650001501560650001801575650002701593700001901620700001901639700001701658700002001675700001601695700001801711700002201729773010801751856007201859961001301931852000901944655001201953IND60790641820221119182644.0220826e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079064182DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRyder, Nathan10aTranscriptome assembly and annotation of johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense) rhizomes identify candidate rhizome‐specific genes  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRhizomes facilitate the wintering and vegetative propagation of many perennial grasses. Sorghum halepense (johnsongrass) is an aggressive perennial grass that relies on a robust rhizome system to persist through winters and reproduce asexually from its rootstock nodes. This study aimed to sequence and assemble expressed transcripts within the johnsongrass rhizome. A de novo transcriptome assembly was generated from a single johnsongrass rhizome meristem tissue sample. A total of 141,176 probable protein‐coding sequences from the assembly were identified and assigned gene ontology terms using Blast2GO. Estimated expression analysis and BLAST results were used to reduce the assembly to 64,447 high‐confidence sequences. The johnsongrass assembly was compared to Sorghum bicolor, a related nonrhizomatous species, along with an assembly of similar rhizome tissue from the perennial grain crop Thinopyrum intermedium. The presence/absence analysis yielded a set of 98 expressed johnsongrass contigs that are likely associated with rhizome development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aSorghum halepense 3aThinopyrum intermedium 3aasexual reproduction 3agene ontology 3ameristems 3aperennial grasses 3arhizomes 3arootstocks 3atranscriptome 3avegetative propagation1 aDorn, Kevin M.1 aHuitsing, Mark1 aAdams, Micah1 aPloegstra, Jeff1 aDeHaan, Lee1 aLarson, Steve1 aTintle, Nathan L.0 tPlant direct.g2018 June, v. 2, no. 6 p.e00065-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.653Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02677naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002800151245012100179300001600300520101900316592002801335650002701363650001201390650001801402650002201420650002501442650001701467650001701484650002201501650001901523650001301542650001301555650001301568650001601581650001101597653001701608653002501625653002401650653000801674653001401682653001901696653001501715700001801730700002501748700003101773700002001804700001701824700001801841700002301859700002301882773011201905856008502017852000902102655001202111IND60573692220221119142923.0170724e20170903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369222DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.2017.13318682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlu’datt, Muhammad H.10aOptimization, characterization and biological properties of phenolic compounds extracted from Rosmarinus officinalis  ap. 375-384.  aThis study evaluated the optimal conditions for the extraction of phenolics from Rosmarinus officinalis.

The results revealed that the optimum conditions for maximum phenolic content extraction and antioxidant activity were achieved using a mixture of methanol and water at 60 °C/1 h. However, the optimal extraction conditions for phenolics with the highest hypertensive (ACE) or diabetic (α-amylase and α-glucosidase) enzyme inhibitory activity were observed using a mixture of acetone and water for extraction at 40 °C/6 h or methanol at 50 °C/8 h, respectively. The results indicated that the free and bound phenolic compounds had antioxidant, antihypertensive and antidiabetic properties. The predominant free phenolic compound identified in rosemary was thymol, while chlorogenic and caffeic acids were the predominant bound phenolic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aacetone 3aalpha-amylase 3aalpha-glucosidase 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acaffeic acid 3aenzyme inhibition 3aessential oils 3amethanol 3arosemary 3asolvents 3atemperature 3athymol 0aOptimization 0aantioxidant activity 0ainhibitory activity 0aACE 0aphenolics 0aα-glucosidase 0aα-amylase1 aRababah, Taha1 aAlhamad, Mohammad N.1 aAl-Ghzawi, Abdul Latief A.1 aEreifej, Khalil1 aGammoh, Sana1 aAlmajwal, Ali1 aHussein, Neveen M.1 aRaweshadeh, Mervat0 tJournal of essential oil research.g2017 Sept. 3, v. 29, no. 5 p.375-384dTaylor & Francisx2163-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10412905.2017.13318683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012500154520131200279592002801591650001701619650001001636650002001646650001101666650002601677650002101703650001101724650001001735650002401745650000901769650001601778650002101794650002001815651001001835700002101845700001401866773011801880856007301998852000902071655001202080IND60653351020221119070033.0190714e20180525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065335102DNAL7 a10.3390/w100606842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hang13aAn Interval Quadratic Fuzzy Dependent-Chance Programming Model for Optimal Irrigation Water Allocation under Uncertainty  aIn this study, an interval quadratic fuzzy dependent-chance programming (IQFDCP) model is proposed for irrigation water management under uncertainty. This model can deal with the interval and fuzzy uncertainties encountered in optimal irrigation water resources allocation problems. It takes optimal credibility level of system revenue as the objective function for addressing the conflict between maximum system revenue and the credibility level of the system revenue. By providing three scenarios of precipitation, the optimal solutions are obtained. The developed model is applied to a case study for irrigation water allocation in Minqin Oasis, Wuwei city, northwest China. This study can help determine how much irrigation water should be allocated to different crops under the maximum credibility level of the system revenue. The optimal solutions can provide a certain credibility level of system revenue corresponding to different scenarios and mitigate the system-failure risk level of water shortages in arid areas. Moreover, because the IQFDCP can objectively reflect the interrelationship among crop irrigation water amount, system revenue, and system-failure risk level, the results are able to provide advices to decision makers for efficiently managing water resources in different scenarios.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acrops 3adecision making 3aincome 3airrigation management 3airrigation water 3amodels 3aoases 3aresource allocation 3arisk 3auncertainty 3awater allocation 3awater shortages 3aChina1 aZhang, Chenglong1 aGuo, Ping0 tWater.g2018 May 25, v. 10, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100606843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245008300168300001600251520107300267592002801340650002201368650001901390650002901409650001901438650001801457650001701475650001701492650001601509650001801525650000701543650001901550653002601569653002201595653001701617653002201634700001201656700001701668700001601685700001801701773010601719856008701825852000901912655001201921IND60536668620221122043540.0190409e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053666862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMu, Dashuai10aRemoving Bacillus subtilis from fermentation broth using alumina nanoparticles  ap. 508-511.  aIn this study, an efficient separation technology using Al2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) was developed for removing Bacillus subtilis from fermentation broth. The dosage of alumina nanoparticles used for separating B. subtilis increased during the culture process and remained stable in the stationary phase of the culture process. The pH of the culture-broth was also investigated for its effects on flocculation efficiency, and showed an acidic pH could enhance the flocculation efficiency. The attachment mechanisms of Al2O3 NPs to the B. subtilis surface were investigated, and the zeta potential analysis showed that Al2O3 NPs could attach to B. subtilis via electrostatic attachment. Finally, the metabolite content and the antibacterial effect of the fermentation supernatants were detected and did not significantly differ between alumina nanoparticle separation and centrifugation separation. Together, these results indicate a great potential for a highly efficient and economical method for removing B. subtilis from fermentation broth using alumina nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus subtilis 3aaluminum oxide 3aantibacterial properties 3acentrifugation 3aculture media 3afermentation 3aflocculation 3ametabolites 3ananoparticles 3apH 3azeta potential 0aAlumina nanoparticles 0aBacillus subtilis 0aFlocculation 0aRemoving bacteria1 aMu, Xin1 aXu, Zhenxing1 aDu, Zongjun1 aChen, Guanjun0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Dec., v. 197 p.508-511dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245014000157300001600297520117400313592002801487650002101515650001701536650002001553650002501573650001501598650001001613650001101623650001401634650001401648651001001662700001901672700001701691700001901708773010501727856007101832852000901903655001201912IND60137837420221121212333.0150524e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013783742DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.38672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHashimoto, Maki10aCharacterisation of heteroplasmic status at codon 143 of the Botrytis cinerea cytochrome b gene in a semi‐quantitative AS‐PCR assay  ap. 467-477.  aBACKGROUND: An in‐depth understanding of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI)‐fungicide‐resistant Botrytis cinerea isolates in a vineyard is expected to contribute to the development of an optimum disease management programme for the control of grape grey mould. RESULTS: The resistance and structure of the cytochrome b gene in B. cinerea collected from a Japanese vineyard were characterised. The semi‐quantitative allele‐specific primer–polymerase chain reaction (AS‐PCR) assay developed in the present study was able to distinguish heteroplasmic status from homoplasmic status at codon 143 of the cytochrome b gene in QoI‐fungicide‐resistant B. cinerea from vineyards in Japan. With this assay it was demonstrated that the repeated introduction of QoI fungicide selection pressure increased the ratio of G143A‐mutated cytochrome b genes in B. cinerea isolates. CONCLUSION: It is proposed that the semi‐quantitative AS‐PCR assay is a reliable tool for the detection of QoI fungicide resistance and the evaluation of homoplasmic/heteroplasmic status at codon 143 of the cytochrome b gene in B. cinerea isolates. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3acytochrome b 3adisease control 3afungicide resistance 3afungicides 3agenes 3agrapes 3agray mold 3avineyards 3aJapan1 aAoki, Yoshinao1 aSaito, Seiya1 aSuzuki, Shunji0 tPest management science.g2015 Mar., v. 71, no. 3 p.467-477dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.38673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02515naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245012600172300001600298520095300314592002801267650002801295650002101323650001701344650002501361650001701386650001601403650001801419650002201437650000901459650001701468650001801485650001901503650002101522650001201543650001101555650002101566653003301587653002901620653001101649653002201660653001701682700005901699700005601758773011101814856008701925852000902012655001202021IND60622836120221122084146.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Yongguang10aNanoencapsulation of caffeic acid phenethyl ester in sucrose fatty acid esters to improve activities against cancer cells  ap. 125-133.  aCaffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a natural compound with anticancer activities but has low water solubility. In this work, sucrose fatty acid ester (SFAE) was used to nanoencapsulate CAPE in aqueous propylene glycol (PG) with a temperature-cycle method by heating at 90 °C for 20 min and cooling to 21 °C, followed by additional heating at 90 °C for 5 min and cooling to 21 °C. A higher amount of PG facilitated encapsulation with up to 0.1%w/w CAPE in 1.0% w/w SFAE. Additional 0.3%w/w thymol further improved the CAPE loading capability to 0.15%w/w to form nanoparticles smaller than 100 nm and stable in 30 days at 21 °C. Nanoencapsulation enhanced cytotoxicity of CAPE against colon cancer HCT-116 and breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and thymol additionally enhanced the cytotoxicity of CAPE dispersions. This work provides a new approach to nanoencapsulate CAPE in stable aqueous dispersions with improved cytotoxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic activity 3abreast neoplasms 3acaffeic acid 3acolorectal neoplasms 3acytotoxicity 3adispersions 3aencapsulation 3afatty acid esters 3aheat 3ananocapsules 3ananoparticles 3aneoplasm cells 3apropylene glycol 3asucrose 3athymol 3awater solubility 0aCaffeic acid phenethyl ester 0aSucrose fatty acid ester 0aThymol 0aNanoencapsulation 0aCytotoxicity1 aChen, Huaiqiong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3722-53991 aZhong, Qixin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6071-342X0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Apr., v. 246 p.125-133dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03395naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245009600203500001400299520194700313592002802260650002402288650001302312650000902325650001002334650001102344650002402355650001202379650001602391650001602407650001102423650001302434650001702447650001302464650002502477650001702502650000902519650001002528651001002538700002602548700002302574700006202597700002702659700002202686773010802708856007602816852000902892655001202901IND60723047820221120152252.0210111e20201229xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072304782DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88630992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoampong, Richard1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0842-195610aGrowth and Yield of Taro (Colocasia esculenta (L) Schott.) as Affected by Planting Distance  aNAL-light  aTaro, Colocasia esculenta (L) Schott., is a staple food for many people in Africa. Despite the numerous importance of the crop, it still remains an underutilized crop in Ghana with little information on many aspects of the crop, especially agronomic practices. This experiment was conducted to identify the effect of planting distance on growth and yield of two promising taro accessions. The experiment was laid out using the split-plot design arranged in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replications in which accessions (BL/SM/80 and BL/SM/16) were used as main plots and three planting distances (1 m × 1 m, 1 m × 0.75 m, and 1 m × 0.5 m) as subplots. Data were recorded on the 4ᵗʰ, 8ᵗʰ, 12ᵗʰ, 16ᵗʰ, 20ᵗʰ, 24ᵗʰ, and 28ᵗʰ week after planting (WAP) for growth parameters while yield data were taken at harvest. The results indicated that plant height (63.4 cm), petiole length (44.0 cm), number of leaves (4.7), leaf length (31.7 cm), and width (20.5 cm) were significantly (P≤0.05) higher in closely spaced plants than widely spaced plants at 4 WAP and 8 WAP for petiole length (70.3 cm) and in the 28ᵗʰ WAP where there was an accession effect on leaf length and number of suckers/plant. The highest corm yield/plant (0.63 kg) and total corm yield/ha (11.7 t/ha) in both accessions were achieved by the medium plant spacing (1 m × 0.75 m) and lower plant spacing (1 m × 0.5 m), respectively. Accession BS/SM/80 recorded the highest total yield/ha of 13.0 t/ha for 1 m × 0.5 m plant spacing. The higher number of suckers (8.1) was recorded by higher spaced plants. From the study, it was seen that growth parameters correlated significantly and positively with yield. It is therefore recommended that farmers in the area and those in similar production areas use a spacing of 1 m × 0.5 m for optimum growth and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColocasia esculenta 3aagronomy 3aarea 3acorms 3adesign 3aexperimental design 3afarmers 3ainformation 3aleaf length 3alength 3apetioles 3aplant height 3aplanting 3aspatial distribution 3astaple foods 3ataro 3awidth 3aGhana1 aBoateng, Samuel Kwasi1 aAdu Amoah, Richard1 aAdu Gyamfi, Bright1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0667-70421 aAboagye, Lawrence Misa1 aAnsah, Eric Osafo0 tInternational journal of agronomy.g2020 Dec. 29, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:J000000090x1687-81677nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88630993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245011100172300001600283520106800299592002801367650002901395650001901424650002301443650002201466650002401488650001901512650002201531653002901553653002201582653001601604653001001620700001501630700001801645773010601663856008701769852000901856655001201865IND60536668720221122043608.0190409e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053666872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Qing-Qing10aEnhanced biohydrogen production from sugarcane bagasse by Clostridium thermocellum supplemented with CaCO3  ap. 422-428.  aClostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 was used to degrade sugarcane bagasse (SCB) directly for hydrogen production, which was significantly enhanced by supplementing medium with CaCO3.

Under the optimal CaCO3 concentration of 20mM, the hydrogen production reached 97.83±5.19mmol/L from 2% sodium hydroxide-pretreated SCB, a 116.72% increase over the control (45.14±1.03mmol/L), and the yield of hydrogen production reached 4.89mmol H2/g SCBadded. Additionally, CaCO3 promoted the biodegradation of SCB and the growth of C. thermocellum. The stimulatory effects of CaCO3 on biohydrogen production are mainly attributed to the buffering capacity of carbonate. The study provides a novel strategy to enhance biohydrogen production from lignocellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClostridium thermocellum 3abiodegradation 3abuffering capacity 3acalcium carbonate 3ahydrogen production 3alignocellulose 3asugarcane bagasse 0aClostridium thermocellum 0aSugarcane bagasse 0aBiohydrogen 0aCaCO31 aLiang, Lei1 aZhu, Ming-Jun0 tBioresource technology.g2015 Dec., v. 197 p.422-428dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.08.1113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02733naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245012500174300001800299500001900317520128400336592002801620596007601648596003001724596002201754596001801776650001201794650001001806650001601816650002901832650001401861650001501875650001801890650001101908650001201919650001801931651001401949700003201963700002201995700002102017700001902038773012702057856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60685989420221117004156.0200312e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068598942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-020-04201-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodríguez, Patricia,10aBeaver dam effect on phytoplankton and periphyton composition and hydrology in streams from Tierra del Fuego (Argentina)  ap. 1461-1477.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThere is practically no stream or river without non-native beaver impact, past or current, in Tierra del Fuego (TDF), Argentina. In this study, we evaluated the effect of beaver activity on water quality and algal composition in forested streams and rivers from TDF. We sampled five streams and rivers with current beaver activity during the austral summers of 2016 and 2017. Also, three streams which have had beaver activity in the past but with no activity since several years ago (ca. 10 years) were included in the study. Sampling was performed in a paired design upstream and downstream the beaver dam or the site where it used to be located. Physical and chemical variables as well as phytoplankton and epilithon chlorophyll-a and algal composition were monitored. Results show a decrease in dissolved organic carbon concentration and an increase in both phytoplankton abundance and periphyton taxa richness downstream the dam. The diatom Hannaea arcus was present in both communities only in impacted sites, thus influencing the clustering. In this study, we show that beaver activity influences periphyton richness and composition, and phytoplankton abundance in impacted streams and rivers, though it exerted a minor influence on water physical and chemical variables.  aPublisher supplied data  aPICT 2015 1152cFondo para la Investigación Científica y Tecnológica  aPIDUNTdF 2016-2018cUNTdF  aPUE 2016cConicet  aGEF 4768cFAO 3aHannaea 3aalgae 3achlorophyll 3adissolved organic carbon 3ahydrology 3aperiphyton 3aphytoplankton 3arivers 3astreams 3awater quality 3aArgentina1 aGonzález Garraza, Gabriela1 aGarcía, Victoria1 aGranitto, María1 aEscobar, Julio0 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Mar., v. 847, no. 6 p.1461-1477dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04201-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02725naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245013500161300001400296500002000310520134200330592002801672650002501700650001201725650002401737650003001761650001901791650002301810650001501833650002501848650001701873650002201890650001701912650001601929650001301945650002201958651001901980700002201999700002102021700002302042773013102065856007402196852000902270655001202279IND60572003220221120074535.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057200322DNAL7 a10.1111/jwas.123332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarden, Tanya L.10aForecasting the Genetic Impacts of Net Pen Failures on Gulf of Mexico Cobia Populations Using Individual‐based Model Simulations  ap. 20-34.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOffshore net pen fish farming provides a cost‐efficient means for production of marine finfish, and there is great interest in development of net pen operations in domestic waters. However, there are concerns over the possible genetic and ecological impacts that escaped fish may have on wild populations. We used individual‐based simulations, with parameter values informed by life history and genetic data, to investigate the short‐term (50 yr) impacts of net pen failures on the genetic composition of cobia, Rachycentron canadum, stocks in the Gulf of Mexico. Higher net pen failure rates resulted in greater genetic impacts on the wild population. Additionally, the use of more genetically differentiated source populations led to larger influxes of non‐native alleles and greater temporal genetic change in the population as a result of net pen failure. Our results highlight the importance of considering the appropriate source population for broodstock collection in net pen aquaculture systems and help to provide a general set of best management practices for broodstock selection and maintenance in net pen aquaculture operations. A thorough understanding of the genetic diversity, stock structure, and population demography of target species is important to determine the impact escapees can have on wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRachycentron canadum 3aalleles 3aaquaculture systems 3abest management practices 3abreeding stock 3acost effectiveness 3ademography 3aenvironmental impact 3afish culture 3agenetic variation 3alife history 3amarine fish 3anet pens 3asimulation models 3aGulf of Mexico1 aRobinson, John D.1 aStrand, Allan E.1 aDenson, Michael R.0 tJournal of the World Aquaculture Society.g2017 Feb., v. 48, no. 1 p.20-34dWiley Subscription Services, Inc.x0893-88497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jwas.123333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005900152245015800211300001600369520172400385592002802109650002202137650001202159650002002171650002002191650003802211650002002249650002602269650001602295650001202311650002102323653002002344653002402364653003502388653002002423653002002443700001902463700001602482700005702498700002102555773011102576856008702687852000902774655001202783IND60622836220221122084121.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTavernier, Iris1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9109-407010aEffect of high cooling and shear rate on the microstructural development of hybrid systems containing diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols of palm origin  ap. 141-152.  aThis research explores the potential of diacylglycerol (DAG) and triacylglycerol (TAG) combinations in shortenings. An alternative formulation of a fat blend alters the crystallization behavior, which was investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. DSC experiments demonstrated that by replacing TAGs with DAGs, crystallization had an earlier onset. However, the lower concentrations of TAGs require more undercooling to fully crystallize, which resulted in more crystallization events during the isothermal step for samples with a higher DAG and lower TAG concentration. A higher DAG concentration also resulted in a more dominant presence of the β polymorphic form. As both DAG and TAG structuring are based on crystal network formation, processing conditions (cooling and shear) will play an important role. Considering processing is essential to understand the behavior of newly formulated fats on an industrial processing line. Samples were prepared both statically, without shear or rapid cooling, and dynamically, under high shear and fast cooling using a bench-top scraped surface heat exchanger. Dynamically crystallized samples containing DAGs were more brittle than samples without DAGs, which can be related to the slower crystallization kinetics of lower TAG concentrations at higher DAG concentrations. The final textural properties of the statically crystallized samples could not predict the properties of the dynamic values. As such, it was demonstrated that preparing crystalline samples using processing conditions similar to those used in an industrial setting is essential to assess applicability of alternatively structured crystalline fat phases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acooling 3acrystallization 3adiacylglycerols 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aheat exchangers 3aprocessing technology 3ashortenings 3atexture 3atriacylglycerols 0aDiacylglycerols 0aFat crystallization 0aScraped surface heat exchanger 0aSynchrotron XRD 0aStop and return1 aNorton, Ian T.1 aRimaux, Tom1 aLazidis, Aris1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6511-236X1 aDewettinck, Koen0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Apr., v. 246 p.141-152dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011200175300001800287500001900305520137200324592002801696596007401724650001501798650001101813650001101824650001201835650002401847650002101871650001001892650000701902650001801909650002101927650001101948650001601959650001601975700006601991773012702057856008202184852000902266655001202275IND60685989520221117005226.0200312e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068598952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-020-04207-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfonina, Ekaterina Yu.10aFluctuations in plankton community structure of endorheic soda lakes of southeastern Transbaikalia (Russia)  ap. 1383-1398.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of present research is to study the patterns of phyto- and zooplankton fluctuations in endorheic soda lakes (Uldz Gol-Torey Basin, southeastern Transbaikalia, Russia) under arid conditions because studied area is becoming increasingly arid. Plankton samples were collected in summer during time intervals with different lake water levels using standard hydrobiological methods. We detected four patterns of change in plankton communities with changing environmental conditions (increasing total dissolved solid, pH and temperature, and decreasing depth). The first pattern is characterized by a predominance of green algae, charophytes, diatoms and euglenophytes; the species composition and dominant zooplankton assemblage are the same in different years. The second pattern is characterized by a loss of cryptophyte and chrysophyte algae, a dominance of green and blue-green algae, a decrease in zooplankton species diversity, and an increased abundance of zooplankton, the dominant species are consistent over time. The third pattern exhibits marked decreases in phytoplankton diversity and density, a dominance of green algae and diatoms, a further decrease in the species richness of zooplankton, and increased abundance and biomass of some species. The fourth pattern is a marked by a reduction in plankton species diversity to a monospecific community.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No. IX.137.1.1.cSiberian Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences 3aCharophyta 3aRussia 3abasins 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adominant species 3alakes 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3aspecies richness 3asummer 3atemperature 3azooplankton1 aTashlykova, Natalya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1252-34770 tHydrobiologia.g2020 Mar., v. 847, no. 6 p.1383-1398dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04207-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02665naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147242011200167245011200279300001400391520156200405592002801967650001701995650002102012650001302033650001802046650001702064700001802081700002402099700002402123773010202147856008102249852000902330655001202339IND60572618420221119161216.0170725e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6057261842DNAL7 a10.1007/s00506-016-0365-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaba, Christoph10aNanomaterialien in Forschung, Industrie und Umwelt – Fallbeispiele für nanoskopische Referenzmaterialien10aNanomaterials in research, industry and the environment – case studies for nanoscopic reference materials  ap. 25-33.  aEngineered nanomaterials have established themselves as a staple in industry, and have paved the way for the development of new products. On one hand, their size and specific, highly chemically reactive surfaces make nanomaterials promising candidates in terms of their range of applications. On the other, it’s virtually impossible to make any universally valid statements on their potential effects on human beings or the environment.The difficulty of assessing the safety of these innovative materials, which are often made of complex compositions, is compounded by the fact that not only the chemical species and the amount/dosage but also further physical-chemical parameters like the particle shape, structure, specific surface characteristics, size and size distribution are important aspects. As such, it is currently extremely difficult to take into account potential transformation processes like the aggregation into larger clusters or dissolution into ionic components, and to differentiate between nanomaterial-specific and nonspecific effects. In addition, nano-scale reference materials and nanomaterials that can be found in complex environmental samples are currently in short supply.Accordingly, the standardized methods and testing techniques currently in use must be refined and adapted. In response to these challenges, this article proposes new approaches to differentiating between synthetic nanomaterials and their naturally occurring counterparts, illustrating them on the basis of an environmentally relevant sample application.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3achemical species 3aindustry 3ananomaterials 3anew products1 aPart, Florian1 aHuber-Humer, Marion1 aSinner, Eva-Kathrin0 tÖsterr Wasser- und Abfallw.g2017 Feb., v. 69, no. 1-2 p.25-33dSpringer Viennax0945-358X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00506-016-0365-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02178naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245017500166520082300341592002801164650001501192650001101207650003601218650001401254650002901268650003001297650001801327650001101345650001301356650001401369650001601383650002101399653002001420653002101440653001901461653001401480700002001494700001601514700001601530773010401546856008501650852000901735655001201744IND60787330520221121235612.0220830e20220914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078733052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tetlet.2022.1540732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cong10aDFT study on the mechanism of selectively oxidative C(sp2)–H/C(sp3)–H cross-coupling of benzamides with amides by nickel catalyst: Oxidant-controlled regioselectivity  aThe mechanisms of Ni-catalyzed selective oxidation of C(sp²)-H/C(sp³)-H cross-coupling of benzamide with amide are investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculations show that the reaction involves the sequential steps of NH activation, CH activation, oxidative addition of free radicals, reductive elimination, protonation, and oxidation. Based on the DFT calculations, the CH cleavage occurs via the concerted metalation-deprotonation (CMD) mechanism. Moreover, we have also conducted a detailed study on the mechanisms of the formation of two different free radicals, α-C(sp³) carbon radical RA and free radical RB that is adjacent to nitrogen atom.

Thiram is a pesticide for fighting fungi and protection of cultivated products. This research aimed at controlled release of thiram pesticide from Poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibrous matrix. Solutions of PLLA (9% w/v) in chloroform-methanol (80–20 v/v) containing 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% (w/w) thiram relative to the PLLA were electrospun. FESEM, FTIR, and XRD were employed to characterize the electrospun nanofibers. UV spectrophotometry was employed to study the release of thiram from PLLA nanofibers in deionized water. The results showed that the controlled release of thiram from PLLA nanofibers without annealing followed Fick mechanism, but after annealing, non-Fick mechanism prevailed. It was also observed that annealing led to lower level and lower initial rate of controlled release. It is concluded that electrospun PLLA-thiram nanofibers can be used for the controlled release of thiram in long-term periods in agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aannealing 3acost effectiveness 3afabrics 3afungi 3ananofibers 3apolylactic acid 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athiram 0aNanofibers 0acontrolled release 0athiram pesticide 0apoly (L-lactic acid) 0aannealing1 aTavanai, Hossein1 aMorshed, Mohammad1 aKhajehali, Jahangir0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2017 Sept. 2, v. 108, no. 9 p.1504-1509dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2016.12589503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02640naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245010100166520151900267592002801786650001101814650001601825650001201841650001301853650001101866650001401877650002801891651001001919653002901929653003301958653002001991653003202011700001902043773011902062856008802181852000902269655001202278IND60761075320221118151952.0220222e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076107532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Lei10aSimulation study on carbon emission of China's freight system under the target of carbon peaking  aThe development of Chinese society needs the support of a perfect and efficient freight transport system. Nonetheless, China's freight system is facing a major challenge in reducing carbon emissions. Hence, firstly, this paper explores three major internal drivers of carbon emissions by analyzing the current situation in China's freight system: proportion of railway freight (PORF), railway electrification level (REL) and electric truck penetration (ETP). Secondly, the system dynamics (SDs) model is used to simulate the carbon emission system of freight transportation in China. Thirdly, this paper sets 13 scenarios of carbon peaking to explore the paths of carbon peaking before 2030 under the three levels of development of ETP oriented freight system. The results indicate that when PORF, REL, and ETP reach 23.96% of total freight volume, 83.7% of rail freight, and 11% of truck freight in 2030 respectively, China's freight system has the most optimistic scenario of carbon peaking. Meanwhile, the time of carbon peaking is 2024, and the peak value is 0.842 billion tons. When PORF, REL, and ETP reach 15.96% of total freight volume, 63.7% of rail freight, and 3% of truck freight in 2030 respectively, China's freight system has the worst scenario of carbon peaking. Meanwhile, the time of carbon peaking is 2029, and the peak value is 1.016 billion tons. Also, it is proved that improving PORF, REL, and ETP is an effective way to achieve green and sustainable development of China's freight industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aenvironment 3afreight 3aindustry 3amodels 3arailroads 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aFreight transport system 0aThree major internal drivers 0aSystem dynamics 0aThe paths of carbon peaking1 aSong, Qianqian0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 812 p.152600-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1526003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04228naa a2200817 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100003100181245006000212300001800272506007600290520155400366592002801920506003701948650002501985650001002010650002602020650001002046650001602056650001802072650001302090650005202103650001302155650001602168650001002184650001402194650001002208650005302218650003502271650001802306650003102324650004702355650002202402650003802424650002002462650004102482650002002523650005702543650002802600650002702628650002902655650002502684650004002709650002502749650004702774650002302821650003402844650001702878653001602895653002102911653001402932653002302946653002502969653002302994653001903017700003603036700002803072700003003100700002603130700003103156700002603187773010203213856007403315852000903389655001203398IND60115105020221207074243.0150202e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011510502DNAL7 a229752862pmid7 aPMC34780582pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcs2002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarza-Caligaris, Luz Elena10aAt3g08030 transcript: a molecular marker of seed ageing  ap. 1253-1260.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims Prolonged storage generally reduces seed viability and vigour, although the rate of deterioration varies among species and environmental conditions. Here, we suggest a possible ageing molecular marker: At3g08030 mRNA. At3g08030 is a member of the DUF642 highly conserved family of cell-wall-associated proteins that is specific for spermatophytes. Methods At3g08030 expression was performed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR analysis in seed samples differing in their rate of germination and final germination following a matrix priming and/or controlled deterioration (rapid ageing) treatment. Key Results The At3g08030 gene transcript was present during the entire Arabidopsis thaliana plant life cycle and in seeds, during maturation, the ripening period and after germination. Matrix priming treatment increased the rate of germination of control seeds and seeds aged by controlled deterioration. Priming treatments also increased At3g08030 expression. To determine whether the orthologues of this gene are also age markers in other plant species, At3g08030 was cloned in two wild species, Ceiba aesculifolia and Wigandia urens. As in A. thaliana , the At3g08030 transcript was not present in aged seeds of the tested species but was present in recently shed seeds. A reduction in germination performance of the aged seeds under salt stress was determined by germination assays. Conclusions At3g08030 mRNA detection in a dry seed lot has potential for use as a molecular marker for germination performance in a variety of plant species.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCeiba 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3agermination 3amessenger RNA 3aproteins 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aripening 3asalt stress 3aseeds 3aviability 3avigor 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aCarrier Proteinsxgenetics 2aCeibaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aFlowersxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Markers 2aGerminationxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrophyllaceaexdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeedlingsxgenetics. 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aTime Factors 0aSeed ageing 0amolecular marker 0aAt3g08030 0aDUF642 gene family 0aArabidopsis thaliana 0aCeiba aesculifolia 0aWigandia urens1 aAvendaño-Vázquez, Aida Odette1 aAlvarado-López, Sandra1 aZúñiga-Sánchez, Esther1 aOrozco Segovia, Alma,1 aPérez-Ruíz, Rigoberto V.1 aGamboa-deBuen, Alicia0 tAnnals of botany.g2012 Nov., v. 110, no. 6 p.1253-1260dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs2003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245014000198500001400338520111300352592002801465596005901493650002301552650002501575650001201600650002201612650001201634650001501646650001301661650001801674650001201692650001301704650001001717650001301727650001601740700005501756700005201811700005701863700005501920700005201975773012102027856007602148852000902224655001202233IND60723048120221120152227.0210111e20201228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072304812DNAL7 a10.1155/2020/88757882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Xianwen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9386-162110aAnalysis of Antioxidant Capacity of Chromones in Saposhnikoviae Radix Obtained by Ultrasonic-Assisted Deep Eutectic Solvents Extraction  aNAL-light  aIn this paper, ultrasonic-assisted deep eutectic solvent (DES) extraction was applied to the acquisition of chromones (cimicifugin, prim-o-glucosylcimifugin, and 5-o-methylvisamminoside) from Saposhnikoviae radix (SR). The extraction effects of 11 prepared DESs were screened taking contents of chromones as indexes. Furthermore, the optimum extraction conditions were confirmed using a single-factor test and response surface optimization test. Scavenging activities of DPPH anion and ABTS cation radicals of different SR extracts (DES, methanol, and ethanol) were studied. The analysis results of best extraction conditions optimized by Design-Expert software were as follows: extraction time (40 min), extraction temperature (60°C), and the solid/liquid ratio (32 mL/g). Scavenging rates of the DES extract for DPPH anion radical and ABTS cation radical were found to be 75.31% and 65.71%, which were higher than those of methanol and ethanol extracts. In conclusion, the developed extraction method can be regarded as a safe, green, and more effective approach for the extraction of chromones in SR.  aPublisher supplied data  aJJKH20200025KJcEducation Department of Jilin Province 3aanalytical methods 3aantioxidant activity 3acations 3acomputer software 3aethanol 3aextraction 3aextracts 3afree radicals 3aliquids 3amethanol 3apaper 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aXu, Fangfei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3711-04761 aLv, Peng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2600-08531 aYang, Huailei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2284-53061 aBao, Huiwei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5787-18141 aXu, Yang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2324-12990 tJournal of Analytical Methods in Chemistry (Online).g2020 Dec. 28, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:26807x2090-88737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88757883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03671naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002700124024003400151040001800185100002200203245010300225300001800328500002000346506002800366506003000394520195000424592002802374596004402402596004502446596004502491506003702536650001502573650002502588650001102613650001202624650001902636650001502655650002402670650001602694650001302710650001502723650002402738650001702762650001102779650002502790651001302815700002102828700002002849700002102869773012302890856007303013903002203086852000903108655001203117IND60587816620221207103620.0180102e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058781662DNAL7 a10.1111/gcb.135502chorus7 a10.1111/gcb.135502doi7 a10.1111/gcb.135502chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoungsteadt, Elsa10aResponses of arthropod populations to warming depend on latitude: evidence from urban heat islands  ap. 1436-1447.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aBiological effects of climate change are expected to vary geographically, with a strong signature of latitude. For ectothermic animals, there is systematic latitudinal variation in the relationship between climate and thermal performance curves, which describe the relationship between temperature and an organism's fitness. Here, we ask whether these documented latitudinal patterns can be generalized to predict arthropod responses to warming across mid‐ and high temperate latitudes, for taxa whose thermal physiology has not been measured. To address this question, we used a novel natural experiment consisting of a series of urban warming gradients at different latitudes. Specifically, we sampled arthropods from a single common street tree species across temperature gradients in four US cities, located from 35.8 to 42.4° latitude. We captured 6746 arthropods in 34 families from 111 sites that varied in summer average temperature by 1.7–3.4 °C within each city. Arthropod responses to warming within each city were characterized as Poisson regression coefficients describing change in abundance per °C for each family. Family responses in the two midlatitude cities were heterogeneous, including significantly negative and positive effects, while those in high‐latitude cities varied no more than expected by chance within each city. We expected high‐latitude taxa to increase in abundance with warming, and they did so in one of the two high‐latitude cities; in the other, Queens (New York City), most taxa declined with warming, perhaps due to habitat loss that was correlated with warming in this city. With the exception of Queens, patterns of family responses to warming were consistent with predictions based on known latitudinal patterns in arthropod physiology relative to regional climate. Heterogeneous responses in midlatitudes may be ecologically disruptive if interacting taxa respond oppositely to warming.  aPublisher supplied data  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199  cUSGSdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000002030 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aarthropods 3abioactive properties 3acities 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aectothermy 3ahabitat destruction 3aheat island 3alatitude 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3astreet trees 3asummer 3atemperature profiles 3aNew York1 aErnst, Andrew F.1 aDunn, Robert R.1 aFrank, Steven D.0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 Apr., v. 23, no. 4 p.1436-1447dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.135503Available from publisher's site  aVersion of Record  aDNAL 7aarticle02081naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007600169300001800245520091800263592002801181650002401209650001301233650001201246650001001258650002001268650002101288653002101309653001701330653001901347653002601366700001701392700002001409700001901429700002001448773013301468856008501601852000901686655001201695IND60573692720221119144828.0170724e20170902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057369272DNAL7 a10.1080/00405000.2016.12589512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshraf, Waqas10aInvestigation of mechanical behavior of woven/knitted hybrid composites  ap. 1510-1517.  aThe objective of this research is to develop the woven/knitted hybrid composites for improved in plane as well as out of plane mechanical properties.

Secondly, the laminated composite samples were fabricated with different stacking sequence of fabric plies. The epoxy resin was used as matrix. The cured samples were characterized for impact, tensile and dynamic mechanical properties. The behavior of composite materials was then analyzed with percentages of different fiber and fabric types. The samples with higher percentages of knitted reinforcement gave better impact strength but failed to provide better tensile properties. Moreover, the samples with higher percentages of woven structure and glass materials gives better modulus values.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3afabrics 3aglass 3aimpact strength 3atensile strength 0aHybrid composite 0awoven Fabric 0aknitted Fabric 0amechanical properties1 aNawab, Yasir1 aUmair, Muhammad1 aShaker, Khubab1 aKarahan, Mehmet0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2017 Sept. 2, v. 108, no. 9 p.1510-1517dTaylor & FranciswJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2016.12589513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012200165300001200287520115200299592002801451650001201479650002201491650003501513650001601548650002201564650001501586650001301601650001901614650001101633650001401644650001801658650001601676650001501692650002101707651001301728700002301741773015001764856008201914852000901996655001202005IND60572618620221119161620.0180619e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057261862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-017-5935-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBashir, Hafsa10aExploring geospatial techniques for spatiotemporal change detection in land cover dynamics along Soan River, Pakistan  ap. 222.  aClassification of land cover dynamics via satellite imagery has played indispensible services in developing effective management strategies for evaluation and management of water resources. The present study employed geospatial techniques, i.e., integrated GIS and remote sensing for effectual land change study. Hybrid classification approach was applied using ERDAS Imagine 11 to detect changes in land cover dynamics using satellite imagery of Landsat 4, 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM, and Landsat 8 OLI for the years of 1992, 2002, and 2015, respectively. The study area was classified into four categories, i.e., vegetation, water body, barren, and urban area. Resultant maps, overlay maps, and post classification comparison maps were produced using ArcGIS 10.2 indicated remarkable shrinkage of water body up to 58.81%, reduction in vegetation area 53.24%, and increase in urban and barren area to 49.04 and 137.32%, respectively. The significant changes in land cover dynamics of Soan River are posing threats to its survival. Therefore, proper management, policies, and development of land use inventory are needs of the hour for saving Soan River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acomputer software 3ageographic information systems 3ainventories 3aissues and policy 3aland cover 3aland use 3aremote sensing 3arivers 3ashrinkage 3asurface water 3aurban areas 3avegetation 3awater management 3aPakistan1 aAhmad, SheikhSaeed0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2017 May, v. 189, no. 5 p.222-222dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-017-5935-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02019naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245008300161300001600244520100200260592002801262650001301290650001101303650001201314650001201326650001401338651001601352651001301368653001401381653001601395653001401411653001001425653001701435653001301452773009401465856007701559852000901636655001201645IND60520413220221120211323.0160520e20130731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052041322DNAL7 a10.2478/pbj-2013-00182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRenner, Matt,10aLejeunea Subelobata and Lejeunea Drummondii (Jungermanniopsida) in Australasia  ap. 193-203.  aLejeunea subelobata Carrington & Pearson has been regarded as a synonym of L. drummondii Taylor, but the two species differ in patterns of variation in lobule morphology, shapes of the gynoecial bracteole, female bract underleaf and vegetative underleaves; in stem anatomy, and ecology. Lejeunea subelobata is a rheophyte from south-east Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand that grows primarily as a lithophyte on rock within and around waterways, in association with basicolous substrates particularly basalt, rhyolite and andesite. Lobules in L. subelobata are always explanate, the female bract underleaf is obovate, underleaves are rotund and remote, and the stem medulla has 19-26 cells with small concave trigones. Lejeunea drummondii is, in its current circumscription, an ecologically and morphologically malleable taxon confined to Australia. The relationship between L. drummondii and plants from New Zealand described as L. epiphylla Colenso nom. illeg. requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aandesite 3abasalt 3aecology 3afemales 3awaterways 3aNew Zealand 3aTasmania 0aAustralia 0aNew Zealand 0aliverwort 0aFlora 0aLejeuneaceae 0asynonymy0 tPolish Botanical Journal.g2013 July 31, v. 58, no. 1 p.193-203dVersitax2084-43527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pbj-2013-00183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245005100180300001600231520135800247592002801605650001001633650001101643650001801654650002401672650001501696650001601711650002001727650001401747650002501761650001601786650001801802653001101820653001401831653001401845653001501859653001101874700003501885700002701920700003901947700007501986700003102061773011102092856008702203852000902290655001202299IND60622836520221122084109.0210114e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062283652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza da Silva, Edilene10aUltrasound-assisted vacuum drying of nectarine  ap. 119-124.  aConvective drying is a widely used conservation process, and in an attempt to improve it, the use of ultrasound and/or vacuum can be an alternative. The objective of this work was to evaluate the influence of ultrasonic waves and vacuum, combined or not, on the drying kinetics at 60 °C and the impact in terms of fruit quality, through the following techniques: ultrasonic assisted drying (USD), vacuum drying (VD), ultrasonic assisted vacuum drying (USVD) and control drying (CD). Six different semi-theoretical drying mathematical models were compared based on their coefficient of determination and mean square error to characterize the drying curves. The application of the USVC technique resulted in a higher rate drying kinetics and a reduction of the process time above 50%. The dehydrated kinetics was successfully described by the Two-terms Exponential model. Effective moisture diffusivities were in the range of 10⁻⁹ m²/s and the higher value was obtained for USVD. It was verified that the use of ultrasound (USD and USVD) had a strong influence in obtaining the highest retention of polyphenols, while the use of vacuum (VD and USVD) resulted in lower color differences of processed samples in relation to fresh fruit and lower energy consumption. Thus, the combined use of ultrasound and vacuum can provide satisfactory results.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3aenergy 3afruit quality 3amathematical models 3anectarines 3apolyphenols 3aprocessing time 3araw fruit 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 3avacuum drying 0aDrying 0aNectarine 0aPhenolics 0aUltrasound 0aVacuum1 aRupert Brandão, Shirley Clyde1 aLopes da Silva, Amanda1 aFernandes da Silva, João Henrique1 aDuarte Coêlho, Antônio Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5875-89441 aAzoubel, Patrícia Moreira0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Apr., v. 246 p.119-124dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2018.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02765naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100002100166245007600187300001800263520093600281592002801217650001601245650001301261650001601274650002201290650002101312650001201333650001301345650002201358650004001380650002701420650004801447650003601495650006201531650004501593650003601638650002301674650004101697650006701738650004001805650003801845700001801883700002901901700003001930700002401960700001901984700002202003773010602025856008302131852000902214655001202223IND4473398820221118040622.0141111e20120701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447339882DNAL7 a225256812pmid7 a10.1016/j.jplph.2012.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJannat, Rayhanur10aCatalases negatively regulate methyl jasmonate signaling in guard cells  ap. 1012-1016.  aMethyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced stomatal closure is accompanied by the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) in guard cells. In this study, we investigated the roles of catalases (CATs) in MeJA-induced stomatal closure using cat mutants cat2, cat3-1 and cat1 cat3, and the CAT inhibitor, 3-aminotriazole (AT). When assessed with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein, the reduction of catalase activity by means of mutations and the inhibitor accumulated higher basal levels of H₂O₂ in guard cells whereas they did not affect stomatal aperture in the absence of MeJA. In contrast, the cat mutations and the treatment with AT potentiated MeJA-induced stomatal closure and MeJA-induced H₂O₂ production. These results indicate that CATs negatively regulate H₂O₂ accumulation in guard cells and suggest that inducible H₂O₂ production rather than constitutive elevation modulates stomatal apertures in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acatalase 3aguard cells 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amethyl jasmonate 3amutants 3amutation 3astomatal movement 2aAcetatesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aAmitrolexpharmacology 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCalcium Signalingxdrug effects 2aCatalasexantagonists & inhibitorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aMutationxgenetics 2aOxylipinsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Stomataxcytologyxdrug effectsxenzymologyxphysiology. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects1 aUraji, Misugi1 aHossain, Mohammad Anowar1 aIslam, Mohammad Muzahidul1 aNakamura, Yoshimasa1 aMori, Izumi C.1 aMurata, Yoshiyuki0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2012 July 1, v. 169, no. 10 p.1012-1016dElsevier GmbHx0176-16177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2012.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04453naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100006000188245020900248300001200457506007600469520238700545592002802932506003702960650001802997650003603015650001303051650001903064650002203083650001403105650002603119650001303145650002703158650001303185650001203198650001103210650001903221650001403240650001803254650001603272650002503288650002503313650001303338650001503351650004303366650001003409650002003419650001103439650001003450650001103460651002903471700001903500700001903519700002103538700002503559700002303584773010503607856008203712852000903794655001203803IND60619530520221207143709.0190503e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061953052DNAL7 a10.1186/s12870-018-1487-y2doi7 aPMC62114342pmcid7 a303828182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubois, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4545-568810aGenetic and environmental factors affecting the expression of α-gliadin canonical epitopes involved in celiac disease in a wide collection of spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta) cultivars and landraces  ap. 262.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder affecting genetically predisposed individuals whose dietary gluten proteins trigger an inflammatory reaction in the small intestine. Gluten is found in the seeds of cereals like bread wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum) and spelt (Triticum aestivum ssp. spelta). The development of new varieties lacking immunogenic peptides is one of the strategies currently investigated to address the CD problem. Among gluten proteins, α-gliadins display the strongest immunogenicity with four main T-cell stimulatory epitopes. The objective of this work was to study the expression of α-gliadin epitopes related to CD in a wide collection of 121 spelt accessions (landraces and varieties, spring and winter accessions) from different provenances, and to analyze the correlation between the presence of epitope sequences in gDNA and their expression (cDNA). The effect of environmental factors (harvest year and N fertilization) on the epitope expression was also investigated. RESULTS: TaqMan probes targeting the canonical form of the epitopes were used to evaluate the epitope expression levels. Significant variations in the amount of epitope transcripts were identified between accessions and according to the provenances. Spring accessions showed a significantly higher immunogenicity than winter ones and no influence of spelt breeding on the epitope expression levels could be assessed when comparing landraces and varieties from Northwestern Europe. No correlation was observed between quantitative PCR results obtained from cDNA and gDNA for 45 accessions tested, stressing the need to use markers focusing on epitope transcripts rather than on genomic sequences. A relative stability of the amount of epitopes expressed by a same accession across four harvest years was detected. The fertilization strategy, evaluated through seven N fertilization modalities applied to two commercial spelt varieties, did not influence the epitope expression of the first variety, whereas it had a slight effect for the second one. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this work showed that the CD-related epitope expression greatly fluctuated among the spelt accessions studied. This expression was not correlated to the epitope genomic occurrence and environmental factors had almost no influence on the amount of epitope transcripts.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3abreeding 3aceliac disease 3acomplementary DNA 3acultivars 3aenvironmental factors 3aepitopes 3afertilizer application 3agenomics 3agliadin 3agluten 3aimmunogenicity 3alandraces 3amessenger RNA 3anew variety 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3aprovenance 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseeds 3asmall intestine 3aspring 3awheat 3awinter 3aNorthern European region1 aBertin, Pierre1 aHautier, Louis1 aMuhovski, Yordan1 aEscarnot, Emmanuelle1 aMingeot, Dominique0 tBMC plant biology.g2018 Dec., v. 18, no. 1 p.262-262dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-018-1487-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02722naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001500180245008000195300001800275506007600293520105600369592002801425506003701453650001901490650001201509650002501521650002801546650001601574650001101590650001301601650002401614650001601638650002601654650001401680650002401694650001101718650001701729650001201746700001401758700001901772700002101791700002301812700002201835700001701857700002201874700002701896700002201923700002101945773010601966856007502072852000902147655001202156IND60532772020221207044854.0160728e20130513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053277202DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400316e2doi7 aPMC38242512pmcid7 a235869382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiu, Li-na10aBiomimetic Silicification of Demineralized Hierarchical Collagenous Tissues  ap. 1661-1668.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnlike man-made composite materials, natural biominerals containing composites usually demonstrate different levels of sophisticated hierarchical structures which are responsible for their mechanical properties and other metabolic functions. However, the complex spatial organizations of the organic–inorganic phases are far beyond what they achieved by contemporary engineering techniques. Here, we demonstrate that carbonated apatite present in collagen matrices derived from fish scale and bovine bone may be replaced by amorphous silica, using an approach that simulates what is utilized by phylogenetically ancient glass sponges. The structural hierarchy of these collagen-based biomaterials is replicated by the infiltration and condensation of fluidic polymer-stabilized silicic acid precursors within the intrafibrillar milieu of type I collagen fibrils. This facile biomimetic silicification strategy may be used for fabricating silica-based, three-dimensional functional materials with specific morphological and hierarchical requirements.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHexactinellida 3aapatite 3abiochemical pathways 3abiocompatible materials 3abiomimetics 3acattle 3acollagen 3acomposite materials 3aengineering 3amechanical properties 3aphylogeny 3ascales (integument) 3asilica 3asilicic acid 3atissues1 aJiao, Kai1 aRyou, Heonjune1 aDiogenes, Anibal1 aYiu, Cynthia

The capacities of such integrated continuous facilities must be determined for potential products in the face of clinical trials uncertainty. Given a portfolio consisting of potential products in the development stage, the goal of capacity planning is to ensure the availability of enough production capacity to meet the projected demands of products, which vary from the launch to the peak-demand periods. To address this problem, we propose a multiscenario, multiperiod, mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that takes into account uncertainty in the outcome of clinical trials. We illustrate the proposed framework using several examples. The exponential increase in problem size with the number of products motivates us to develop an efficient solution method, which is discussed in Part 2 of this paper.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclinical trials 3adrugs 3aengineering 3aingredients 3alinear programming 3amanufacturing 3aplanning 3auncertainty1 aEvans, James M.

Here, we aimed to clarify the response mechanism of a herbaceous plant (Chinese lyme grass, Leymus chinensis) to browsing by a mammalian herbivore (Brandt's vole, Lasiopodomy brandtii). We used high-performance liquid chromatography and spectrophotometry to investigate changes in the concentrations of 6-MBOA, total phenol and condensed tannin in Chinese lyme grass seedlings with respect to its ontogeny and different types of damage treatments. 6-MBOA concentrations were higher on day 7 and day 8 than on days 12 and 17 after seedling germination. The concentrations of total phenol and condensed tannin were higher on day 12 than on days 7 and 8 after seedling germination. Compared to the control, higher 6-MBOA concentrations were obtained in the salivation, gnawing and artificial cutting treatment groups. The response of 6-MBOA was delayed in the artificial cutting group compared to the salivation and gnawing groups. In contrast, the concentrations of total phenol and condensed tannin were higher in the artificial cutting and control groups compared to the salivation and gnawing groups. 6-MBOA concentration was negatively correlated with total phenol concentration. The results indicated that 6-MBOA concentration decreased with seedling ontogeny, and that it could be induced by Brandt's vole saliva. In conclusion, our study verified the hypothesis that the browsing by Brandt's vole induces the dynamic defenses of L. chinensis .  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeymus chinensis 3abrowsing 3acorrelation 3acutting 3adefense mechanisms 3agermination 3agrasses 3aherbaceous plants 3aherbivores 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aontogeny 3aproanthocyanidins 3asaliva 3asalivation 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3aspectroscopy 3avoles 0aLeymus chinensis 0a6-MBOA 0aphenolic compounds 0ainduced defense1 aZhang, Yan-Qi1 aJiang, Lian-Yu1 aYuan, Fei1 aWang, Ai-Qin1 aWei, Wan-Hong1 aYang, Sheng-Mei0 tIsrael journal of ecology & evolution.g2014 Oct. 2, v. 60, no. 2-4 p.75-84dTaylor & Francisx2224-46627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15659801.2014.9868783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001900169245021700188300001600405520154700421592002801968653001601996653001802012653000902030653005202039653001502091700001702106700002002123700001902143773013902162856011702301852000902418655001202427IND60126951820221120193959.0151108e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012695182DNAL7 a10.1603/0013-8746(2004)097[0957:IAICBA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTokuda, Makoto10aInter- and Intraspecific Comparisons Between Asteralobia Gall Midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) Causing Axillary Bud Galls on Ilex Species (Aquifoliaceae): Species Identification, Host Range, and Mode of Speciation  ap. 957-970.  aInter- and intraspecific differences between Asteralobia gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) that induce axillary bud galls on several Ilex species were studied from morphological, molecular, and ecological points of view. Asteralobia sasakii (Monzen) and Asteralobia soyogo (Kikuti) were clearly distinguished from one another by thoracic setal and scale counts and by sequences of partial mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I region. Because adults of A. sasakii emerged within a shorter period of time and later in the season than those of A. soyogo, they were considered to be temporally isolated. The host ranges of A. sasakii and A. soyogo did not overlap. A. sasakii was confirmed to use Ilex crenata Thunberg, Ilex crenata var. paludosa (Nakai) Hara, and Ilex maximowicziana Loesener for galling, and A. soyogo included galls on Ilex chinensis Sims, Ilex integra Thunberg, Ilex leucoclada (Maximowicz) Makino, and Ilex pedunculosa Miquel. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that host races were not formed either in A. sasakii or in A. soyogo populations, whereas geographical variations were detected for both species at the DNA level. The haplotype diversity was significantly higher in A. soyogo than in A. sasakii. The DNA analysis suggested that A. sasakii and A. soyogo had speciated allopatrically. On the basis of the current study, we concluded that A. soyogo had been already established in Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, Japan, when A. sasakii arrived in these areas from the southwest islands more recently.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAsteralobia 0aCecidomyiidae 0aIlex 0amitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene 0aspeciation1 aTabuchi, Ken1 aYukawa, Junichi1 aAmano, Hiroshi0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2004 Sept., v. 97, no. 5 p.957-970dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603%2F0013-8746%282004%29097%5B0957%3AIAICBA%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02652naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245011000167520170200277592002801979650000802007650001902015650001702034650001002051650000902061650001502070650001302085650002002098650001302118773012002131856007802251852000902329655001202338IND60757747620221119095309.0211125e20211023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075774762DNAL7 a10.3390/genes121116722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZemanova, Miriam A.10aNoninvasive Genetic Assessment Is an Effective Wildlife Research Tool When Compared with Other Approaches  aWildlife research has been indispensable for increasing our insight into ecosystem functioning as well as for designing effective conservation measures under the currently high rates of biodiversity loss. Genetic and genomic analyses might be able to yield the same information on, e.g., population size, health, or diet composition as other wildlife research methods, and even provide additional data that would not be possible to obtain by alternative means. Moreover, if DNA is collected non-invasively, this technique has only minimal or no impact on animal welfare. Nevertheless, the implementation rate of noninvasive genetic assessment in wildlife studies has been rather low. This might be caused by the perceived inefficiency of DNA material obtained non-invasively in comparison with DNA obtained from blood or tissues, or poorer performance in comparison with other approaches used in wildlife research. Therefore, the aim of this review was to evaluate the performance of noninvasive genetic assessment in comparison with other methods across different types of wildlife studies. Through a search of three scientific databases, 113 relevant studies were identified, published between the years 1997 and 2020. Overall, most of the studies (94%) reported equivalent or superior performance of noninvasive genetic assessment when compared with either invasive genetic sampling or another research method. It might be also cheaper and more time-efficient than other techniques. In conclusion, noninvasive genetic assessment is a highly effective research approach, whose efficacy and performance are likely to improve even further in the future with the development of optimized protocols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanimal welfare 3abiodiversity 3ablood 3adiet 3aecosystems 3agenomics 3apopulation size 3awildlife0 tGenes.g2021 Oct. 23, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes121116723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01237naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100001800193245005100211300001200262506007600274520026700350592002800617506003700645650002100682650002000703650001300723773010300736856008700839852000900926655001200935IND60119445920221207063016.0141214e200102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011944592DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2001-2-2-reviews10062doi7 aPMC1389042pmcid7 a111828922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinston, Fred10aControl of eukaryotic transcription elongation  ap. 151.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Spt4, Spt5, and Spt6 proteins are conserved eukaryotic transcription-elongation factors.

The treatment and control of schistosomiasis rely on a single drug, praziquantel (PZQ). Despite its efficacy, treatment with PZQ presents some major drawbacks including an inability of the chemotherapy to reverse disease-induced fibrosis and the prospect of the emergence of drug resistance. Here, we investigated a novel therapeutic approach with antioxidant biomolecules in combination with PZQ against the adult developmental stage of Schistosoma mansoni and oviposition in vitro, given that this therapeutic approach achieved synergistic/additive activity against larval schistosomes. The antioxidants curcumin and oxadiazole per se exhibited antischistosomal activity against adult worms leading to severe morphological alterations and death. Additionally, the antioxidant flavone combined with vandetanib or imatinib improved antischistosomal activity against adult forms. By contrast, however, these antioxidant-anthelmintic combinations were not as effective against adults in comparison to larval schistosomes. Nevertheless, the antioxidants alone or combined with drugs inhibited oviposition.  aPublisher supplied data  aIF/00092/2014/CP1255/CT0004cFCT and FEDER  aUIDB/4255/2020cFundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  aCA164719cNational Institutes of Health 3aSchistosoma mansoni 3aadults 3aantioxidants 3acurcumin 3adeath 3adrug resistance 3adrug therapy 3afibrosis 3aflavones 3alarvae 3aoviposition 3aoxadiazoles 3aparasitology 3apraziquantel 3aresearch 3aschistosomiasis 3atropical diseases1 aBrindley, Paul J.1 aGärtner, Fátima1 aVale, Nuno1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1283-10420 tJournal of parasitology research.g2020 Aug. 6, v. 2020dHindawiwJournal:21566x2090-00317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/88438083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02291naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011900164300002000283520117500303592002801478650001501506650001401521650002001535650001601555650002301571650001801594650001101612650001301623650001601636700001401652700002301666700002001689773013601709856007501845852000901920655001201929IND60536948120221121065444.0160807e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053694812DNAL7 a10.1021/ie30032542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSundaramoorthy, Arul10aCapacity Planning under Clinical Trials Uncertainty in Continuous Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, 2: Solution Method  ap. 13703-13711.  aIn Part 1 of this paper, we presented a scenario-based multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for a capacity planning problem in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing under clinical trials uncertainty. The number of scenarios and, thus, the formulation size grows exponentially with the number of products. The model size easily becomes intractable for conventional algorithms for more than 8 products. However, industrial-scale problems often involve 10 or more products, and thus a scalable solution algorithm is essential to solve such large-scale problems in reasonable times. In this part of the paper, we develop a rigorous decomposition strategy that exploits the underlying problem structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm using several examples containing up to 16 potential products and over 65 000 scenarios. With the proposed decomposition algorithm, the solution time scales linearly with the number of scenarios, whereby a 16-product example with over 65 million binary variables, nearly 240 million continuous variables, and over 250 million constraints was solved in less than 6 h of solver time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemistry 3aclinical trials 3aengineering 3alinear programming 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3aplanning 3auncertainty1 aLi, Xiang1 aEvans, James M.

The vibration waves propagate through the soil layers and reach to nearby buildings creating distractions for human activities and causing equipment malfunctioning. Not only the train components and the rails, but also the surrounding tunnel, soil and rock strata have dynamic characteristics that play significant roles in the vibration levels felt in a nearby structure. This paper presents a finite element study conducted to investigate the vibrations resulting from train movements in nearby subway tunnels. The subway line is located at an average horizontal distance of 50 ft (15.2 m) from the structure in assessment, which is a six-story office building. The main goal of the work is to assess the train-induced vibrations at the ground level of the building through a case study and sensitivity analysis. A plane strain finite element model is built to represent the railroad tunnel embedded in the rock and the soil stratum above it. The one train loading function is applied to the model as a point source at the track level and compared to the two-train scenario. Other simulations are undertaken for sensitivity analysis involving increased loading, decreased damping and decreased distance to tunnels. Even though there are several numerical studies on the propagation of train induced vibrations in the literature; a finite element model accompanied with a sensitivity analysis has not been discussed in detail in a technical publication before. The paper not only presents the finite element modeling but also compares the results with the criteria of Transit Noise and Vibration Impact Assessment Manual, which was published by the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) of the U.S. Department of Transportation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acase studies 3aequipment 3afinite element analysis 3arailroads 3asoil 3avibration 0aVibrations disturbance 0aTrain vibrations 0aGround-borne vibrations 0aRailroad tunnels 0aTunnels embedded in rock 0aANSYS 0aFinite element modelling1 aBhargava, Ashish1 aNikitas, Nikolaos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6243-052X1 aInman, D.

Among them, Devil’s pygmy grasshoppers (genus Holocerus Bolívar, 1887) are unique in having two long spines on the back, which are modified internal lateral pronotal carinae. The genus Holocerus was composed of two species – H. lucifer (Serville, 1838) and H. taurus Rehn, 1929 syn. nov., but here it is evidenced that the latter represents a junior synonym of the former. Simultaneously, H. devriesei sp. nov. is described as a species new to science. Holocerus lucifer is a northern species of paler coloration and longer spines (distributed from Marojejy and Maroantsetra in the north to Zahamena in the south), whereas H. devriesei sp. nov. represents the southern and darker species (distributed from Vohimana and Andasibe-Mantadia in the south to the Antongil Bay in the north). There are potential overlaps in the distribution of the two species, but without more georeferenced localities, it is impossible to discriminate whether they occur only sympatrically or also syntopically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTetrigidae 3acolor 3ageoreferencing 3aMadagascar 0apygmy grasshoppers 0aTetrigoidea 0aMetrodorinae 0aHolocerus 0aHendrik Devriese 0anew species 0athreatened species1 aMedak, Kristian1 aPavlović, Marko1 aKitonić, †Davorka1 aMiko, Rafanomezanjanahary Jean Christian1 aFranjević, Damjan0 tZooKeys.g2020 Aug. 10, v. 957 p.1-15dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.957.525653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007700168300001600245520126700261592002801528650002301556650002201579650001201601650002401613650001801637650001701655650000901672653002101681653002201702653003301724653002101757700001501778700002101793773012101814856008401935852000902019655001202028IND60122865720221122052251.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012286572DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2013.8513672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGautam, Shuva10aAgility capabilities in wood procurement systems: a literature synthesis  ap. 216-232.  aThe ability of a firm to detect changing demands and efficiently respond to them can be described as agility. The past decade has seen a significant rise in the literature on the concept of agility. It has been identified as a requirement for growth and competitiveness. However, a review of the related literature reveals that the concept has scarcely been studied in the forest industry context. This study contributes to filling this gap. More specifically, we contextualize agility in wood procurement systems (WPSs). A WPS includes upstream processes and actors in the forest-products supply chain, responsible for procuring and delivering raw materials from the forest to the mill. We first identify the capabilities a WPS needs to possess in order to enable agility. Next, we review the literature in the WPS domain to search for evidence of these capabilities. It was found that aspects of the practices embodied in agility capabilities have already been proposed in the WPS literature but without explicit reference to agility. However, opportunities to further improve the agility of WPSs were also identified. It is suggested that future research focus on determining optimal levels of investments in agility in order to maximize supply-chain profits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest engineering 3aforest industries 3aforests 3aprofits and margins 3araw materials 3asupply chain 3awood 0awood procurement 0aforest operations 0aforest products supply chain 0aagility enablers1 aLeBel, Luc1 aBeaudoin, Daniel0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 24, no. 3 p.216-232dTaylor & Francisx1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2013.8513673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02072naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245010800154300002000262520098400282592002801266650001401294650001601308650001301324650001301337650001401350650001301364700001501377700001401392700001901406700001301425700001101438700001501449700001401464773013601478856007501614852000901689655001201698IND60536948420221121065608.0160807e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053694842DNAL7 a10.1021/ie300515z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Ting10aCoupling Conversion of Methanol and C4 Hydrocarbon to Propylene on La-Modified HZSM-5 Zeolite Catalysts  ap. 13589-13598.  aThe coupling conversion of methanol and C₄ hydrocarbon (62.2 wt % of n-butanes and 34.4 wt % of n-butylenes) to propylene was studied over La-modified HZSM-5 (La/HZSM-5) catalysts. Compared with the individual methanol to olefins and C₄ hydrocarbon cracking to propylene, the coupling conversion remarkably improved propylene yield and the catalytic stability of La/HZSM-5. In the coupling conversion, propylene yield was strongly dependent on the reaction conditions and the loading of La. The interaction of La with hydroxyl groups (OH) adsorbed on HZSM-5 surface occurred. Such interaction modified the density and distribution of acid sites from the hydroxyl groups. Propylene yield was close relative to the density and distribution of acid sites. The comparatively high propylene yield of ca. 46.0 wt % was obtained on La/HZSM-5 catalyst with l.5 wt % load of La (1.5 wt % La/HZSM-5), possibly due to the moderate density and distribution of acid sites on the catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aengineering 3amethanol 3amoieties 3apropylene 3azeolites1 aZhang, Xin1 aBai, Ting1 aZhang, Quiquan1 aTao, Lin1 aQi, Mi1 aDuan, Chao1 aZhang, Li0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 51, no. 42 p.13589-13598dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie300515z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007600169300001600245520143100261592002801692650002201720650001801742650001401760650002201774650002301796650001101819650002601830650001801856650001101874650001001885650001501895653002701910653001101937653001101948653001701959653001201976653001801988700001802006773012102024856008402145852000902229655001202238IND60122865820221122052141.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012286582DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2013.8523902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhlert, Detlef10aHarvesters for short rotation coppice: current status and new solutions  ap. 170-182.  aMechanization in the harvesting of short rotation coppice on farmed land is a prerequisite for the expansion of short rotation coppice cropping. Existing harvest lines can be classified as log, bundle, bale, or chip lines; the latter are widely considered the most economical. Despite the development of more than 20 different harvesting machines and assemblies for chip lines in the past decade alone, only a few have progressed beyond the prototype stage. In addition to special mower tools already available for conventional forage harvesters, there is a great need for low-cost tractor-mounted chip harvesters. Therefore, a novel working principle for a mower-chipper was developed and tested. In contrast to most other solutions, the trees remain in an upright position while mowing and chipping. The harvest machine has a compact single rotor bearing a circular saw blade with a diameter of approximately 1000 mm. Knives arranged radially are attached to the saw and offset above the disk with spacer blocks. To ensure even feeding of the mower-chipper unit, numerous passive and active machine elements were tested to find a reliable solution for practical application. With the investigated harvester, trees with stem diameters up to 15 cm and 10 m in height could be successfully harvested at very promising working speeds of 3–5 km/h. The Class P45 wood chips produced satisfied the CEN/TS 14961:2005 standard.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acircular saws 3acoppicing 3aforage harvesters 3aforest engineering 3aknives 3amechanical harvesting 3amechanization 3amowing 3atrees 3awood chips 0ashort rotation coppice 0apoplar 0awillow 0ablack locust 0aharvest 0amower-chipper1 aPecenka, Ralf0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 24, no. 3 p.170-182dTaylor & Francisx1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2013.8523903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01398naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100001700193245004100210300001200251506007600263520038400339592002800723506003700751650001000788650002100798650001400819700001700833700002300850773010300873856008700976852000901063655001201072IND60119446220221207071059.0141214e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011944622DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2001-2-3-reviews10092doi7 aPMC1389152pmcid7 a112764292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdds, F.

Inevitably direct and indirect contacts with medical devices, food packing and daily supplies with harmful bacteria are among the major transmission routes of bacterial infections. Effective bacterial theranostic systems that combine diagnostic functions and therapeutic effects have received extensive attention due to their excellent features including high efficiency, real-time performance and low drug resistance. In this review article, we summarize the recent advances of antibacterial materials including natural antibacterial compounds, quaternary ammonium polymers, and inorganic or hybrid nanoparticles with the dual functions of detection and imaging. In particular, multiple imaging modalities and antibacterial modalities are systematically discussed in order to provide a better understanding of modern theranostics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3abacterial infections 3achemistry 3adrug resistance 3ahuman health 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amedical equipment 3ananoparticles 3apolymers 3aprecision medicine 3aquaternary ammonium compounds1 aLi, Qiaoying1 aWang, Xin1 aYang, Ying-Wei1 aGao, Hui0 tJournal of materials chemistry.g2018 Aug. 15, v. 6, no. 32 p.5198-5214dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26902x2050-75187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8tb01519h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245007300160300001800233520108700251592002801338650001901366650001401385650002701399650001101426650001301437650001601450650001901466650001501485650001001500650001301510650002201523650001201545650001501557650001301572650001101585650001701596650001701613650001401630650002101644650001101665650000901676700002001685700002101705700001801726773010601744856007501850852000901925655001201934IND60532772520221120122626.0160728e20130513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053277252DNAL7 a10.1021/bm400377e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFukuzumi, Hayaka10aSelective Permeation of Hydrogen Gas Using Cellulose Nanofibril Film  ap. 1705-1709.  aBiobased membranes that can selectively permeate hydrogen gas have been developed from aqueous dispersions of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofibrils (TOCN) prepared from wood cellulose: TOCN-coated plastic films and self-standing TOCN films. Compared with TOCNs with sodium, lithium, potassium, and cesium carboxylate groups, TOCN with free carboxyl groups (TOCN-COOH) had much high and selective H₂ gas permeation performance. Because permeabilities of H₂, N₂, O₂, and CO₂ gases through the membranes primarily depended on their kinetic diameters, the gas permeation behavior of the various TOCNs can be explained in terms of a diffusion mechanism. Thus, the selective H₂ gas permeability for TOCN-COOH was probably due to a larger average size in free volume holes present between nanofibrils in the layer and film than those of other TOCNs with metal carboxylate groups. The obtained results indicate that TOCN-COOH membranes are applicable as biobased H₂ gas separation membranes in fuel cell electric power generation systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acellulose 3acellulose microfibrils 3acesium 3adiameter 3adispersions 3aelectric power 3afuel cells 3agases 3ahydrogen 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alithium 3ananofibers 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apermeability 3aplastic film 3apotassium 3apower generation 3asodium 3awood1 aFujisawa, Shuji1 aSaito, Tsuguyuki1 aIsogai, Akira0 tBiomacromolecules.g2013 May 13, v. 14, no. 5 p.1705-1709dAmerican Chemical Societyx1526-46027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fbm400377e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009600164300001600260520123300276592002801509650004401537650001501581650001601596650001101612650001701623650001601640650001401656650002601670650002101696650003701717650001601754700001701770700001801787773012201805856004801927852000901975655001201984IND50059753720221118161658.0121102e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005975372DNAL7 a10.1007/s11783-012-0421-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Guangxia10aCharacterization of humic substances in bio-treated municipal solid waste landfill leachate  ap. 711-716.  aConsiderable organic matter remains in municipal solid waste landfill leachate after biological treatments. Humic substances (HSs) dominate the organic matter in bio-treated landfill leachate. In this study, the HSs from landfill leachate treated by membrane bioreactor (MBR-HSs) were analyzed via elemental analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and charge polarized magic-angle spinning-13C-nuclear magnetic resonance. The characteristic absorption in the UV wavelength range indicated the presence of high C=C and C=O double bonds within the MBR-HSs. Compared with commercial HSs, MBR-HSs had lower carbon content [48.14% for fulvic acids (FA) and 49.52% for humic acids (HA)], higher nitrogen content (4.31% for FA and 6.16% for HA), lower aromatic structure content, and higher carbohydrate and carboxylic atoms of carbon content. FA predominantly had an aliphatic structure, and HA had less condensed or substituted aromatic ring structures than natural HA. The aromatic carbon content of MBR-HSs was lower than that of humus-derived HSs but higher than that of waste-derived HSs, indicating that MBR-HSs appeared to be more similar to humus-derived HSs than waste-derived HA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabsorption 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3afulvic acids 3ahumic acids 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3anitrogen content 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awavelengths1 aYue, Dongbei1 aNie, Yongfeng0 tFrontiers of environmental science & engineering.g2012 Oct., v. 6, no. 5 p.711-716dSpringer-Verlagx2095-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11783-012-0421-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245004500175300001600220520097100236592002801207650001901235650001101254650001201265650002301277650001301300650001201313650001501325650001701340650001601357650001501373650001301388650001201401653001301413653000901426653001101435653001301446700002301459700002301482700002301505773012101528856008401649852000901733655001201742IND60122866020221122112432.0150325e20131101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012286602DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2013.8566132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMagagnotti, Natascia12aA new guide for work studies in forestry  ap. 249-253.  aA team of international specialists has developed a new guide for conducting forest work studies. The guide is a quick how-to manual designed for the field researcher, and it may contribute to the international harmonization of work-study methods. This endeavor was supported by the European Union through COST Action FP0902; however, the author team was not limited to European scientists, it was world-wide. The draft was reviewed by three international experts external to the team and to the action. Two provisional versions were administered to a test group of students, who elected the current version. Feedback was sought after publishing, through an online survey. Ninety-three researchers responded to the survey. The largest majority of respondents believed that the guide was state-of-the-art and that they were able to do a better job after reading the guide. The guide is available for free download from the Forest Energy Portal (www.forestenergy.org).  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aenergy 3aexperts 3aforest engineering 3aforestry 3aforests 3aguidelines 3apublications 3aresearchers 3ascientists 3astudents 3asurveys 0ahandbook 0atime 0amotion 0aEuropean1 aKanzian, Christian1 aSchulmeyer, Fabian1 aSpinelli, Raffaele0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2013 Nov. 1, v. 24, no. 3 p.249-253dTaylor & Francisx1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2013.8566133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02164naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245009400171300001600265500001400281520088300295592002801178650002001206650001601226650000901242650001501251650001901266650001501285650002001300650001601320650001101336653001601347653001201363653001501375700002301390700002401413700002401437700001301461700001801474773014901492856008001641852000901721655001201730IND60710069620221121031330.0200908e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071006962DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.76582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumari, K.

Layers (528) were fed with diets containing two protein levels i.e. 13.36 and 15.78% each with 5% concentration variations of lysine (0.50, 0.55, 0.60, 0.65, and 0.70) and a control with 17% CP and 0.70% lysine. Each diet was fed to six replicates of eight birds. Egg production, feed intake, body weight were not influenced either by the concentration of lysine or by level of protein in diet. Increased (P d ”0.05) egg weight and egg mass were observed with increasing lysine in diets. Better feed efficiency was observed with increasing lysine concentration. It can be concluded that WLH layers require approximately 0.65% lysine with 13.36% CP or 0.63% lysine with 15.78% CP (i.e. 598.80 vs 570 mg/h/day) in diet.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3abody weight 3adiet 3aegg masses 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3alysine 0aPerformance 0aProtein 0aWLH layers1 aReddy, V.

Here, we tested the hypothesis whether H6pd knock‐out (KO) in primary murine bone marrow‐derived macrophages results in a switch from 11β‐HSD1 oxoreduction to dehydrogenation, thereby inactivating glucocorticoids (GC) and affecting macrophage phenotypic activation as well as causing a more aggressive M1 macrophage phenotype. H6pdKO did not lead to major disturbances of macrophage activation state, although a slightly more pronounced M1 phenotype was observed with enhanced proinflammatory cytokine release, an effect explained by the decreased 11β‐HSD1‐dependent GC activation. Unexpectedly, ablation of H6pd did not switch 11β‐HSD1 reaction direction. A moderately decreased 11β‐HSD1 oxoreduction activity by 40–50% was observed in H6pdKO M1 macrophages but dehydrogenation activity was undetectable, providing strong evidence for the existence of an alternative source of NADPH in the ER. H6pdKO M1 activated macrophages showed decreased phagocytic activity, most likely a result of the reduced 11β‐HSD1‐dependent GC activation. Other general macrophage functions reported to be influenced by GC, such as nitrite production and cholesterol efflux, were altered negligibly or not at all. Importantly, assessment of energy metabolism using an extracellular flux analyzer and lactate measurements revealed reduced overall glucose consumption in H6pdKO M1 activated macrophages, an effect that was GC independent. The GC‐independent influence of H6PD on energy metabolism and the characterization of the alternative source of NADPH in the ER warrant further investigations.

In each of the air and root temperatures, rose cuttings from different positions of the flower shoot were rooted. The effects of air and root temperatures and their interactions on root formation of chrysanthemum and rose cuttings were studied. Increasing the air temperature from 15°C to 21°C accelerated rooting and distinctly increased the number of roots per cutting on both plants. Higher root temperatures (24°C, 27°C) had a favorable influence on the rate of the rooting process but did not enhance the number of formed roots. Increasing both temperatures significantly increased the growth of the roots and their fresh and dry weight. An adverse effect of the root temperature was noticed on the breaking and growth of rose buds. Increasing the temperature from 21°C to 27°C strongly decreased the percentage of breaking buds and their growth. The results are discussed from the point of view of the influence air temperature on the contents of growth substances in the cuttings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysanthemum 3aadverse effects 3aair 3aair temperature 3abuds 3acultivars 3aplant cuttings 3arooting1 aHagen, Paul1 aMoe, Hoar0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 40, no. 1-2 p.27-39dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.1987.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01921naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002700141245007000168300001400238520086500252592002801117650001401145650000901159650000801168650001101176650002501187650002101212650001401233650000901247650001301256650001201269650001001281650001101291700002201302700002001324773010701344856007501451852000901526655001201535IND60643708720221121182016.0190513e20130823xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064370872DNAL7 a10.5586/aa.1987.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKukułczanka, Krystyna14aThe effect of the substratum on the in vitro culture of Cymbidium  ap. 41-51.  aThe effect of different substrata (agar, pearl barley, oat flakes and perlite) on the growth and development of orchids. Cymbidium, in the early stages of development in in vitro cultures was studied. Liquid PB medium, complete and without peptone, was added to the substratum. The best growth of Cymbidium shoots and roots was observed on pearl barley. The oat flake substratum favored the growth of shoots, however, due to poor air proportions, the numerous developing roots were damaged. The few roots which arose on the traditional agar substratum grew on its surface. Perlite provided perfect air conditions for the development of roots, but was too poor in nutrients. The presence of peptone in the medium caused the increase of fresh weight of Cymbidium plants. The macroelement content in the plant was dependent on the supply from the substratum used.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbidium 3aagar 3aair 3abarley 3adevelopmental stages 3ain vitro culture 3anutrients 3aoats 3apeptones 3aperlite 3aroots 3ashoots1 aCząstka, Barbara1 aMarczonek, Anna0 tActa agrobotanica.g, v. 40, no. 1-2 p.41-51dPolish Botanical SocietywJournal:14720x2300-357X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.1987.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03044naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245013400209520142800343592002801771650002801799650002101827650001901848650001701867650001001884650002201894650003301916650001101949650001101960650002001971650001801991650001102009651001002020653002402030653001702054653001902071653002602090653004302116653002502159700001702184700001702201700001302218700001402231700001902245700005802264773011902322856008802441852000902529655001202538IND60676593720221121032710.0200503e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067659372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1345432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Chuanbo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9807-391510aEutrophication and heavy metal pollution patterns in the water suppling lakes of China’s south-to-north water diversion project  aThis study used non-supervised machine learning self-organizing maps (SOM) in conjunction with traditional multivariate statistical techniques (e.g., hierarchical cluster analysis, principle component analysis, Pearson’s correlation analysis) to investigate spatio-temporal patterns of eutrophication and heavy metal pollution in the water supplying lakes (i.e., the Gao-Bao-Shaobo Lake, GBSL) of the eastern route of China’s South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP-ER). A total of 28 water quality parameters were seasonally monitored at 33 sampling sites in the GBSL during 2016 to 2017 (i.e., 132 water samples were collected in four seasons). The results indicated that: 1) spatially, the western and south-western GBSL was relatively more eutrophic and polluted with heavy metals; and 2) temporally, the lakes suffered from high risks of heavy metal contamination in spring, but eutrophication in summer while water quality in winter was the best among the four seasons. Two main potential sources of pollution and transport routes were identified and discussed based on the pollution patterns. These findings contributed considerably to providing in-depth understanding of water pollution patterns, as well as potential pollution sources in the water-supplying region. Such understanding is crucial for developing pollution control and management strategies for this mega inter-basin water transfer project.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3acluster analysis 3aeutrophication 3aheavy metals 3alakes 3apollution control 3aprincipal component analysis 3aspring 3asummer 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awinter 3aChina 0aSelf-organizing Map 0aHeavy metals 0aEutrophication 0aMultivariate analysis 0aSouth-to-North Water Diversion Project 0aWater quality safety1 aChen, Yushun1 aXia, Wentong1 aQu, Xiao1 aYuan, Hui1 aXie, Songguang1 aLin, Lian-Shin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5578-47680 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 711 p.134543-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1345433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02080naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245011800157300001600275520093700291592002801228650001101256650001401267650001701281650002201298650001101320650001901331650001401350650001701364653002401381653001301405653001701418700001401435700001801449773015201467856007801619852000901697655001201706IND60523077220221121233311.0160605e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052307722DNAL7 a10.1515/znc-2006-3-4152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xin10aSalicylic Acid Decreases the Levels of Dehydrin-Like Proteins in Tibetan Hulless Barley Leaves under Water Stress  ap. 245-250.  aThe effects of salicylic acid (SA) on the accumulation of dehydrins in leaves of Tibetan hulless barley seedlings under water stress were investigated. The results indicated that SA decreased the levels of the four dehydrin-like proteins induced by water stress. The concentrations of these dehydrin-like proteins increased under water stress. However, their levels in SA-pretreated seedlings were always lower than in those receiving only water stress. Our results also indicated that the levels of dehydrin-like proteins decreased as the SA concentration increased. In SA-pretreated seedlings, electrolyte leakage, MDA and H₂O₂ content were rather higher than in seedlings receiving only water stress. By these results, we suggest that lower levels of dehydrin-like proteins in seedlings with SA treatment may be due to the greater accumulation of H₂O₂ induced by SA, which causes more oxidative injury under water stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3abarley 3adehydrins 3aelectrolytes 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aleaves 3asalicylic acid 3aseedlings 3awater stress 0aSalicylic Acid (SA) 0aDehydrin 0aWater Stress1 aYuan, Shu1 aLin, Hong-Hui0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung.g2014 June 2, v. 61, no. 3-4 p.245-250dVerlag der Zeitschrift für NaturforschungwJournal:23183x1865-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znc-2006-3-4153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01517naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245005900162300001500221500001900236520071800255592002800973650001401001650001501015651001001030773012001040856008201160852000901242655001201251IND60688693620221119013433.0200416e19920101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068869362DNAL7 a10.1080/0961452491000767012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLane, Jon10aWorking with local NGOs: WaterAid's programme in Nepal  ap. 92-102.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis article describes the evolution of WaterAid's programme of work in Nepal, based on the author's experiences while working as WaterAid's Representative Engineer in Nepal from 1987 to 1991.

Various problems and constraints are identified and discussed, and certain points are highlighted which may be of general interest to other external support agencies working in similar ways in other countries and sectors. The overall conclusion is that this programme represents a viable methodology for an international NGO to achieve useful results in supporting local NGOs working in development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aevolution 3aphilosophy 3aNepal0 tDevelopment in practice.g1992 Jan. 1, v. 2, no. 2 p.92-102dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0961452491000767013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02350naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245010500162520138500267592002801652650001301680650002301693650001301716650001701729650000901746700003501755700002701790700002401817773012001841856007801961852000902039655001202048IND60757748620221119093532.0211125e20211023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075774862DNAL7 a10.3390/genes121116812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElsayed, Inas 10aMapping the Diverse and Inclusive Future of Parkinson’s Disease Genetics and Its Widespread Impact  aOver the last decades, genetics has been the engine that has pushed us along on our voyage to understand the etiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although a large number of risk loci and causative mutations for PD have been identified, it is clear that much more needs to be done to solve the missing heritability mystery. Despite remarkable efforts, as a field, we have failed in terms of diversity and inclusivity. The vast majority of genetic studies in PD have focused on individuals of European ancestry, leading to a gap of knowledge on the existing genetic differences across populations and PD as a whole. As we move forward, shedding light on the genetic architecture contributing to PD in non-European populations is essential, and will provide novel insight into the generalized genetic map of the disease. In this review, we discuss how better representation of understudied ancestral groups in PD genetics research requires addressing and resolving all the challenges that hinder the inclusion of these populations. We further provide an overview of PD genetics in the clinics, covering the current challenges and limitations of genetic testing and counseling. Finally, we describe the impact of worldwide collaborative initiatives in the field, shaping the future of the new era of PD genetics as we advance in our understanding of the genetic architecture of PD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aancestry 3achromosome mapping 3aetiology 3aheritability 3arisk1 aMartínez Carrasco, Alejandro,1 aCornejo-Olivas, Mario 1 aBandres-Ciga, Sara 0 tGenes.g2021 Oct. 23, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes121116813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03155naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245010900205300001600314506007600330520179700406592002802203506003702231650001602268650001702284650001602301650001202317650001202329650001702341650001702358700001702375700001902392700001902411700001502430700001902445700005502464773012302519856008202642852000902724655001202733IND60594603320221207094945.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059460332DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-018-0709-x2doi7 aPMC59789042pmcid7 a294763062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qiang10aPotential high-frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in Arabidopsis and its prevention  ap. 445-456.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aKEY MESSAGE: We present novel observations of high-specificity SpCas9 variants, sgRNA expression strategies based on mutant sgRNA scaffold and tRNA processing system, and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated T-DNA integrations. Specificity of CRISPR/Cas9 tools has been a major concern along with the reports of their successful applications. We report unexpected observations of high frequency off-target mutagenesis induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in T1 Arabidopsis mutants although the sgRNA was predicted to have a high specificity score. We also present evidence that the off-target effects were further exacerbated in the T2 progeny. To prevent the off-target effects, we tested and optimized two strategies in Arabidopsis, including introduction of a mCherry cassette for a simple and reliable isolation of Cas9-free mutants and the use of highly specific mutant SpCas9 variants. Optimization of the mCherry vectors and subsequent validation found that fusion of tRNA with the mutant rather than the original sgRNA scaffold significantly improves editing efficiency. We then examined the editing efficiency of eight high-specificity SpCas9 variants in combination with the improved tRNA-sgRNA fusion strategy. Our results suggest that highly specific SpCas9 variants require a higher level of expression than their wild-type counterpart to maintain high editing efficiency. Additionally, we demonstrate that T-DNA can be inserted into the cleavage sites of CRISPR/Cas9 targets with high frequency. Altogether, our results suggest that in plants, continuous attention should be paid to off-target effects induced by CRISPR/Cas9 in current and subsequent generations, and that the tools optimized in this report will be useful in improving genome editing efficiency and specificity in plants and other organisms.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3agene editing 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aprogeny 3atransfer DNA 3atransfer RNA1 aXing, Hui-Li1 aWang, Zhi-Ping1 aZhang, Hai-Yan1 aYang, Fang1 aWang, Xue-Chen1 aChen, Qi-Jun1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7827-82110 tPlant molecular biology.g2018 Mar., v. 96, no. 4-5 p.445-456dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl33639x0167-44127nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-018-0709-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01851naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011900162300001400281520077000295592002801065650002501093650001901118650001301137653001501150653002301165653003401188653005101222700001501273700002001288700002501308773009001333856008101423852000901504655001201513IND60544815720221119232845.0160901e20151105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054481572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Yu-bo10aReview of the recent progress in photoresponsive molecularly imprinted polymers containing azobenzene chromophores  ap. 10-20.  aPhotoresponsive molecularly imprinted polymers (PMIPs) containing azobenzene have received wide research attention in recent years and made notable achievements.

Within the Tonle Sap basin, freshwater molluscs provide vital ecosystem services and are among the fauna targetted for commercial harvesting. Despite their importance, freshwater molluscs of the Tonle Sap basin remain poorly studied. The historical literature was reviewed and at least 153 species of freshwater molluscs have been previously recorded from throughout Cambodia, including 33 from the Tonle Sap basin. Surveys of the Tonle Sap Lake and surrounding watershed were also conducted and found 31 species, 15 bivalves (five families) and 16 gastropods (eight families), in the Tonle Sap basin, including three new records for Cambodia (Scaphula minuta, Novaculina siamensis, Wattebledia siamensis), the presence of globally invasive Pomacea maculata and potential pest species like Limnoperna fortunei. This study represents the most comprehensive documentation of freshwater molluscs of the Tonle Sap basin, and voucher specimens deposited at the Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, Cambodia, represent the first known reference collection of freshwater molluscs in the country. In order to combat the combined anthropogenic pressures, including invasive species, climate change and dams along the Mekong River, a multi-pronged approach is urgently required to study the biodiversity, ecology, ecosystem functioning of freshwater molluscs and other aquatic fauna in the Tonle Sap basin.  aInland Fisheries Research and Development Institute Cambodia  aPublisher supplied data 3aLimnoperna fortunei 3aPomacea maculata 3abasins 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3afauna 3afreshwater 3afreshwater lakes 3ainvasive species 3aresearch and development 3awatersheds 3aCambodia 3aMekong River 0aalien species 0abivalves 0adiversity 0aeconomic species 0aLower Mekong basin 0asnails 0aTonle Sap Lake1 aJeratthitikul, Ekgachai1 aČhirasak Sutčharit,1 aChhuoy, Samol1 aPin, Kakada1 aPholyotha, Arthit1 aSiriwut, Warut1 aSrisonchai, Ruttapon1 aHogan, Zeb S.1 aNgor, Peng Bun0 tZooKeys.g2020 Aug. 11, v. 958 p.107-141dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2141x1313-29707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/zookeys.958.538653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03484naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100005800188245009700246300001200343506007600355520200800431592002802439596005502467506003702522650002502559650001902584650001202603650001502615650001602630650001102646650001002657650001702667650002102684650001702705650001802722650001402740650002402754700001702778700002302795773011702818856008202935852000903017655001203026IND60619531720221207075425.0210216e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061953172DNAL7 a303828872pmid7 aPMC62114302pmcid7 a10.1186/s12917-018-1652-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJawor, Paulina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3141-672210aPerinatal immuno/inflammatory responses in the presence or absence of bovine fetal infection  ap. 322.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: It is known that the bovine fetus can mount an immune and inflammatory reaction to infection, but it is not known whether there is a contemporaneous maternal response. Nor is it known whether the response of calves which die perinatally, with or without infection, differs from that of live perinates. Hence, the objective of this study was to determine if acute phase reactant and immunoglobulin concentrations differed between calves (and their dams) in three groups: live calves (CC; n = 21) and dead calves with (PM INF+; n = 22) or without (PM INF-; n = 89) in utero infection. In calf plasma, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, immunoglobulins M, G₁ and G₂ and interleukin-6 were measured. In dam serum, SAA and Hp was measured and in amniotic and abomasal fluid, IL-6 was measured. RESULTS: Live calves had higher plasma concentrations of SAA and IL-6 than dead calves with (PM INF+) or without (PM INF-) in utero infection. Calves in the PM INF-, but not PM INF+ group, had higher Hp concentrations than calves in the CC group. Calves in the PM INF+ group had higher IgG₁ concentrations than calves in the PM INF- and CC groups. Except for higher IgG₁ and IgG₂ concentrations, biomarker values did not differ significantly between dead calves with or without in utero infection. Live calves had higher IL-6 concentrations in abomasal fluid compared to PM INF- calves. There were no significant differences in blood biomarker concentrations between dams of the three groups of calves. Amniotic fluid IL-6 concentrations were higher from the dams of control calves than the dams of uninfected calves. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in biomarkers (higher Hp and IgG₁; lower SAA and IL-6) between perinatal mortalities and live perinates probably reflect differences between these two groups in age at sampling (SAA and IL-6) and in utero infection (IgG₁). Out of the six analytes measured in calves, only IgG₁ and IgG₂ were biomarkers of (chronic) in utero infection.  aPublisher supplied data  aPBS2/A8/20/2013cNarodowe Centrum Badań i Rozwoju0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute phase proteins 3aamniotic fluid 3aamyloid 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3acalves 3afetus 3ahaptoglobins 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3amortality 3aveterinary medicine1 aMee, John F.1 aStefaniak, Tadeusz0 tBMC veterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 14, no. 1 p.322-322dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1652-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245008300166520158400249592002801833650000801861650002501869650002201894650001601916650002501932650001901957650002001976650001101996700002102007700002402028700002602052700002202078700002302100700002302123700002302146700002602169700002502195773012002220856007802340852000902418655001202427IND60757748720221119095003.0211125e20211023xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075774872DNAL7 a10.3390/genes121116822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalberova, Olga V.10aCandidate Genes of Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Energy Metabolism in Athletes  aAll biological processes associated with high sports performance, including energy metabolism, are influenced by genetics. DNA sequence variations in such genes, single nucleotide variants (SNVs), could confer genetic advantages that can be exploited to achieve optimal athletic performance. Ignorance of these features can create genetic “barriers” that prevent professional athletes from pursuing a career in sports. Predictive Genomic DNA Profiling reveals single nucleotide variations (SNV) that may be associated with better suitability for endurance, strength and speed sports. (1) Background: To conduct a research on candidate genes associated with regulation of skeletal muscle energy metabolism among athletes. (2) Methods: We have searched for articles in SCOPUS, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Clinical keys, PubMed, e-LIBRARY databases for the period of 2010–2020 using keywords and keywords combinations; (4) Conclusions: Identification of genetic markers associated with the regulation of energy metabolism in skeletal muscles can help sports physicians and coaches develop personalized strategies for selecting children, teenagers and young adults for endurance, strength and speed sports (such as jogging, middle or long distance runs). However, the multifactorial aspect of sport performances, including impact of genetics, epigenetics, environment (training and etc.), is important for personalized strategies for selecting of athletes. This approach could improve sports performance and reduce the risk of sports injuries to the musculoskeletal system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aathletic performance 3aenergy metabolism 3aepigenetics 3anucleotide sequences 3arisk reduction 3askeletal muscle 3asports1 aBykov, Evgeny V.1 aMedvedev, German V.1 aZhogina, Margarita A.1 aPetrov, Kirill V.1 aPetrova, Marina M.1 aAl-Zamil, Mustafa 1 aTrefilova, Vera V.1 aGoncharova, Polina S.1 aShnayder, Natalia A.0 tGenes.g2021 Oct. 23, v. 12, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes121116823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03549naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094024002000136024001900156040001800175100001700193245008500210300001200295506007600307520202300383592002802406506003702434650001202471650000802483650002002491650001502511650001702526650001802543650001502561650001302576650001402589650002102603650001002624650001402634650000902648650001202657650002002669650001402689650003702703650001302740650001502753650002202768650001102790700001802801773010302819856008802922852000903010655001203019IND60119447020221207045640.0141214e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011944702DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2001-2-3-research00092doi7 aPMC307082pmcid7 a112764262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Susan14aThe cohesin complex: sequence homologies, interaction networks and shared motifs  ap. 211.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Cohesin is a macromolecular complex that links sister chromatids together at the metaphase plate during mitosis. The links are formed during DNA replication and destroyed during the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. In budding yeast, the 14S cohesin complex comprises at least two classes of SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) proteins - Smc1 and Smc3 - and two SCC (sister-chromatid cohesion) proteins - Scc1 and Scc3. The exact function of these proteins is unknown. RESULTS: Searches of protein sequence databases have revealed new homologs of cohesin proteins. In mouse, Mmip1 (Mad member interacting protein 1) and Smc3 share 99% sequence identity and are products of the same gene. A phylogenetic tree of SMC homologs reveals five families: Smc1, Smc2, Smc3, Smc4 and an ancestral family that includes the sequences from the Archaea and Eubacteria. This ancestral family also includes sequences from eukaryotes. A cohesion interaction network, comprising 17 proteins, has been constructed using two proteomic databases. Genes encoding six proteins in the cohesion network share a common upstream region that includes the MluI cell-cycle box (MCB) element. Pairs of the proteins in this network share common sequence motifs that could represent common structural features such as binding sites. Scc2 shares a motif with Chk1 (kinase checkpoint protein), that comprises part of the serine/threonine protein kinase motif, including the active-site residue. CONCLUSIONS: We have combined genomic and proteomic data into a comprehensive network of information to reach a better understanding of the function of the cohesin complex. We have identified new SMC homologs, created a new SMC phylogeny and identified shared DNA and protein motifs. The potential for Scc2 to function as a kinase - a hypothesis that needs to be verified experimentally - could provide further evidence for the regulation of sister-chromatid cohesion by phosphorylation mechanisms, which are currently poorly understood.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArchaea 3aDNA 3aDNA replication 3aEubacteria 3aactive sites 3abinding sites 3achromatids 3acohesion 3adatabases 3aeukaryotic cells 3agenes 3ametaphase 3amice 3amitosis 3aphosphorylation 3aphylogeny 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aproteins 3aproteomics 3asequence homology 3ayeasts1 aSgouros, John0 tGenome biology.g2001 Mar., v. 2, no. 3 p.211-211dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2001-2-3-research00093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002100165245014200186300001600328520137300344592002801717650002301745650000901768650001901777650001001796650002201806650001301828650002201841650003001863650001301893650001201906650001201918650002801930650003001958650006501988650000902053650001102062650000902073650004202082650008802124650004202212650004402254650002602298651001002324651002502334653002302359653002702382653002802409653001502437653003802452700001802490700002302508700001802531700002402549700002102573700002302594700002202617773013202639852000902771856008302780655001202863IND4457859620221118061329.0181016e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445785962DNAL7 a212170422pmid7 a10.1177/1040638711023001222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGentilini, Fabio10aFrequency of the Allelic Variant of the PTPLA Gene Responsible for Centronuclear Myopathy in Labrador Retriever Dogs as Assessed in Italy  ap. 124-126.  aCentronuclear myopathy (CNM) is an autosomal recessive hereditary disease affecting Labrador Retriever dogs. The disease is characterized by muscle lesions, typically encompassing reduction in the number and atrophy of type II fibers, and is caused by a short interspersed repeat element insertion in exon 2 of the protein tyrosine phosphatase-like member A. The actual allele frequency is unknown; a study was undertaken to ascertain it using a convenience-sample population composed of 217 Labrador Retrievers. In addition to 3 subjects already diagnosed with CNM, used as positive controls for polymerase chain reaction, only 2 unrelated dogs were heterozygous wild-type/mutation (wild-type/mut). Thus, the frequency of the CNM allele observed in the present study was 1.8% and 0.47% when including and excluding the 3 mut/ mut homozygous cases, respectively. Based on the Hardy–Weinberg exact test (P = 1.00), the genotype frequency without the CNM-affected dogs was in agreement with the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Assuming the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium law, the expected frequency of the homozygous mutated genotype was calculated to be approximately 0.00005, which corresponds to 1 case of CNM out of 20,000 dogs. In conclusion, the present study indicates that the CNM allele is present but rare in a convenience sample of Labrador Retrievers in Italy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabrador Retriever 3adogs 3agene frequency 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3agenotype 3amuscular diseases 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atyrosine 2aAlleles 2aAnimals 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aDNAxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDog Diseasesxenzymologyxepidemiologyxgeneticsxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMuscle Fibers, Fast-Twitchxpathology 2aMyopathies, Structural, Congenitalxenzymologyxepidemiologyxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 2aProtein Tyrosine Phosphatasesxgenetics 2aRetrospective Studies 3aItaly 0aItalyxepidemiology. 0aAllele frequencies 0acentronuclear myopathy 0aLabrador Retriever dogs 0aPTPLA gene 0ashort interspersed repeat element1 aZambon, Elisa1 aGandini, Gualtiero1 aRosati, Marco1 aSpadari, Alessandro1 aRomagnoli, Noemi1 aTurba, Maria Elena1 aGernone, Floriana0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 23, no. 1 p.124-126dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638711023001223Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02903naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245009800166300001600264520171400280592002801994650002302022650001202045650001602057650002002073650002402093650002402117650002102141650002102162650001502183651001002198700001702208700001902225700001202244700001502256700001402271700001302285773010502298856008102403852000902484655001202493IND50072187420221120032508.0150212e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007218742DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-013-0852-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Xiaoqin10aShort-term effects of thinning on soil respiration in a pine (Pinus tabulaeformis) plantation  ap. 357-367.  aRespiration was measured at daytime during the growing seasons (May–October) of 2011 and 2012 in a young Pinus tabulaeformis plantation with heavy, medium and light intensity thinning and unthinned control plots in Shanxi province in northern China. Soil temperature, moisture, fine root biomass, amounts of soil organic C and litterfall biomass were also measured. We found that immediately following thinning treatments, soil respiration increased by 8 %–21 % compared with the unthinned control plots during both growing seasons. Thinning significantly affected soil respiration and soil temperature with different thinning intensities, while there were no significant differences in soil moisture among the various treatments. During the growing seasons, the soil respiration rates were positively correlated with the soil moisture: the 19.4 %–54.0 % variation in soil respiration rates in the four thinning regimes are explained by the changes in soil moisture. Meanwhile, a positive correlation was found between soil temperature and soil respiration rates at all sites. The best fitting model with temperature and moisture explained 44.3 % of the variation in soil respiration in the high thinning treatment, 27.6 % in the light thinning treatment, 18.6 % in medium thinning and in the control sites during the measuring periods. Overall, soil respiration is better predicted by soil moisture, soil organic C, live fine root biomass and soil temperature when data are pooled for all thinning treatments over the two growing seasons.

In this study, we explored changes in the trophic niche overlap of dung beetles between the native forest and different land uses in the semideciduous Atlantic forest, under the hypothesis that trophic niche overlap increases with species richness. We sampled dung beetles in protected native forests and four land uses (pine plantations, agroforestry parklands, silvo‐pastoral systems and open pastures), using seven potential food sources (monkey, feline, tapir and deer dung, decomposing fruit, decomposing fungi and carrion). The species richness of each habitat, the trophic niche overlap and the relation between both measures were analysed. Also, we explored species trophic preferences in each habitat to explain and discuss the results obtained in trophic niche overlap measures. As expected, our results showed a positive relation between species richness and trophic niche overlap. Moreover, the addition of different resources in open habitats did not increase species richness, suggesting that resource availability may not be the main mechanism explaining the empoverished dung beetle community observed in open habitats. Other mechanisms, such as physiological restrictions, may play a role in limiting the use of these habitats. Studies on the mechanisms leading to the patterns of species abundance and diversity observed in land uses are necessary to propose management recommendations that increase the sustainability of open habitats.  aPublisher supplied data  a22920160100130COcCONICET  aPIA 10105‐14057cUCAR‐MAGyP  aPICT‐PRH 2702cANPCyT 3acats 3adead animals 3adeer 3adung beetles 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3afeces 3aforest canopy 3aforests 3afruits 3afungi 3ahabitats 3ainsect communities 3aland use 3amonkeys 3apastures 3aplantations 3asilvopastoral systems 3aspecies abundance 3aspecies richness 3aArgentina1 aVerdú, José R.1 aGómez‐Cifuentes, Andrés1 aVaz‐de‐Mello, Fernando Z.1 aZurita, Gustavo A.0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2018 Nov., v. 11, no. 6 p.554-564dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.122993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02694naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245011600157300002000273520144100293592002801734650002001762650001601782650001801798650002001816650001001836650001601846650001201862650002501874650001801899650004401917650002701961650002001988650001102008650001502019700001802034700001202052773013602064856007502200852000902275655001202284IND60536949320221120033310.0160807e20121024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053694932DNAL7 a10.1021/ie301401a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Fangang10aCure of Filament-Caused MBR Fouling in the Presence of Antibiotics: Taking Ciprofloxacin Exposure As an Example  ap. 13784-13791.  aPharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) are ubiquitous in wastewater streams, but little is known regarding their roles in membrane fouling during the operation of membrane bioreactors (MBRs). This study attempted to understand the role of ciprofloxacin exposure in control of filamentous bulking as well as membrane fouling mitigation. Compared with the control MBR, results show that the ciprofloxacin could selectively inhibit and kill filaments present in the mixed liquor, and, as a consequence, the sludge settleability improved significantly. The addition of ciprofloxacin had little influence on organic removals and nitrification, but had an adverse effect on denitrification. In addition, the sludge flocs exposure to ciprofloxacin still kept in compact structure; specifically, granular sludge was finally formed possibly due to the increase of polysaccharides in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) corroborated the enrichment of polysaccharides in the EPS exposure to ciprofloxacin. On the other hand, because of the release of EPS and the decay of filaments, soluble microbial products (SMP), particularly soluble polysaccharides, increased significantly in the MBR exposure to ciprofloxacin. Despite this, the results of this study show that the presence of trace contaminants in wastewater streams may play some positive roles in MBR fouling control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aantibiotics 3aciprofloxacin 3adenitrification 3adrugs 3aengineering 3afouling 3amembrane bioreactors 3anitrification 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apersonal care products 3apolysaccharides 3asludge 3awastewater1 aWang, Zhizhen1 aLi, Yue0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2012 Oct. 24, v. 51, no. 42 p.13784-13791dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie301401a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012500164520130000289592002801589650001201617650001301629650001401642650001901656650001301675650000901688700002001697700001701717773012101734856007801855852000901933655001201942IND60754236620221120073102.0211023e20210928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075423662DNAL7 a10.3390/genes121015302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoon, Byung-Woo 10aRisk Allele Frequency Analysis of Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms for Vitamin D Concentrations in Different Ethnic Group  aThe prevalence of vitamin D deficiency varies from 20.8% to 61.6% among populations of different ethnicities, suggesting the existence of a genetic component. The purpose of this study was to provide insights into the genetic causes of vitamin D concentration differences among individuals of diverse ancestry. We collected 320 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with vitamin D concentrations from a genome-wide association studies catalog. Their population-level allele frequencies were derived based on the 1000 Genomes Project and Korean Reference Genome Database. We used Fisher’s exact tests to assess the significance of the enrichment or depletion of the effect allele at a given SNP in the database. In addition, we calculated the SNP-based genetic risk score (GRS) and performed correlation analysis with vitamin D concentration that included latitude. European, American, and South Asian populations showed similar heatmap patterns, whereas African, East Asian, and Korean populations had distinct ones. The GRS calculated from allele frequencies of vitamin D concentration was highest among Europeans, followed by East Asians and Africans. In addition, the difference in vitamin D concentration was highly correlated with genetic factors rather than latitude effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aancestry 3adatabases 3agene frequency 3alatitude 3arisk1 aShin, Hyun-Tae 1 aSeo, Jehyun 0 tGenes.g2021 Sept. 28, v. 12, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27140x2073-44257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/genes121015303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245014500162300001600307500001400323520150300337592002801840650002101868650002001889650002201909651001001931653001901941653001601960653001301976653000901989653002001998653001602018653002402034653001402058700002102072700002102093700001702114700001702131773014902148856008002297852000902377655001202386IND60710070420221119034352.0200908e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071007042DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJadoun, Y S10aConstraints faced by animal husbandry officials in the implementation of integrated murrah development scheme (IMDS) in Haryana State, India  ap. 944-947.  aNAL-light  aA study has been conducted in Haryana to analyze the various constraints faced by animal husbandry officials in implementation of “Integrated Murrah Development Scheme ”(IMDS). Data were collected from 40 animal husbandry officials from four districts namely Kurukshetra, Mahendragarh, Bhiwani and Jhajjar. Garett 's ranking technique was used to prioritize the different sets of constraints. “Heavy work-load due to multidimensional activities of the project during peak season ”and “Inadequacy of staff in the scheme ”were the major administrative constraints in order of severity. Under technical constraints “lack of mass media approach ”followed by “No provision for the refresher courses for the programme functionaries ”were the most severe. “Inadequate number of staff at field level and large area of operation under a single supervisor ”followed by “lack of involvement of NGO and PRIs in enhancing community participation ”were important infrastructural and operational constraints. Untimely release of fund by the parent department and misguidance of farmers by the middlemen/Brokers were the economic and socio-psychological constraints, respectively. Lack of technical expertise in the field of extension, lack of emphasis on educating the dairy farmers were other important miscellaneous constraints faced by animal husbandry officials. Removal of these constraints should receive priority over the considerable focus on the implementation of such scheme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal husbandry 3aanimal research 3acommunity service 3aIndia 0aAdministrative 0aConstraints 0aEconomic 0aIMDS 0aInfrastructural 0aOperational 0aSocio-psychological 0aTechnical1 aJha, Surya Kant,1 aBhaduria, Pragya1 aGupta, Rohit1 aSingh, Ruchi0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2017 Oct., v. 51, no. 5 p.944-947dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.v0iOF.91343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245011400154300001600268500001400284500001700298520132500315592002801640596004001668596002501708650002501733650001101758650000801769650001501777650001601792650001601808650000901824650001201833650001201845650001401857650001001871650001501881650001401896650002501910650001401935650001501949650001401964650000901978650001301987650001902000650001602019651001402035651002102049700002302070700005202093773013602145856007302281852000902354655001202363IND60707285720221120132724.0200819e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070728572DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.129832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuffalo, G12aA canine distemper virus seroprevalence study of dogs on three islands in the Torres Strait region, Australia  ap. 371-374.  aNAL-light  aCase Reports  aCanine distemper virus (CDV) can cause mortality in domestic dogs, which is easily prevented by the consistent application of vaccination protocols. The aim of this study was to determine if the dog populations of three strategically located islands in the Torres Strait of Australia, adjacent to Papua New Guinea, are infected by CDV. Eighty‐four serum samples were collected from 70 dogs resident on Saibai, Dauan and Boigu Islands during 2017–2018. Sera were tested for CDV antibodies by a virus neutralization test (VNT). Overall, 7 (8.3%) sera from 6 (8.6%) dogs resident on all three islands were test positive. VNT titres ranged from 20 to >1280. Male adult dogs were more commonly seropositive than female and juvenile dogs. Considering the origin and age of test positive dogs, and veterinary visits to these islands, it was concluded that there is evidence of exposure to a field strain of CDV – rather than previous vaccination – in 4 of the 70 dogs (5.7%) tested in this study. Given the strategic location of these islands in a zone of high biosecurity risk, ongoing surveillance of pathogens such as CDV could inform on potential disease spread pathways in this region. In addition, the presence of high serological titres in the apparent absence of clinical disease requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data  cSydney School of Veterinary Science  cUniversity of Sydney 3aCanine morbillivirus 3aadults 3aage 3aantibodies 3abiosecurity 3ablood serum 3adogs 3afemales 3aislands 3ajuveniles 3amales 3amonitoring 3amortality 3aneutralization tests 3apathogens 3apopulation 3aprotocols 3arisk 3asampling 3aseroprevalence 3avaccination 3aAustralia 3aPapua New Guinea1 aByers, Margaretta,1 aWard, MP1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9921-49860 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2020 Aug., v. 98, no. 8 p.371-374dWiley Publishing Asia Pty LtdwJournal:jnl45498x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.129833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245012000165300001600285500002000301520161800321592002801939596003101967596005201998650003402050650001702084650001102101650002102112650000902133650002402142650001202166650001302178650001902191650001202210650001902222650001002241650002102251650001102272650001102283650002002294650002502314651002802339700002502367700001702392700002402409700002002433700002102453773013502474856007402609852000902683655001202692IND60620152620221119230626.0181106e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062015262DNAL7 a10.1111/icad.123022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoniatowski, Dominik14aThe invasion of Bromus erectus alters species diversity of vascular plants and leafhoppers in calcareous grasslands  ap. 578-586.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe most common mechanism of biological invasions is an increase in competition, which usually results in the loss of biodiversity. The invasion of Bromus erectus (Syn. Bromopsis erecta) in calcareous grasslands of western and central Europe is well‐documented. Although, it is largely unknown to what extent this development affects biodiversity. In this study, we analysed the effects of B. erectus invasion on vascular plant and leafhopper assemblages of calcareous grasslands. At each of the 15 randomly selected sites, we compared one plot with stands of Bromus (presence) and one without (absence) (paired sampling design). The invasion of B. erectus affected vegetation structure as well as vascular plant and leafhopper assemblages. Despite similar abiotic site characteristics, Bromus plots had a higher turf height, vegetation density, and litter cover. Additionally, we recorded a much lower species richness in Bromus plots than in absence plots in all analysed groups of vascular plants. A similar pattern was found for leafhoppers. Absence plots exhibited a higher species richness of habitat and diet specialists than Bromus plots. The overall abundance of all leafhopper species was highest in presence plots, whereas that of diet specialists peaked in absence plots. We conclude that the ongoing invasion of B. erectus will lead to a strong structural homogenisation with negative effects on plant and insect diversity. One possible management tool might be a goal‐driven rough grazing with sheep – especially in spring when B. erectus is much more palatable than in summer and autumn.  aPublisher supplied data  cBundesamt für Naturschutz  cAkademie für ökologische Landesforschung e.V. 3aBromus erectus subsp. erectus 3aCicadellidae 3aautumn 3achalk grasslands 3adiet 3aecological invasion 3agrazing 3ahabitats 3ahomogenization 3ainsects 3alawns and turf 3asheep 3aspecies richness 3aspring 3asummer 3avascular plants 3avegetation structure 3aCentral European region1 aHertenstein, Florian1 aRaude, Nadja1 aGottbehüt, Kathrin1 aNickel, Herbert1 aFartmann, Thomas0 tInsect conservation and diversity.g2018 Nov., v. 11, no. 6 p.578-586dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:J000000087x1752-458X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/icad.123023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01728naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245007400165300001400239500001900253520082000272592002801092650001301120650001701133650001701150650002501167650001201192651001201204773011901216856008201335852000901417655001201426IND60688694220221119013315.0200416e19930101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068869422DNAL7 a10.1080/0961452491000769212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaFond, Anne10aDeterrents to immunisation in Somalia: A survey of mothers' attitudes  ap. 27-35.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAs part of the global drive to achieve Universal Child Immunisation by 1990 (UCI 90), Somalia launched a national immunisation programme for women and children. While access to it improved, actual demand for immunisation remained low. This article reports the findings of a study to identify the factors influencing acceptance of immunisation in two Somali communities. A retrospective, qualitative approach was adopted to assess individual and community experience both with immunisation and with the immunisation programme. Data were derived from focus group discussions, informal interviews and observation. The research findings provided programme managers and health workers with information for redesigning both the overall approach of the immunisation programme, and the content and style of health messages.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildren 3afocus groups 3aimmunization 3aqualitative analysis 3asurveys 3aSomalia0 tDevelopment in practice.g1993 Jan. 1, v. 3, no. 1 p.27-35dTaylor & Francis GroupwJournal:12201x1364-92137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0961452491000769213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245009000180300001300270520138000283592002801663650002001691650001401711650002301725650001701748650001301765650001101778650002501789653001801814653001301832653002001845653001401865653001801879653001701897700001801914773011801932856008402050852000902134655001202143IND60122866920221122061521.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012286692DNAL7 a10.1080/14942119.2014.9041502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAalmo, Giovanna Ottaviani10aOperator performance improvement through training in a controlled cable yarding study  ap. 5-13.  aThis paper provides evidence of improvement in cable yarder operator proficiency through initial training on a controlled site. Five subjects were included in the study: one expert (as control), two with limited experience in operating similar machines, and two with no experience. A 1:3 scale tower-yarder modeled on the Owren 400 was used as a test rig. A wireless control with two joysticks, used individually and in combination, covered all yarder and carriage functionality. The time taken to individually yard five logs was measured and repeated six times over two days for each subject. Cable tension in the system was simultaneously monitored as an indicator of operating consistency. Evidence of a distinct learning curve was obtained through statistical analysis by applying mixed-effects models. The standard deviations of times and tensions of the limited-experience group rapidly emulated the profiles of the expert, and subjects in the no-experience group were comfortable with the operation of the yarder controls after the six trial replications. A reduction in initial large fluctuations in cable tension demonstrated the usefulness of training. On-the-job training with full-scale machines under similar conditions could have led to system failure, with possible breakage of the tail spar, guy lines or mainline and potential material loss and human injury.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal injuries 3aequipment 3aforest engineering 3ajob training 3alearning 3amodels 3astatistical analysis 0acable yarding 0atraining 0alearning curves 0asimulator 0asteep terrain 0amixed models1 aTalbot, Bruce0 tInternational journal of forest engineering.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 25, no. 1 p.5-13dTaylor & Francisx1913-22207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14942119.2014.9041503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01397naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100002100193245006100214300001200275506007600287520036100363592002800724506003700752650000800789650001400797650001000811650002900821700002200850773010300872856008700975852000901062655001201071IND60119447420221207045644.0141214e200103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011944742DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2001-2-3-reviews00022doi7 aPMC1389132pmcid7 a112764272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwedlow, Jason R10aNuclear dynamics: where genes are and how they got there  ap. 155.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDNA is highly organized spatially, both within domains of chromatin along each chromosome and within the nucleus as a whole.

Here, we use output from a suite of 11 earth system models to examine projected changes in two ecosystem‐defining variables: temperature and food availability. In particular, we examine projected changes in epipelagic temperature and, as a proxy for food availability, zooplankton density. We find that under RCP8.5, a high business‐as‐usual greenhouse gas scenario, increasing temperatures may alter the spatial distribution of tuna and billfish species richness across the North Pacific basin. Furthermore, warmer waters and declining zooplankton densities may act together to lower carrying capacity for commercially valuable fish by 2–5% per decade over the 21st century. These changes have the potential to significantly impact the magnitude, composition, and distribution of commercial fish catch across the pelagic North Pacific. Such changes will in turn ultimately impact commercial fisheries’ economic value. Fishery managers should anticipate these climate impacts to ensure sustainable fishery yields and livelihoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3acarrying capacity 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aeconomic valuation 3afisheries 3afood availability 3agreenhouse gases 3alivelihood 3amarine ecosystems 3amodels 3aspecies diversity 3asustainable fisheries 3atemperature 3atuna 3azooplankton1 aPolovina, Jeffrey J.1 aDrazen, Jeffrey C.0 tGlobal change biology.g2017 Mar., v. 23, no. 3 p.1000-1008dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57021x1354-10137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gcb.134713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01882naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245010800160300001400268500001900282520087600301592002801177650001801205650001301223653002901236653002101265653002201286653002001308653003201328773012201360856007701482852000901559655001201568IND60734754220221119065328.0210422e20210401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073475422DNAL7 a10.1089/ind.2020.00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYum, Seungil14aThe Cluster Characteristics of Biotechnology Industries and Their Effect on Regional Innovation Systems  ap. 79-91.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study proposes a new Cluster Quotient (CQ) to highlight the cluster characteristics and their effect on regional innovation systems based on all US Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) in 2014. This study finds that San Diego, CA plays an important role in biotechnology industries, and the CQ index would be a better method to measure the degree of clusters than the Location Quotient index (LQ) given that the CQ method is based on the definition of a cluster and strongly correlated with high industry quotient MSAs. The study also highlights that biotechnology clusters have a positive impact on patents. An increase of 1% of the CQ generates an increase of 0.25% of patents. The result highlights that biotechnology clusters play an important role in regional innovation systems and need to be seriously taken into consideration in the field of urban planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiotechnology 3aindustry 0aBiotechnology industries 0acluster quotient 0alocation quotient 0acluster effects 0aregional innovation systems0 tIndustrial biotechnology.g2021 Apr. 01, v. 17, no. 2 p.79-91dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:19601x1931-84217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/ind.2020.00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002100094024003600115024001100151040001800162100002000180245005800200300001400258506017300272520096300445592002801408650001401436650002101450650001901471650002101490650001101511650001901522650002401541650002301565650001201588650001001600650002001610650003001630650002001660650001001680653001601690653002101706653001801727653001701745653002001762773011601782856008301898856011201981956011302093961000902206852000902215655001202224IND50069165420221117195647.0190318e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006916542DNAL7 a10113/573682hdl7 a10.1016/j.jspr.2012.10.0012doi8 ans2895  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHallman, Guy J.10aControl of stored product pests by ionizing radiation  ap. 36-41.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aFood irradiation for prevention of food-borne illness and disinfestation of commodities of pests is increasing in a number of countries.

Doses to prevent reproduction of stored product pests range from 0.05 kGy for Tenebrio molitor L. to 0.45 kGy for Sitotroga cereallela (Olivier). Small but increasing amounts of grains and pulses are being irradiated in the world today especially in Asia. At least 33 countries permit irradiation of some stored products with 14 countries permitting it for all stored products. Ways in which stored product irradiation research and application may influence other uses of irradiation technology are also discussed. Deactivation of weed seeds might be an area of stored product phytosanitation where irradiation would have an advantage over other measures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSitotroga 3aTenebrio molitor 3adisinfestation 3afood irradiation 3agrains 3ainsect control 3ainsect reproduction 3aionizing radiation 3alegumes 3aseeds 3astorage insects 3astored product protection 3astored products 3aweeds 0aIrradiation 0aFood irradiation 0aStorage pests 0aPest control 0aPest management0 tJournal of stored products research.g2013 Jan., v. 52 p.36-41dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45775x0022-474X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jspr.2012.10.0013Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/573683Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/116184_JSPR_2013_52_36_41_Hallman.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle03452naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245015800168520185800326592002802184650001202212650002002224650001002244650001702254650001702271650001602288650001902304650001502323650001002338650001502348650000902363650002002372650001502392651001002407653002602417653001202443653002502455653003402480653003402514700001302548700001202561700002002573700001702593700001902610700001802629700001702647700001402664700001602678773011902694856008802813852000902901655001202910IND60761072320221118151751.0220222e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076107232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1525582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Quan10aHysteresis effects of meteorological variation-induced algal blooms: A case study based on satellite-observed data from Dianchi Lake, China (1988–2020)  aAs one of three top-priority eutrophic lakes in China, Dianchi Lake has received national attention due to its severe eutrophication in recent decades. Meteorological factors are the main factors driving the formation and persistence of algae blooms. In addition, meteorological variation-induced algal blooms usually have a hysteresis effect. However, there have been few quantitative studies on this hysteresis effect. In the present study, Landsat images were used to extract the dynamic characteristics of changes in algal blooms in Dianchi Lake from 1988 to 2020. The hysteresis effect of meteorological factors driving algal blooms was studied by employing the modified lag-correlation method. The results showed that the algal blooms in Dianchi Lake were most severe between 1998 and 2008. During the periods of algal blooms, the values of air temperature (AT) and precipitation (PP) were significantly higher, while those wind velocity (WV) and sunshine duration (SSD) were obviously lower, than the corresponding annual mean values. AT and PP were significantly positively correlated with algal bloom factors in both the formation and persistence stages of algal blooms, while SSD and WV both promoted their regression, but these effects were less significant in the persistence period than in the formation period. Moreover, rainfall led to a decrease in SSD and WV, indirectly contributing to algal blooms. Furthermore, AT, PP and SSD are the main factors impacting the duration of persistent blooms. The time periods during which each meteorological factor was most influential were as follows: 1) AT - 25-30 days before the maximum bloom. 2) PP - within the first 10 days before the maximum bloom. 3) Both SSD and WV - 15-20 days before the maximum bloom. The results of this study support the prediction of algal blooms in Dianchi Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aair temperature 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3acase studies 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3ahysteresis 3alakes 3aprediction 3arain 3asolar radiation 3awind speed 3aChina 0aMeteorological factor 0aLandsat 0aFloating algae index 0aFloating algae coverage index 0aSpearman correlation analysis1 aSun, Liu1 aZhu, Yi1 aWang, Shuaibing1 aDuan, Chunyu1 aYang, Zhaojie,1 aZhang, Yumeng1 aLiu, Dejiang1 aZhao, Lin1 aTang, Jinli0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 812 p.152558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1525583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02731naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245025000162300001200412520098700424592002801411650001201439650001301451650001501464650001401479650001201493650002901505650001401534650001801548650000901566650001401575650001201589650001801601650002201619650000901641650000901650653002901659653002201688653000901710653001901719653001601738653003001754653001101784653000901795653002101804653001701825700001501842700001801857700002101875700001801896700002101914773013101935856007802066852000902144655001202153IND60520410020221121235621.0160520e20151230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052041002DNAL7 a10.1515/oszn-2015-00212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKõlli, Raimo10aAccumulation of metallic elements into the superficial peat layer of mires and wet mineral soils of Estonian forest land / Akumulacja metali w powierzchniowej warstwie gleb torfowych i wilgotnych glebach mineralnych ekosystemów leśnych Estonii  ap. 6-9.  aThis article studied the extent of accumulation of aqua regia extractable metallic elements (Al, Mg, Pb, Zn, Hg, Cd) into peaty (histic) epipedon (EP) of fen soils, transitional bog soils, peaty gley soils and peaty podzols. The accumulation coefficients (Kac) of the elements in EP were estimated in relation of forest floor (FF, as an input) as a comparison to deeper levels (SS, as a past background). The study revealed that the extent of accumulation and its order depend on soil (peat) type or pedo-ecological conditions of peatification. In the forming of EP from FF, the concentrations of Al and Pb were increased on an average 2.5-5.0 times, but that of Hg increased significantly only in peaty soils (on an average 1.5-1.6 times). The contents of Zn were significantly decreased (Kac 0.1-0.5) in all soil groups. The comparison of EP peats concentrations with SS data demonstrated a considerable accumulation of Pb, Cd, Zn and Hg into thin (~20 cm) superficial peat layer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPodzols 3aaluminum 3aaqua regia 3abog soils 3acadmium 3aenvironmental protection 3afen soils 3aforest litter 3alead 3amagnesium 3amercury 3amineral soils 3anatural resources 3apeat 3azinc 0aaccumulation coefficient 0ametallic elements 0apeat 0apeaty epipedon 0aforest land 0awspółczynnik akumulacji 0ametale 0atorf 0atorfowy epipedon 0agleby leśne1 aAsi, Endla1 aSzajdak, Lech1 aTõnutare, Tõnu1 aAstover, Alar1 aKrebstein, Kadri0 tOchrona Środowiska i Zasobów Naturalnych.g2015 Dec. 30, v. 26, no. 4 p.6-9dDe Gruyter OpenwJournal:23163x2353-85897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/oszn-2015-00213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004100113040001800154100001600172245011200188300001600300520154300316592002801859650001501887650001601902650001301918650001701931650001601948650000801964650002801972650000902000650001502009650001202024650001002036650001802046650001102064650001402075650001502089650001202104650003102116650001302147650001002160650002302170650001602193650002102209650002802230650003802258650003602296650002602332650001802358650002102376650004502397650002902442651001102471653000902482653001002491653002102501653002402522653002302546700002002569773010602589856008702695852000902782655001202791IND50070502220221122045906.0160902e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007050222DNAL7 a239735382pmid7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Shu-An10aSize-selective assessment of agricultural workers' personal exposure to airborne fungi and fungal fragments  ap. 725-732.  aFungi are ubiquitous agents that cause human respiratory diseases. Very few studies have size-selectively assessed farmers' exposure to fungi and fungal fragments in agricultural settings. In this study, a two-stage bio-aerosol cyclone personal sampler was employed to collect airborne fungi and fungal fragments size-selectively at corn, swine, poultry, and mushroom farms. The collected air samples were analyzed for culturable fungi, fungal spores, viable fungi and (1→3)-β-d-glucan. The results show that the median concentrations ranged from 3.2×105 to 1.3×108spores/m3 for total fungal spores, from 1.3×105 to 5.1×107spores/m3 for total viable fungi, from 1.9×103 to 1.5×107CFU/m3 for total culturable fungi, and from 4.3×103 to 2.4×106pg/m3 for total (1→3)-β-d-glucan. The aerodynamic sizes of most of the collected fungal contaminants were larger than 1.8μm. Total (1→3)-β-d-glucan significantly correlated with total fungal spores (r=0.65, p<0.001), total viable fungi (r=0.68, p<0.001) and total culturable fungi (r=0.72, p<0.001). Total (1→3)-β-d-glucan significantly correlated with Aspergillus/Penicillium, Alternaria, and Cladosporium. Alternaria and Botrytis were also found to highly correlate with (1→3)-β-d-glucan at the size <1μm, which was less than the expected spore sizes (the mean measured aerodynamic sizes were 18.5μm for Alternaria and 6.1μm for Botrytis); therefore, Alternaria and Botrytis might release small fragments that could enter the deep lung and cause respiratory diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus 3aBotrytis 3aCladosporium 3aPenicillium 3aair 3aairborne microorganisms 3acorn 3afarm labor 3afarmers 3afarms 3afungal spores 3ahumans 3amushrooms 3apollutants 3apoultry 3arespiratory tract diseases 3asampling 3aswine 2aAerosolsxanalysis 2aAgriculture 2aAir Microbiology 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFungixisolation & purification 2aOccupational Exposure 2aParticle Size 2aReference Values 2aSpores, Fungalxisolation & purification 2abeta-Glucansxmetabolism 0aTaiwan 0aSize 0aFungi 0aFungal fragments 0a(1→3)-β-d-glucan 0aAgricultural farms1 aLiao, Chien-Hua0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Jan. 01, v. 466-467 p.725-732dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.07.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02801naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001900146245007800165300001600243520140000259592002801659650001901687650001101706650001401717650001201731650001901743650002001762650001001782650001401792650001101806650003201817650001201849650001401861650001301875650001601888650001801904650001301922650002501935653000801960653001601968653002301984653001802007700002502025700001802050700002002068773011802088856008002206852000902286655001202295IND60520656220221119034843.0160522e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052065622DNAL7 a10.2478/prolas-2013-00762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYusenko, Elena10aDetermination of Oxalate and Some Inorganic Anions in Green and Black Tea  ap. 429-432.  aOxalate concentration differs in various daily consumed food products. The role of oxalic acid in the human body is very significant, as its compounds are responsible for the stability of biological membranes. However, insoluble calcium and magnesium oxalates can be accumulated in the body in the form of kidney stones. Oxalate concentration has been measured by high performance liquid, gas after derivatization and ion chromatography (IC). The most effective method for the simultaneous determination of oxalate and inorganic anions is ion chromatography with conductometric detection. Here, we report the results of the measurement of oxalic acid in bleak and green tea samples. Separation was performed by IC on an anion-exchange column Shodex IC SI-90 with surface-layer sorbent and conductimetric detection. The main analytical features of the method were: limit of detection of oxalic acid 0.03 mg/l, linear range 0.1-20 mg/l, correlation 0.9998, relative standard deviation 1%. The method did not need specific sample treatment and was successfully applied to the analysis of black and green tea samples. Oxalic acid was determined in the ranges 16.7-84 mg/l for green tea and 63-116 mg/l for black tea. Green tea contained lower oxalate ions concentration than black tea. The IC method has a lower detection limit for oxalate ions than HPLS and GC, ten and two times less, respectively  aPublisher supplied data 3aanion exchange 3aanions 3ablack tea 3acalcium 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3afoods 3agreen tea 3ahumans 3aion exchange chromatography 3aliquids 3amagnesium 3aoxalates 3aoxalic acid 3arenal calculi 3asorbents 3astatistical analysis 0atea 0aoxalic acid 0aion chromatography 0akidney stones1 aPolyntseva, Evgeniya1 aLyzhova, Anna1 aKalyakina, Olga0 tProceedings of the Latvian Academy of Sciences.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 67, no. 4-5 p.429-432dVersitax1407-009X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/prolas-2013-00763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03448naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010000174300001800274520196600292592002802258650002202286650002802308650002602336650001502362650001702377650001902394650001802413650001202431650001802443650001602461650001502477650001102492650002802503650002502531650001502556650001302571650001402584650001002598650001202608700002902620700004502649700002902694700003202723773010902755856008102864852000902945655001202954IND60572615420221120181020.0170717e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057261542DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-017-5425-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Sinval Garcia10aIn vitro acaricidal activity of Crescentia cujete L. fruit pulp against Rhipicephalus microplus  ap. 1487-1493.  aCattle tick (Rhipicephalus microplus) is an important constraint on livestock production, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. Synthetic acaricides are the primary method of control this thick. Resistance of R. microplus to synthetic acaricides has given rise to the need of new scientific investigations on alternative ways to control it. The objective of this work was to conduct a chemical investigation of Crescentia cujete L. fruit pulp and to evaluate the acaricide effect on R. microplus larvae of extracts, fractions, and isolated substances from this species. Crescentia cujete is a Bignoniaceae and it is characteristic of tropical climates. Its most distinctive feature is its fruit, which is spherical and gourd-like, with a hard woody shell and gelatinous pulp. The fruit pulp of C. cujete was extracted with ethanol by maceration yielding an extract and a residue. The extract was partitioned giving an ethyl acetate phase (EAF) that was fractionated by chromatographic procedures yielding cinnamic acid and benzoic acid. The remained botanic material from the ethanol extraction was further and successively extracted with ethyl ether and methanol under reflux. The acaricide effect of all extracts and fractions was evaluated against R. microplus using the larval packet test. The best result was observed for the EAF that caused 100% of mortality when a 10% solution was used and with LC₅₀ of 5.9%. Cinnamic acid was also tested showing 63.0% of mortality with LC₅₀ of 6.6% at the same concentrations and time of the experiment. The data obtained in this study provides information related to the chemical nature and the acaricide activity of the C. cujete epicarp that has not been previously reported. This study shows that the ethyl acetate phase of the ethanol extract of C. cujete fruit pulp is a potential alternative control for R. microplus and its activity is in part associated to cinnamic acid, its major compound.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrescentia cujete 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3aacaricidal properties 3aacaricides 3abenzoic acid 3achromatography 3acinnamic acid 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aethyl ether 3afruit pulp 3alarvae 3alethal concentration 50 3alivestock production 3amaceration 3amethanol 3amortality 3aticks 3atropics1 ade Araújo, Sandra Alves1 aGuilhon, Giselle Maria Skelding Pinheiro1 aSantos, Lourivaldo Silva1 aJunior, Livio Martins Costa0 tParasitology research.g2017 May, v. 116, no. 5 p.1487-1493dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-017-5425-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001800161245005600179300001600235520070800251650001800959650001000977650001100987650001800998650001701016650001201033650001001045650001601055650001601071650002001087650001101107650002201118650002301140650001601163650002001179650001801199650001401217700001501231700001401246700001501260773008501275852000901360930003301369945002501402946001101427655001201438IND4377035620221117162645.0060106e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437703562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of moisture content and temperature on the specific volume of the sample were investigated. An empirical equation relating moisture content and temperature to specific volume was derived, and the measured data agreed well with the values calculated from the equation. Within the range of temperatures tested, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the sample was small. Therefore, the specific volume could be considered a linear function of moisture content only. In addition, the specific volume in bulk was related to a quadratic function of moisture content. 3awater content 3awheat 3abarley 3aparticle size 3abulk density 3asoaking 3awater 3atemperature 3awet milling 3amilling quality 3avolume 3athermal expansion 3adry matter content 3awheat flour 3atrinitrotoluene 3alinear models 3aequations1 aTagawa, A.1 aKasai, T.1 aTakeya, K.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2006 Apr., v. 73, no. 4 p.364-369x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a20070815b20070902c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/05/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02925naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245008300167300001600250500001500266520165200281650000901933650001201942650001501954650001701969650000901986650001001995650001602005650001102021650001902032650001302051650001002064650002802074650001302102650001102115650002102126650002102147650000902168650001202177650001102189653001002200773009302210852000902303856008502312939003302397946001302430655001202443IND4482692420221122230004.0140627e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448269242DNAL7 a10.1007/s12230-009-9123-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRondon, Silvia I.14aThe potato tuberworm: A literature review of its biology, ecology, and control  ap. 149-166.  a2019-12-05  aThe potato tuberworm, Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), is a worldwide pest of solanaceous crops especially devastating to potatoes. Adults mate and lay eggs in foliage or tubers throughout the growing season, preferring foliage over tubers. When foliage has naturally or artificially senesced and/or tubers are accessible, they deposit eggs in or near the eye buds. The larvae mine leaves, stems, and petioles causing irregular galleries, and excavate tunnels through tubers. Foliar damage to the potato crop usually does not result in significant yield losses but infested tubers may have reduced marketability and losses in storage may be up to 100% especially in non-refrigerated systems. The greatest risk of tuber damage occurs immediately before harvest while the crop is left in the field prior to digging; additional damage may occur in storage, if conditions are not maintained properly. Potatoes that are left in the field for any length of time can become infested. The pest is difficult to control and growers rely extensively on the use of insecticides and a variety of cultural practices. After harvest, the insect may continue to develop on tubers or volunteer plants remaining in the field as well as on other solanaceous plants. Incorporation of host plant resistance together with insecticides and appropriate biological and cultural practices may provide the best management options.

In the mouse, the percentage of blastocysts formed ranged from 82% in controls to 16% after injection at the highest titer. In the rat and cow, a similar decrease in blastocyst formation was noted (62% to 6% and 26% to 4%, respectively). Reporter gene (galactosidase, LacZ) activity could be detected in mouse embryos after injection at a concentration of only 25 pfu/100 pI, whereas a tenfold higher titer was required in the other two species to observe the blue LacZ reaction product. When examined after 5 (mouse), 6 (rat), or 9 (cow) days of in vitro culture, the proportion of LacZ-positive embryos ranged from 15% to 96%, 6% to 76%, and 18% to 58% in mouse, rat, and cow embryos, respectively, depending upon viral concentration. However, a large percentage of positive embryos proved to be expression mosaics, the degree of which was likewise dependent on titer. While none of the embryos showed LacZ activity at 30 h after injection, 70% of mouse, 8% of rat, and 20% of cow embryos expressed the reporter gene at 42 h. Delaying the timing of injection revealed that the efficiency with which mouse and rat embryos could be infected decreased with increasing degree of differentiation. Only 35% and 18% of mouse embryos expressed the reporter gene after injection at the morula or blastocyst stage, respectively. A similar drop in efficiency was noted in rat embryos when injections took place at the 8-cell, morula, or blastocyst stage, with 70%, 33%, and 9% of embryos, respectively, subsequently showing LacZ activity. Likewise, advanced development resulted in a decrease in the efficiency of viral-mediated gene transfer in cow embryos, with 100%, 78%, and 68% of embryos being positive after injection at the 8-cell, morula, or blastocyst stage, respectively. These results demonstrate that a human adenovirus can be used to express a reporter gene transiently in nonhuman embryos. 3amice 3arats 3acattle 3agene transfer 3areporter genes 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo culture 3ainjection 3aembryo (animal) 3atransgenes 2aAdenoviridaexgenetics 2aAnimals 2aBlastocystxmetabolism 2aCattle 2aCulture Techniques 2aEmbryo, Mammalianxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGalactosidasesxgenetics 2aGene Expression 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aMice 2aMicroinjections 2aMorulaxmetabolism 2aRats 2aVitelline Membrane 2aZygotexmetabolism 0atiming 0ahuman adenovirus 0aexpression mosaics1 aLarson, M.A.1 aEichen, P.A.1 aWilson, J.M.1 aRoberts, R.M.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1997 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.119-124wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.1.1193Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03522naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001600164245012600180300001600306520180100322650003302123650000902156650001902165650001802184650001802202650002002220650002002240650002702260650001502287650001202302650001702314650002702331650001802358650002002376650003602396650001102432650001802443650002702461650002302488650000902511650002302520650000902543650001702552653001102569653001302580653002602593700001302619700001302632773009802645852000902743856008602752930003302838945001302871946001302884990002302897655001202920IND2060206120221122060137.0971021e199701  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206020612DNAL7 a90026472pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.1.1802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyoshi, K.10aStage-dependent development of rat 1-cell embryos in a chemically defined medium after fertilization in vivo and in vitro  ap. 180-185.  aThe present study was conducted to examine the development of rat 1-cell embryos cultured in a chemically defined medium (mR1ECM) soon after penetration of eggs in vivo or in vitro. When eggs were recovered from naturally mated females at 0600-0900 h on the following day, no penetrated eggs with male pronuclei were observed. However, the percentage of pronuclear eggs had increased significantly at 1000-1100 h (17%) and 1200-1300 h (65%). When penetrated eggs recovered at 0600-0900 h were cultured in mR1ECM, blastocyst formation (22-46%) was significantly less frequent than in those (79-93%) recovered at 1000-1300 h. After collection at 0600-0800 h, preculture of penetrated eggs in modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (mKRB) for up to 1200-1300 h improved their development to the blastocyst stage from 42% to 78%. Pronuclei were formed in almost all (98-100%) of the penetrated eggs examined after 6-20 h of insemination in mKRB. When penetrated eggs were transferred from mKRB into mR1ECM after 4-30 h of insemination, the percentages (47-64%) of blastocyst formation were significantly higher than those (1-20%) for eggs transferred after 1-3 h or after 40 h of insemination. When a total of 70 morulae or early blastocysts that had been produced by in vitro fertilization and developed in vitro were transferred to 7 pseudopregnant rats, 5 recipients into which 48 embryos had been transferred maintained their pregnancies and 25% of the embryos developed into late fetuses or pups. The results of the present study indicate that rat 1-cell embryos recovered from oviducts before pronuclear formation, or produced by in vitro fertilization, can develop to the blastocyst stage in vitro and that one or more factors in mKRB are necessary to maintain their development in mR1ECM. 3afertilization (reproduction) 3arats 3aembryo culture 3aculture media 3aembryogenesis 3aembryo transfer 3aembryo (animal) 3ain vitro fertilization 3apronucleus 2aAnimals 2aBicarbonates 2aBlastocystxphysiology 2aCulture Media 2aEmbryo Transfer 2aEmbryonic and Fetal Development 2aFemale 2aFertilization 2aFertilization in Vitro 2aIsotonic Solutions 2aMale 2aMorulaxphysiology 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 0atiming 0ain vitro 0ain vivo fertilization1 aKono, T.1 aNiwa, K.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1997 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.180-185wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.1.1803Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03753naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001600164245020100180300001600381500001500397520160500412650003302017650001202050650001802062650003402080650002002114650001502134650001702149650002102166650002402187650002802211650002002239650001702259650001902276650001702295650001402312650001902326650001202345650002302357650005302380650004102433650001102474650004702485650003302532650002402565650003002589650002402619650003102643650002902674650001902703653001302722653002602735653002702761700001602788773009802804852000902902856008602911930003302997945001303030946001303043990002303056655001203079IND2060162420221122052732.0971017e199702  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206016242DNAL7 a91161552pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.2.5162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoumano, K.10aOvarian follicular steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, low-density lipoprotein receptor, and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage messenger ribonucleic acids in cattle undergoing superovulation  ap. 516-522.  a2019-12-05  aOvarian hyperstimulation with eCG in cattle results in increased plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations, whereas hyperstimulation with FSH increases only estradiol concentrations. This study tested the hypothesis that eCG, compared to FSH, increases mRNA abundance for steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R), and/or cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc), the main elements of the progesterone biosynthetic pathway. Heifers were stimulated with eCG (n = 10) or commercial FSH (n = 10), and ovaries were removed by colpotomy the day before and at 12 and 24 h after luteolysis was induced with prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha. RNA was extracted from individual follicles, and relative abundance of StAR, LDL-R, and P450scc mRNA was assessed by slot blots. In ovaries of abattoir origin, StAR mRNA was detected in all follicles and was present in the theca but not the granulosa cell layer, as shown by Northern blotting. Levels of StAR mRNA increased 2-fold (p < 0.05) after PGF2 alpha injection in small (< 6 mm) follicles from eCG-treated but not from FSH-treated animals. After PGF2 alpha injection, StAR mRNA levels were 2- to 3-fold higher (p < 0.01) in large (> 9 mm) and medium (6-9 mm) follicles in eCG- compared with FSH-treated heifers. In contrast, P450scc and LDL-R mRNA levels did not consistently differ according to treatments. We show that StAR is expressed in the theca cells of bovine follicles and that stimulation with eCG increases follicular accumulation of StAR mRNA in comparison to stimulation with FSH. 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aheifers 3amessenger RNA 3aequine chorionic gonadotropin 3asteroidogenesis 3aluteolysis 3aprogesterone 3acytochrome P-450 3ahormonal regulation 3alow density lipoprotein 3agranulosa cells 3athecal cells 3aprostaglandins 3ablood plasma 3areceptors 3asuperovulation 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzymexgenetics 2aChorionic Gonadotropinxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexpharmacology 2aOvarian Folliclexmetabolism 2aOvulation Induction 2aPhosphoproteinsxgenetics 2aProgesteronexblood 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, LDLxgenetics 2aSuperovulation 0aproteins 0asuperovulated females 0achorionic gonadotropin1 aPrice, C.A.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1997 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.516-522wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.2.5163Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02855naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001100146245007500157300001600232500001500248520152100263650002201784650001201806650001101818650002001829650002001849650001201869650001201881650001401893653001501907653001301922653001701935653001301952653001901965653002401984653001102008653002202019700001502041700001702056700001302073773009802086852000902184856008602193930003302279945001302312946001302325990002302338655001202361IND2060209420221122052616.0971021e199701  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206020942DNAL7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.1.2602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, B.10aExpression of mos proto-oncoprotein oocytes during maturation in vitro  ap. 260-265.  a2019-12-05  aThe c-mos proto-oncogene product Mos is believed to be an active component of the cytostatic factor that stabilizes and sustains the activity of maturation-promoting factor. Mos has been found to be responsible for the metaphase arrest of oocytes at the second meiotic division in both Xenopus and the mouse. In this study, we have demonstrated, by Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis, that an approximately 39-kDa protein, identified as Mos, was present in in vitro-matured (metaphase II stage) bovine oocytes but disappeared in parthenogenetically activated oocytes. The oocytes actively synthesized p39(mos) at the metaphase II stage (between 22 and 26 h of in vitro maturation [IVM]), whereas little p39(mos) synthesis was detected during the first 4 h of IVM and it was nondetectable during aging at 44-48 h of IVM, when oocytes lose the capability of normal development after fertilization. Ethanol activation of mature oocytes fed to the disappearance of p39(mos). beta-Tubulin, but not p34(cdc2), was co-precipitated with Mos when extracts of metaphase II-stage bovine oocytes were incubated with Mos antiserum. These results demonstrated that Mos is present and actively synthesized in mature bovine oocytes and that oocytes aged beyond the optimal time for fertilization seem to lose the ability to synthesize the Mos protein. beta-Tubulin was found to be associated with Mos, which suggests a possible role for the cytoskeletal protein in maintaining the meiotic arrest in mature bovine oocytes. 3aprotein synthesis 3atubulin 3acattle 3aproto-oncogenes 3agene expression 3ameiosis 3aoocytes 3ametaphase 0amaturation 0aproteins 0abeta-tubulin 0ain vitro 0ameiotic arrest 0ain vitro maturation 0atiming 0aoocyte activation1 aIgnotz, G.1 aCurrie, W.B.1 aYang, X.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1997 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.260-265wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.1.2603Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle05562naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001500164245006400179300001600243520327100259650000903530650002303539650001303562650002003575650003503595650002403630650002403654650002203678650001403700650001203714650001703726650002003743650001703763650001903780650002703799650001803826650002403844650003303868650003203901650001203933650003103945650002603976650002304002650001104025650004504036650006104081650002504142650006104167650004604228650006504274650002904339650002204368653001404390653001604404653003604420653002004456653002504476700001904501700001704520700002104537773008104558852000904639856008604648930003304734945001304767946001304780990002304793655001204816IND2060207020221122052710.0971021e199701  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206020702DNAL7 a90026512pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.1.2082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDobson, H.10aEndocrine activity of induced persistent follicles in sheep  ap. 208-213.  aThis experiment was designed to examine gonadotropin requirements for the induction and maintenance of persistent ovarian follicles in sheep. At the time of prostaglandin (PG) treatment on the tenth day of an induced estrous cycle, 8 ewes (with one ovary autotransplanted to the neck) received an injection of a GnRH antagonist ([Ac-d-Nal1, d-4-C-1-Phe2, d-Trp3, d-Arg6, d-Ala10] GnRH.HOAc; 50 microgram/kg s.c.), and continuous hourly injections of exogenous ovine LH (equivalent to 1.25 microgram NIH-oLH-S26) began simultaneously with this first antagonist injection (time zero). Antagonist was given three times at 3-day intervals. On Day 6, LH injections were stopped in 4 ewes (group 2) but continued in 4 other ewes (group 1) until the end of the 10-day experiment. Ovarian vein blood was samples daily every 15 min for a 2-h period around two injections of exogenous LH (this sampling included group 2 after Day 6). Additional jugular and ovarian vein blood samples were collected every 8 h throughout the experiment. Daily ultrasound examination revealed the presence of at least one large follicle (range 4- to 7.5-mm diameter) from Day 3 to Day 10 in all ewes, but no new growing follicles (> 2 mm) were detected for at least 6 days. After Day 2, secretion of estradiol was positively correlated with that of inhibin (r = 0.83, p < 0.001), whereas FSH concentrations were inversely related to inhibin (r = -0.71, p < 0.001) and estradiol (r = -0.81, p < 0.001). In the absence of an LH surge, estradiol and androstenedione secretion (range 5-20 ng steroid/min) was maintained from Day 1 to Day 8 in group 1; but in group 2, secretion decreased abruptly when the LH injections stopped. Thus, continued low-amplitude, high-frequency LH pulses were required to maintain estradiol secretion when concentrations of FSH were < 0.5 ng/ml. However, estradiol and androstenedione secretion decreased (and FSH concentrations increased) between Days 8 and 10 in the ewes that received continued LH injections (group 1), showing that atresia in estrogenic follicles was not due to a lack of gonadotropin availability but to changes within the follicle. For the first 3 days after administration of PG, androstenedione secretion was greater than that of estradiol (p < 0.05), but from Day 4 to 6 the secretion rates were similar (p < 0.1), suggesting that aromatase may be limiting in the first 3 days whereas provision of androstenedione precursors was altered as the follicle persisted. In group 2 on Days 7 and 8 when hourly LH injections had stopped, neither androstenedione nor estradiol secretion increased after one test injection of LH; in contrast, androstenedione but not estradiol secretion increased after a second LH test injection 1 h later, suggesting that secretion of androstenedione is controlled by repealed exposure to LH. In conclusion, persistent estrogenic follicles were produced in the follicular phase in sheep by treatment with a combination of GnRH antagonist and hourly pulses of LH. Secretion of estradiol was dependent on continued hourly LH pulses of approximately 1 ng/ml and the follicles remained estrogenic for 8 days, after which time the ability to secrete estradiol and androstenedione declined even with continued LH injections. 3aewes 3aGraafian follicles 3adiameter 3asteroidogenesis 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahormone antagonists 3ahormonal regulation 3ahormone secretion 3aestradiol 3ainhibin 3aprogesterone 3aandrostenedione 3ablood plasma 3aprostaglandins 3asynthetic progestogens 3aestrous cycle 3aluteinizing hormone 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 2aAndrostenedionexsecretion. 2aAnimals 2aCloprostenolxpharmacology 2aEstradiolxsecretion. 2aEstrusxphysiology 2aFemale 2aFollicle Stimulating Hormonexsecretion. 2aGonadotropin-Releasing Hormonexantagonists & inhibitors 2aInhibinsxsecretion. 2aLuteinizing Hormonexadministration & dosagexsecretion. 2aMedroxyprogesterone Acetatexpharmacology 2aOvarian Folliclexdrug effectsxphysiologyxultrasonography. 2aProgesteronexsecretion. 2aSheepxphysiology 0ainduction 0apersistence 0apersistent estrogenic follicles 0agnrh antagonist 0acontinuous lh pulses1 aCampbell, B.K.1 aGordon, B.M.1 aScaramuzzi, R.J.0 tBiology of reproduction.g1997 Jan., v. 56, no. 1 p.208-213x0006-33637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.1.2083Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03189naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001600164245017200180300001600352500001500368520121700383650001801600650002001618650001401638650002001652650001001672650001301682650001801695650001501713650000901728650001201737650001801749650001001767650001201777650002301789650002801812650002001840650002501860650002601885650000901911650002401920650002501944650002901969650000901998650002502007650005002032650002502082650002002107650004602127653002502173653001702198653001102215700001702226700001402243773008102257852000902338856008602347930003302433945001302466946001302479990002302492655001202515IND2060162820221122052643.0971017e199702  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206016282DNAL7 a91161602pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.2.5492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkmal, K.M.10aRetinoic acid receptor alpha gene expression in the rat testis: potential role during the prophase of meiosis and in the transition from round to elongating spermatids  ap. 549-556.  a2019-12-05  aMutational studies have identified retinoic acid receptor (RARalpha) as having an essential role in spermatogenesis. The objective of this study was to determine which cells express RARalpha within the normal rat testis by conducting in situ analyses for mRNA and protein. Characterization of RARalpha expression revealed the time and location of the vitamin A requirement during spermatogenesis. In situ hybridization analysis of testis from adult rats showed the highest level of transcripts occurring in round spermatids at stage VIII of the spermatogenic cycle. Analysis in the developing testes revealed that the mRNA level was high from 10 to 15 days of age, both in Sertoli cells and in germ cells, and then declined in 20-day-old rats. Consistent with this, immunohistochemical studies on adult testis demonstrated that the protein was present in the nucleus of the elongating spermatids (stages IX-XI) but not in elongated spermatids. The protein was also expressed in germ cells in the prophase of meiosis and at very low levels in Sertoli cells. These results suggest a role for RARalpha during meiosis, at the transition from round to elongating spermatids, and in Sertoli cells of developing testis. 3amessenger RNA 3aspermatogenesis 3areceptors 3agene expression 3agenes 3aprophase 3aretinoic acid 3aspermatids 3arats 3ameiosis 3aSertoli cells 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCell Nucleusxchemistry 2aGene Expression 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMale 2aMeiosisxphysiology 2aProphasexphysiology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, Retinoic Acidxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSpermatidsxcytology 2aSpermatogenesis 2aTestisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aspermatid elongation 0alocalization 0atestes1 aDufour, J.M.1 aKim, K.H.0 tBiology of reproduction.g1997 Feb., v. 56, no. 2 p.549-556x0006-33637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.2.5493Available from publisher's Web site  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02581naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245013900174300001600313500001500329520063300344650002000977650002100997650004401018650002501062650002001087650001501107650002101122650002101143650002401164650003701188650004501225650004301270650001801313650001601331650002301347650002001370650001901390650003701409650003101446650002301477650002801500650001101528650002501539650002401564653002301588653001601611653002501627653002801652700001801680700001601698773006201714852000901776856007801785930003301863945001301896946001101909990002301920655001201943IND2042256820221121071917.0940927e199402  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204225682DNAL7 a79063812pmid7 a10.1007/BF002804282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrickmore, N.10aUse of an operon fusion to induce expression and crystallisation of a Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxin encoded by a cryptic gene  ap. 365-368.  a2019-12-04  aA delta-endotoxin gene previously cloned from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. galleriae has been shown by a combination of restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis to be a cryIIB clone; in common with other cryIIB genes it was found to lack a functional promoter.

Several transgenic plants that had elevated NIA mRNA and nitrate reductase (NR) activity were obtained. In addition, a few plants that exhibited a chlorotic phenotype characteristic of NR-deficient mutants were also obtained. One of these plants contained no NIA mRNA, no NR activity and accumulated nitrate. This phenotype was therefore assumed to result from co-suppression of 35S-NIA transgenes and host NIA genes. NR-deficient plants were also found among the progeny of transformants overexpressing NIA mRNA. Genetic analyses indicated that these NR-deficient plants were homozygous for the 35S-NIA transgene, although not all homozygous plants were deficient for NR. The ratio of normal to NR-deficient plants in the progeny of homozygous plants remained constant at each generation, irrespective of the state of expression of the NIA genes (active or inactive) in the previous generation. This ratio also remained unchanged when field trials were performed in two areas of France: Versailles and Bergerac. The analysis of homozygous plants revealed that cosuppression was reversible at some stage of sexual reproduction. Indeed, host genes and transgenes reactivated at each generation, and co-suppression always appeared after a lag period of normal growth, suggesting that the phenomenon is developmentally regulated. We observed that the triggering of co-suppression was delayed when plants were initially grown under limited light and/or watered with limited nitrate supply (light and nitrate both being required for the expression of the host NIA genes). However, this delay did not affect the final ratio between normal and NR-deficient plants after transfer to nitrate-fertilized fields. Independent transformants exhibited either different co-suppression ratios or no co-suppression at all, irrespective of the transgene copy number, suggesting that genomic sequences surrounding the transgene might play a role in determining co-suppression. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3atransgenic plants 3acomplementary DNA 3anitrate reductase 3agene transfer 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme deficiencies 3anitrates 3anutrient availability 2aCaulimovirusxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFertilizers 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aGenes, Viralxgenetics 2aLight 2aNitrate Reductase 2aNitrate Reductasesxgenetics 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aTerminator Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxradiation effects. 2aTransformation, Genetic 2aWaterxmetabolism 0agenetic regulation 0ania gene1 aVincentz, M.1 aChupeau, Y.1 aVaucheret, H.0 tMGG.g1994 June 15, v. 243, no. 6 p.613-621x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002795703Available from publisher's Web site  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02818naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245010000172300001600272500001500288520131000303650001301613650002801626650000901654650001201663650001001675650001401685650002901699650001001728650001601738650001601754650001201770650001801782650003001800650002701830650002801857650002301885653001701908653001601925653001901941653002501960700001701985700001402002700001702016773006402033852000902097856007802106930003302184945001302217946001102230990002302241655001202264IND2041672620221120185513.0940829e19940510gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204167262DNAL7 a81900862pmid7 a10.1007/BF003010692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD., Michel.13aAn unstable allele at the maize Opaque2 locus is caused by the insertion of a double Ac element  ap. 334-342.  a2019-12-04  aAn unstable allele designated o2-m55, was isolated as a derivative of the o2-m5 allele. Whereas the o2-m5 allele is caused by the insertion of one copy of the transposable element Activator (Ac) into the first exon of the maize Opaque2 (O2) gene, the o2-m55 allele contains two Ac elements. The position of one copy is identical to the position of the Ac element in the o2-m5 allele. The second copy is present within the first copy, thereby interrupting its structure shortly before the first ATG of the major reading frame of Ac. Both Ac sequences have the same orientation. Excision of the internal Ac element as well as excision of the complete double Ac element was detectable. Truncated double Ac elements comprising the complete internal Ac element and either the proximal or distal fragment of the interrupted Ac element can also be excised. The Ac elements exhibit a strong negative dosage effect: kernels which display revertant sectors in a mutant background are rarely seen in plants homozygous for the o2-m55 allele. If only one dose of the o2-m55 allele is present in endosperm tissue, revertant sectors can be detected. The amount of the transcript expressed from the internal Ac element of the o2-m55 allele is less than that derived from the single Ac element present in the o2-m5 allele. 3aZea mays 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3aloci 3aalleles 3aseeds 3aphenotype 3atranscription (genetics) 3aexons 3atransposons 3agene dosage 2aAlleles 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aZea maysxgenetics 0ao2-m55 locus 0ao2m5 allele 0aopaque-2 maize 0anucleotide sequences1 aSalamini, F.1 aMotto, M.1 aDoring, H.P.0 tMGG.g1994 May 10, v. 243, no. 3 p.334-342x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003010693Available from publisher's Web site  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02393naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245011800174300001600292500002400308520138100332650001701713650001301730650001601743650001401759650001801773650001701791650002201808650001001830651001701840700002301857773011101880852000901991856005502000655001202055IND4461172120221120145620.0110805e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446117212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButler, Vivian P.10aSpider assemblages associated with leaf litter of three tree species in central South Africa (Arachnida: Araneae)  ap. 301-310.  aIncludes references  aSpiders were collected by sifting leaf litter of three common tree species, Cussonia paniculata sinuata, Olea europaea africana and Searsia lancea, in an undisturbed grassland habitat in central South Africa. The study aimed to collect baseline data on spider assemblage structure, seasonality and the effects of litter structure on spider assemblages. In total, 1385 spiders were collected, representing 26 families and 56 species. Four species, Obatala sp. (Amaurobiidae, 22.7%), Camillina maun Platnick & Murphy (Gnaphosidae, 17.0%), Proevippa sp. (Lycosidae, 11.4%) and Zelotes frenchi Tucker (Gnaphosidae, 9.2%) dominated the fauna. Spider abundance was the highest in Olea litter (n = 607), followed by Searsia (n = 453) and Cussonia (n = 325). Searsia had the greatest number of species (41 spp.), followed by Olea (35 spp.) and Cussonia (30 spp.). Both spider abundance and species richness per sample varied significantly between the tree species. Of the ten most abundant species, all but two showed a significant preference for particular litter types. Mean spider abundance and species richness per sample were the lowest in Cussonia litter, which was the deepest litter type, but with the most interstitial space, whereas mean abundance and species richness per sample were the highest in Olea litter, which was the shallowest and moderately compact in structure. 3aAmaurobiidae 3aCussonia 3aGnaphosidae 3aLycosidae 3aOlea europaea 3aplant litter 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3aSouth Africa1 aHaddad, Charles R.0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2011 Sept., v. 49, no. 3 p.301-310dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01265.x 7aarticle02905naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245006600188300001600254500002400270520142900294650002801723650002101751650000901772650001101781650001701792650000901809650001001818650001201828650001701840650001301857650001801870650001201888650002201900650004201922650002001964650002101984650001102005650001102016650005902027650000902086650001402095650002202109650006002131700001502191773011702206852000902323856005502332655001202387IND4407942120221120130826.0080718e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440794212DNAL7 a186381192pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01157.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEngland, GCW14aThe Ethics and Role of AI with Fresh and Frozen Semen in Dogs  ap. 165-171.  aIncludes references  aThe use of artificial insemination (AI) with fresh semen has resulted in many benefits for the management of dog breeding, but there are disadvantages that can sometimes be overlooked. Furthermore, poorer quality semen arising as a result of cryopreservation necessitates uterine insemination, which raises the potential for surgical insemination. A number of significant ethical concerns have been raised by key stakeholders (such as The Kennel Club and the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons) about AI per se, but particularly about the use of surgical insemination. This paper discusses the technological development of AI and explores a number of the ethical issues raised by its application to dog breeding. An Ethical Matrix method is used to map the potential ethical issues for key interest groups, namely dogs, breeders, owners, veterinarians and wider society. There are national variations in the way in which institutions have evaluated potential ethical impacts, and this is reflected in the different regulatory frameworks governing the use of AI in dogs. In order to facilitate decision-making and reduce some of the ethical risks associated with this technology, the veterinary research community could take several proactive steps including: (i) clarifying clinical decision-making processes, (ii) enhancing informed choice among clients and (iii) increasing the knowledge-base of potential impacts of AI. 3aartificial insemination 3acryopreservation 3adogs 3aethics 3ainsemination 3arisk 3asemen 3asociety 3astakeholders 3asurgeons 3aveterinarians 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxmethods 2aCryopreservationxethicsxveterinary. 2aDecision Making 2aDogsxphysiology 2aEthics 2aFemale 2aInsemination, Artificialxethicsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPregnancy 2aSemenxphysiology 2aSemen Preservationxadverse effectsxethicsxstandards.1 aMillar, KM0 tReproduction in domestic animals.g2008 July, v. 43, no. s2 p.165-171dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0936-67687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0531.2008.01157.x 7aarticle04619naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001300164245014000177300001600317500001500333520222500348650001802573650002102591650001302612650002202625650001602647650002502663650001502688650002102703650002002724650001402744650001002758650001102768650001002779650002402789650001202813650003902825650001802864650002702882650002302909650005102932650001102983650005802994650005603052650001103108650004003119650002803159650004803187650003003235650001403265650003303279650001003312653001203322653001703334653001903351653002303370653002803393653001803421653002903439653002503468653001903493700001903512700001903531700001703550773008103567852000903648856008603657930003303743945001303776946001303789990002303802655001203825IND2060351520221120130622.0971030e199703  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206035152DNAL7 a90470152pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.3.6882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, I.12aA developmental switch in expression from blastocyst to endometrial/placental-type cytochrome P450 aromatase genes in the pig and horse  ap. 688-696.  a2019-12-05  aPig blastocysts exhibit a transient period of estrogen production at periimplantation, with a second, more sustained period of estrogen synthesis occurring in endometrium and placenta at later pregnancy. Previously we reported the isolation of cDNA clones encoding a novel isoform of cytochrome P450 aromatase (the terminal enzyme in the estrogen biosynthetic pathway) from porcine periimplantation blastocysts. The present study investigated pregnancy-associated expression, in blastocysts and maternal reproductive tract tissues, of this and an additional mRNA transcript encoding a distinct P450 aromatase isoform. Restriction endonuclease and nucleotide sequence analyses of 44 cDNA clones demonstrated that the major aromatase mRNA in periimplantation blastocysts and early-pregnancy endometrium and placenta (blastocyst-type) differed in sequence from the major aromatase mRNA expressed in endometrium and placenta at midpregnancy (endometrial-type). The deduced blastocyst and endometrial aromatase isoform protein sequences had 93% similarity. A third type of aromatase mRNA, deleted in exons 4-6 sequences, also was cloned from blastocysts. This cDNA was identical in nucleotide sequence to the blastocyst full-length aromatase cDNA and specified an open reading frame of 354 amino acids for a putative aromatase-related protein containing the heme-binding domain. Expression of this shorter mRNA in blastocysts was confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The 5'-untranslated exon sequences in the transcripts encoding the blastocyst-type aromatase isoform were distinct from that of the endometrial type, consistent with differential expression of multiple chromosomal genes. In perimplantation equine embryos, however, embryonic and placental 5'-untranslated axon-containing transcripts were coexpressed. Results identify an aromatase isoform expressed in the endometrium and placenta at midpregnancy, demonstrate a transition in synthesis of aromatase isoform-specific mRNAs during placental development, and suggest the preferential involvement of the blastocyst aromatase isoform in synthesis of estrogenic molecules that may function in embryo-maternal signaling at periimplantation. 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3aplacenta 3acomplementary DNA 3aendometrium 3aamino acid sequences 3ablastocyst 3acytochrome P-450 3agene expression 3apregnancy 3aexons 3ahorses 3aswine 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aAromatasexbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aBlastocystxenzymology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEndometriumxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmentalxphysiology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxphysiology 2aHorses 2aIsoenzymesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlacentaxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPregnancy 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aSwine 0acloning 0amidpregnancy 0agenbank/u52142 0aaromatase isoforms 0amolecular sequence data 0asow pregnancy 0adevelopmental expression 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/u521411 aCollante, W.R.1 aSimmen, R.C.M.1 aSimmen, F.A.0 tBiology of reproduction.g1997 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.688-696x0006-33637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.3.6883Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03233naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003600110040001800146100001400164245007100178300001600249520137500265650001901640650000901659650001101668650002301679650001801702650001301720650002401733650001301757650001601770650003801786650001201824650004201836650002801878650000901906650002101915650003801936650001101974650002701985650002402012650002402036650002602060650003602086650003402122653001502156653002702171653003002198653003102228700001302259700001802272700001702290700001302307773009802320852000902418856008602427930003302513945001302546946001302559990002302572655001202595IND2060351020221120115623.0971030e199703  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206035102DNAL7 a90470072pmid7 a10.1095/biolreprod56.3.6322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbuki, R.10aLong-term observations of uterine contractions in nonpregnant dogs  ap. 632-639.  aUterine contractile activity in nonpregnant conscious dogs was investigated based on 2- to 6-mo-long continuous recording by means of a chronically implanted force transducer. We found that nonpregnant uterine contractile activity could be classified into six major patterns: sporadic contractions, weak and strong tonic contractions, weak and strong phasic contractions, and phasic contraction bursts. The contractile patterns during proestrus and estrus were the most active, with strong phasic and tonic contractions and phasic contraction bursts. The phasic and tonic contractions were inhibited dose-dependently by a beta2 adrenergic agonist, ritodrine, and reproduced by an alpha2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine. In contrast, the cholinergic inhibitors atropine and hexamethonium did not affect the spontaneous occurrence of these contractions, although bethanechol evoked uterine contractions. Oxytocin and prostaglandin F2alpha-induced contractions were phasic during estrus, whereas they showed tonic increases with phasic contractions during proestrus, diestrus, and anestrus, and these contractions did not resemble the spontaneous contractions. In conclusion, the nonpregnant uterus contracts continuously in harmony with the estrous cycle phases, and its contractile activity is enhanced by a adrenergic receptors and inhibited by beta2 adrenergic receptors. 3aprostaglandins 3adogs 3auterus 3amuscle contraction 3aestrous cycle 3aoxytocin 3ahormonal regulation 3aagonists 3aantagonists 2aAdrenergic Agonistsxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aCholinergic Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aDinoprostxpharmacology 2aDogs 2aEstrogensxblood 2aEstrusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aOxytocinxpharmacology 2aProgesteronexblood 2aStomachxphysiology 2aTransducers, Pressure 2aUterine Contractionxphysiology 2aVaginaxcytologyxphysiology. 0aregulation 0acholinergic mechanisms 0abeta-adrenergic receptors 0aalpha-adrenergic receptors1 aHaga, N.1 aMuramatsu, S.1 aMizumoto, A.1 aItoh, Z.0 tBiology of Reproduction.g1997 Mar., v. 56, no. 3 p.632-639wJournal:jnl1102x0523-67547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod56.3.6323Available from publisher's Web site  a19971201b19971208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03589naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100002300193245011700216300001800333500002400351506007600375520162700451506003702078650001802115650001602133650001502149650001002164650003002174650001202204650002502216650001402241650002502255650003002280650001102310650003502321650002402356650001802380650005302398650003002451650002202481650002202503650002802525650004502553650001402598650004802612650002702660700002302687700001802710773013402728852000902862856009202871856004802963655001203011IND4375814220221207133830.0051106e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437581422DNAL7 a162697822pmid7 aPMC12876722pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.71.11.7401-7413.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrenreich, Ian M.10aDistribution and Diversity of Natural Product Genes in Marine and Freshwater Cyanobacterial Cultures and Genomes  ap. 7401-7413.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aNatural products are a functionally diverse class of biochemically synthesized compounds, which include antibiotics, toxins, and siderophores. In this paper, we describe both the detection of natural product activities and the sequence identification of gene fragments from two molecular systems that have previously been implicated in natural product production, i.e., nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), in diverse marine and freshwater cyanobacterial cultures. Using degenerate PCR and the sequencing of cloned products, we show that NRPSs and PKSs are common among the cyanobacteria tested. Our molecular data, when combined with genomic searches of finished and progressing cyanobacterial genomes, demonstrate that not all cyanobacteria contain NRPS and PKS genes and that the filamentous and heterocystous cyanobacteria are the richest sources of these genes and the most likely sources of novel natural products within the phylum. In addition to validating the use of degenerate primers for the identification of PKS and NRPS genes in cyanobacteria, this study also defines numerous gene fragments that will be useful as probes for future studies of the synthesis of natural products in cyanobacteria. Phylogenetic analyses of the cyanobacterial NRPS and PKS fragments sequenced in this study, as well as those from the cyanobacterial genome projects, demonstrate that there is remarkable diversity and likely novelty of these genes within the cyanobacteria. These results underscore the potential variety of novel products being produced by these ubiquitous organisms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCyanobacteria 3aantibiotics 3afreshwater 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3aligases 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3apolyketide synthases 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atoxins 2aBiological Factorsxmetabolism 2aBiological Products 2aCulture Media 2aCyanobacteriaxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPolyketide Synthasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeawaterxmicrobiology1 aWaterbury, John B.1 aWebb, Eric A.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2005 Nov., v. 71, no. 11 p.7401-7413dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.71.11.7401-7413.20053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03052naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150100001500168245008800183300001800271500002400289520138300313650002901696650001001725650002901735650002101764650001901785650001101804650001101815650002201826650001501848650001901863650001601882650001101898650001501909650003801924650001901962650002101981650002202002650002002024650001702044650002102061650003502082650004102117651001402158651001402172700001602186700002002202700002102222700002002243700001802263773009502281852000902376856008902385655001202474IND4439879020221120100151.0100715s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443987902DNAL7 a204354032pmid7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.03.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRixen, Tim10aDissolved oxygen and its response to eutrophication in a tropical black water river  ap. 1730-1737.  aIncludes references  aThe Siak is a typical, nutrient-poor, well-mixed, black water river in central Sumatra, Indonesia, which owes its brown color to dissolved organic matter (DOM) leached from surrounding, heavily disturbed peat soils. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and oxygen concentrations along the river, carried out a 36-h experiment in the province capital Pekanbaru and quantified organic matter and nutrient inputs from urban wastewater channels into the Siak. In order to consider the complex dynamic of oxygen in rivers, a box-diffusion model was used to interpret the measured data. The results suggest that the decomposition of soil derived DOM was the main factor influencing the oxygen concentration in the Siak which varied between ∼100 and 140 μmol l-1. Additional DOM input caused by wastewater discharges appeared to reduce the oxygen concentrations by ∼20 μmol l-1 during the peak-time in household water use in the early morning and in the early evening. Associated enhanced nutrient inputs appear to reduce the impact of the anthropogenic DOM by favoring the photosynthetic production of oxygen in the morning. A reduction of 20 μmol l-1, which although perhaps not of great significance in Pekanbaru, has strong implications for wastewater management in the fast developing areas downstream Pekanbaru where oxygen concentrations rarely exceed 20 μmol l-1. 3aanthropogenic activities 3acolor 3adissolved organic carbon 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aoxygen production 3apeat soils 3aphotosynthesis 3ariver water 3arivers 3awastewater 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEutrophication 2aOxygenxanalysis 2aRiversxchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aTime Factors 2aTropical Climate 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 3aIndonesia 0aIndonesia1 aBaum, Antje1 aSepryani, Harni1 aPohlmann, Thomas1 aJose, Christine1 aSamiaji, Joko0 tJournal of environmental management.g2010 Aug., v. 91, no. 8 p.1730-1737x1095-86307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2010.03.0093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02988naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245008700155300001800242500002400260500001500284520171300299650001902012650001502031650000902046650001202055650002302067650001202090650001102102650001402113650002202127650002102149650001602170650001102186650002002197650001602217650001302233653001702246700001802263700001402281700001602295773013302311852000902444856007702453655001202530IND4440147020221120084831.0100716s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444014702DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.24072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Jin-Hong10aEffects of electrolytes on the reduction of 2,4-dinitrotoluene by zero-valent iron  ap. 1117-1121.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aBACKGROUND: Dinitrotoluenes (DNTs) are environmentally persistent, making the remediation of contaminated streams and groundwater difficult. Zero-valent iron (Fe⁰) can be used as an electron source for the reduction of recalcitrant DNTs in waste-water and thus enhance their biodegradability. However, little is known about the qualitative effects of major anions and cations present in waste-water on the reduction of DNTs by Fe⁰.RESULTS: The presence of Na₂SO₄ and NaCl at levels between 0.25 and 2 mmol L⁻¹ was observed to enhance the reactivity of Fe⁰ towards 2,4-DNT. The positive effect of K₂SO₄ is stronger than that of Na₂SO₄ at the same level (1 mmol L⁻¹). Varying (NH₄)₂SO₄ from 0.1 to 1.0 mmol L⁻¹ improved the efficiency of 2,4-DNT degradation by Fe⁰. The effects of varying NaNO₃ and NaNO₂ from 0 mmol L⁻¹ to 4.7 mmol L⁻¹ and 0 mmol L⁻¹ to 5.8 mmol L⁻¹, respectively, were also investigated. Both NaNO₃ and NaNO₂ at low concentration improved the efficiency of 2,4-DNT degradation by Fe⁰, however, at high concentration, inhibiting effects appeared.CONCLUSION: SO₄ ²⁻, Cl⁻, Na⁺, K⁺ and NH₄ ⁺ notably enhanced 2,4-DNT reduction by Fe⁰ at the tested concentrations. The positive effect of K⁺, Cl⁻ was relatively stronger than that of Na⁺ and sulfate (SO₄ ²⁻). However, the effect of NH₄ ⁺ was relatively weaker at concentrations greater than 1.0 mmol L⁻¹. The presence of low concentrations of NO₃ ⁻ and NO₂ ⁻ promoted 2,4-DNT reduction by Fe⁰ and inhibited the reaction. The results suggest that 2,4-DNT reduction by Fe⁰ can be controlled by the ions composition of the waste-water.

Degradation of PAEs in soil has been investigated, but limited to one or a few kinds of PAEs. Microorganisms could be regarded as a sensitive bio-indicator for soil contaminants. Therefore, four commonly used PAEs were chosen to investigate their degradation patterns and potential impacts on soil microbial activity with a series of bioassays.RESULT: PAEs in sterile soils changed slightly, while degradation of PAEs in non-sterile soil followed a single first-order kinetic. Higher concentrations of PAEs led to lower β-glucosidase activity and higher protease activity, with smooth changes of phosphatase and urease activities. PAEs decreased average well color development (AWCD), while Shannon index (H) showed a tendency to increase after a decrease. Carbon utilization profile was affected significantly by PAEs, especially at 10 mg kg⁻¹ soil.CONCLUSION: Degradation of PAEs was driven mainly by microbial mediated processes. PAEs affected carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles variously, and had temporal effects on metabolic diversity, owing to the adaptation of microbes. Carbon substrates utilization changed from easily degradable sugars and carboxylic acids to recalcitrant compounds during the simulation. 3abeta-glucosidase 3abiodegradation 3acarbon 3acarboxylic acids 3acolor 3aenzyme activity 3amicrobial activity 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3aphthalates 3apolluted soils 3asoil ecology 3asoil pollution 3asugars 3aurease1 aShi, Yi-Jing1 aZhang, Jian1 aCui, Yin1 aTeng, Shao-Xiang1 aWang, Shu-Guang1 aZhao, Ran0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2010 Aug., v. 85, no. 8 p.1108-1116dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0268-25757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.24063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02681naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245017700165300001600342500002400358520121500382650002101597650002601618650001601644650001701660650002001677650003201697650001201729650001501741650001401756650002001770650001301790650001801803653002001821653003201841653003301873653002401906653002101930700002301951700001901974700002401993773011202017852000902129856008502138655001202223IND4440126220221120084812.0100716s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444012622DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-009-0394-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazumdar, Suman10aIdentification of cultivation condition to produce correctly folded form of a malaria vaccine based on Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 in Escherichia coli  ap. 719-730.  aIncludes references  aThe C-terminal, 19-kDa domain of Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface protein-1 (PfMSP-1₁₉) is among the leading vaccine candidate for malaria due to its essential role in erythrocyte invasion by the parasite. We designed a synthetic gene for optimal expression of recombinant PfMSP-1₁₉ in Escherichia coli and developed a scalable process to obtain high-quality PfMSP-1₁₉. The synthetic gene construct yielded a fourfold higher expression level of PfMSP-1₁₉ in comparison to the native gene construct. Optimization of cultivation conditions in the bioreactor indicated important role of yeast extract and substrate feeding strategy for obtaining enhanced expression of soluble and correctly folded PfMSP-1₁₉. It was observed that the higher expression level of PfMSP-1₁₉ was essentially associated with the generation of higher level of incorrectly folded PfMSP-1₁₉. A simple purification procedure comprising metal affinity and ion exchange chromatography was developed to purify correctly folded form of PfMSP-1₁₉ from cell lysate. Biochemical and biophysical characterization of purified PfMSP-1₁₉ suggested that it was highly pure, homogeneous, and correctly folded. 3aEscherichia coli 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3abioreactors 3aerythrocytes 3afeeding methods 3aion exchange chromatography 3amalaria 3amerozoites 3aparasites 3asynthetic genes 3avaccines 3ayeast extract 0aMalaria vaccine 0aMerozoite surface protein-1 0aRecombinant Escherichia coli 0aProcess development 0aCharacterization1 aSachdeva, Suraksha1 aChauhan, V.

GnRH is a neurohormone synthesized by a small population of neurons located in the anterior hypothalamus, which regulates the secretion of gonadotropines in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland and they finally regulate the synthesis of sex steroids. Particular attention is given to analysis of the data involving the role of thymic peptides and cytokines in GnRH-system regulation in the normal condition and in the case of inflammation development caused by endotoxines in adult animals. The main prospects of the studies involving the influence of proinflammatory cytokines on GnRH-neuron migration and differentiation in prenatal ontogenesis are also discussed. 3aadults 3acytokines 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahypothalamus 3aimmune system 3ainflammation 3aneurons 3aontogeny 3apituitary gland 3asecretion 3asteroids1 aSharova, V.

Innate immunity plays an important role in the defense against infections. The complement system represents an essential part of the innate immune system. This cascade system is activated on the surface of A. fumigatus conidia and hyphae and enhances phagocytosis of conidia. A. fumigatus conidia but not hyphae bind to their surface host complement regulators factor H, FHL-1, and CFHR1, which control complement activation. Here, we show that A. fumigatus hyphae possess an additional endogenous activity to control complement activation. A. fumigatus culture supernatant efficiently cleaved complement components C3, C4, C5, and C1q as well as immunoglobulin G. Secretome analysis and protease inhibitor studies identified the secreted alkaline protease Alp1, which is present in large amounts in the culture supernatant, as the central molecule responsible for this cleavage. An alp1 deletion strain was generated, and the culture supernatant possessed minimal complement-degrading activity. Moreover, protein extract derived from an Escherichia coli strain overproducing Alp1 cleaved C3b, C4b, and C5. Thus, the protease Alp1 is responsible for the observed cleavage and degrades a broad range of different substrates. In summary, we identified a novel mechanism in A. fumigatus that contributes to evasion from the host complement attack.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aEscherichia coli 3acomplement 3aconidia 3afungi 3ahumans 3ahyphae 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apatients 3aphagocytosis 3aproteinase inhibitors 3aproteinases 2aAnimals 2aAspergillus fumigatusxenzymologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aComplement C1qxmetabolism 2aComplement C3xmetabolism 2aComplement C4xmetabolism 2aComplement C5xmetabolism 2aEscherichia colixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aGene Deletion 2aHumans 2aHyphaexenzymologyximmunology. 2aImmune Evasion 2aImmunoglobulin Gxmetabolism 2aMice 2aSerine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aLessing, Franziska1 aSchindler, Susann1 aWartenberg, Dirk1 aJacobsen, Ilse D.1 aThoen, Marcel1 aZipfel, Peter F.1 aBrakhage, Axel A.0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.3585-3594dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01353-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04457naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245012000202300001800322500002400340506007600364520182500440506003702265650003102302650003102333650002202364650002102386650002502407650002402432650001602456650001002472650002402482650001002506650001702516650002802533650002102561650002402582650002102606650000902627650003702636650001702673650001402690650001402704650001102718650002702729650001202756650004402768650002202812650004302834650004302877650003602920650003802956650001102994650003903005650004003044650000903084650000903093650002403102650001903126650004603145650002303191650002603214650002703240700003203267700002003299700002103319700001903340700002103359700002103380700002003401773011703421852000903538856008003547655001203627IND4439984520221207133836.0100716s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443998452DNAL7 a204982632pmid7 aPMC29162612pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01407-092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishanth, Gopala10aProtective Toxoplasma gondii-Specific T-Cell Responses Require T-Cell-Specific Expression of Protein Kinase C-Theta  ap. 3454-3464.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aProtein kinase C-theta (PKC-θ) is important for the activation of autoreactive T cells but is thought to be of minor importance for T-cell responses in infectious diseases, suggesting that PKC-θ may be a target for the treatment of T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. To explore the function of PKC-θ in a chronic persisting infection in which T cells are crucial for pathogen control, we infected BALB/c PKC-θ⁻/⁻ and PKC-θ⁺/⁺ wild-type mice with Toxoplasma gondii. The PKC-θ⁻/⁻ mice succumbed to necrotizing Toxoplasma encephalitis due to an insufficient parasite control up to day 40, whereas the wild-type mice survived. The number of T. gondii-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells was significantly reduced in the PKC-θ⁻/⁻ mice, resulting in the impaired production of protective cytokines (gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor) and antiparasitic effector molecules (inducible nitric oxide, gamma interferon-induced GTPase) in the spleen and brain. In addition, Th2-cell numbers were reduced in infected the PKC-θ⁻/⁻ mice, paralleled by the diminished GATA3 expression of PKC-θ⁻/⁻ CD4 T cells and reduced T. gondii-specific IgG production in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Western blot analysis of splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells revealed an impaired activation of the NF-κB, AP-1, and MAPK pathways in T. gondii-infected PKC-θ⁻/⁻ mice. Adoptive transfer of wild-type CD4 plus CD8 T cells significantly protected PKC-θ⁻/⁻ mice from death by increasing the numbers of gamma interferon-producing T. gondii-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells, illustrating a cell-autonomous, protective function of PKC-θ in T cells. These findings imply that PKC-θ inhibition drastically impairs T. gondii-specific T-cell responses with fatal consequences for intracerebral parasite control and survival.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aWestern blotting 3aantiparasitic agents 3aautoimmune diseases 3ablood serum 3abrain 3acerebrospinal fluid 3adeath 3aencephalitis 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainfectious diseases 3ainterferon-gamma 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3anitric oxide 3aparasites 3apathogens 3aspleen 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxanalysisxblood. 2aBrainximmunology 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCerebrospinal Fluidximmunology 2aCytokinesximmunologyxsecretion. 2aFemale 2aImmunoglobulin Gxanalysisxblood. 2aIsoenzymesxdeficiencyximmunology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Knockout 2aProtein Kinase Cxdeficiencyximmunology. 2aSpleenximmunology 2aTh2 Cellsximmunology 2aToxoplasmaximmunology1 aSakowicz-Burkiewicz, Monika1 aHandel, Ulrike.1 aKliche, Stefanie1 aWang, Xiaoqian1 aNaumann, Michael1 aDeckert, Martina1 aSchlüter, Dirk0 tInfection and immunity.g2010 Aug., v. 78, no. 8 p.3454-3464dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01407-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03181naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245010600172300001600278500001500294520122300309650002101532650001601553650000901569650002501578650002901603650002301632650001701655650002101672650002301693650002401716650003301740650001801773650002601791650001901817650002301836650004201859650002801901650002801929650001101957650001301968650003001981650003302011650002702044653002302071653001902094653001802113653002802131653002502159653002302184653002102207700001402228700001402242700001902256773006502275852000902340856007802349930003302427945001302460946001102473990002302484655001202507IND2044548720221120033811.0950210e19941017gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204454872DNAL7 a78453552pmid7 a10.1007/BF002797582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenturi, V.10aAmplification of the groESL operon in Pseudomonas putida increases siderophore gene promoter activity  ap. 126-132.  a2019-12-04  aPseudobactin 358 is the yellow-green fluorescent siderophore [microbial iron(III) transport agent] produced by Pseudomonas putida WCS358 under iron-limiting conditions. The genes encoding pseudobactin 358 biosynthesis are iron-regulated at the level of transcription. In this study, the molecular characterization is reported of a cosmid clone of WCS358 DNA that can stimulate, in an iron-dependent manner, the activity of a WCS358 siderophore gene promoter in the heterologous Pseudomonas strain A225. The functional region in the clone was identified by subcloning, transposon mutagenesis and DNA sequencing as the groESL operon of strain WCS358. This increase in promoter activity was not observed when the groESL genes of strain WCS358 were integrated via a transposon vector into the genome of Pseudomonas A225, indicating that multiple copies of the operon are necessary for the increase in siderophore gene promoter activity. Amplification of the Escherichia coli and WCS358 groESL genes also increased iron-regulated promoter activity in the parent strain WCS358. The groESL operon codes for the chaperone proteins GroES and GroEL, which are responsible for mediating the folding and assembly of many proteins. 3astructural genes 3achaperonins 3airon 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3abacterial proteins 3asiderophores 3apromoter regions 3aPseudomonas putida 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aChaperoninsxgenetics 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aGene Amplification 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOligopeptidesxgenetics 2aOperon 2aPlasmids 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aPseudomonas putidaxgenetics 2aSiderophoresxgenetics 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/x78435 0aamplification 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0achaperone proteins 0apseudobactin 3581 aWolfs, K.1 aLeong, J.1 aWeisbeek, P.J.0 tMGG.g1994 Oct. 17, v. 245, no. 1 p.126-132x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002797583Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03482naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245009100172300001400263520197700277650002202254650002102276650001302297650001202310650001802322650001202340650002602352650001202378650002602390650001602416650001402432650002602446650002802472650002602500650001802526650001302544650007502557653002002632653001402652653001402666653002702680700001502707773006302722852000902785856007802794930003302872945001302905946001102918990002302929655001202952IND2044547920221120033849.0950210e19941017gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204454792DNAL7 a78453612pmid7 a10.1007/BF002797542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, J.10aEthanol-hypersensitive and ethanol-dependent cdc- mutants in Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 86-95.  aEthanol-hypersensitive strains (ets mutants), unable to grow on media containing 6% ethanol, were isolated from a sample of mutagenized Schizosaccharomyces pombe wild-type cells. Genetic analysis of these ets strains demonstrated that the ets phenotype is associated with mutations in a large set of genes, including cell division cycle (cdc) genes, largely non-over-lapping with the set represented by the temperature conditional method; accordingly, we isolated some ets non-ts cdc- mutants, which may identify novel essential genes required for regulation of the S. pombe cell cycle. Conversely, seven well characterized ts cdc- mutants were tested for their ethanol sensitivity; among them, cdc1-7 and cdc13-117 exhibited a tight ets phenotype. Ethanol sensitivity was also tested in strains bearing different alleles of the cdc2 gene, and we found that some of them were ets, but others were non-ets; thus, ethanol hypersensitivity is an allele-specific phenotype. Based on the single base changes found in each particular allele of the cdc2 gene, it is shown that a single amino acid substitution in the p34Cdc2 gene product can produce this ets phenotype, and that ethanol hypersensitivity is probably due to the influence of this alcohol on the secondary and/or tertiary structure of the target protein. Ethanol-dependent (etd) mutants were also identified as mutants that can only be propagated on ethanol-containing media. This novel type of conditional phenotype also covers many unrelated genes. One of these etd mutants, etd1-1, was further characterized because of the lethal cdc- phenotype of the mutant cells under restrictive conditions (absence of ethanol). The isolation of extragenic suppressors of etd1-1, and the complementation cloning of a DNA fragment encompassing the etd1+ wild-type gene (or an extragenic multicopy suppressor) demonstrate that current genetic techniques may be applied to mutants isolated by using ethanol as a selective agent. 3aSaccharomycetales 3astructural genes 3aproteins 3amutants 3acell division 3aethanol 3aantifungal properties 3aalleles 3anutrient requirements 3amutagenesis 3aphenotype 3abiological resistance 2aCell Divisionxgenetics 2aEthanolxpharmacology 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMutation 2aSchizosaccharomycesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 0ainhibitor genes 0acdc genes 0acdc2 gene 0aextragenic suppressors1 aOballe, J.0 tMGG.g1994 Oct. 17, v. 245, no. 1 p.86-95x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002797543Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03728naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245013200172300001600304500001500320520160100335650001301936650002101949650002901970650002501999650001802024650002302042650002502065650001602090650001502106650002402121650001802145650002402163650001602187650004302203650001302246650001802259650002802277650001302305650002502318650001402343650002702357650002502384650002302409650007202432650003802504650002502542650001602567653001702583653002802600653001902628653001402647653001502661653001102676700001202687700001802699700001502717700001402732700001602746773006502762852000902827856007802836930003302914945001302947946001102960990002302971655001202994IND2044548320221120033701.0950210e19941017gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204454832DNAL7 a78453522pmid7 a10.1007/BF002797562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKikuchi, Y.12aA new yeast gene, HTR1, required for growth at high temperature, is needed for recovery from mating pheromone-induced G1 arrest  ap. 107-116.  a2019-12-04  aA new temperature-sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated. Arrested cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature were of dumb-bell shape and contained large vacuoles. A DNA fragment was cloned based on its ability to complement this temperature sensitivity. The HTR1 gene encodes a putative protein of 93 kDa without significant homology to any known proteins. The gene was mapped between ade5 and lys5 on the left arm of chromosome VIl. The phenotype of the gene disruptant appeared to be strain-specific; disruption of the gene in strain W303 caused the cells to become temperature sensitive. The arrested phenotype here was similar to that of the original ts mutant and cells in G2/M phase predominated at high temperature. Another disruptant in a strain YPH background grew slowly at high temperature due to slow progression through G2/M phase, and morphologically abnormal (elongated) cells accumulated. A single-copy suppressor that alleviated the temperature-sensitive defects in both strains was identified as MCS1/SSD1. The wild-type strains W303 and YPH are known to carry defective MCS1/SSD1 alleles; hence HTR1 may function redundantly with MCS1/ SSD1 to suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotypes. In addition, based on a halo bioassay, the disruptant strains appeared to be defective in recovery from, or adaptive response to G1 arrest mediated by mating pheromone, even at the permissive temperature. Thus the gene has at least two functions and is designated HTR1 (required for high temperature growth and recovery from G1 arrest induced by mating pheromone). 3aproteins 3astructural genes 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3acell division 3achromosome mapping 3anucleotide sequences 3atemperature 3apheromones 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Cycle Proteins 2aDNA, Fungal 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aG1 Phase 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPeptidesxphysiology 2aPhenotype 2aPheromonesxphysiology 2aRNA-Binding Proteins 2aRepressor Proteins 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aTemperature 0aalpha-factor 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d25541 0ahtr1 gene 0acell cycle 0agrowth1 aOka, Y.1 aKobayashi, M.1 aUesono, Y.1 aToh-E, A.1 aKikuchi, A.0 tMGG.g1994 Oct. 17, v. 245, no. 1 p.107-116x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002797563Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03733naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001300156245014100169300001600310500001500326520155000341650002001891650002101911650001401932650002901946650002301975650001301998650002902011650002502040650001902065650002102084650004802105650003802153650003502191650003002226650003902256650001802295650002502313650004102338650002902379650002302408650003902431650003802470650003602508650002702544650003102571653001202602653002302614653001402637653001502651653002102666653001402687653001402701653001402715653002002729700002302749700001902772773006502791852000902856856007802865930003302943945001302976946001102989990002303000655001203023IND2045393820221120033805.0950404e19941215gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204539382DNAL7 a78307152pmid7 a10.1007/BF002972742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, H.10aGenetic interactions between SIN3 mutations and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional activators encoded by MCM1, STE12, and SWI1  ap. 675-685.  a2019-12-04  aSIN3 was first identified by a mutation which suppresses the effects of an swi5 mutation on expression of the HO gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We now show that a sin3 mutation also partially suppresses the effects of swi1 on HO transcription, and partially suppresses the growth defect and inositol requirement observed in swi1 mutants. This suggests that SIN3 and SWI1 may play opposite regulatory roles in controlling expression of many yeast genes. Yeast SIN3 has been shown to function as a negative transcriptional regulator of a number of yeast genes. However, expression of the yeast STE6 gene is reduced in a sin3 mutant strain. This suggests that SIN3 functions as a positive regulator for STE6 transcription, although this apparent activation function could be indirect. In order to understand how SIN3 functions in STE6 regulation, we have performed a genetic analysis. It has been previously demonstrated that MCM1 and STE12 are transcriptional activators of a-specific genes such as STE6, and we now show that SWI1 is also required for STE6 expression. Our data suggest that STE12 and SWI1 function in different pathways of activation, and that STE12 is epistatic to SIN3 and SWI1. We show that the activities of the Mcm1p and Ste12p activators are modestly reduced in a sin3 mutant strain, and that phosphorylation of the Ste12p activator is decreased in a sin3 mutant. Thus, it is possible that the decreased transcription of STE6 in sin3 mutants is due to the combined effect of the diminished activities of Mcm1p and Ste12p. 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3aepistasis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abeta-galactosidase 3amutation 3atranscription (genetics) 3aDNA-binding proteins 3areporter genes 3apromoter regions 2aATP-Binding Cassette Transportersxgenetics 2aChromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aFungal Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGlycoproteins 2aHistone Deacetylases 2aMinichromosome Maintenance 1 Protein 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRepressor Proteins 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTranscriptional Activation 0aho gene 0agenetic regulation 0amcm1 gene 0aste12 gene 0agene interaction 0aste6 gene 0aswi1 gene 0apho5 gene 0ainhibitor genes1 aReynolds-Hager, L.1 aStillman, D.J.0 tMGG.g1994 Dec. 15, v. 245, no. 6 p.675-685x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002972743Available from publisher's Web site  a19950501b19950505c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02327naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245012700155300001600282500001500298520096800313650002601281650002201307650002101329650001601350650002901366650001801395650002501413650002101438653001401459653001701473653001801490653001501508653003301523653002501556700001201581700001701593700001801610773006201628852000901690856007801699930003301777945001301810946001101823990002301834655001201857IND2044544720221120033704.0950210e199411  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204454472DNAL7 a10.1007/BF003022642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChiang, T.Y.10aDNA binding site specificity of the Neurospora global nitrogn regulatory protein NIT2: analysis with mutated binding sites  ap. 512-516.  a2019-12-04  aNIT2, a positive-acting regulatory protein in Neurospora crassa, activates the expression of a series of unlinked structural genes that encode nitrogen catabolic enzymes. NIT2 binding sites in the promoter regions of nit3, alc and lao have at least two GATA sequence elements. We have examined the binding affinity of the NIT2 protein for the yeast DAL5 wild-type upstream activation sequence UAS(NTR), which contains two GATA elements, and for a series of mutated binding sites, each differing from the wild-type site by a single base. Substitution for individual nucleotides within 5' or 3' sequences that flank the GATA elements had only modest effects upon NIT2 binding. In contrast, nearly all substitutions within the GATA elements almost completely eliminated NIT2 binding, demonstrating the importance of the GATA sequence for NIT2 binding. Four high-affinity binding sites for the NIT2 protein were found within a central region of the nit-2 gene itself. 3atranscription factors 3aNeurospora crassa 3astructural genes 3amutagenesis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3apromoter regions 0adal5 gene 0anit2 protein 0agata sequence 0anit-2 gene 0aupstream activation sequence 0anucleotide sequences1 aRai, R.1 aCooper, T.G.1 aMarzluf, G.A.0 tMGG.g1994 Nov., v. 245, no. 4 p.512-516x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF003022643Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03676naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001800156245014800174300001600322500001500338520178600353650002002139650002102159650003602180650002202216650002002238650001902258650002202277650001902299650002202318650001402340650002102354650002302375650001802398650001502416650001802431650002802449650004602477650002102523650003302544650001802577650003002595650004202625650001202667650002802679653001902707653001502726653001302741700001602754700002002770700001702790773006402807852000902871856007802880930003302958945001302991946001103004990002303015655001203038IND2044520620221120033722.0950209e19941101gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204452062DNAL7 a78160382pmid7 a10.1007/BF002901082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStockhaus, J.10aEvolution of the C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase promoter of the C4 dicot Flaveria trinervia: an expression analysis in the C3 plant tobacco  ap. 286-293.  a2019-12-04  aThe key enzymes of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in C4 plants have evolved from C3 isoforms which were present in the C3 ancestral species. We are interested in the molecular changes responsible for the novel expression pattern of C4 genes and are focussing on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) of the genus Flaveria. The C4 isoform of PEPCase in the C4 plant F. trinervia is encoded by the ppcA subgroup of the PEPcase gene family and is abundantly expressed in the mesophyll cells of leaves. The orthologous ppcA genes of the C3 plant F. pringlei are only weakly expressed and their transcripts do not accumulate in a leaf-specific manner but, rather, are present in all plant organs. To answer the question whether the differences in the expression levels of the ppcA genes from F. pringlei and F. trinervia are caused by changes in the 5 upstream regions of the genes or by C4-specific trans-regulatory factors. varying parts of the 5' flanking region of the ppcA1 genes of both species were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and inserted in the tobacco genome. GUS expression analysis of transgenic plants revealed that the level of expression of the Flaveria ppcA1 genes are recapitulated in the heterologous C3 plant tobacco. Hence, the 5' upstream region of the ppcA1 gene of F. trinervia contains regulatory cis-elements that are responsible for the C4-specific, abundant expression of this gene. These sequences are located upstream of position -500 relative to the transcription initiation site. Interestingly, the ppcA1 promoter (position -2118 to position +66) of F. trinervia is specifically active in palisade parenchyma cells of transgenic tobacco, suggesting that the mesophyll specificity of this promoter is partially maintained in tobacco. 3arecombinant DNA 3astructural genes 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 3ahistochemistry 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3aFlaveria pringlei 3amesophyll 3apromoter regions 3abeta-glucuronidase 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plant 2aGlucuronidase 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylasexgenetics 2aPlantsxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modified 2aPlants, Toxic 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aTobacco 2aTransformation, Genetic 0appca1 promoter 0appca1 gene 0aFlaveria1 aPoetsch, W.1 aSteinmuller, K.1 aWesthoff, P.0 tMGG.g1994 Nov. 1, v. 245, no. 3 p.286-293x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002901083Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03455naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245007400172300001400246500001500260520151100275650002701786650001801813650002101831650002201852650002401874650002801898650001401926650002501940650003401965650002901999650002102028650002702049650002002076650002002096650002102116650002402137650001202161650002302173650002102196650005502217650003802272650002802310650002102338650001302359650001402372650002502386653001902411653002802430653001902458653002502477653001902502700001502521700001502536773006302551852000902614856007802623930003302701945001302734946001102747990002302758655001202781IND2044547520221120033824.0950210e19941017gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204454752DNAL7 a78453562pmid7 a10.1007/BF002797472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyvanen, M.10aGlutathione transferase gene family from the housefly Musca domestica  ap. 25-31.  a2019-12-04  aThree new glutathione transferase (GST) genes from the housefly Musca domestica are described. These genes, identified as MdGST-2, -3, and -4, were from cDNA clones obtained from a cDNA bank in phage a. The bank was prepared using poly(A)+ RNA from a housefly that is highly resistant to organophosphate insecticides because of enhanced expression of multiple members of the glutathione transferase gene family. The DNA sequence of each is reported and has a complete open reading frame that specified an amino acid sequence similar to other dipteran glutathione transferases. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we can conclude that the insect glutathione transferase gene family falls into two groups, each of which evolves at a different rate, presumably due to differences in functional constraints. We show that MdGST-1 (and their homologues from Drosophila and Lucilia) evolve at a significantly slower rate than the other members of the gene family. Each housefly GST cDNA was inserted into a bacterial plasmid expression system and a glutathione transferase activity was expressed in Escherichia coli. The transcription pattern of each of these glutathione transferases was examined in a variety of different housefly strains that are known to differ in their resistance to organophosphate insecticides due to different patterns of glutathione transferase expression. We found that the level of transcription for two of our clones was positively correlated with the level of organophosphate resistance. 3agenetic transformation 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3aglutathione transferase 3aphylogeny 3aamino acid sequences 3aorganophosphorus insecticides 3atranscription (genetics) 3amultigene family 3ainsecticide resistance 3aMusca domestica 3aenzyme activity 3aEscherichia coli 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCloning, Molecular 2aEscherichia coli 2aGlutathione Transferasexclassificationxgenetics. 2aHousefliesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aPhylogeny 2aRecombinant Proteins 0agenbank/x72576 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x73574 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/x735751 aZhou, Z.H.1 aWang, J.Y.0 tMGG.g1994 Oct. 17, v. 245, no. 1 p.25-31x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002797473Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02759naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245013500171300001600306520114800322650002801470650002501498650002301523650002001546650001101566650001501577650002901592650002601621650002401647650003501671650001801706650001901724650000901743650002301752650002801775650002301803650005101826650003801877650003101915653002301946700001501969700001401984773006401998852000902062856007802071930003302149945001302182946001102195990002302206655001202229IND2044521120221120033857.0950209e19941101gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204452112DNAL7 a78160412pmid7 a10.1007/BF002901112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScreen, S.10aOxygen sensitivity and metal ion-dependent transcriptional activation by NIFA protein from Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar trifolii  ap. 313-322.  aThe NIFA protein from Rhizobium leguminosrum biovar trifolii (R. trifolii) strain ANU843 lacks an N-terminal domain present in homologous NIFA proteins from other diazotrophs. The R. trifolii nifA gene product is unstable when expressed in Escherichia coli under both aerobic and microaerobic conditions. Stability is increased by fusion of additional amino acids to the N-terminus of the protein or by expression of nifA in sno mutant (presumed protease deficient) strains of E. coli. Transcriptional activation in vivo by R. trifolii NIFA decreases under aerobic growth conditions, or when cultures are depleted of metal ions. In sno mutant strains this decrease in activity reflects a loss of specific activity rather than proteolytic degradation, implying that R. trifolii NIFA requires metal ions for activity and is oxygen sensitive. The addition of 30 amino acids to the amino-terminus of R. trifolii NIFA results in an oxygen-tolerant protein, with metal ion-dependent activity. Metal ions are therefore not only required for oxygen sensing by R. trifolii NIFA but may play an additional role in determining NIFA structure or activity. 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aDNA-binding proteins 3abacterial proteins 3agene expression 3aoxygen 3ametal ions 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterial 2aIons 2aMetalsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aRhizobium leguminosarumxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxmetabolism 2aTranscriptional Activation 0agenetic regulation1 aWatson, J.1 aDixon, R.0 tMGG.g1994 Nov. 1, v. 245, no. 3 p.313-322x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002901113Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03504naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001600156245008700172300001600259500001500275520160600290650002501896650001101921650002201932650002101954650002401975650002501999650002002024650002302044650001002067650001202077650002102089650001902110650002602129650001802155650001502173650002102188650001802209650002802227650002402255650002902279653001102308653001902319653001602338653002802354653001602382653003302398653001602431653001902447653003902466653002502505653001402530653001402544700001502558700001402573773006402587852000902651856007802660930003302738945001302771946001102784990002302795655001202818IND2044522320221120025639.0950209e19941101gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204452232DNAL7 a78160492pmid7 a10.1007/BF002901202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe Guen, L.10aGene density and organization in a small region of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome  ap. 390-396.  a2019-12-04  aWe have characterized a 6.4 kb genomic fragment from Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia overlapping the 5' end of the AKin10 gene which encodes a protein Ser/Thr kinase. Using, as probes, various restriction fragments located upstream of AKin10, two cDNA clones have been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from young shoot tissue. A comparison between the cDNA and the above genomic sequences allowed us to locate two novel genes, Atcys1 and Athyp1 (for Arabidopsis thaliana cystathionine gamma-synthase 1 and hypothetical protein 1). The coding sequences of both genes are interrupted by introns and the exons match the sequences of the corresponding cDNAs. Further analysis of the genomic fragment revealed the presence of an open reading frame (ORF) of 609 nucleotides situated between the two genes. Atcys1, Athyp1, AKin10 and the ORF are very close to each other and organized in the same polarity: hence, the intergenic regions probably contain, within less than 0.5 kb, all the regulatory elements necessary to govern initiation and termination of transcription. The deduced protein sequence of Atcys1 shows a high degree of similarity with the cystathionine gamma-synthase from Escherichia coli. The putative product of the Athyp1 gene contains seven hydrophobic regions flanked by hydrophilic domains, reminiscent of membrane-spanning proteins. Southern blot hybridization experiments suggest the presence of one copy of Atcys1, Athyp1 and AKin10 per haploid genome, and Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the three genes are differentially expressed in roots, shoots and leaves. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3alyases 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3achromosome mapping 3aexons 3aintrons 3apromoter regions 3aplant proteins 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Plant 2aGenes, Regulator 2aGenome, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 0agenome 0agenbank/x78422 0aathyp1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0aakin10 gene 0acystathionine gamma-synthase 0aatcys1 gene 0agenbank/x79707 0ao-succinylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase 0anucleotide sequences 0ahyp1 gene 0acys1 gene1 aThomas, M.1 aKreis, M.0 tMGG.g1994 Nov. 1, v. 245, no. 3 p.390-396x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF002901203Available from publisher's Web site  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02686naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002500156245010500181300001600286500001500302520069400317650002101011650001601032650001601048650002901064650002501093650002501118650001301143650001901156650001701175650002501192650002201217650001201239650002401251650001601275650004401291650003001335650001801365650003301383650002701416650002801443650001301471650003101484650005301515650003901568650003401607653001901641653001301660653002801673653001701701700001601718700001401734700001801748700001501766773006401781852000901845856007801854930003301932945001301965946001101978990002301989655001202012IND2044520420221120025626.0950209e19941101gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204452042DNAL7 a78160362pmid7 a10.1007/BF002901062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauer, M.q(Manfred)10aPET1402, a nuclear gene required for proteolytic processing of cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 in yeast  ap. 272-278.  a2019-12-04  aThe nuclear mutation pet ts1402 prevents proteolytic processing of the precursor of cytochrome oxidase subunit 2 (cox2) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

We report the nucleotide sequence of an 8.4-kb region of genomic DNA of Drosophila hydei which includes the entire Adh region. Analysis of this sequence reveals similarity in organization to the Adh region of Drosophila mojavensis and Drosophila mulleri of the mulleri subgroup, with three genes ordered 5' to 3', Adh-psi, Adh-2, Adh-1. Deletion of a nucleotide in the second codon of each pseudogene suggests that the first Adh duplication occurred before the divergence of the hydei and mulleri subgroups. However, Adh-1 and Adh-2 of D. hydei are significantly more alike than Adh-1 and Adh-2 of D. mojavensis. Models to account for the difference in similarity between the coding genes were tested by orthologous and paralogous comparisons of the extent of sequence divergence. A model which proposes that independent duplication events generated Adh-1 and Adh-2 in the two lineages is supported by these data. The D. hydei pseudogene is transcribed and the transcript is processed in a complex manner. An intron of greater than 6.2 kb exists between the first "coding" exon and an upstream exon which is approximately 250 nucleotides in length. 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3apseudogenes 3amessenger RNA 3arestriction mapping 3aevolution 3agene conversion 3aamino acid sequences 3atranscription (genetics) 3aexons 3aintrons 3arepetitive sequences 3aDrosophila 3aprediction 2aAlcohol Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Evolution 2aChromosome Deletion 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNAxgenetics 2aDrosophilaxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aExons 2aGene Library 2aGenetic Variation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aOligonucleotide Probes 2aRestriction Mapping 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data 0atranscripts 0anucleotide sequences 0adrosophila mulleri 0adrosophila mojavensis1 aStarmer, W.T.1 aSullivan, D.T.0 tGenetics.g1991 Feb., v. 127, no. 2 p.355-366x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02545naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245010300167300001400270520136200284650002301646650000901669650000901678650002001687650001201707650002101719650001001740650001501750650001101765650002301776650002001799651001201819700002001831700001701851700001801868700001801886700001801904773015401922856005002076852000902126655001202135IND60313038120221120023036.0150716s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031303812DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2013.033.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConner, David10aMeasuring Current Consumption of Locally Grown Foods in Vermont: Methods for Baselines and Targets  ap. 83-94.  aNumerous studies have measured the economic impact of increased consumption of locally grown foods, and many advocates have set goals for increasing consumption of locally grown foods to a given percentage. In this paper, we first apply previously developed methods to the state of Vermont, to measure the quantity and value of food that would be consumed if the USDA Dietary Guidelines were followed. We also assess the potential of locally grown foods to meet these guidelines, finding that meeting dietary guidelines with a local, seasonal diet would bring economic benefit, in this case, US$148 million in income for Vermont farmers. A missing piece of information has been: what is the current percentage of locally grown food being consumed in a given city, state, or region? The Farm to Plate Strategic Plan, a 10-year plan for strengthening Vermont's food system, attempted to answer this question. To date, we know of no credible set of methods to precisely measure the percentage of food consumed that is locally grown. We collect data from a variety of sources to estimate current local consumption of food. We were able to measure and account for about US$52 million in local food expenditures, equal to about 2.5% of all food expenditures in Vermont. We then discuss limitations and suggestions for improving measurement methods moving forward. 3aDietary Guidelines 3aUSDA 3adiet 3aeconomic impact 3afarmers 3afood consumption 3afoods 3aguidelines 3aincome 3alocal food systems 3anutritive value 3aVermont1 aBecot, Florence1 aHoffer, Doug1 aKahler, Ellen1 aSawyer, Scott1 aBerlin, Linda0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2013, v. 3, no. 3 p.83-94dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2013.033.004  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002200110040001800132100001800150245007700168300001600245500001500261520180400276650002202080650002702102650002202129650002402151650001502175650001302190650002602203650002102229650001302250650001802263650002502281650001302306650001302319650001002332650002502342650001502367650001202382650002402394650001802418650001802436650002302454650002102477650005302498650001702551650001802568650001302586650001202599650002802611650001302639650002402652650004502676653001202721653001402733653002802747653002302775653001502798700001402813700001602827773006702843852000902910939003302919946001302952655001202965IND9100917620221120023230.0910220e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910091762DNAL7 a20047052pmid7 aPMC12043582pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeilotter, H.10aGenetic and molecular analysis of cdr1/nim1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 309-318.  a2019-12-04  aThe cdr1 gene in Schizosaccharomyces pombe was identified as a mutation affecting the nutritional responsiveness of the mitotic size control. cdr1 alleles have been further analyzed for genetic interactions with elements of the mitotic control pathway and cloned by plasmid rescue of a conditional lethal cdr1-76 cdc25-22 double mutant. These analyses show that the cdr1 gene is allelic to nim1, a gene identified as a high copy number plasmid suppressor of the mitotic control gene, cdc25. The gene structure for cdr] differs from the described nim1 gene in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the gene. The published nim1 sequence encoded a product of predicted Mr 45,000, and included 356 amino acids from the amino-terminal region of the gene and 14 amino acids from a noncontiguous carboxyl-terminal fragment. The cdr1 sequence includes an additional 237 amino acids of the contiguous fragment and encodes a product of predicted Mr 67,000. The sequence shows a high level of identity with protein kinases over the amino-terminal catalytic domain, and limited identity with yeast protein kinases SNF1, KIN2 and KIN1 over part of the carboxyl-terminal domain. The effect of overexpression of the full length gene has been examined in various genetic backgrounds. These data show that the full length gene product is required to give a normal cell cycle response to nitrogen starvation. A detailed examination of the genetic interaction of cdr1 mutants with various mutants of mitotic control genes (cdc2, cdc25, wee1, cdc13) demonstrated strong interactions with cdc25, some cdc2 alleles, and with cdc13-117. Overall, the results are interpretable within the framework of the existing model of cdr1/nim1 action in mitotic control, i.e., cdr1 functions upstream of wee1 to relieve mitotic inhibition. 3aSouthern blotting 3agenetic transformation 3aSaccharomycetales 3arestriction mapping 3astarvation 3anitrogen 3anutrient deficiencies 3agene interaction 3amutation 3acell division 3aamino acid sequences 3aplasmids 3aallelism 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aprediction 2aAlleles 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Division 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNA, Fungalxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aGene Library 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenotype 2aMitosis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlasmids 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSchizosaccharomycesxcytologyxgenetics. 0acloning 0acdr1 gene 0amolecular sequence data 0achromosome mapping 0aregulation1 aNurse, P.1 aYoung, P.G.0 tGenetics.g1991 Feb., v. 127, no. 2 p.309-318x0016-67317nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03649naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245011100164300001800275520190200293650002902195650001002224650002502234650002502259650002002284650001102304650002402315650001802339650002802357650002502385650003302410650004202443650002102485650003302506650002802539650003202567650002402599650001402623650003002637650002802667650002402695650002702719650003602746650002702782653002802809700001702837700001502854700001602869700001702885700001802902773008402920852000903004939003303013946001303046655001203059IND9100908820221117162235.0910220e199102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910090882DNAL7 a19917122pmid7 aPMC2072332pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKullik, I.10aBradyrhizobium japonicum has two differentially regulated, functional homologs of the sigma 54 gene (rpoN)  ap. 1125-1138.  aRecognition of -24/-12-type promoters by RNA polymerase requires a special sigma factor, sigma factor 54 (RpoN NtrA GlnF). In the nitrogen-fixing soybean symbiont Bradyrhizobium japonicum, two functional, high]y conserved rpoN genes (rpoN1, and rpoN2) were identified and sequenced. The two predicted B. japonicum RpoN protein sequences were 87% identical, and both showed different levels of homology to the RpoN proteins of other bacteria. Downstream of rpoN2 (but not of rpoN1), two additional open reading frames were identified that corresponded to open reading frames located at similar positions in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas putida. Both B. japonicum rpoN genes complemented the succinate- and nitrate-negative phenotypes of a Rhizobium meliloti rpoN mutant. B. japonicum strains carrying single or double rpoN mutations were still able to utilize C4-dicarboxylates as a carbon source and histidine, proline, or arginine as a nitrogen source, whereas the ability to assimilate nitrate required expression of at least one of the two rpoN genes. In symbiosis both rpoN genes could replace each other functionally. The rpoN1/2 double mutant induced about twice as many nodules on soybeans as did the wild type, and these nodules lacked nitrogen fixation activity completely. Transcription of a nifH'-'lacZ fusion was not activated in the rpoN1/2 mutant background, whereas expression of a fixR'-'lacZ fusion in this mutant was affected only marginally. By using rpoN'-'lacZ fusions, rpoN1 expression was shown to be activated at least sevenfold in microaerobiosis as compared with that in aerobiosis, and this type of regulation involved fixLJ. Expression of rpoN2 was observed under all conditions tested and was increased fivefold in an rpoN2 mutant. The data suggested that the rpoN1 gene was regulated in response to oxygen, whereas the rpoN2 gene was negatively autoregulated. 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aoxygen 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aDNA-Directed RNA Polymerases 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aOpen Reading Frames 2aPhenotype 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRNA Polymerase Sigma 54 2aRestriction Mapping 2aRhizobiaceaexgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSigma Factorxgenetics 0amolecular sequence data1 aFritsche, S.1 aKnobel, H.1 aSanjuan, J.1 aHennecke, H.1 aFischer, H.M.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1991 Feb., v. 173, no. 3 p.1125-1138x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02425naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002500149245007800174300001600252520135400268650002301622650002001645650001801665650002201683650002301705650001201728650001501740650002901755650002201784651001101806700002201817700002101839773015601860856005002016852000902066655001202075IND60313039820221117162228.0150716s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031303982DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2013.034.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFazzino, David V.

Our experiences with various food system research projects over the last five years have revealed several exclusionary and inclusionary practices and policies that call into question shared notions of community among local food producers and consumers. We note the different motivations and discourses that producers and consumers construct for themselves and each other regarding their participation in local food movements. Tension and frictions exist in these multilayered foodscapes where cultural values of community, as imagined by both producers and consumers, confront the reality of market interactions. Hence, rather than producing a unified narrative of sustainability that is agreed upon by all members of some imagined community, we suggest that future food system research and development initiatives should be open to how foodscapes will and must remain contested landscapes whose contours are ever shifting. The alternative, we argue, is to perpetuate a façade of food system reform that, while sufficient for some, will remain vulnerable to external criticism by those who continue to promote only large-scale and industrial paradigms. 3aconsumer attitudes 3acultural values 3afood industry 3aissues and policy 3alocal food systems 3amarkets 3amotivation 3aresearch and development 3aresearch projects 3aAlaska1 aLoring, Philip A.1 aMohammadi, Azara0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2013, v. 3, no. 4 p.103-108dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2013.034.013  aDNAL 7aarticle01808naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001800236520068400254650001300938650001100951650001500962650001500977650001200992650001401004650001601018650001401034650002101048650001401069650001901083650001101102650001101113650003701124653002301161653002301184700001701207700001701224773009201241852000901333939003301342946001101375655001201386IND9100903720221123034045.0910219e199012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910090372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHocart, C.H.10aMetabolism and translocation of exogenous zeatin riboside in germinating seeds and seedlings of Zea mays  ap. 1517-1524.  aHigh specific activity [3H]-zeatin riboside (ZR) was supplied to germinating seed and developing seedlings of Zea mays to study its metabolism and translocation.

While several studies have evaluated characteristics of farmers' markets within single metropolitan areas, few have compared the impact of multiple markets in socioeconomically contrasting regions. This research compares shopping habits and economic impacts of customers at farmers' markets in two North American cities: Flint, Michigan, and London, Ontario. Overall, 895 market visitors completed surveys. We conducted statistical and spatial analyses to identify differences between these markets. Though geographically proximate and similar in metropolitan size, the two cities differ greatly in recent economic development, social vitality, and public health indicators. The objectives of this article are to quantify the impact that each market has on its local economy and contextualize these impacts in light of the place-specific attributes of each market. Results indicate that customers come from a mix of urban and suburban locations, but that key urban areas do not draw a substantial share of customers. Marketing efforts in nearby disadvantaged neighborhoods, therefore, might yield new customers and increase multiplier effects within the neighborhoods. The London market drew slightly younger customers who shopped less frequently, while the Flint market drew an older crowd that attended more regularly. This may be attributable to the relative age of the markets, and certainly reflects the marketing push of each market's managers. Given the opportunity to compare similarities and differences, much can be learned from each market in terms of opportunities for marketing, local economic development, and increased community vitality. 3acities 3aconsumers (people) 3aeconomic impact 3afarmers' markets 3alow-income neighborhoods 3amanagers 3amultipliers 3apublic health 3asmall businesses 3asurveys 3aurban areas 3aMichigan 3aOntario1 aClark, Michael A.

  1 aFrenken, Koen10aIntroduction: Evolutionary methodologies for analyzing environmental innovations and the implications for environmental policy  ap. 449-452.  a2019-12-04  aIt is commonly recognized that environmental innovations provide an important key to sustainability. However, the two dominant approaches within environmental economics - neoclassical and ecological economics - have found it difficult to develop a systematic research program on environmental innovation. From the 1980s evolutionary economics emerged as a framework for analysing analyzing and understanding economic change and industrial dynamics. Evolutionary economic theory provides a dynamic framework, where differential patterns of survival in populations produce aggregate changes in an economy [R. Nelson and S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, London, 1982.]. From the mid-1990s onwards, evolutionary economics emerged as a promising alternative for the economic analysis of environmental innovations. More recently, scholars have started to develop formal evolutionary models in environmental studies. These efforts reflect a further deepening of the evolutionary program in the area of environmental studies, which opens up possibilities for applications in environmental policy-making [K. Frenken, A. Faber and A.M. Idenburg, Introduction: environmental policy and modelling in evolutionary economics, in: A. Faber, K. Frenken and A.M. Idenburg, Environmental Policy and Modelling in Evolutionary Economics, MNP (report 550033001), Bilthoven, 2006, pp. 11-18., J.C.J.M. van den Bergh, A. Faber, A.M. Idenburg and F.H. Oosterhuis, Evolutionary Economics and Environmental Policy. Survival of the Greenest., Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2007.]. The goal of this special issue is to provide an overview of evolutionary approaches to environmental innovation with a focus on formal modeling. We consider the recent modeling efforts as a next step towards a truly ''evolutionary environmental economics''. Such an approach provides policymakers with an alternative perspective on environmental policy, emphasizing the dynamic welfare effects of policy [A. Faber and K. Frenken, Models in evolutionary economics and environmental policy: Towards an evolutionary environmental economics, Technological Forecasting & Social Change, this issue (2008).], the dangers of technological lock-in [G.C. Unruh, Escaping carbon lock-in, Energy Policy, 30 (2002) 317-325.], co-evolutionary perspectives on technical change [J.C.J.M. van den Bergh and S. Stagl, Coevolution of economic behaviour and institutions: towards a theory of institutional change, Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 13 (2003) 289-317.], consumer preferences [M.A. Janssen and W. Jager, Stimulating diffusion of green products, co-evolution between firms and consumers, Journal of Evolutionary Economics, 12 (2002) 283-306.] and long-term transition policy [J.C.J.M. van den Bergh, A. Faber, A.M.Idenburg and F.H. Oosterhuis, Evolutionary economics and environmental policy. Survival of the greenest., Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2007.], often (but not exclusively) by means of scenario analysis or dynamic simulation models. This puts the evolutionary perspective as complementary to neoclassical policy insights that are highly appropriate for well-defined, short-term problem contexts and to ecological policy insights into the management of material flows. The contributions to the special issue are divided into three parts. The first part consists of a methodological discussion and a literature review, and serves as an introduction to the use of evolutionary economics in environmental studies and environmental policy. The second part consists of seven modeling contributions addressing a variety of topics, including technology diffusion, technological substitution, consumer heterogeneity, eco-labelling, renewable resources, and recycling. The third part contains two empirical contributions on innovation systems, applied to a specific sector (automotive) and particular emerging technologies (biofuels and biomass). 3amodels 3aenvironmental economics 3aenvironmental policy 3atechnological change 0anew technology 0aevolutionary economics 0ainnovation systems 0atechnology1 aFaber, Albert0 tTechnological forecasting and social change.g2009 May, v. 76, no. 4 p.449-452x0040-16257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2008.04.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100512b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/05/12  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02450naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245009600171300001400267520138100281650002001662650001401682650001801696650001501714650001101729650002301740650001101763650001301774650001901787650001201806651001101818700002201829700002401851773015401875856005002029852000902079655001202088IND60313033420221123034134.0150715s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031303342DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2013.033.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoring, Philip A.10aSeafood as Local Food: Food Security and Locally Caught Seafood on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula  ap. 13-30.  aIn this paper we explore the relationship between food security and access to locally caught seafood for communities of the Kenai Peninsula region of Alaska. Seafood and fisheries are infrequently discussed in the literature on local and small-scale food movements; instead, they are more commonly construed as overexploited components of a global food system and a source of conflict with respect to global food security and fisheries conservation. By way of contrast, we argue here that many fisheries have the potential to be sources of healthy and sustainable "local" food, in support of the many values and goals embraced by local food movement, including conservation. With data collected via a by-mail survey, we show that many people in our Alaskan study region enjoy improved food security because they have access to locally caught seafood, especially those households at the lowest income levels. We also show, however, that access to these resources is still uneven for some, and we discuss strategies for improving the social-justice aspects of this component of the regional food system. Our findings are important not just to the fisheries and food security research communities, but also for contributing to a better understanding of the conditions within which local and regional food movements can achieve the ambitious social and ecological goals they seek. 3adata collection 3afisheries 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3alocal food systems 3apeople 3aseafoods 3asocial justice 3asurveys 3aAlaska1 aGerlach, S.

  1 aBleda, Mercedes10aGraded eco-labels: A demand-oriented approach to reduce pollution  ap. 512-524.  a2019-12-04  aSupplied oriented environmental policies are generally used in order to limit production related pollution. This fact is based on the hypothesis that consumers are not willing to sacrifice personal utility for a wider social gain. We suggest that widespread environmental concerns of consumers can be exploited to push producers along cleaner technological patterns. Our core assumption is that consumers would be ready to purchase cleaner products if the products' characteristics are not 'too dissimilar' to those of more polluting alternatives. However, due to a lack of information about non-observable product characteristics, this assumption on its own is not sufficient for 'environmental friendly' producers to become competitive. We show - by means of a simulation model - that only if consumers are provided with appropriate information on the greenness of products through adequate eco-labels (graded eco-labels), then producers will be pressed to implement innovations aimed at reducing the environmental impact of their products. Under two test settings - one without any certification and another with binary eco-labels - the model shows markets characterised by highly polluting technological patterns. Only in the presence of graded eco-labels, competition drives the market toward cleaner technological patterns. 3aconsumer behavior 3asimulation models 3apollution control 3ainnovation adoption 3amarketing 3ainformation 3aenvironmental quality 3aenvironmental policy 0alabeling 0agreen products 0aeco-labelling 0anew technology 0atechnological change 0aenvironmental protection 0atechnology1 aValente, Marco0 tTechnological forecasting and social change.g2009 May, v. 76, no. 4 p.512-524x0040-16257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2008.05.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100512b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/05/12  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03591naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181072001700198100001600215245011700231300001400348500001500362520127400377650001201651650001701663650001801680650002301698650001201721650001101733650002201744650001601766650001601782650001001798650002001808650001101828650000801839650002901847650002401876650001801900650001901918650001601937650002301953650002501976650002302001650003202024650000902056650002802065650002002093650002802113650002802141650001902169650001702188650003002205650001102235650001102246650000902257650002302266650001502289650001602304650001702320651001002337651002502347653001602372700002502388700001702413700002002430700002302450773008802473852000902561856008502570930003302655945002502688946001302713990002302726655001202749IND4418817020221123024511.0090406e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441881702DNAL7 a192349952pmid7 a10.1080/016393608026339872doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aArlappa, N.10aNutritional Parameters and Chronic Energy Deficiency in Older Adults of Desert Areas of Western Rajasthan, India  ap. 61-71.  a2019-12-04  aNutritional status was assessed in 212 older individuals (>or=60 years of age) in a cross - sectional study carried out in desert areas of western Rajasthan during 2003. Heights and weights were recorded and a family diet survey (one-day, 24-hour recall) was carried out in 200 households (HHs) from 20 villages. Body Mass Index (BMI) was used to classify nutritional status. The prevalence of Chronic Energy Deficiency (CED = BMI < 18.5) was >or= 40% in desert areas of India, indicating a “very high” public health problem. It was higher among older women (52%) compared with men (42.4%) and higher in those belonging to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes and in HHs of laborers, artisans, landless individuals, marginal farmers, and below poverty line families. CED did not differ (statistically) between the desert and plain areas of Rajasthan. CED prevalence among older adults in desert areas was actually lower (p < 0.001) than that found in their rural and tribal counterparts. Intervention programs initiated by the government may explain this finding. Our findings support the conclusion that regular nutritional monitoring of older adults in desert and drought prone areas is needed and can help appropriately target the need for intervention measures. 3aelderly 3amalnutrition 3aenergy intake 3aat-risk population 3adeserts 3aheight 3aelderly nutrition 3arural areas 3adiet recall 3awomen 3adietary surveys 3aweight 3amen 3anutritional intervention 3aenergy deficiencies 3ahealth status 3atribal peoples 3afood intake 3anutritional status 3anutritional adequacy 3agender differences 3afood and nutrition programs 2aAged 2aBody Heightxphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDesert Climate 2aDiet Surveys 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aPrevalence 2aSex Factors 2aSocial Class 3aIndia 0aIndiaxepidemiology. 0arisk groups1 aMallikarjuna Rao, K.1 aVenkaiah, K.1 aBrahmam, G.N.V.1 aVijayaraghavan, K.0 tJournal of nutrition for the elderly.g2009 , v. 28, no. 1 p.61-71x0163-93667nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/016393608026339873Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd6CTe2009/04/27  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02825naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160072001700177100002200194245016900216300001400385500001500399520127300414650001801687650001401705650001901719650001801738650002801756650002201784650002001806650001601826650001601842650001601858650002201874650003501896650002001931653001601951653001001967653001801977653001801995653002402013700001402037700001302051773006802064852000902132856008302141930003302224945002502257946001302282655001202295IND4418853120221123024623.0090408e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441885312DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-86-1-00612doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In this study one biscuit, two bread, and one durum wheat cultivars were evaluated in two consecutive seasons for reaction to extreme high and low temperatures during grain filling. In both years, the soft biscuit wheat cultivar showed the largest reaction to low temperature stress, where the monomeric proteins were significantly increased and the polymeric proteins significantly decreased. The effect of temperature stress was more pronounced in the second year, with an earlier planting date. The durum wheat reacted to both heat and cold stress in the second year, where the small polymeric proteins were significantly reduced, and the small and large monomeric proteins were increased with stress. The effect of wheat type was much more pronounced than the effect of temperature treatments on the protein fractions. The protein fractions of the tetraploid durum wheat were very different from the hexaploid cultivars, with much less polymeric proteins, and more monomeric proteins. The soft biscuit wheat had significantly less large polymeric proteins and more large monomeric proteins than the bread wheat cultivars for both years. 3aplanting date 3acultivars 3afilling period 3afractionation 3afood processing quality 3aprotein structure 3aair temperature 3adurum wheat 3acold stress 3aheat stress 3aTriticum aestivum 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3aprotein content 0abread wheat 0awheat 0awheat classes 0abiscuit wheat 0aprotein composition1 aElago, O.1 aKoen, E.0 tCereal chemistry.g2009 , v. 86, no. 1 p.61-66x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-86-1-00613Available from publisher's Web site  a20090603b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle03081naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160072001700177072001700194100001900211245012300230300001400353500001500367520126800382650002801650650001501678650002201693650001901715650002301734650001001757650002701767650002701794650002101821650003601842650002001878650001001898650001601908650001301924653002401937653001301961653001501974653002201989653001902011700002202030700002302052700002802075700002802103700002602131700001802157700002502175700002402200773006802224852000902292856008302301930003302384945002502417946001302442655001202455IND4418853020221123024406.0090408e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441885302DNAL7 a10.1094/CCHEM-86-1-00522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Concentrations of trichothecenes, a volatile metabolite trichodiene (TRICH), as well as ergosterol (ERG) and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) (a total microbial biomass indicator), were assessed. Toxin concentrations in spelt grain and husks harvested in 2003 and 2004 were comparable. Average deoxynivalenol concentrations reached 450 and 523 μg/kg in grain and 2,162 and 855 μg/kg in husks, respectively. Spelt grain, in comparison with common wheat grain, contained significantly higher concentrations of P, S, Mg, Zn, and Cu and a lower concentration of Al, whereas the concentrations of Ca, Fe, and Pb were significantly higher in the husks than in the grain of this cereal. A comparison of concentrations of Fusarium spp. metabolites in the grain of spelt and common wheat showed that the total concentration of mycotoxins and TRICH was slightly lower in T. spelta, whereas common wheat grain contained lower concentrations of ERG and ATP. The obtained results indicate that spelt husks contain considerable concentrations of trichothecenes. 3ainterspecific variation 3aergosterol 3achemical elements 3adeoxynivalenol 3afood contamination 3awheat 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3afood composition 3aTriticum aestivum subsp. spelta 3amineral content 3ahulls 3ametabolites 3aFusarium 0aspecies differences 0aelements 0amycotoxins 0aTriticum aestivum 0atrichothecenes1 aKandler, Wolfgang1 aPerkowski, Juliusz1 aBerthiller, F.q(Franz)1 aPreinerstorfer, Beatrix1 aSuchowilska, Elzbieta1 aBusko, Maciej1 aLaskowska, Magdalena1 aKrska, R.q(Rudolf)0 tCereal chemistry.g2009 , v. 86, no. 1 p.52-60x0009-03527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/CCHEM-86-1-00523Available from publisher's Web site  a20090603b20090703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/05/04  aOther US 7aarticle05556naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001900228245008200247300001800329500001500347520315800362650000903520650001803529650001803547650001903565650002003584650002003604650001703624650001403641650002303655650002103678650001303699650001003712650002003722650001303742650001603755650001703771650001003788650002603798650002603824650001003850650002403860650004103884650002603925650001203951650002803963650003303991650002104024650002404045650001304069650001104082650000904093650002004102650002704122650002204149650005204171653001604223653001604239653001704255700001604272700002004288700001804308700001704326700001804343700001404361700001704375700001604392773012104408852000904529856008104538930003304619945002504652946001304677655001204690IND4417703420221122235002.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770342DNAL7 a190982462pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-11212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aDivakala, K.C.10aAmino acid supplementation of hydrolyzed feather meal diets for finisher pigs  ap. 1270-1281.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this study was to determine the possibility of replacing soybean meal (SBM) in finisher pig diets completely with hydrolyzed feather meal (FM). Forty-five gilts and 45 castrated males (57.8 ± 0.8 kg of BW; 3 gilts or 3 castrated males/pen) were randomly assigned to 5 finisher-1 diets with 6 pens per diet. At an average pen BW of 81.0 ± 1.4 kg, pigs were offered finisher-2 diets. Corn-SBM, finisher-1 and finisher-2 positive control (PC) diets were formulated to contain 6.1 and 4.7 g of apparent ileal digestible (AID) Lys/kg, respectively. Corn-FM negative control (NC) diets were formulated to be iso-N to the PC diets. The NC diets were supplemented with Lys and Trp (NRC; NC + Lys and Trp) to alleviate apparent deficiencies based on AID AA in FM reported by the 1998 NRC. In addition, the NC diets were supplemented further with the third limiting AA, Thr (40+3AA; NC + Lys, Trp, and Thr), and fourth and fifth limiting AA, His and Ile (40+5AA; NC + Lys, Trp, Thr, His, and Ile), based on the assumption that the apparent ileal digestibility of all indispensable AA in FM is 40%. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water. At the end of the study (112.1 ± 1.8 kg), blood samples were collected from all pigs before slaughter. As expected, overall ADFI, AID Lys (representing indispensable AA) intake (LysI), ADG, and G:F were greater and BW gain:LysI (G:LysI) was less in pigs fed the PC diet than those fed the NC diet (P < 0.001). Pigs fed the NRC diet grew slower than those fed the PC diet (P = 0.004), and their G:LysI tended to be less than those fed the PC (P = 0.083) or the 40+3AA and 40+5AA diets (P = 0.094). Greater fat-free lean percentage (P = 0.005), fat-free lean gain (LG; P < 0.001), and LG:F (P < 0.001) were observed in pigs fed the PC diet compared with those fed the NC diet, but their LG:F or LG:LysI was similar to those fed the NRC diet. However, LG:F (P = 0.030) and LG:LysI (P = 0.028) were greater in pigs fed the 40+3AA and the 40+5AA diets than those fed the NRC diet. Pigs fed the 40+5AA diet tended to utilize AID Lys more efficiently for LG than those fed the 40+3AA diet (P = 0.068). Subjective meat color (P < 0.001), firmness (P = 0.004), and marbling (P < 0.001) scores were greater in pigs fed the 40+5AA diet than those fed the 40+3AA diet. Diets seemed to have no clear effect on the weight of liver, kidney, and heart or serum urea N and triacylglycerides. Pigs fed the PC diet had more serum albumin and total protein (P < 0.001), but less glucose (P = 0.031) and cholesterol (P < 0.001) than those fed the NC diet. Serum total protein was greater (P = 0.031) in pigs fed the 40+5AA diet than those fed the 40+3AA diet. The results indicated that the corn-FM diets were not as effective as the corn-SBM diet in supporting BW gain of finisher pigs. However, the results seemed to indicate that pigs fed the corn-FM diet supplemented with the necessary AA can utilize feed and AA for BW gain and lean gain as efficiently as those fed the corn-SBM diet. Further research is needed to explore fully the optimal AA supplementation strategy to effectively utilize FM for pig production. 3apork 3aswine feeding 3atissue weight 3alean body mass 3ablood chemistry 3aliveweight gain 3afeather meal 3afinishing 3aad libitum feeding 3afeed supplements 3amarbling 3aileum 3afeed conversion 3afirmness 3afeed intake 3asoybean meal 3aswine 3anutrient availability 3aessential amino acids 3acolor 3acarcass composition 2aAmino Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBlood Chemical Analysis 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aFeathers 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aOrgan Sizexphysiology 2aRandom Allocation 2aSwinexbloodxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 0aamino acids 0abody weight 0ameat quality1 aChiba, L.I.1 aKamalakar, R.B.1 aRodning, S.P.1 aWelles, E.G.1 aCummins, K.A.1 aSwann, J.1 aCespedes, F.1 aPayne, R.L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1270-1281dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-11213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle04045naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177100001700194245009900211300001800310500001500328520188900343650001602232650002302248650000902271650001102280650001902291650001602310650001302326650001702339650001602356650001802372650002102390650001102411650001402422650002202436650001102458650001702469650002502486650003502511650004502546650001202591650002802603650002302631650003802654650002102692650002702713650000902740650003402749650002602783650003802809653002902847653002002876653002002896653001802916700001702934700001502951700001502966700001502981700002102996773012103017852000903138856008103147930003303228945002503261946001303286655001203299IND4417703820221122234840.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770382DNAL7 a190982422pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-11962doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aAmetaj, B.N.10aBackgrounding and finishing diets are associated with inflammatory responses in feedlot steers  ap. 1314-1320.  a2019-12-04  aThe objective of this investigation was to study the effects of feeding backgrounding and finishing diets on selected acute phase proteins in the plasma of feedlot steers. Two groups of 12 steers each, at the backgrounding and finishing stages, were offered either a backgrounding (45% barley grain-based concentrate and 55% barley silage on a DM basis) or a finishing (91% barley grain-based concentrate and 9% barley silage) diet for 12 and 15 wk, respectively. Steers at the backgrounding and finishing stages had initial BW of approximately 250 and 380 kg, respectively, at the beginning of the experiment. Blood samples were obtained from a jugular vein at 3-wk intervals during the experimental period beginning at wk 3 or 0 for the backgrounding and finishing periods, respectively. Plasma samples were analyzed for serum amyloid A (SAA), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), haptoglobin, and α₁-acid glycoprotein. Steers fed the finishing diet showed peak plasma SAA, LBP, and haptoglobin within 3 wk from the initiation of the diet (20, 23, and 1,940 μg/mL for SAA, LBP, and haptoglobin, respectively). Although plasma α₁-acid glycoprotein reached a peak concentration (449 μg/mL) at the beginning of the finishing phase, no diet effect was obtained for this variable. Steers fed the backgrounding diet showed less variation in the concentrations of plasma acute phase proteins measured; plasma haptoglobin reached a peak concentration (1,720 μg/mL) 9 wk after the beginning of this diet. In conclusion, feeding feedlot steers the backgrounding or finishing diet was associated with increased peak concentrations of acute phase proteins in the plasma. More research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms behind the inflammatory responses observed in feedlot steers and their implications for health issues and the production efficiency of feedlot operations. 3afeed grains 3atemporal variation 3adiet 3abarley 3acattle feeding 3abody weight 3afeedlots 3ainflammation 3abeef cattle 3aanimal health 3abinding proteins 3asteers 3afinishing 3afeed concentrates 3asilage 3ahaptoglobins 3aacute phase proteins 2aAcute-Phase Proteinsxanalysis 2aAcute-Phase Reactionxbloodxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aCarrier Proteinsxblood 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseasesxbloodxetiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aHaptoglobinsxanalysis 2aMale 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxblood 2aOrosomucoidxanalysis 2aSerum Amyloid A Proteinxanalysis 0aalpha1-acid glycoprotein 0ablood chemistry 0aserum amyloid A 0aglycoproteins1 aKoenig, K.M.1 aDunn, S.M.1 aYang, W.Z.1 aZebeli, Q.1 aBeauchemin, K.A.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1314-1320dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-11963Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle04855naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100002300211245015400234300001800388500001500406520244400421650001202865650001002877650002502887650001202912650001902924650001802943650002302961650002502984650002503009650001503034650001803049650002303067650001903090650002303109650001603132650001703148650001303165650001203178650002003190650000703210650002203217650001703239650002203256650001203278650004703290650002803337650002103365650003603386650001103422650001703433650004103450650003703491650003103528650002503559650002203584650003703606653001003643653001603653700001803669700002803687700002603715700002603741773012103767852000903888856008103897930003303978945002504011946001304036655001204049IND4417703920221122234914.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770392DNAL7 a190982322pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-12632doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMolina-Alcaide, E.10aEffects of concentrate replacement by feed blocks on ruminal fermentation and microbial growth in goats and single-flow continuous-culture fermenters  ap. 1321-1333.  a2019-12-04  aThe effect of replacing concentrate with 2 different feed blocks (FB) on ruminal fermentation and microbial growth was evaluated in goats and in single-flow continuous-culture fermenters. Diets consisted of alfalfa hay plus concentrate and alfalfa hay plus concentrate with 1 of the 2 studied FB. Three trials were carried out with 6 rumen-fistulated Granadina goats and 3 incubation runs in 6 single-flow continuous-culture fermenters. Experimental treatments were assigned randomly within each run, with 2 repetitions for each diet. At the end of each in vivo trial, the rumen contents were obtained for inoculating the fermenters. For each incubation run, the fermenters were inoculated with ruminal fluid from goats fed the same diet supplied to the corresponding fermenter flask. The average pH values, total and individual VFA, and NH₃-N concentrations, and acetate:propionate ratios in the rumen of goats were not affected (P greater-than-or-equal 0.10) by diet, whereas the microbial N flow (MNF) and efficiency were affected (P [less-than or equal to] 0.001), with the greatest values observed for the diet without FB. In fermenters, the diet affected pH (P < 0.001), propionate concentrations (P = 0.01), acetate:propionate ratio (P = 0.03), carbohydrate digestibility (P greater-than-or-equal 0.05), and total (P = 0.02), NH₃ (P = 0.005), and non-NH₃ (P = 0.02) N flows, whereas the efficiency of VFA production was not affected (P = 0.75). The effect of diet on MNF and efficiency depended on the bacterial pellet used as a reference. An effect (P < 0.05) of diet on the composition of solid- and liquid-associated bacteria was observed. The compositions of liquid-associated bacteria in the fermenter contents and effluent were similar (P = 0.05). Differences (P < 0.001) between in vivo and in vitro values for most fermentation variables and bacterial pellet compositions were found. Partial replacement of the concentrate with FB did not greatly compromise carbohydrate fermentation in unproductive goats. However, this was not the case for MNF and efficiency. Differences between the results obtained in vivo and in vitro indicate a need to identify conditions in fermenters that allow better simulation of fermentation, microbial growth, and bacterial pellet composition in vivo. Reduced feeding cost could be achieved with the inclusion of FB in the diets of unproductive goats without altering rumen fermentation. 3aammonia 3agoats 3adietary carbohydrate 3aalfalfa 3apropionic acid 3adigestibility 3aruminant nutrition 3avolatile fatty acids 3arumen microorganisms 3afermenters 3acost analysis 3arumen fermentation 3aanimal feeding 3amicrobial activity 3aacetic acid 3afood animals 3anitrogen 3adigesta 3aphysical models 3apH 3afeed concentrates 3arumen fluids 2aAmmoniaxanalysis 2aAnimals 2aBacteriaxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aDietxveterinary 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexanalysis 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aGastrointestinal Contentsxchemistry 2aGoatsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRumenxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 0afeeds 0afeed blocks1 aPascual, M.R.1 aCantalapiedra-Hijar, G.1 aMorales-García, E.Y.1 aMartín-García, A.I.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1321-1333dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-12633Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle04321naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001600228245012200244300001800366520229300384650000902677650001402686650001602700650001602716650001502732650001402747650002002761650001302781650002002794650001202814650001402826650001602840650001402856650001202870650003302882650002302915650001102938650002902949650001102978650002602989650002603015650001103041650001403052650004503066650001703111650002203128653001903150700001903169700001603188700001803204700001703222700001803239700001403257700001903271700002703290773012103317852000903438856008103447930003303528945002503561946001303586655001203599IND4417703520141219000000.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770352DNAL7 a190982412pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-10092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMosnier, E.10aFeed intake in the multiparous lactating sow: Its relationship with reactivity during gestation and tryptophan status  ap. 1282-1291.  aVoluntary feed intake in sows after parturition may be related to the capacity of the sow to cope with the numerous changes occurring around farrowing. This experiment was undertaken to investigate whether the feed intake during lactation was related to the reactivity of the sow during gestation and plasma Trp and cortisol concentrations. On d 58 of pregnancy, 37 sows were individually placed in a novel environment, and their behavior was observed during a 5-min open-field test. This test allowed the selection of 12 reactive (R) and 8 nonreactive (NR) sows for the study. Sows were fed 3 kg of a standard gestation diet/d before farrowing and a standard lactation diet ad libitum thereafter. The behavioral reactivity of sows when a human touched their neck in the farrowing crate was evaluated on d 72 of gestation, and their behavior during farrowing was analyzed. Sows were catheterized on d 70 of gestation, and blood samples were taken after an overnight fast on d 37 before farrowing, daily during the week before and the week after parturition, and on d 14 and 21 of lactation for plasma Trp and cortisol determination. The NR sows were less reactive to human contact (P = 0.02), had a shorter farrowing duration (P = 0.02), and tended to have a shorter birth interval between piglets (P = 0.09) than the R sows. Feed intake was greater for the NR sows than for the R sows during wk 1 of lactation (P = 0.02), as well as during the whole lactation (P = 0.03). Plasma cortisol concentration was maximal on the day after farrowing (P = 0.01) and returned to basal concentration within 4 d postpartum. No relationship was observed between sow behavior and plasma concentration of cortisol. For both groups of sows, plasma concentrations of Trp between d 2 and 4 postpartum were less than during gestation (P < 0.05). The NR sows had decreased plasma Trp concentrations compared with the R sows during wk 1 of lactation (P = 0.02). A low reactivity during gestation was associated with behavior of the sow that was favorable to piglet survival during farrowing, increased feed intake, and decreased plasma Trp concentration during wk 1 of lactation. Further research is needed to elucidate whether Trp or Trp metabolites are related to reactivity and ADFI of the reproducing sow. 3asows 3alactation 3afeed intake 3asow feeding 3atryptophan 3afarrowing 3ablood chemistry 3acortisol 3aanimal behavior 3apiglets 3amortality 3ametabolites 3apregnancy 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxphysiology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHandling, Psychological. 2aHumans 2aHydrocortisonexblood 2aLactationxphysiology 2aParity 2aPregnancy 2aSwinexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 2aTryptophanxblood 0abirth interval1 aDourmad, J.-Y.1 aEtienne, M.1 aLe Floc'h, N.1 aPère, M.-C.1 aRamaekers, P.1 aSève, B.1 aMilgen, J. van1 aMeunier-Salaün, M.-C.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1282-1291dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-10093Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle03113naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013800142300001600280520153000296650001001826650003501836650001001871650002001881650001501901650001301916650001501929650001401944650002001958650001201978650003501990650003302025650003402058650002202092650002202114650004002136650006302176650003102239650001002270650004602280653001502326653002302341653002202364700001702386700001802403773009602421852000902517930003302526945001302559946001102572655001202583IND2045164520221122234839.0950321e199408  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204516452DNAL7 a79280682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabel, B.10aImproved bioassay for estimation of inhibitory effects of ovine gastrointestinal mucus and anthelmintics on nematode larval migration  ap. 671-676.  aA bioassay based on the ability of substances present in ovine gastrointestinal mucus or anthelmintics to paralyse third stage larval (L3) nematodes and inhibit their passage through 20 micromoles nylon mesh sieves [larval migration inhibition (LMI) activity] is described. Factors influencing the reproducibility of the bioassay were examined using exsheathed L3 of the sheep gastrointestinal nematode parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Levamisole, morantel tartrate and piperazine were shown to inhibit L3 migration in the bioassay. The bioassay was used to demonstrate that gastrointestinal mucus from nematode-resistant sheep possessed greater L3 inhibitory activity than mucus from nematode-susceptible sheep. LMI activity of mucus used in this bioassay was significantly correlated with LMI activities obtained using two previously described similar bioassays. The action of mucus components on nematode larvae was shown to be reversible in the bioassay. The modified assay has advantages over other bioassays as it avoided the use of temperature-dependent agar blocks, reduced the number of L3 required to a more manageable size, and the whole experiment could be performed on a 48-well culture plate. The reproducibility, high correlation with other bioassays, ease of performance, suitability for testing a large number of samples and low cost make this modified assay the method of choice for determining antiparasitic activity of gastrointestinal mucus components and as a screen for potential anthelmintics. 3asheep 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3amucus 3adigestive tract 3alevamisole 3amorantel 3apiperazine 3abioassays 3anematode larvae 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxtherapeutic use 2aBiological Assayxveterinary 2aIntestinal Mucosaximmunology 2aLarvaximmunology 2aMucusximmunology 2aNematodaxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aNematode Infectionsxdrug therapyximmunologyxveterinary. 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdrug therapyximmunology. 0ainhibition 0aparasite migration 0amorantel tartrate1 aMcGregor, R.1 aDouch, P.G.C.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1994 Aug., v. 24, no. 5 p.671-676x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03030naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245013700147300001600284520144800300650002501748650001301773650001801786650002101804650003101825650002401856650001101880650003801891650001201929650006201941650003402003650001102037650003102048650003602079650005002115650001102165650000902176650002702185650004202212650002402254700001602278700001802294700001902312700001902331773009602350852000902446930003302455945001302488946001102501655001202512IND2045164820221122234938.0950321e199408  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204516482DNAL7 a79280702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraaf, D.B. de10aIdentification and isolation of a 19.7 kDa Ostertagia ostertagi specific antigen and evaluation of its potential for immunodiagnosis  ap. 681-688.  aOstertagia ostertagi adult worm extracts were analysed by Western blotting using sera from calves experimentally infected with O. ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora. Strong differences in antigen recognition were noticed, even between animals from the same group. Two Ostertagia specific antigens with apparent molecular mass of 19.7 (OoA19.7) and 20.7 kDa (OoA20.7) were identified. One of them (OoA19.7) was purified by three subsequent chromatographic steps, i.e. gel-filtration, ion-exchange and reversed phased chromatography. It was demonstrated that this antigen does not show any cross-reactions with heterologous sera from C. oncophora. Dictyocaulus viviparus, Nematodirus helvetianus and Fasciola hepatica-infected animals. It was found that only IgG1 antibodies reacted against OoA19.7. The application of this antigen in an ELISA resulted in a highly species-specific test when compared to crude worm extracts. However, strong individual differences in anti-OoA19.7 response could be noticed between calves which received the same number of O. ostertagi larvae. These individual differences can hinder the application of the ELISA as a diagnostic tool, since the anti-OoA19.7 response does not seem to reflect the level of exposure to L3 larvae. This was supported by the absence of a clear infection dose-related effect. It was shown that the anti-OoA19.7 response started from week 6 to 8, and reached its highest level at week 15. 3aOstertagia ostertagi 3aantigens 3aserodiagnosis 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aantigen-antibody reactions 3anematode infections 3acalves 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Helminthximmunologyxisolation & purification. 2aBlotting, Westernxveterinary 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxdiagnosis 2aChromatography, Gelxveterinary 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxveterinary 2aFemale 2aMale 2aOstertagiaximmunology 2aOstertagiasisxdiagnosisxveterinary. 2aSpecies Specificity1 aBerghen, P.1 aHilderson, H.1 aClaerebout, E.1 aVercruysse, J.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1994 Aug., v. 24, no. 5 p.681-688x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02281naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245009100147300001400238500001500252520072100267650001300988650002101001650002601022650002301048650001401071650001201085650004101097650004001138650002501178650002401203650001101227650003501238650001101273650000901284650000901293650002401302650004101326650003501367650002601402653001801428653001501446700001301461700001701474700001701491700001701508700001501525700001501540773009401555852000901649930003301658945001301691946001101704655001201715IND2207120520221122230441.0001005e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220712052DNAL7 a106757442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNishikawa, Y.10aMonoclonal antibody inhibition of Neospora caninum tachyzoite invasion into host cells  ap. 51-58.  a2019-12-05  aMonoclonal antibodies were produced against Neospora caninum tachyzoites to identify antigens which may play a role during invasion of host cells. Confocal laser microscopy showed that most antigens recognised by the mAb were located on the surface, but one mAb, 1A5, reacted to the apical end of the parasite. Some mAbs, which recognised 70, 42 and 36 kDa parasite proteins, significantly inhibited the invasion of the parasite in vitro. The mAbs which recognised 42 and 36 kDa parasite protein, reacted with Nc-p43 and Nc-p36 expressed by vaccinia virus and Escherichia coli, respectively. These results suggest that a 70 kDa protein, Nc-p43 and Nc-p36 are involved in the invasion of the parasite into host cells. 3aantigens 3aNeospora caninum 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amicrobial proteins 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxpharmacology 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxpharmacology 2aAntibody Specificity 2aAntigens, Protozoan 2aFemale 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aNeosporaximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aProtozoan Proteinsximmunology 2aVirulenceximmunology 0acell invasion 0ainhibition1 aXuan, X.1 aNagasawa, H.1 aIgarashi, I.1 aFujisaki, K.1 aOtsuka, H.1 aMikami, T.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2000 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.51-58x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle04186naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001800211245012500229300001800354500001500372520204700387650001002434650001002444650001402454650001902468650001802487650001202505650002002517650002102537650002002558650001602578650001602594650001302610650002002623650000802643650001602651650001702667650002102684650001202705650001802717650001802735650001902753650001502772650002102787650001202808650002102820650002802841650001102869650000902880650002002889650002202909650003202931650003202963651001002995651001003005653001703015653001703032653001703049700001503066700002603081700001503107773012103122852000903243856008103252930003303333945002503366946001303391655001203404IND4417705120221122230357.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770512DNAL7 a190288452pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-13622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

There were 3 treatments: barrows slaughtered at 130 kg of BW (B), gilts slaughtered at 130 kg of BW (G1), and gilts slaughtered at 134 kg of BW (G2). Growth performance was similar for G1 and G2, and both consumed less feed (P < 0.001) and had less BW gain (P < 0.05) and better G:F (P < 0.01) than B. Also, the B treatment showed thicker backfat (P < 0.001) and covering fat over the gluteus medius (GM) muscle (P < 0.05) than G1 or G2, but no differences in carcass fat were detected between G1 and G2. Loin and ham yields were similar for B and G2, and both were less than those for G1 (P < 0.01). Treatment did not affect the proportion of carcasses with a minimum weight of 84 kg, but the percentage of carcasses with a minimum fat depth over the GM muscle of 18 mm and the percentage of carcasses that fulfill both requirements (as required for the Teruel ham trademark) were less for G1 than for B or G2 (P < 0.001). Meat from B had greater (P < 0.05) intramuscular fat content than meat from G1 with loin from G2 being intermediate. Thawing losses of the loins were greater (P < 0.05) for B than for G2 with loins from G1 being intermediate. Shear force value was greater for meat from G1 than for that from G2 with meat from B being intermediate (P < 0.05). Fat over the GM muscle from the B treatment was more saturated and had decreased PUFA/SFA ratio than that from G1 with fat from G2 being intermediate (P < 0.001). Also, backfat from the B treatment showed decreased (P < 0.01) PUFA proportion than backfat from G1 or G2. We conclude that increasing the slaughter weight of gilts by 4 kg with respect to that of barrows optimized the 2 criteria used for the selection of carcasses destined for the production of Teruel ham. 3asires 3agilts 3athickness 3acarcass weight 3acarcass yield 3abarrows 3askeletal muscle 3aslaughter weight 3aliveweight gain 3aLarge White 3acured meats 3amarbling 3afeed conversion 3aham 3afeed intake 3ashear stress 3aloins (meat cut) 3abackfat 3alipid content 3aanimal growth 3adams (mothers) 3acrossbreds 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aRandom Allocation 2aSubcutaneous Fatxchemistry 2aSwinexgrowth & development 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aoptimization 0aswine breeds 0ameat quality1 aRipoll, G.1 aGarcía-Belenguer, E.1 aAriño, L.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1464-1471dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-13623Available from publisher's Web site  a20110629b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle03796naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175100001300192245007100205300001800276500001500294520237000309650001402679650002002693650002002713650001602733650001502749650001802764650002202782650001902804650001002823650001402833650001502847650002002862650002002882650001602902650000902918650002802927653001202955653001002967700001902977773012102996852000903117856008103126930003303207945002503240946001303265655001203278IND4417705220221122230410.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770522DNAL7 a10.2527/jas.2008-12022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A total of 180 pigs from 24 litters were used in a random design with 4 treatments in a 2 x 2 (social familiarity x initial BW uniformity) factorial arrangement. Pigs were born in group-farrowing rooms where they mingled in large groups of 66 to 80 pigs from 10 d of age. At 8 wk of age (BW = 23 ± 3.1 kg), pigs were allocated to 20 pens of 9 pigs (5 castrated males and 4 females) in a grow-finish room, with 5 pens assigned to each of 4 treatment combinations without consideration of relatedness. Familiar groups consisted of pigs from 1 farrowing room, and unfamiliar groups consisted of 3 pigs from each of 3 different farrowing rooms. Uniform BW groups were formed by using the middle 2 quartiles, and variable BW groups by using the heaviest and lightest quartiles of pigs. Aggression and activity behavior were directly observed by scan or continuous sampling during a period of 4 h on the first 3 d, d 7, and d 14 after grouping. Injury scores were assessed on all pigs immediately before and 48 h after grouping. Body weight gain and apparent feed intake were measured every 2 wk for 14 wk. Aggression in familiar groups was minimal throughout the observation periods. Compared with that in familiar groups, total duration of fighting was greater in unfamiliar groups on d 0 (upon grouping, 48.5 vs. 0.5 ± 10.88 s/pig⁻¹·4 h⁻¹; P < 0.001) and on d 1 (10.8 vs. 0.4 ± 3.24 s/pig⁻¹·4 h⁻¹; P < 0.05) after grouping. Unfamiliar pigs had greater injury scores (6.6 vs. 1.8 ± 0.28; P < 0.001) and spent less time eating on d 0 (5.1 vs. 8.8 ± 0.92% of total observation time; P < 0.01) after grouping compared with familiar pigs. The ADG and ADFI were decreased in unfamiliar groups during the initial 6 wk, but not for the entire 14-wk period in comparison with familiar groups. Body weight variation did not affect behavior and performance in familiar groups but increased aggression-induced injuries in unfamiliar groups. The results indicated that grouping unacquainted pigs derived from large groups induced overt aggression, associated injuries and initial reduction in performance, which causes welfare concerns on mixing pigs born to group-housed lactating sows. 3afarrowing 3aanimal behavior 3aanimal injuries 3abody weight 3aaggression 3aswine housing 3aphysical activity 3aanimal welfare 3amales 3alactation 3acastration 3aliveweight gain 3asocial behavior 3afeed intake 3asows 3alitters (young animals) 0afemales 0aswine1 aJohnston, L.J.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1472-1478dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-12023Available from publisher's Web site  a20110701b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle04485naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100001500211245011500226300001800341500001500359520249100374650002102865650002002886650002402906650001402930650001402944650001602958650001402974650002002988650001903008650001703027650001003044650002403054650001503078650005803093650003003151650001203181650003303193650002803226650000903254650006003263650002403323650003103347650003203378653000903410653001903419653001003438653001303448700001203461700002603473700001303499700001703512773012103529852000903650856008103659930003303740945002503773946001303798655001203811IND4417705020221122230427.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770502DNAL7 a190982492pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-12852doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRipoll, G.10aEstimation of light lamb carcass composition by in vivo real-time ultrasonography at four anatomical locations  ap. 1455-1463.  a2019-12-04  aThe objectives of this study were to study the relationship between in vivo ultrasound measurements and cold carcass measurements at 4 anatomical points of the backbone, and to establish regression equations to estimate carcass composition within the cold carcass weight range for Ternasco lambs (8 to 12.5 kg) by using ultrasonic measurements taken at a single location. Measurements of subcutaneous fat and skin thickness and of muscle depth and width were taken over the 10th to 11th and 12th to 13th thoracic vertebrae and the 1st to 2nd and 3rd to 4th lumbar vertebrae. These measurements were taken at 2 and 4 cm from the nearest end of the LM to the backbone and at 1/3 of the LM width with the probe perpendicular to and parallel to the backbone. The left sides of the carcasses were dissected into muscle, fat, and bone. Body weight (22.6 kg) and cold carcass weight (10.8 kg) were representative of Ternasco light lambs. Muscle depth measured at 2 cm, 4 cm, and 1/3 of LM width remained regular, with slight ups and downs along the spine. All the pairs of in vivo ultrasound and cold carcass measurements were significantly different (P < 0.05) and had small correlations. All the ultrasound measurements of muscle depth at any location or at any distance to the backbone were less than their equivalent cold carcass measurements, with differences ranging from 0.8 to 5.9 mm. Differences between ultrasound fat thickness + interface (US_FDGI) and cold carcass fat thickness were less than differences between ultrasound fat thickness and cold carcass fat thickness, ranging from -0.9 to -1.0 mm for the former and from -2.1 to -0.5 mm for the latter. The small differences in absolute values between US_FDGI and cold carcass fat thickness suggest that US_FDGI is the best measure of the real fatness level of the lambs. The best prediction equations for muscle, bone, and fat were developed with in vivo ultrasound data measured at the 1st to 2nd lumbar vertebrae perpendicularly to the backbone, but they had limited predictive value. To predict the muscle content of carcass, BW and muscle depth were included, and they explained 59% of variation. Fifty-one percent of total fat was predicted by BW and fat thickness, whereas only 17% of the variation in bone was predicted by 2 fat-related variables. The BW of lambs was an important predictor to improve regression equations but ultrasound measurements were the most important variables when a narrow range of BW was used. 3asubcutaneous fat 3aultrasonography 3amathematical models 3athickness 3avertebrae 3abody weight 3aequations 3askeletal muscle 3acarcass weight 3alumbar spine 3alambs 3acarcass composition 3aprediction 2aAdipose Tissuexanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aAnimal Husbandryxmethods 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Weightxphysiology 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxanatomy & histologyxultrasonography. 2aRegression Analysis 2aSheepxanatomy & histology 2aUltrasonographyxveterinary 0askin 0aanimal anatomy 0abones 0abody fat1 aJoy, M.1 aAlvarez-Rodriguez, J.1 aSanz, A.1 aTeixeira, A.0 tJournal of animal science.g2009 Apr., v. 87, no. 4 p.1455-1463dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-12853Available from publisher's Web site  a20110629b20110701c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/25  aOther US 7aarticle04438naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194100002000211245013400231300001800365500001500383520227000398650002202668650002802690650001402718650001902732650001402751650002002765650001502785650002202800650000902822650002002831650002702851650002002878650002202898650002302920650001202943650002002955650003702975650001603012650004703028650001203075650003303087650007903120650002103199650003303220650000903253650003903262653002503301653002103326653003303347700001903380700002003399700001903419700002003438773012103458852000903579856008103588930003303669945002503702946001303727655001203740IND4417705720221122212100.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441770572DNAL7 a189970832pmid7 a10.2527/jas.2008-13522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Individual DMI and feeding behavior traits were measured in Angus bulls (n = 341; initial BW = 371.1 ± 50.8 kg) fed a corn silage-based diet (ME = 2.77 Mcal/kg of DM) for 84 d in trials 1 and 2 and for 70 d in trials 3 and 4 by using a GrowSafe feeding system. Meal duration (min/d) and meal frequency (events/d) were calculated for each bull from feeding behavior recorded by the GrowSafe system. Ultrasound measures of carcass 12th-rib fat thickness (BF) and LM area (LMA) were obtained at the start and end of each trial. Residual feed intake (RFIp) was computed from the linear regression of DMI on ADG and midtest BW⁰.⁷⁵ (metabolic BW, MBW), with trial, trial by ADG, and trial by midtest BW⁰.⁷⁵ as random effects (base model). Overall ADG, DMI, and RFIp were 1.44 (SD = 0.29), 9.46 (SD = 1.31), and 0.00 (SD = 0.78) kg/d, respectively. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that inclusion of BW gain in BF and LMA in the base model increased R² (0.76 vs. 0.78) and accounted for 9% of the variation in DMI not explained by MBW and ADG (RFIp). Residual feed intake and carcass-adjusted residual feed intake (RFIc) were moderately correlated with DMI (0.60 and 0.55, respectively) and feed conversion ratio (FCR; 0.49 and 0.45, respectively), and strongly correlated with partial efficiency of growth (PEG; -0.84 and -0.78, respectively), but not with ADG or MBW. Gain in BF was weakly correlated with RFIp (0.30), FCR (-0.15), and PEG (-0.11), but not with RFIc. Gain in LMA was weakly correlated with RFIp (0.17) and FCR (-0.19), but not with PEG or RFIc. The Spearman rank correlation between RFIp and RFIc was high (0.91). Meal duration (0.41), head-down duration (0.38), and meal frequency (0.26) were correlated with RFIp and accounted for 35% of the variation in DMI not explained by MBW, ADG, and ultrasound traits (RFIc). These results suggest that adjusting residual feed intake for carcass composition will facilitate selection to reduce feed intake in cattle without affecting rate or composition of gain. 3asimulation models 3acarcass characteristics 3aphenotype 3acattle feeding 3athickness 3afeed conversion 3abeef bulls 3afeeding frequency 3aarea 3askeletal muscle 3aphenotypic correlation 3aliveweight gain 3adry matter intake 3aselection criteria 3abackfat 3aultrasonography 2aAdipose Tissuexultrasonography. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aCattlexanatomy & histologyxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aFeeding Behaviorxphysiology 2aMale 2aMuscle, Skeletalxultrasonography. 0aresidual feed intake 0afeeding behavior 0apartial efficiency of growth1 aCarstens, G.E.1 aRibeiro, F.R.B.1 aTedeschi, L.O.1 aCrews, D.H.

A non-CE (NCE) E. coli strain (ATCC 25922) was included as a control. Anaerobic fermentations (50 mL) were set up in serum bottles with a 2:1 mineral buffer to microbial inoculum ratio and with or without gluconic acid, a component of intestinal mucus, which has been shown to be stimulatory to the growth of E. coli O157 in vitro. A five-strain mixture of E. coli O157 made resistant to nalidixic acid (50 μg/mL; Nal(R)) was added to each fermentation, and concentrations of Nal(R) E. coli O157 were determined after 0, 6, 12, and 24h of fermentation. In ruminal microbial fermentation, the CE treatment had a lower (0.6 log; p<0.01) concentration of Nal(R) E. coli O157 than the NCE control at 24 h, regardless of gluconic acid inclusion. In fecal microbial fermentation, the CE treatment did not affect Nal(R) E. coli O157 concentrations in fermentations without gluconic acid; but with gluconic acid inclusion, Nal(R) E. coli O157 concentrations were lower in the CE treatment than in NCE controls at 12h (1.7 log CFU/mL lower) and 24 h (1.9 log CFU/mL lower). In vitro fermentation with ruminal or fecal microbial inoculum could be a simple and inexpensive initial approach to assess efficacy of CE cultures for reducing E. coli O157. 3afeed grains 3aintestinal microorganisms 3acompetitive exclusion 3agluconic acid 3afeedlots 3aEscherichia coli O157 3acoculture 3abeef cattle 3acorn 3aculture media 3afeces 3asteers 3afood pathogens 3arumen fermentation 3ainvasive species 3abatch fermentation 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aCoculture Techniquesxmethods 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDisease Reservoirsxmicrobiologyxveterinary. 2aEscherichia colixgrowth & development 2aEscherichia coli O157xgrowth & development 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFermentation 2aFood Contaminationxprevention & control 2aGluconatesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aRumenxmicrobiology 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aanaerobiosis 0aEscherichia coli1 aDrouillard, James S.1 aNagaraja, T.G.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2009 Mar., v. 6, no. 2 p.193-199x1535-31417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2008.01703Available from publisher's Web site  a20090408b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/04/08  aOther US 7aarticle03858naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141100001300158245016100171300001600332500001500348520208000363650002802443650002802471650002302499650002602522650002302548650002302571650002402594650002502618650001902643650002202662650001902684650001002703650001602713650002602729650001202755650002802767650001402795650001602809650002502825653002502850653002702875653002802902653002502930653002502955700001502980700001802995773010603013852000903119856008103128930003303209945002503242946001303267655001203280IND4417879520221122212024.0090318e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441787952DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2008.01772doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aLin, Jun10aSystematic Identification of Genetic Loci Required for Polymyxin Resistance in Campylobacter jejuni Using an Efficient In Vivo Transposon Mutagenesis System  ap. 173-185.  a2019-12-04  aThe aim of this study was to identify genetic loci required for polymyxin (PM) resistance in Campylobacter jejuni using an efficient in vivo random mutagenesis system. PM has been widely used as a model peptide to examine mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), the major effectors of host innate immunity and also candidates for a new generation of antibiotics. In this study, a commercially available transposon mutagenesis approach (EZ-Tn5 <KAN-2> Transposome; Epicentre, Madison, WI) was evaluated and used to systematically identify Campylobacter mutants with increased susceptibility to PM. This simple, yet efficient, transposon mutagenesis approach identified 12 mutants representing seven different genes of C. jejuni 81-176 involved in acquired PM resistance. Backcrossing of the transposon mutations into the parent strain confirmed that the PM-sensitive phenotype in each mutant was linked to the gene with a specific transposon insertion. The genes are identified as being involved in the synthesis of cell-surface carbohydrates, modification of intracellular targets, signal transduction, and modulation of transmembrane potential. The mutant with the highest susceptibility to PM contains a transposon insertion in a putative galU gene that is essential for production of uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP)-glucose, a precursor required for lipooligosaccharide (LOS) synthesis. LOS analysis by tricine SDS-PAGE showed significant truncation of the LOS core structure in the galU mutant. Susceptibility assays also indicated that GalU contributed C. jejuni resistance to some natural AMPs. Complementation of the galU mutant in trans fully restored LOS synthesis and resistance to the levels of the parent strain. Together, these results define seven C. jejuni genetic loci that will be useful for characterizing the molecular basis of Campylobacter resistance to PM and natural AMPs, and also highlight the usefulness of the in vivo mutagenesis approach for systematic characterization of functionally important Campylobacter genes. 3abacterial contamination 3ainsertional mutagenesis 3agenetic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance 3amembrane potential 3amicrobial genetics 3asignal transduction 3alipooligosaccharides 3agene targeting 3afoodborne illness 3afood pathogens 3agenes 3apolymyxin B 3aresistance mechanisms 3amutants 3agenetic complementation 3avirulence 3atransposons 3aCampylobacter jejuni 0afoodborne infections 0atransposon mutagenesis 0amolecular sequence data 0abacterial resistance 0anucleotide sequences1 aWang, Ying1 aHoang, Ky Van0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2009 Mar., v. 6, no. 2 p.173-185wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2008.01773Available from publisher's Web site  a20090404b20090508c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/04/02  aOther US 7aarticle01977naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162100002100179245006900200300001600269520064600285650001000931650002200941650001700963650001200980650002000992650001701012650001601029650002301045650001701068650000901085650002501094650002301119650002001142653002301162653001801185700001701203700001801220773010401238852000901342856008501351930003301436945002501469946001301494655001201507IND4417887420221122212013.0090319e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441788742DNAL7 a10.1080/104083908020644042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBakkalbasi, Emre10aFood Ellagitannins-Occurrence, Effects of Processing and Storage  ap. 283-298.  aInterest in ellagitannins and ellagic acid has increased over the past few years due to its properties as a micronutrient. Ellagitannins are complex plant polyphenols composed of hexahydroxydiphenoyl moieties esterified to a sugar. Fruits (especially berries and nuts) are rich sources of ellagitannins and ellagic acid, a hydrolytic product of ellagitannins. These secondary metabolites give the characteristic taste to the fruits and their products, and also play an important role in food processing. This paper reviews research about occurrence in foods, change during process, and antioxidant activity of ellagitannins and ellagic acid. 3afoods 3afruit composition 3aellagic acid 3atannins 3afood processing 3afood storage 3apolyphenols 3achemical structure 3asmall fruits 3anuts 3aantioxidant activity 3atemporal variation 3anutritive value 0aliterature reviews 0aellagitannins1 aMentes, Ozay1 aArtik, Nevzat0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2009 Mar., v. 49, no. 3 p.283-298x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083908020644043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle03713naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072001700164072001700181100002400198245009500222300001600317500001500333520142700348650001201775650001601787650002301803650002001826650002301846650001101869650001701880650001501897650002201912650001101934650002101945650001101966650001101977650001701988650001902005650002202024650001002046650000902056650002202065650001002087650001202097650001702109650000902126650002402135650001102159650001102170650001002181650006702191650006202258650000902320650001602329650003502345650001702380650002402397650007302421650001602494653002502510653002302535653003702558653002102595700001702616700001702633773010402650852000902754856008502763930003302848945002502881946001302906655001202919IND4417888120221122212111.0090319e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441788812DNAL7 a192349432pmid7 a10.1080/104083908020669792doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aCarpentier, Shannon10aAssociations between Lutein, Zeaxanthin, and Age-Related Macular Degeneration: An Overview  ap. 313-326.  a2019-12-04  aAge-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, is a degenerative condition of the macula characterized by death or dysfunction of the photoreceptors. With the aging population growing, the incidence of age-related macular degeneration is expected to increase. This raises concern about the future of visual dysfunction related falls and the resulting injuries in the elderly population. Lutein and zeaxanthin are macular pigments that may play a role in reducing the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration. Evidence is accumulating on the consumption of lutein and zeaxanthin (in whole food or supplemental form), the resulting concentrations in the serum, and tissue distribution throughout the body, particularly in the retina. Lutein and zeaxanthin intake increases serum concentrations which in turn increases macular pigment density. Existing literature focuses on factors affecting macular pigment density, functions of lutein and zeaxanthin as blue-light filters and antioxidants, and risk factors associated with age-related macular degeneration. Few studies have focused on the impact of dietary lutein and zeaxanthin on retinal function and the potential to preserve vision and prevent further degeneration. This presents an opportunity for further research to determine an effective dose that delays the progression of age-related macular degeneration. 3aelderly 3afood intake 3anutritional status 3ablood chemistry 3adisease prevention 3adosage 3ahuman health 3azeaxanthin 3aelderly nutrition 3alutein 3avision disorders 3aretina 3avision 3adiet therapy 3aphotoreceptors 3aprotective effect 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidants 2aDiet 2aDietary Supplements 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLight 2aLuteinxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxphysiology. 2aMacular Degenerationxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRetinaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRisk Factors 2aTissue Distribution 2aXanthophyllsxadministration & dosagexpharmacokineticsxphysiology. 2aZeaxanthins 0abioactive properties 0aliterature reviews 0aage-related macular degeneration 0amacular pigments1 aKnaus, Maria1 aSuh, Miyoung0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2009 Apr., v. 49, no. 4 p.313-326x1040-83987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/104083908020669793Available from publisher's Web site  a20090506b20090608c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle03773naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166072001700184100002000201245007900221300001800300506007600318520157400394506003701968650001402005650001502019650002202034650001302056650002302069650001002092650001602102650001002118650001402128650002002142650004202162650001902204650004602223650001702269650006302286650001802349650001102367650002202378650002202400650001902422650001102441650001402452650001602466650001102482650003202493650002402525650003202549650001702581653002402598653002502622700001902647700002402666700002102690700002102711700001702732773013902749852000902888856008302897930003302980945002503013946001303038655001203051IND4417994320221207132342.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441799432DNAL7 a192118212pmid7 aPMC26674542pmcid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.271402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

OBJECTIVE: We prospectively examined the association between consumption of SSBs and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women. DESIGN: Women (n = 88,520) from the Nurses' Health Study aged 34-59 y, without previously diagnosed coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, or diabetes in 1980, were followed from 1980 to 2004. Consumption of SSBs was derived from 7 repeated food-frequency questionnaires administered between 1980 and 2002. Relative risks (RRs) for CHD were calculated by using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known cardiovascular disease risk factors. RESULTS: During 24 y of follow-up, we ascertained 3105 incident cases of CHD (nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD). After standard and dietary risk factors were adjusted for, the RRs (and 95% CIs) of CHD according to categories of cumulative average of SSB consumption (<1/mo, 1-4/mo, 2-6/wk, 1/d, and greater-than-or-equal2 servings/d) were 1.0, 0.96 (0.87, 1.06), 1.04 (0.95, 1.14), 1.23 (1.06, 1.43), and 1.35 (1.07, 1.69) (P for trend < 0.001). Additional adjustment for body mass index, energy intake, and incident diabetes attenuated the associations, but they remained significant. Artificially sweetened beverages were not associated with CHD. CONCLUSION: Regular consumption of SSBs is associated with a higher risk of CHD in women, even after other unhealthful lifestyle or dietary factors are accounted for.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abeverages 3asweeteners 3aphysical activity 3abody fat 3aenergy expenditure 3awomen 3afood intake 2aAdult 2aBeverages 2aBody Mass Index 2aCarbonated Beveragesxadverse effects 2aCohort Studies 2aCoronary Diseasexepidemiologyxetiology. 2aDiet Surveys 2aDietary Sucrosexadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aFeeding Behavior. 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aMiddle Aged 2aNurses 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aProspective Studies 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aRisk Factors 0asweetened beverages 0aNurses' Health Study1 aMalik, Vasanti1 aRexrode, Kathryn M.1 aManson, JoAnn E.1 aWillett, Walter.1 aHu, Frank B.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1037-1042dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.271403Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/26  aOther US 7aarticle03426naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100002200179245013000201300001800331520151400349650001501863650002201878650001301900650002301913650002301936650002001959650001601979650002701995650003102022650003302053650002702086650002102113650002802134650003002162650003402192650002502226650001102251650001102262650002102273650001502294650000902309650002202318650003302340650003202373650001502405650001702420700002202437700002002459700003102479773013902510852000902649856008302658930003302741945002502774946001302799655001202812IND4417994220221122191123.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441799422DNAL7 a192443742pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.267462doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aJackson, Diane M.10aIncreased television viewing is associated with elevated body fatness but not with lower total energy expenditure in children  ap. 1031-1036.  aBACKGROUND: Television (TV) viewing in children is associated with a higher body mass index, but it is unknown whether this reflects body fatness, and, if it does, why. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate whether TV viewing is associated with body fatness, physical activity, and total energy expenditure in preschool children. DESIGN: Eighty-nine children were recruited into a cross-sectional study. Total daily energy expenditure (TEE) was measured by doubly labeled water, body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and physical activity by accelerometry. RESULTS: There was a significant positive association between fat mass (corrected for fat-free body mass) and TV viewing (F = 9.05, P = 0.004). Each extra hour of watching TV was associated with an extra 1 kg of body fat. Children who watched more TV were also significantly less physically active (F = 5.16, P = 0.026). Independent of body composition and sex, children with greater physical activity levels had higher TEE (F = 5.15, P = 0.029); however, physical activity did not mediate the relation between TV viewing and adiposity (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Preschool children who watch more TV are fatter and are less active, and activity influences TEE. However, despite TV viewing being linked to lower physical activity, the relation between TV viewing and fatness is not mediated by physical activity. The results suggest that a relation between TV viewing and fatness is more likely to be due to an effect on food intake. 3atelevision 3aphysical activity 3abody fat 3aenergy expenditure 3apreschool children 3achild nutrition 3afood intake 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Waterxmetabolism 2aChild, Preschool 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEnergy Intakexphysiology 2aEnergy Metabolismxphysiology 2aExercisexphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIsotope Labeling 2aLife Style 2aMale 2aObesityxetiology 2aPhysical Fitnessxphysiology 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aTelevision 2aTime Factors1 aDjafarian, Kurosh1 aStewart, Joanne1 aSpeakman, J.

  1 aWagstaff, David A.12aA preliminary study of active compared with passive imputation of missing body mass index values among non-Hispanic white youths  ap. 1025-1030.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Addressing missing data on body weight, height, or both is a challenge many researchers face. In calculating the body mass index (BMI) of study participants, researchers need to impute the missing data. OBJECTIVE: A multiple imputation through a chained equations approach was used to determine whether one should first impute the missing anthropometric data and then calculate BMI or use an imputation model to obtain BMI. DESIGN: The present study used computer simulation to address the question of how to calculate BMI when there is missing data on weight and height. The simulated data reflected data gathered on non-Hispanic white youths (n = 905) aged 2-18 y, who participated in the 1999-2000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). RESULTS: The simulation indicated that it made little difference in the accuracy with which the youths' mean BMIs were estimated when the data were missing completely at random. However, the use of a model to impute BMI was favored slightly when the data were missing at random and the imputation model included the variable used to determine missingness. CONCLUSION: The present findings extend the use of passive imputation and the use of multiple imputation through a chained equations approach to an area of critical public health importance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abody mass index 3aWhites 3aadolescents 3aadolescent nutrition 3adata analysis 3acomputer analysis 3asimulation models 3aequations 2aAdolescent 2aBody Mass Index 2aChild 2aChild, Preschool 2aComputer Simulation 2aData Collectionxmethodsxstandards. 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aWhite Peoplexstatistics & numerical data. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aOutcome Assessment, Health Carexstatistics & numerical data. 2aPublic Health 2aReproducibility of Results 2aResearch Design 0aimputation1 aKranz, Sibylle1 aHarel, Ofer0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1025-1030dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.269953Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/26  aOther US 7aarticle03953naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162100002100179245007400200300001800274520182100292650002602113650001602139650001502155650002202170650002302192650001602215650001202231650001102243650001002254650001802264650001502282650002202297650001102319650001502330650001002345650003202355650002302387650005702410650007002467650002402537650002202561650004502583650001102628650001102639650002202650650003302672650000902705650001602714650002702730650004102757650005802798650001602856700002002872700002102892700002102913700001902934773013902953852000903092856008303101930003303184945002503217946001303242655001203255IND4417994020221122191138.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441799402DNAL7 a192251182pmid7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.273352doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aMaljaars, Jeroen10aEffect of fat saturation on satiety, hormone release, and food intake  ap. 1019-1024.  aBACKGROUND: Ileal delivery of fat reduces hunger and food intake through activation of the ileal brake. Physicochemical properties of fat have been shown to affect satiety and food intake. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the effect of ileal fat emulsions with differing degrees of fatty acid saturation on satiety, food intake, and gut peptides (cholecystokinin and peptide YY). We hypothesized that long-chain triacylglycerols with diunsaturated fatty acids would increase satiety and reduce energy intake compared with long-chain triacylglycerols with monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. DESIGN: We performed a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in which 15 healthy subjects [mean age: 24 y; mean body mass index (in kg/m²): 22] were intubated with a naso-ileal catheter and participated in 4 experiments performed in random order on 4 consecutive days. After consumption of a liquid meal, subjects received a fat or control infusion in the ileum. Fat emulsions consisted of 6 g of 18:0 (shea oil; mainly 18:0), 18:1 (canola oil; mainly 18:1), or 18:2 (safflower oil; mainly 18:2) oils. Food intake was measured during an ad libitum lunch. Satiety questionnaires (visual analog scale) and blood samples were collected at regular intervals. RESULTS: Compared with the control, only 18:2 and 18:1 significantly increased fullness and reduced hunger. No effect on food intake was observed. 18:1 and 18:2 increased cholecystokinin secretion significantly compared with the control. Fatty acid saturation did not affect peptide YY secretion. CONCLUSIONS: When infused into the ileum, triacylglycerols with unsaturated fatty acids increase satiety, whereas triacylglycerols with saturated fatty acids does not. This trial was registered with the Dutch Trial Register as ISRCTN51742545. 3asaturated fatty acids 3adietary fat 3afat intake 3ahormone secretion 3ahormone metabolism 3afood intake 3asatiety 3aadults 3aileum 3aenergy intake 3atest meals 3ametabolic studies 3ahunger 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCholecystokininxsecretion. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aDrug Interactions 2aEnergy Intakexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIleumxmetabolism 2aIntubation, Gastrointestinal 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPeptide YYxsecretion. 2aSatiationxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aTriglyceridesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aYoung Adult1 aRomeyn, Emma A.1 aHaddeman, Edward1 aPeters, Harry PF1 aMasclee, Ad AM0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1019-1024dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.273353Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/26  aOther US 7aarticle03547naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184072001700201072001700218100002600235245017000261300001800431506007600449520170000525506003702225650002902262650002002291650001802311650002602329650001802355650002202373650001302395650002002408650002302428650002502451650002002476650002002496650001902516653002202535700002102557700002202578700001902600700002302619700001802642700001902660773013902679852000902818856008302827930003302910945002502943946001302968655001202981IND4417994720221207132322.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441799472DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.272802doi7 aPMC26674572pmcid7 a192443692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aVan Calcar, Sandra C.10aImproved nutritional management of phenylketonuria by using a diet containing glycomacropeptide compared with amino acids [Erratum: 2010 Apr., v. 91, no. 4, p. 1072]  ap. 1068-1077.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) requires a lifelong low-phenylalanine diet that provides the majority of protein from a phenylalanine-free amino acid (AA) formula. Glycomacropeptide (GMP), an intact protein formed during cheese production, contains minimal phenylalanine. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of substituting GMP food products for the AA formula on acceptability, safety, plasma AA concentrations, and measures of protein utilization in subjects with PKU. DESIGN: Eleven subjects participated in an inpatient metabolic study with two 4-d treatments: a current AA diet (AA diet) followed by a diet that replaced the AA formula with GMP (GMP diet) supplemented with limiting AAs. Plasma concentrations of AAs, blood chemistries, and insulin were measured and compared in AA (day 4) and GMP diets (day 8). RESULTS: The GMP diet was preferred to the AA diet in 10 of 11 subjects with PKU, and there were no adverse reactions to GMP. There was no significant difference in phenylalanine concentration in postprandial plasma with the GMP diet compared with the AA diet. When comparing fasting with postprandial plasma, plasma phenalyalanine concentration increased significantly with the AA but not with the GMP diet. Blood urea nitrogen was significantly lower, which suggests decreased ureagenesis, and plasma insulin was higher with the GMP diet than with the AA diet. CONCLUSIONS: GMP, when supplemented with limiting AAs, is a safe and highly acceptable alternative to synthetic AAs as the primary protein source in the nutritional management of PKU. As an intact protein source, GMP improves protein retention and phenylalanine utilization compared with AAs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3anutritional intervention 3aphenylketonuria 3aspecial diets 3aamino acid metabolism 3aphenylalanine 3ametabolic studies 3apatients 3ablood chemistry 3apostprandial state 3anutrition physiology 3aprotein sources 3adietary protein 3aprotein intake 0aglycomacropeptide1 aMacLeod, Erin L.1 aGleason, Sally T.1 aEtzel, Mark R.1 aClayton, Murray K.1 aWolff, Jon A.1 aNey, Denise M.0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1068-1077dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.272803Available from publisher's Web site  a20100720b20100807c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle02775naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125072001700143072001700160100002200177245011100199300001800310520141300328650002101741650003501762650001501797650002001812650002301832650002501855650001901880650001101899650003601910650001301946651001801959700002301977700002202000700001702022773013902039852000902178856008302187930003302270945002502303946001302328655001202341IND4417997120221122191100.0090320e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441799712DNAL7 a10.3945/ajcn.2008.272822doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aRobitaille, Julie10aDoes the MTHFR 677C to T variant affect the Recommended Dietary Allowance for folate in the US population?  ap. 1269-1273.  aBACKGROUND: The MTHFR 677CtoT variant is associated with reduced enzyme activity, abnormalities of folate metabolism, and potential increase in folate requirement. The effect of this variant on the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folate is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the MTHFR 677CtoT polymorphism on the current folate RDA for US adults aged greater-than-or-equal19 y (400 μg/d) by race and ethnicity. DESIGN: We calculated the projected RDA for folate for each racial and ethnic group according to the methods of the Institute of Medicine. We modeled the projected RDA with different hypothetical effect sizes ranging from 5% to 50%. The RDA value was then weighted according to the US prevalence of the TT (or the combined CT/TT) genotype in each racial and ethnic group. RESULTS: The projected RDA ranges were based on TT genotype frequencies and on different effect sizes (5-50%) that ranged from 400 to 421 μg/d for non-Hispanic whites, 401-436 μg/d for Mexican Americans, and 400-402 μg/d for non-Hispanic blacks. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the current RDA for folate differs little for non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans irrespective of the MTHFR TT genotype, and, from a population perspective, the MTHFR 677CtoT variant does not warrant modifications to the current RDA for dietary folate at this time. 3agenetic variance 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3afolic acid 3aenzyme activity 3avitamin metabolism 3agenetic polymorphism 3ahuman genetics 3aadults 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3agenotype 3aUnited States1 aHamner, Heather C.1 aCogswell, Mary E.1 aYang, Quanhe0 tAmerican journal of clinical nutrition.g2009 Apr., v. 89, no. 4 p.1269-1273dAmerican Society for Clinical Nutritionx0002-91657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2008.272823Available from publisher's Web site  a20090520b20090608c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle03224naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245011100203300001800314500002400332506007600356520186200432506003702294650002702331650001302358650001302371650001402384650001402398650001702412650001502429650001202444650001302456650001402469650001302483700002702496700002002523700002202543773013602565852000902701856008002710655001202790IND4458357520221207121823.0110526e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445835752DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02656-102doi7 aPMC31275972pmcid7 a214987622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTran, Victoria B.10aDynamics of Flagellum- and Pilus-Mediated Association of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Contact Lens Surfaces  ap. 3644-3652.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlagella and pili are appendages that modulate attachment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to solid surfaces. However, previous studies have mostly reported absolute attachment. Neither the dynamic roles of these appendages in surface association nor those of attachment phenotypes have been quantified. We used video microscopy to address this issue. Unworn, sterile, soft contact lenses were placed in a laminar-flow optical chamber. Initial lens association kinetics for P. aeruginosa strain PAK were assessed in addition to lens-surface association phenotypes. Comparisons were made to strains with mutations in flagellin (fliC) or pilin (pilA) or those in flagellum (motAB) or pilus (pilU) function. PAK and its mutants associated with the contact lens surface at a constant rate according to first-order kinetics. Nonswimming mutants associated ~30 to 40 times slower than the wild type. PAK and its pilA mutant associated at similar rates, but each ~4 times faster than the pilU mutant. Lens attachment by wild-type PAK induced multiple phenotypes (static, lateral, and rotational surface movement), each showing only minor detachment. Flagellin (fliC) and flagellar-motility (motAB) mutants did not exhibit surface rotation. Conversely, strains with mutations in pilin (pilA) and pilus retraction (pilU) lacked lateral-surface movement but displayed enhanced surface rotation. Slower surface association of swimming-incapable P. aeruginosa mutants was ascribed to lower convective-diffusion-arrival rates, not to an inability to adhere. Flagellum function (swimming) enhanced lens association, attachment, and rotation; hyperpiliation hindered lens association. P. aeruginosa bound through three different adhesion sites: flagellum, pili, and body. Reduction of bacterial attachment to contact lenses thus requires blockage of multiple adhesion phenotypes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aadhesion 3afimbriae 3aflagellin 3aflagellum 3alaminar flow 3amicroscopy 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3aswimming1 aFleiszig, Suzanne M.J.1 aEvans, David J.1 aRadke, Clayton J.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2011 June 1, v. 77, no. 11 p.3644-3652dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02656-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03719naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245008600185300001600271500002400287520157200311650002701883650002001910650001301930650002801943650001601971650001701987650001002004650001002014650001502024650001402039650001602053650002102069650000802090650001402098650001302112650002502125650003002150650001802180650004402198650001302242650002102255650003702276650001102313650001202324650002002336650002502356650004402381650001402425650005502439650006702494650005402561650004202615651001102657651001102668651001802679651002602697700001502723700001502738700001502753700001402768700001602782700001502798773010802813852000902921856005502930655001202985IND4459158420221122145306.0110617e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445915842DNAL7 a216759962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2761.2011.01266.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, L.10aKoi herpesvirus epizootic in cultured carp and koi, Cyprinus carpio L., in Taiwan  ap. 547-554.  aIncludes references  aKoi herpesvirus (KHV) poses a significant threat to cultured koi and common carp, both Cyprinus carpio L. Since the first reported case in Israel in 1998, KHV has rapidly spread worldwide. This study investigates the spread of KHV to Taiwan by collecting 49 cases of suspected common carp and koi infections from 2003 to 2005 for analysis. Clinical signs included lethargy, anorexia, increased respiratory movements and uncoordinated swimming. Hyperaemia, haemorrhage on body surface and necrotic gill filaments were recorded. Gill epithelial hyperplasia, necrosis and eosinophilic intranuclear inclusion bodies were observed by histological examination, while virions were detected using transmission electron microscopy. By detecting the presence of the KHV thymidine kinase (TK) gene and the KHV 9/5 gene using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 37 cases were identified as KHV-positive, and the cumulative mortality of infected fish was 70-100%. Positive cases showed identical sequences for the genes analysed, implying that they were of the same origin. For the KHV 9/5 gene sequence, these cases exhibited 100% identity with the Japanese strain (TUMST1, accession number AP008984) and 99% identity with the Israeli (KHV-I, DQ177346) and US (KHV-U, DQ657948) strains. Additionally, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was performed and found to be more sensitive than PCR tests, suggesting its potential use as a rapid diagnostic method for KHV. This is the first epidemiological study of KHV infection in cultured common carp and koi in Taiwan. 3aCyprinid herpesvirus 3 3aCyprinus carpio 3aanorexia 3aepidemiological studies 3afarmed fish 3afish culture 3agenes 3agills 3ahemorrhage 3ahistology 3ahyperplasia 3ainclusion bodies 3akoi 3amortality 3anecrosis 3anucleotide sequences 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aswimming 3athymidine kinase 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avirion 2aAnimals 2aCarpsxvirology 2aDNA, Viralxgenetics 2aFish Diseasesxepidemiologyxpathology. 2aFisheries 2aHerpesviridaexgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHerpesviridae Infectionsxepidemiologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aNucleic Acid Amplification Techniquesxveterinary 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxveterinary 3aIsrael 3aTaiwan 3aUnited States 0aTaiwanxepidemiology.1 aChen, C.Y.1 aTsai, M.A.1 aWang, P.C.1 aHsu, J.P.1 aChern, R.S.1 aChen, S.C.0 tJournal of fish diseases.g2011 July, v. 34, no. 7 p.547-554dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2761.2011.01266.x 7aarticle03048naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009500163300001600258500002400274520173800298650001402036650001002050650003002060650002202090650000902112650001202121650001202133650001102145650001102156650001102167650001702178650002302195650000902218650001502227650001102242650000702253650001802260650001302278650001902291650002302310650000902333700002202342700002002364773011302384852000902497856004802506655001202554IND4438475220221122145339.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443847522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-009-0275-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourie, Elena10aEfficient Purification of Heavy-Metal-Contaminated Water by Microalgae-Activated Pine Bark  ap. 493-500.  aIncludes references  aBatch experiments were performed to study metal sorption by pine bark and algae-treated bark. The biosorption of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni) in synthetic multimetal aqueous solutions was studied as a function of metal content in solution, and amount and size of bark particles used for sorption. Influence of water hardness (Ca²⁺ only was tested) on the metal sorption process was also evaluated. Metal uptake from solutions with high heavy metal content (i.e. 10× the limit for leachate from landfills) was found to be independent of Ca²⁺ concentration. At low metal content in solution (i.e. 1× the limit for leachate from landfills), uptake of Cu, Zn, Ni, and Cd decreased with increasing Ca²⁺ content in water. Microalgae-treated bark was found to increase the metal sorption efficiency. Air-drying of bark-entrapped algae was shown to be the best method for sorbent drying. In general, the green algae, Chlorella sp. and Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata showed the best results in metal uptake. Sorption of Co, Zn, Ni, and Cd from solution with high levels of both heavy metals and calcium increased by almost 50% with algae treatment of bark was applied. At low levels of metals and calcium content, 100% uptake of Cu and Pb in water was observed. Uptake of other metals from solution with low metal and Ca content was relatively high (50-60%). Low pH (pH 3.0) had no influence on metal sorption from solutions with high metal content. For solutions with low metal content a decrease of metal uptake by 10-15% was observed for all the metals but Pb. Thus, the treatment of bark with microalgae was successful and influenced positively the uptake capacity of the bark. 3aChlorella 3aPinus 3aSelenastrum capricornutum 3aaqueous solutions 3abark 3acadmium 3acalcium 3acobalt 3acopper 3adrying 3aheavy metals 3alandfill leachates 3alead 3amicroalgae 3anickel 3apH 3aparticle size 3asorption 3awater hardness 3awater purification 3azinc1 aPatil, Vishwanath1 aGjengedal, Elin0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2010 July, v. 210, no. 1-4 p.493-500dSpringer Netherlandsx0049-69797nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-009-0275-6 7aarticle03160naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245014500190300001600335500002400351520144900375650001601824650001101840650001201851650001201863650001601875650001801891650001801909650001001927650002001937650001601957650002801973650001202001650001702013650001002030650002602040650004702066650001202113650005202125650002102177650002402198650002802222650002202250650004402272650000902316650002202325700001802347700001702365700001502382773013302397852000902530856005502539655001202594IND4445736420221122145318.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444573642DNAL7 a204559682pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00965.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatriyanto, A.10aEffect of graded levels of dietary betaine on ileal and total tract nutrient digestibilities and intestinal bacterial metabolites in piglets  ap. 788-796.  aIncludes references  aThe study was conducted to investigate the effects of graded dietary inclusion levels of betaine on ileal and total tract nutrient digestibilities and intestinal bacterial metabolites in piglets. A total of eight barrows with an average initial body weight of 7.9 kg were randomly allocated to one of the four assay diets with two pigs per treatment in four repeated measurement periods. The assay diets included a basal diet based on wheat, barley and soybean meal alone, or supplemented with a liquid betaine product at dietary levels of 1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 g betaine per kilogram diet (as‐fed). Ileal digestibilities of dry matter and neutral detergent fibre increased both quadratically and linearly, and ileal digestibility of glycine increased linearly as dietary betaine level increased (p < 0.05). Furthermore, total tract digestibility of crude protein increased quadratically (p < 0.05) and total tract digestibilities of most amino acids tended to increase quadratically (p = 0.06 to p = 0.11) with increasing dietary betaine level. Moreover, there were linear increases in the concentrations of most bacterial metabolites which were significant p < 0.05 for ileal d‐lactic acid and for faecal diaminopimelic acid. The results demonstrate that dietary betaine supplementation stimulates bacterial fermentation of fibre in the small intestine and bacterial degradation of crude protein in the large intestine. 3aamino acids 3abarley 3abarrows 3abetaine 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aileum 3alarge intestine 3ametabolites 3aneutral detergent fiber 3apiglets 3asoybean meal 3awheat 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBetainexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietxveterinary 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aIleumxphysiology 2aIntestinesxdrug effectsxmicrobiology. 2aMale 2aSwinexphysiology1 aMosenthin, R.1 aJezierny, D.1 aEklund, M.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Dec., v. 94, no. 6 p.788-796dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00965.x 7aarticle02519naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100002700169245009600196300001800292500002400310520098400334650001301318650001701331650002701348650001201375650001301387650001601400650001701416650002201433650001101455650002101466650001701487650001001504650001401514650001001528650001101538650003401549650003001583650003101613650002801644650002501672650003801697700002701735700001801762700002401780700002401804773009901828852000901927856005301936655001201989IND4436241920221122061740.0100430e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443624192DNAL7 a203475902pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.03.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuendía-González, L.10aProsopis laevigata a potential chromium (VI) and cadmium (II) hyperaccumulator desert plant  ap. 5862-5867.  aIncludes references  aThe bioaccumulation of Cr(VI) and Cd(II) in Prosopis laevigata and the effect of these heavy metals on plant growth were assessed. P. laevigata seeds were cultured during 50days on modified Murashige-Skoog medium supplemented with four different concentrations of Cr(VI) (0-3.4mM) and Cd(II) (0-2.2mM), respectively. Heavy metals did not stop germination, but smaller plants with fewer leaves and secondary roots were produced. Seedlings showed an accumulation of 8176 and 21,437mg Cdkg⁻¹ and of 5461 and 8090mg Cr kg⁻¹ dry weight, in shoot and root, when cultured with 0.65mM Cd(II) and 3.4mM Cr(VI), respectively. These results indicated that significant translocation from the roots unto aerial parts took place. A bioaccumulation factor greater than 100 for Cd and 24 for Cr was exhibited by the seedlings. P. laevigata can be considered as a potential hyperaccumulator of Cd(II) and Cr(VI) species and considered as a promising candidate for phytoremediation purposes. 3aProsopis 3aaerial parts 3abioaccumulation factor 3acadmium 3achromium 3agermination 3aheavy metals 3ahyperaccumulators 3aleaves 3aphytoremediation 3aplant growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCadmiumxpharmacokinetics 2aChromiumxpharmacokinetics 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aProsopisxmetabolism 2aSoil Pollutantsxpharmacokinetics1 aOrozco-Villafuerte, J.1 aCruz-Sosa, F.1 aBarrera-Díaz, C.E.1 aVernon-Carter, E.J.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 Aug., v. 101, no. 15 p.5862-5867dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.03.027 7aarticle02197naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100001800144245005800162300001600220500011400236500001500350520095200365650002201317650001901339650002201358650001301380650001001393650001301403653002601416653001101442653002001453653002301473653002501496653002901521653002001550700001601570773009901586852000901685930003301694945002501727946001101752655001201763IND4369513020221122061908.0050505e20050430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436951302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Different strategies are being implemented to identify and annotate protein coding and RNA genes in these genomes, as well as study their genomic architecture. Since the genomes vary greatly in size, GC-content, nucleotide composition, and degree of repetitiveness, genome structure is often a factor in choosing the methodology utilised for annotation. In addition, the approach taken is dictated, to a greater or lesser extent, by the particular reasons for carrying out genome-wide analyses and the level of funding available for projects. Nevertheless, these projects have provided a plethora of material that will aid in understanding the biology and evolution of these parasites, as well as identifying new targets that can be used to design urgently required drug treatments for the diseases they cause. 3asequence analysis 3abioinformatics 3aresearch projects 3aProtozoa 3agenes 3agenomics 0afunctional annotation 0agenome 0agene prediction 0aliterature reviews 0aprotein coding genes 0anon-protein coding genes 0agenome projects1 aMyler, P.J.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2005 Apr. 30, v. 35, no. 5 p.495-512x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20050516b20050604c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/05/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03829naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245011000149300001800259500018100277500001500458520190700473650001802380650001802398650001002416650000802426650003002434650001502464650001602479650001602495650003802511650002502549650001002574650001802584650001202602650002902614650001602643650002802659650003902687650002902726650006902755650004502824650003202869650001002901650004502911650002402956653002802980653002803008653002203036700001703058773009803075852000903173930003303182945001303215946001103228655001203239IND2203910420221122050737.0000418e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220391042DNAL7 a105765822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeckeroth, A.R.10aDevelopment and validation of species-specific nested PCRs for diagnosis of acute sarcocystiosis in sheep  ap. 1331-1349.  aIn the special issue "COST820: Vaccines against animal coccidioses" / edited by A.M. Tenter and M.W. Shirley. Proceedings of a workshop held October 22-25, 1998, Toledo, Spain.  a2019-12-05  aSheep may be infected by four species of Sarcocystis. Two of these species, Sarcocystis tenella and Sarcocystis arieticanis, are pathogenic. They may cause abortion or acute disease during the early phase of infection, and chronic disease during the late phase of infection. Thus far, diagnosis of sarcocystiosis in sheep has been limited, because traditional diagnostic tests based on the detection of Sarcocystis-specific antibodies are only genus-specific and, thus, cannot differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic species. In addition, most of these tests show a reasonable sensitivity only for the late phase of infection. Therefore, diagnosis of acute sarcocystiosis has been based mainly on post-mortem examination, i.e. after the animal had succumbed to the disease. Here we established species-specific nested PCR assays based on unique small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequences of S. tenella and S. arieticanis. These PCR assays specifically detect DNA of the homologous species in blood samples of sheep. No cross-reactions were observed with the heterologous pathogenic species, the non-pathogenic species Sarcocystis gigantea, or the closely related coccidia Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum. In sheep experimentally infected with S. tenella or S. arieticanis, positive PCR results were correlated with the early phases of multiplication (endopolygeny) of the parasites. By contrast, Sarcocystis-specific antibodies were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay only during the terminal phase of endopolygeny or thereafter. Thus, the nested PCR assays developed here enable, for the first time, the diagnosis and differentiation of infections with S. tenella and S. arieticanis in living sheep during the acute phase of the disease and facilitate comprehensive studies on the epidemiology and importance of infections with pathogenic Sarcocystis species in sheep. 3aribosomal RNA 3aserodiagnosis 3asheep 3aDNA 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aantibodies 3aDNA primers 3aSarcocystis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aprotozoal infections 3agenes 2aAcute Disease 2aAnimals 2aDNA, Protozoanxanalysis 2aGenes, rRNA 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aSarcocystisxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSarcocystosisxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxdiagnosisxparasitology. 2aSpecies Specificity 0aexperimental infections 0asarcocystis arieticanis 0adisease diagnosis1 aTenter, A.M.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1999 Aug., v. 29, no. 8 p.1331-1349x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02395naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245008800146300001800234500010500252520072900357650001201086650001501098650001501113650001301128650002301141650001901164650002501183650001201208650004101220650004301261650003101304650005901335650003101394650001101425650001301436650006201449650003901511650003501550650006201585650002701647653003701674700001301711773009901724852000901823930003301832945001301865946001101878655001201889IND2333634520221122050756.0030716e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233363452DNAL7 a115663002pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaliba, K.J.10aNutrient acquisition by intracellular apicomplexan parasites: staying in for dinner  ap. 1321-1330.  aIn the thematic issue: Life in vacuoles--a strategy for parasite survival / edited by K.

The nutrients required by these intracellular parasites to support their high rate of growth and replication originate from the host cell which, in turn, takes up such compounds from the extracellular milieu. Solutes moving from the external medium to the interior of the parasite, are confronted by a series of three membranes--the host cell membrane, the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and the parasite plasma membrane. Each constitutes a potential permeability barrier which must be either crossed or bypassed. It is the mechanisms by which this occurs that are the subject of this review. 3aEimeria 3aPlasmodium 3aToxoplasma 3avacuoles 3anutrient transport 3acell membranes 3aprotozoal infections 2aAnimals 2aApicomplexaxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Membranexmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCell Membrane Permeability 2aEimeriaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aHumans 2aMovement 2aPlasmodiumxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aProtozoan Infectionsxparasitology 2aProtozoan Proteinsxmetabolism 2aToxoplasmaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aVacuolesxparasitology 0aparasitophorous vacuole membrane1 aKirk, K.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2001 Oct., v. 31, no. 12 p.1321-1330x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02777naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100003300129245008600162300001600248520104100264650002201305650002001327650001901347650002001366650003001386650000801416650001601424650001201440650002101452650006001473650002801533650005701561650003001618650001101648650003301659650001101692650003001703650002701733651001301760651001301773653002501786653003701811700001301848700001501861700002101876700001601897700001901913700001501932700003301947700001601980700001701996773009602013852000902109930003302118945001302151946001102164655001202175IND2321422020221122041848.0010607e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232142202DNAL7 a113061162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatt︠s︡ėt︠s︡ėg, B.10aDetection of Babesia caballi and Babesia equi in Dermacentor nuttalli adult ticks  ap. 384-386.  aTicks play an important role in human and veterinary medicine particularly due to their ability to transmit protozoan pathogens. In this study we have demonstrated that polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested PCR methods enabled detection of Babesia caballi and Babesia equi in field isolates of Dermacentor nuttalli adult ticks from Mongolia. Primers specific for 218 bp fragment merozoite antigen 1 (EMA-1) gene of B. equi successfully amplified products from all samples of D. nuttalli adult ticks while primers for the 430 bp fragment product from BC48 gene of B. caballi amplified products from seven of the 54 samples. Using PCR and nested PCR methods we have found mixed infections with B. equi and B. caballi in the tick vector. The amplified DNA fragment from D. nuttalli ticks was inserted into the USDA strain of B. caballi. These results suggest that D. nuttalli may play an important role as a vector of both B. caballi and B. equi and also may be important in maintaining endemicity of equine piroplasmosis in Mongolia. 3adisease diagnosis 3aBabesia caballi 3aTheileria equi 3adisease vectors 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 2aAnimals 2aArachnid Vectors 2aBabesiaxchemistryxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBabesiosisxveterinary. 2aDNA, Protozoanxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aDermacentorxparasitology 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxparasitology 2aHorses 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aMongolia 0aMongolia 0adermacentor nuttalli 0anested polymerase chain reaction1 aXuan, X.1 aIkadai, H.1 aBautista, J.L.R.1 aByambaa, B.1 aBoldbaatar, D.1 aBattur, B.1 aBatt︠s︡ėt︠s︡ėg, G.1 aBatsukh, Z.1 aIgarashi, I.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2001 Apr., v. 31, no. 4 p.384-386x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02473naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245008600170300001600256500002400272520134000296650001701636650002801653650001101681650001801692650001901710650001501729650002401744650001201768650001101780650002501791700002301816700002201839700002501861700002501886773011201911852000902023856005502032655001202087IND4403637020221122042037.0080328e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440363702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4514.2008.00170.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGOMEZ, LEISSY10aImmobilization of invertase-chitosan conjugate on hyaluronic-acid-modified chitin  ap. 264-277.  aIncludes references  aBaker yeast invertase, chemically modified with chitosan, was immobilized on hyaluronic-acid-coated chitin support via polyelectrolyte complex formation. The immobilized enzyme retained 80% of the initial invertase activity. The optimum temperature for sucrose hydrolysis was increased by 5C, and its thermostability was enhanced by about 10C after immobilization. The immobilized enzyme was stable against incubation in high-ionic-strength solutions, and was sixfold more resistant to thermal treatment at 65C than the native counterpart. The biocatalyst prepared retained 100% after 10 cycles of reuse as well as after 74 h of continuous sucrose hydrolysis in a packed bed reactor, respectively. The immobilized enzyme retained 69% of its activity after 50 days of storage at 37C. Invertase is widely used in the food industry as biocatalyst for the preparation of invert sugar syrups, a value-added product obtained from sucrose. The present article deals with the preparation of a highly stable invertase by modifying it with chitosan and then immobilizing it on hyaluronic-acid-coated chitin support. This new biocatalyst has potential application in the high-scale preparation of sucrose syrups, reducing industrial costs because of the excellent operational stability and reusability properties showed by the immobilized enzyme. 3abakers yeast 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3achitin 3afood industry 3aheat treatment 3ahydrolysis 3aimmobilized enzymes 3asucrose 3asyrups 3avalue-added products1 aRAMIREZ, HECTOR L.1 aCabrera, Gustavo.1 aSimpson, Benjamin K.1 aVILLALONGA, REYNALDO0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g2008 Apr., v. 32, no. 2 p.264-277dBlackwell Publishing Incx0145-88847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4514.2008.00170.x 7aarticle03400naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245010200144300001600246500001500262520167000277650002201947650001601969650002701985650002002012650002402032650001402056650001402070650002302084650002302107650000902130650001002139650002602149650001802175650002402193650001202217650001302229650002702242650001102269650004902280650001602329650001702345650001402362650001202376650001002388650003302398650001602431650000902447651001402456651001402470653001002484653001602494653001802510653001702528700001502545700001602560773009602576852000902672930003302681945001302714946001102727655001202738IND2180400920221122041823.0981009e199802  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218040092DNAL7 a95129912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJames, P.J.10aSeasonal dynamics and variation among sheep in densities of the sheep biting louse, Bovicola ovis  ap. 283-292.  a2019-12-05  aCyclic patterns and variations among sheep in numbers of Bovicola ovis are described in Polypay and Columbia ewes that were initially infested with equal numbers of lice and penned indoors continuously for 2 years. Bovicola ovis populations were censused at 3-4-week intervals at 69 body sites on each animal. In the second year of the study, the ewes were reinfested and half were mated. Louse populations were monitored on the resulting lambs from birth until 25 weeks of age. Strong seasonal cycles in louse numbers were observed on the ewes, with peaks in spring and troughs in summer. These cycles occurred in the absence of shearing, direct solar radiation or rainfall. Populations began to decline when daily mean and maximum temperatures were 11.5 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively, well below temperatures thought to cause warm season decline. Louse densities on Polypay ewes were approximately 10 times higher than on Columbias at most inspections. There were also large differences among sheep within breeds and sheep counts were highly correlated among dates, both within and between years. One third of the ewes failed to become infested despite having lice applied on five separate occasions and being penned together with other infested sheep. Pregnancy and lactation did not significantly affect louse numbers on the ewes. There was a significant negative correlation between louse counts and weight gains in the lambs, and lamb counts were significantly correlated with those of their dams up until, but not after, weaning. It is suggested that sheep may exert regulatory influences on lice which contribute to cycles in B. ovis populations. 3abreed differences 3aparasitoses 3aColumbia (sheep breed) 3aair temperature 3aambient temperature 3alactation 3apregnancy 3aseasonal variation 3apopulation density 3aewes 3alambs 3abiological resistance 3aBovicola ovis 3apopulation dynamics 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aFemale 2aLice Infestationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aPeriodicity 2aPhthiraptera 2aPregnancy 2aSeasons 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiology 2aTemperature 2aWool 3aMinnesota 0aMinnesota 0asheep 0ainfestation 0apolypay breed 0asheep breeds1 aMoon, R.D.1 aBrown, D.R.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1998 Feb., v. 28, no. 2 p.283-292x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20040629b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03575naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002700164245011400191300001600305500002400321520149100345650000801836650001801844650002301862650001801885650001601903650002001919650001001939650001201949650001601961650001401977650001801991650001502009650002302024650000902047650001502056650001702071650002702088650001702115650002502132650005602157650001202213650005602225650003502281650003202316650006702348650003402415650003502449650003702484650000902521650004802530650002902578650002202607650000902629650001702638700003702655700002302692700002002715773010902735852000902844856004802853655001202901IND4423722520221122041853.0090724e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442372252DNAL7 a193260392pmid7 a10.1007/s00394-009-0013-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 adel Mar Romero, María10aSite-related white adipose tissue lipid-handling response to oleoyl-estrone treatment in overweight male rats  ap. 291-299.  aIncludes references  aBackground Oleoyl-estrone (OE) decreases energy intake while maintaining glucose homeostasis, and energy expenditure at the expense of body fat. White adipose tissue (WAT) depots behave differently under starvation, postprandial state and pharmacologically induced lipolysis. Aim of the study To understand the mechanism of massive lipid loss from WAT elicited by OE treatment. Methods We used overweight male rats. Rats receiving OE (10 nmol/g) gavages were compared with controls and a pair-fed group. Whole fat pads from the mesenteric, retroperitoneal, epididymal and inguinal subcutaneous sites were excised and analyzed for lipid, DNA, mRNA and the expression of lipogenic, fatty acid transporters and lipase genes. Results In OE and pair-fed rats, WAT weights decreased, with the limited loss of cells. Patterns of gene expression in most WAT sites were similar for OE and PF, suggesting a shared mechanism of fat mobilization, but in mesenteric WAT, PF increased lipogenic and fatty acid transporter gene expressions. However, OE inhibited lipogenic expressions more deeply than PF. Conclusions White adipose tissue sites showed different expression patterns, hinting at relatively specialized functions in fat storage; thus, single site analyses cannot be extrapolated to whole WAT. Differences between mesenteric and the other sites suggest that 'visceral fat' should be reserved for this site only, and not applied to other abdominal fat depots (epididymal, retroperitoneal). 3aDNA 3aabdominal fat 3aenergy expenditure 3aenergy intake 3afatty acids 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3alipolysis 3amessenger RNA 3aoverweight 3apostprandial state 3arats 3astarvation 3atransporters 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3avisceral fat 3awhite adipose tissue 2aAdipose Tissuexcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Obesity Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aBody Compositionxdrug effects 2aEnergy Intakexdrug effects 2aEstronexanalogs & derivativesxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aLipid Mobilizationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aOleic Acidsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aOverweightxdrug therapy 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aFernández-López, José Antonio1 aEsteve, Montserrat1 aAlemany, Marià0 tEuropean journal of nutrition.g2009 Aug., v. 48, no. 5 p.291-299dD.

  1 aMassey, H.C. Jr.10aStructure and developmental expression of Strongyloides stercoralis fktf-1, a proposed ortholog of daf-16 in Caenorhabditis elegans  ap. 1537-1544.  a2019-12-05  aA forkhead transcription factor gene, fktf-1, which we propose to be orthologous to the Caenorhabditis elegans dauer-regulatory gene daf-16 has been discovered in the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. Genomic and cDNA sequences from both species predict alternately spliced a and b message isoforms. In contrast to C. elegans, where two a isoforms, daf-16a1 and daf-16a2, are found, a single fktf-1a isoform is found in S. stercoralis. Five of the 10 introns found in the C. elegans gene are found in the proposed S. stercoralis ortholog. Functional motifs common to DAF-16 and several mammalian forkhead transcription factors are conserved in FKTF-1. These include the forkhead DNA binding domain, four Akt/protein kinase B phosphorylation sites and a C-terminal domain that may associate with factors such as the steroid receptor coactivator and other factors necessary for transcriptional regulation. An N-terminal serine-rich domain found in DAF-16A is greatly expanded in FKTF-1A. This domain is missing in DAF-16B, FKTF-1B and all mammalian orthologs. FKTF-1 shows the closest phylogenetic relationship to DAF-16 among all known mammalian and nematode forkhead transcription factors. Like its proposed Caenorhabditis ortholog, the fktf-1 message is expressed at all stages of the life cycle examined thus far. Discovery of fktf-1 indicates the presence of an insulin-like signalling pathway in S. stercoralis similar to that known to regulate dauer development in C. elegans. This pathway is a likely candidate to control infective larval arrest and reactivation as well as regulation of the switch between parasitic and free-living development in the parasite. 3atranscription factors 3amessenger RNA 3acomplementary DNA 3aphylogeny 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3anematode larvae 3aintrons 3aStrongyloides stercoralis 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxgenetics 2aCaenorhabditis elegans Proteins 2aGene Expression 2aGenes, Helminth 2aHumans 2aLarva 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology 2aStrongyloides stercoralisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0aforkhead transcription factor 0amolecular sequence data 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0afktf-1 gene1 aNishi, M.1 aChaudhary, K.1 aPakpour, N.1 aLok, J.B.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2003 Nov., v. 33, no. 13 p.1537-1544x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  aINDdNZMe2004/02/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02555naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002500181245007600206300001800282500002400300506007600324520132700400506003701727650002501764650001001789650002601799650000901825650001101834650001301845650000701858650001601865700001601881773013501897852000902032856008002041856004802121655001202169IND4390252220221207121721.0070408e20070401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439025222DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02013-062doi7 aPMC18556882pmcid7 a172935192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLambert, Ronald J.W.10aGamma Study of pH, Nitrite, and Salt Inhibition of Aeromonas hydrophila  ap. 2239-2246.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe gamma hypothesis states that there are no interactions between antimicrobial environmental factors. The time to growth of Aeromonas hydrophila challenged with pH, NaNO₂, and salt combinations at 30°C was investigated. Data were examined using a model based on the gamma hypothesis (the gamma model), which takes into account variance-stabilizing transformations and which gives biologically relevant parameters. At high concentrations of NaNO₂ and at pHs of >6.0, the antimicrobial action of the nitrite ion has a strong influence (MIC = 2,033 mg liter⁻¹), whereas at pHs of <6, nitrous acid is dominant (MIC = 1.5 mg liter⁻¹). This change is not due to a "synergy" between pH and the nitrite ion but is due to the shift in the equilibrium concentrations of nitrous acid and nitrite in solution caused by pH. In combination with salt, the parameters found for the action of Na nitrite were identical to those found when it was examined in isolation. Therefore, pH, NaNO₂, and salt act independently on the growth of A. hydrophila. By expanding the gamma model with a cardinal temperature model, the results of fitting the model of Palumbo et al. (J. Food Prot. 54:429-435, 1994) to randomly produced environmental conditions could be reproduced, suggesting that temperature also has an independent effect.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3aacids 3aenvironmental factors 3aions 3amodels 3anitrites 3apH 3atemperature1 aBidlas, Eva0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2007 Apr. 1, v. 73, no. 7 p.2239-2246dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02013-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle03821naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009400144300001600238520176200254650001202016650002402028650003002052650002202082650003502104650002302139650002102162650001002183650001602193650002002209650002102229650003302250650002202283650001602305650001202321650003902333650002302372650003502395650001602430650005102446650002402497650001102521650001002532650000902542650002502551650004902576650002702625650004302652650002302695650004802718650003302766651001602799651001602815653001802831653001702849700001802866700001502884700001602899700001602915700001802931773009602949852000903045930003303054945001303087946001103100655001203111IND2057421620221122031354.0970602e199604  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205742162DNAL7 a87735312pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, R.S.10aAntibody responses of grazing alpacas (Lama pacos) in New Zealand to intestinal nematodes  ap. 429-435.  aAlpaca (Lama pacos) were grazed for 10 months (October 1992-June 1993) on pasture with sheep or on pasture which had been recently grazed by sheep. The alpaca, of various age groups, totalled 94 at the beginning of the experiment and during the course of the experiment 32 progeny (cria) were born, 10 in spring 1992 and 22 in autumn 1993. Serum levels of specific antibodies to excretory/secretory antigens of the third larval stage (L3) of (Cooperia curticei, Ostertagia circumcincta or Trichostrongylus colubriformis and somatic antigens from adult T. colubriformis were determined at monthly intervals by ELISA. Faecal egg count and live-weight were determined monthly and fleece-weight was measured at shearing. Three days after the birth of the cria, serum antibody levels ranged from 0.46-0.85 optical density units for the L3 antigens and averaged 0.22 for the adult T. colubriformis antigen. These levels declined to 0.1-0.24 and 0.06 respectively by 2-3 months of age. Subsequently, antibody levels increased steadily to reach maximal adult levels at approximately 23-26 months. Antibody levels were negatively correlated with FEC, but positively correlated with live-weight at 7 months although at 15 months antibodies and live-weight were negatively correlated. A positive correlation was found between weight and FEC. Fleece-weight showed no correlation with antibody level, a positive correlation with weight and a negative correlation with FEC. The relationships among antibody responses, FEC, live-weight and fleece-weight observed for alpaca in this experiment suggest that antibody responses might provide a useful indicator of alpaca immuno-responsiveness and has potential for use as a parameter for selection of alpaca with reduced FEC. 3aalpacas 3anematode infections 3aTeladorsagia circumcincta 3aCooperia curticei 3aTrichostrongylus colubriformis 3aantibody formation 3ahumoral immunity 3afeces 3abody weight 3afecal egg count 3asomatic antigens 3aexcretory-secretory products 2aAgingximmunology 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Helminthxbiosynthesis 2aAntibody Formation 2aAntigens, Helminthximmunology 2aBody Weight 2aCamelids, New Worldximmunologyxparasitology. 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aLarva 2aMale 2aNematodaximmunology 2aNematode Infectionsximmunologyxveterinary. 2aOstertagiaximmunology 2aOstertagiasisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aParasite Egg Count 2aTrichostrongylosisximmunologyxveterinary. 2aTrichostrongylusximmunology 3aNew Zealand 0aNew Zealand 0afleece weight 0ahelminth ova1 aDouch, P.G.C.1 aHill, F.I.1 aDeath, A.F.1 aWyeth, T.K.1 aDonaghy, M.J.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1996 Apr., v. 26, no. 4 p.429-435x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001200146245014500158300001800303520105800321650002401379650001901403650002101422650001001443650002201453650002501475650002501500650001801525650002501543650002001568650002501588650001801613650001501631650002401646650001201670650001801682650003101700650002601731650002201757650004601779650002001825650003401845650002801879650003601907650002001943650002701963653002801990653002902018653002202047653002102069700001402090700001602104700001502120700001702135773009902152852000902251930003302260945002502293946001102318655001202329IND4366606920221122012431.0050112e200411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436660692DNAL7 a155420982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A cellulose-binding protein-encoding cDNA, designated Hg-cbp-1, was cloned from a Heterodera glycines oesophageal gland-cell long-distance PCR cDNA library. The cDNA hybridised to genomic DNA of H. glycines in Southern blots, and the genomic sequence of Hg-cbp-1 contained only one intron. The Hg-cbp-1 cDNA contained an open reading frame encoding 132 amino acids, with a predicted signal peptide sequence for secretion and a cellulose-binding domain. Bacterial expressed recombinant HG-CBP-1, minus the signal peptide sequence, had no hydrolytic activity on carboxymethyl-cellulose but was able to bind to cellulose. The developmental expression of Hg-cbp-1, determined by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, showed that Hg-cbp-1 is expressed throughout the parasitic cycle of H. glycines, with a relatively higher expression level in developing parasitic stages. 3aHeterodera glycines 3acyst nematodes 3abinding proteins 3agenes 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3abinding sites 3arecombinant proteins 3agene expression 3adevelopmental stages 3aanimal glands 3aparasitism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Westernxmethods 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aFood Parasitology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGenes, Helminth 2aHelminth Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNematodaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSoybeansxparasitology 0amolecular sequence data 0acellulose binding domain 0aesophageal glands 0aparasitism genes1 aAllen, R.1 aDavis, E.L.1 aBaum, T.J.1 aHussey, R.S.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2004 Nov., v. 34, no. 12 p.1377-1383x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20050511b20050604c00000000  aINDdNZMe2005/01/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02256naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245005500167300001600222520115400238650001401392650001201406650001701418650002501435650001501460650002001475650001801495650001501513650001401528650002201542650002201564651001101586700002101597700001801618700001901636773015601655856005001811852000901861655001201870IND60313033020221121224850.0150715s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031303302DNAL7 a10.5304/jafscd.2013.032.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdulla, Majd14aThe Importance of Quantifying Food Waste in Canada  ap. 137-151.  aUnderstanding food waste in Canada may offer previously unrecognized opportunities and strategies to address rising food-cost inflation, food insecurity, and negative ecological impacts and energy costs attributable to food production, distribution, and accessibility. It is significant for all agents along the food chain and policy makers to know how much food Canadians waste, as well as why and where. This paper examines food waste at both the consumer and retailer levels. We used data from reports published by Statistics Canada and the World Bank to calculate the amount of food waste from the food available for consumption from 1961 to 2009. The preliminary results of the research show that food waste increased over time in relation to the food available for consumption. The average food waste was estimated at 40 percent of food available for consumption over almost five decades. The conclusion can also be drawn that food waste is positively correlated with per capital GDP and per capita income. We present recommendations for quantifying food waste and understanding the combination of reasons and factors that drive up food waste. 3aCanadians 3acapital 3aenergy costs 3aenvironmental impact 3afood chain 3afood production 3afood security 3afood waste 3ainflation 3aissues and policy 3aper-capita income 3aCanada1 aMartin, Ralph C.1 aGooch, Martin1 aJovel, Eduardo0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2013, v. 3, no. 2 p.137-151dNew Leaf Associates, Inc.wJournal:6226x2152-08017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5304/jafscd.2013.032.018  aDNAL 7aarticle04160naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129100001400146245015100160300001600311520211500327650002402442650002702466650003102493650001402524650002002538650002702558650001502585650002202600650003302622650001202655650002402667650002502691650001302716650001602729650002102745650005302766650001202819650004102831650003102872650002802903650006502931650005302996650003603049650002403085650002403109650003003133650005103163650004203214650003603256653002903292653002203321700001703343773009603360852000903456930003303465945002503498946001103523655001203534IND4363873020221121210223.0040813e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436387302DNAL7 a152177292pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aBrand, A.10aPhosphoinositide-3-OH-kinase inhibitor LY294002 prevents activation of Ancylostoma caninum and Ancylostoma ceylanicum third-stage infective larvae  ap. 909-914.  aThe developmentally arrested hookworm infective larva resumes development only after encountering specific host-mediated cues during invasion. These cues activate a signaling pathway that culminates in the resumption of development. In Ancylostoma caninum, activation is characterised by the resumption of feeding and the release of excretory/secretory products required for infection. The dauer stage of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a developmentally arrested stage analogous to the hookworm infective larva. Dauer larvae exit developmental arrest in response to environmental cues that indicate favorable conditions for reproduction and growth. Because of the similarity between dauer recovery and activation, exit from dauer provides a model for hookworm larval activation. An insulin-signaling pathway has been implicated in controlling exit from developmental arrest in both C. elegans dauers and A. caninum larvae. To further investigate the role of insulin signaling in hookworm larval activation, the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase inhibitor LY294002 was tested for its effect on in vitro activation using the resumption of feeding as a marker for activation. LY294002 prevented feeding in A. caninum infective larvae stimulated with host serum filtrate and a glutathione-analogue, the muscarinic agonist arecoline, or the cell permeable cGMP-analogue 8-bromo-cGMP. Similar results were seen with the congeneric hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum. These data suggest that an insulin-signaling pathway mediates activation in hookworm larvae, as in C. elegans, and that the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase inhibitor acts downstream of the cGMP and muscarinic signaling steps in the pathway. In A. caninum, LY294002 had no effect on the release of excretory/secretory products associated with activation, suggesting that the secretory pathway diverges from the activation pathway upstream of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase step. These results provide additional support for the insulin-signaling pathway as the primarily pathway for activation to parasitism in hookworm larvae. 3aAncylostoma caninum 3aAncylostoma ceylanicum 3aanimal parasitic nematodes 3ahookworms 3anematode larvae 3abiological development 3aparasitism 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aphosphatidylinositol kinases 3ainsulin 3asignal transduction 3abiochemical pathways 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3afeeding behavior 2aAncylostomaxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aAnimals 2aArecolinexmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBlotting, Westernxmethods 2aChromonesxpharmacology 2aCyclic GMPxanalogs & derivativesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aCyclic GMP-Dependent Protein Kinasesxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aMorpholinesxpharmacology 2aMuscarinic Agonistsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPhosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 0aactivation to parasitism 0ainsulin signaling1 aHawdon, J.M.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g2004 July, v. 34, no. 8 p.909-914x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/08/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02848naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245012100169300001600290500002400306520153600330650001901866650002201885650002401907650002901931650001401960650001401974650001001988650002401998650002702022650001102049650003002060650001202090650001302102650001502115700002302130700001302153700001402166700001502180700001402195700001802209773009902227852000902326856005502335655001202390IND4458666320221121132245.0110603e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445866632DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01827.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Hongbo.10aAnalyses of inheritance patterns and consistent expression of sporamin and chitinase PjChi-1 genes in Brassica napus  ap. 345-351.  aIncludes references  aWith 6 figures and 2 tables ABSTRACT: Stable and consistent expression of foreign genes in serial propagation is a crucial factor to induce effective and efficient resistance through genetic engineering in insects and fungi. To better understand the inheritance patterns and expression of transgenes, two genes (sporamin and chitinase PjChi-1) in T₁ progeny of four single-copy T₀ transformants were characterized. PCR detection revealed that the segregation ratio was 3 : 1 for tested plants of each T₀ transformant, which agreed with the Mendelian rules. In RT-PCR analysis, 10 positive progeny plants of T₀-11 line showed a stable expression of sporamin and PjChi-1 but not in wild type. Moreover, a higher expression level of sporamin gene in T₁-11-3 was confirmed compared to the other progeny plants using Northern blot hybridization technique. Artificial inoculation of 10 plants (T₁-11) with Lepidoptera larvae (Plutella xylostella) and fungus (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) in in vitro bioassays showed significant resistance compared to the wild type. Progeny T₁-11-3 showed the stronger resistance, which was consistent with the higher expression level of sporamin gene in Northern blot hybridization detection, whereas there was no difference in insect and fungi resistance among these positive T₁-11 plants. These results indicate that both combined genes have been inherited from parental transformants to their progeny and showed a consistent resistance to insect and fungus in all positive T₁ progeny. 3aBrassica napus 3aNorthern blotting 3aPlutella xylostella 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3abioassays 3achitinase 3afungi 3agenetic engineering 3ainheritance (genetics) 3alarvae 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprogeny 3asporamin 3atransgenes1 aNaeem, Muhammad S.1 aLiu, Dan1 aZhu, YaNa1 aGuo, Xiang1 aCui, Peng1 aZhou, Weijun.0 tPlant breeding.g2011 June, v. 130, no. 3 p.345-351dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01827.x 7aarticle03199naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245012200148300001800270500001500288520126700303650002201570650002401592650001401616650002001630650001001650650000901660650002001669650003001689650002701719650001101746650001601757650002501773650001201798650002401810650001101834650002201845650001301867650003101880650005001911650003001961650003501991650002402026650003302050653002002083653002802103653001502131653001002146653002002156653001702176653001502193653001702208653002402225700002002249700002302269700001802292700001702310700002102327773009902348852000902447930003302456945001302489946001102502655001202513IND2197338120221121105356.0990303e199809  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219733812DNAL7 a97706192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJorgensen, L.T.10aVariation between hosts in the developmental success of the free-living stages of trichostrongyle infections of sheep  ap. 1347-1352.  a2019-12-05  aVariation between hosts of different ages and genotypes in the developmental success of trichostrongylid parasite eggs from sheep was investigated in two trials. The percentage development to infective third-stage larvae of eggs collected from lambs and adult ewes infected with Ostertagia circumcincta was compared in an indoor trial. In addition, sheep previously bred for either high or low faecal egg count and grazed outdoors on parasite contaminated pasture were sampled; egg development, faecal egg count, generic profile and faecal dry matter were measured. In both trials, development to L3 was significantly lower in eggs derived from adult ewes than from lambs and, in the field trial, from animals selected for low faecal egg count. The observed differences could not be accounted for by variations in faecal egg count. faecal dry matter content nor by differences in the generic composition of worm egg output. Although not shown conclusively, the results are consistent with an immune mechanism influencing the development of free-living stages of gastrointestinal nematodes outside the host. These results have significant implications for our understanding of parasite epidemiology, particularly as it relates to sources of pasture contamination. 3abreed differences 3anematode infections 3aexcretion 3afecal egg count 3alambs 3aewes 3anematode larvae 3aTeladorsagia circumcincta 3abiological development 3aRomney 2aAge Factors 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aFecesxparasitology 2aFemale 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aOstertagiaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aOstertagiasisxveterinary 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aSheepxparasitology 2aSheep Diseasesxparasitology 0aperendale breed 0aexperimental infections 0adry matter 0asheep 0aage differences 0ahelminth ova 0asheep dung 0asheep breeds 0apolled dorset breed1 aLeathwick, D.M.1 aCharleston, W.A.G.1 aGodfrey, P.L.1 aVlassoff, A.1 aSutherland, I.A.0 tInternational journal for parasitology.g1998 Sept., v. 28, no. 9 p.1347-1352x0020-75197nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02961naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245010400142300001400246500001500260520118200275650002201457650003301479650001101512650001801523650002201541650002601563650001401589650002501603650002001628650002901648650002501677650002001702650003701722650001201759650002301771650001801794650002301812650003301835650001801868650002201886650002801908650003401936650002701970650004001997650003402037653002102071653002002092653002802112700001602140700001402156700001702170773009402187852000902281930003302290945001302323946001102336655001202347IND2207121520221121105430.0001005e200001  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220712152DNAL7 a106757482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, X.10aMolecular cloning and characterisation of a venom allergen AG5-like cDNA from Meloidogyne incognita  ap. 77-81.  a2019-12-05  aRNA fingerprinting was used to identify RNAs that were expressed in parasitic second-stage juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita, but absent from or reduced in preparasitic second-stage juveniles. A cDNA encoding a putative secretory protein was cloned from a M. incognita second-stage juvenile cDNA library by probing with a 0.5 kb fragment derived from fingerprinting that was more strongly expressed in parasitic second-stage juveniles. The cDNA, named Mi-msp-1, contained an open reading frame encoding 231 amino acids, with the first 21 amino acids being a putative secretory signal. In Southern blot analysis the Mi-msp-1 hybridised with genomic DNA from M. incognita, Meloidogyne arenaria, Meloidogyne javanica, but not Meloidogyne, hapla, Heterodera glycines or Caenorhabditis elegans. In Northern blot analysis a 1 kb transcript was detected in both preparasitic and parasitic second-stage juveniles, but not in adult females of M. incognita.

However, due to methodological constraints, we still lack a comprehensive, quantitative understanding of denitrification rates and controlling factors across various ecosystems. We investigated N₂, N₂O and NO emissions from irrigated cotton fields within the Aral Sera Basin using the He/O₂ atmosphere gas flow soil core technique and an incubation assay. NH₄NO₃ fertilizer, equivalent to 75 kg ha⁻¹ and irrigation water, adjusting the water holding capacity to 70, 100 and 130% were applied to the incubation vessels to assess its influence on gaseous N emissions. Under soil conditions as they are naturally found after concomitant irrigation and fertilization, denitrification was the dominant process and N₂ the main end product of denitrification. The mean ratios of N₂/N₂O emissions increased with increasing soil moisture content. N₂ emissions exceeded N₂O emissions by a factor of 5 ± 2 at 70% soil water holding capacity (WHC) and a factor of 55 ± 27 at 130% WHC. The mean ratios of N₂O/NO emissions varied between 1.5 ± 0.4 (70% WHC) and 644 ± 108 (130% WHC). The magnitude of N₂ emissions for irrigated cotton was estimated to be in the range of 24 ± 9 to 175 ± 65 kg-N ha⁻¹season⁻¹, while emissions of NO were only of minor importance (between 0.1 to 0.7 kg-N ha⁻¹ season⁻¹). The findings demonstrate that for irrigated dryland soils in the Aral Sera Basin, denitrification is a major pathway of N-loss and that substantial amounts of N-fertilizer are lost as N₂ to the atmosphere for irrigated dryland soils. 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aammonium nitrate 3aarid lands 3abasins 3acotton 3adenitrification 3aecosystems 3aemissions factor 3afertilizers 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3airrigation 3airrigation water 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awater holding capacity 3aUzbekistan 0aN₂ exclusion method 0aN₂-emission 0aN₂O-emission 0aNO-emission 0aN₂/N₂O ratio 0aN₂O/NO ratio1 aWassmann, Reiner 1 aButterbach-Bahl, Klaus 1 aLamers, John P.

Plant N status is a function of both soil N availability and plant N uptake and assimilation capacity. As a rate-limiting step in nitrate assimilation, the reduction of nitrate is an important component of plant physiological response to elevated CO₂ and terrestrial carbon sequestration. We examine the effects of elevated CO₂ and N availability on the activity of nitrate reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the reduction of nitrate to nitrite, in two temperate forests--a closed canopy sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) plantation in Tennessee (Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)) and a loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) stand in North Carolina (Duke). Both CO₂ and N enrichment had species specific impacts on nitrate reductase activity (NaR). Elevated CO₂ and N fertilization decreased foliar NaR in P. taeda, but there were no treatment effects on L. styraciflua NaR at ORNL or Duke. NaR in 1-year P. taeda needles was significantly greater than in 0-year old needles across treatments. P. taeda NaR was negatively correlated with bio-available molybdenum concentrations in soils, suggesting that CO₂ and N-mediated changes in soil nutrient status may be altering soil-plant N-dynamics. The variation in response among species may reflect different strategies for acquiring N and suggests that elevated CO₂ may alter plant N dynamics through changes in NaR. 3aLiquidambar styraciflua 3aPinus taeda 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acarbon sequestration 3aenzyme activity 3amolybdenum 3anitrate reductase 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3aphysiological response 3aplant response 3asoil 3asoil nutrients 3atemperate forests 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3aNorth Carolina 3aTennessee 0aFree-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) 0aMicronutrients 0aNO₃ ⁻ assimilation1 aSañudo-Wilhelmy, Sergio A. 1 aLerdau, Manuel T. 0 tPlant and soil.g2009 Jan., v. 314, no. 1-2 p.197-210dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-008-9718-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01888naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001600154245008900170300001600259500002400275520099400299650001601293650001201309650001101321650001101332651001001343700001801353700001701371773013201388852000901520856005701529655001201586IND4461159220221121065700.0110805e199907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446115922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1999.tb00523.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLIU, YAN-JU10aStudies on fossil Metasequoia from north-east China and their taxonomic implications  ap. 267-297.  aIncludes references  aSpecimens of Metasequoia from the Late Cretaceous or Early Tertiary collected from the Wuyun Formation, Jiayin County, Heilongjiang Province, north-east China, include shoots, female and male cones.

Comparative studies on fossil and living specimens of the genus suggest a new approach to the classification of species of Metasequoia. Our investigations indicate that extant M. glyptostroboides is distinct from all of the recognized fossil species. The specimens described here, in addition to those previously regarded as M. disticha, M. japonica, M. chinensis, M. cuneata, M. papillapollenites, M. miocenica, M. kimurae, M. onukii, M. europaea, M. asiatica and M. nathorstii, are now considered to belong to a single species, namely M. occidentalis. A further valid species is M. milleri, which can be distinguished from M. occidentalis by the morphology of the male cones and the vegetative organs. 3aMetasequoia 3afossils 3aleaves 3ashoots 3aChina1 aLI, CHENG-SEN1 aWang, Yufei.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1999 July, v. 130, no. 3 p.267-297dBlackwell Publishing Ltdw43462x0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1999.tb00523.x 7aarticle02242naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245009200184300001400276520069200290650001600982650001700998650001301015650001201028650002501040650002001065650003701085650001101122650003901133650000901172650002301181650002101204650002101225650003801246650002501284650002401309653002201333700002401355700002801379700002201407773019101429852000901620856008501629930003301714946001301747655001201760IND4413729520141219000000.0081212e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441372952DNAL7 a191453582pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-008-0214-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTkachev, V.

Oxidized dextrans irrespective of molecular weight shifted the NO synthase/arginase balance towards predominance of NO production under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Administration of the test compounds to intact mice considerably increased NO synthase activity, while culturing of peritoneal macrophages in the presence of modified dextrans reduced arginase activity in these cells. These effects of oxidized dextrans create conditions for predominant stimulation of Th1-mediated immune reactions. 3amacrophages 3anitric oxide 3aarginase 2aAnimals 2aArginasexmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aDextransxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aMacrophagesxcytologyxenzymology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aMolecular Weight 2aNitric Oxide Synthasexmetabolism 2aNitritesxmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 0aoxidized dextrans1 aKolesnikova, O.

Low-protein (and phosphorus) diets can also ameliorate uremic symptoms, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and metabolic acidosis in patients with chronic renal failure. Albeit controversial, evidence also suggests that dietary protein restriction can slow the rate of progression of renal failure and the time until end-stage renal failure. These dietary regimens appear to be safe and patients with chronic renal failure are able to activate normal compensatory mechanisms designed to conserve lean body mass when dietary protein intake is restricted. When low-protein diets are prescribed, patients should be closely monitored to assess dietary compliance and to ensure nutritional adequacy. Evidence that the spontaneous intake of dietary protein decreases in patients with progressive chronic renal failure who consume unrestricted diets should not be construed as an argument against the use of low-protein diets. Rather, it is a persuasive argument to restrict dietary protein intake in order to minimize complications of renal failure while preserving nutritional status. 3adietary protein 3amalnutrition 3arestricted feeding 3amonitoring 3apatient compliance 3adiabetes 3anutritional adequacy 3arenal function 3aprotein intake 3adata analysis 3akidney diseases 3adietary supplements 3adisease course 0adiet 0aprotein restriction 0aliterature reviews 0alow protein diets 0apreventive nutrition1 aMitch, W.E.0 tAnnual review of nutrition.g1997, v. 17 p.435-455x0199-98857nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02516naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004500129300001600174500001500190520101800205650002401223650002701247650001701274650001801291650001401309650002201323650001301345650001401358650002301372650001701395650001101412650001201423650001201435650001001447650001901457650002501476653003001501653002301531653002301554653001301577653001801590653001001608653004101618653001601659653001701675653002301692653003301715653003901748653001101787773007201798852000901870930003301879945001301912946001301925655001201938IND2072997920221121044620.0980504s1997    cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207299792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtkinson, R.L.10aUse of drugs in the treatment of obesity  ap. 383-403.  a2019-12-05  aObesity has become an epidemic in the United States and in many other countries of the world. Obesity is a chronic disease, not a failure of willpower. Diet, exercise, and behavioral modification of lifestyle are rarely successful over the long term. Medications have been used sparingly, because of concerns about addiction and ineffectiveness, but used chronically, obesity drugs are effective. The two main categories of obesity drugs are centrally active adrenergic and serotonergic agents. These drugs reduce appetite, enhance satiety, and increase energy expenditure. Use of single agents produces modest weight loss and use of combinations increases loss, but few patients reach their goal weight. Co-morbidities associated with obesity resolve or are reduced in severity with weight loss. Adverse events of major concern are changes in brain biochemistry and primary pulmonary hypertension. Published guidelines for use of obesity medications recommend they be used only for medically significant obesity. 3amechanism of action 3acentral nervous system 3adrug therapy 3aenergy intake 3aserotonin 3amedical treatment 3aappetite 3amorbidity 3aenergy expenditure 3ahypertension 3aleptin 3aobesity 3asatiety 3alungs 3anorepinephrine 3anutrition physiology 0aneurotransmitter agonists 0athermogenic agents 0aliterature reviews 0apeptides 0agene products 0adrugs 0acentrally active serotonergic agents 0abody weight 0agut peptides 0aexperimental drugs 0aneurotransmitter antagonists 0acentrally active adrenergic agents 0atheory0 tAnnual review of nutrition.g1997, v. 17 p.383-403x0199-98857nnas  aDNAL  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01985naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004500126300001300171520110000184650001801284650002301302650002701325650002401352650002501376650001701401650001301418653002301431653001901454653001301473653001201486773006901498852000901567930003301576945001301609946001301622655001201635IND2054098320221121044709.0961119s1996    cau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205409832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlson, R.E.10aOn the making of a clinical nutritionist  ap. 1-32.  aClinical nutrition may be defined as the application of the principles of nutrition science and medical practice to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of human disease caused by the deficiency, excess, or metabolic imbalance of nutrients. At present, many physicians do not appreciate the great traditions established by their forebears in this field (Hippocrates, Lind, Eijkman, Glisson, Casal, Livingstone, Hopkins, and Goldberger). They have tended to avoid nutritional problems, plead ignorance of nutrition principles, and delegate the nutritional care of their patients to paramedical personnel. Only by changing this situation can members of the medical profession offer adequate care to their patients. In this chapter, I have attempted to present the duties and responsibilities of a clinical nutritionist in an academic environment. A well-trained academician in such a position can improve the education of medical students in nutrition, attract well-motivated graduates into nutrition training programs, and establish clinical nutrition as a bona fide subspecialty of medicine. 3anutritionists 3aclinical nutrition 3aprofessional education 3anutrition education 3anutrition physiology 3auniversities 3amedicine 0aliterature reviews 0aspecialization 0apractice 0acareers0 tAnnual review of nutrition.g1996, v. 16 p.1-32x0199-98857nnas  aDNAL  a19961202b19961205c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02056naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012700169300001600296520089100312592002801203650002601231650001801257650001401275650002101289650002001310650001101330650001501341650001801356650002801374650000901402650001101411650001601422700002501438773012801463856008201591852000901673655001201682IND60516395220221121172113.0190727e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639522DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797120003972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPanda, Debabrata,10aRole of non-structural carbohydrate and its catabolism associated with sub 1 qtl in rice subjected to complete submergence  ap. 502-512.  aThe present study is to characterise the non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) status and its catabolism along with elongation growth in rice cultivars either possessing or not possessing the Sub 1 quantitative trait locus (QTL), i.e. Swarna and Swarna Sub1 exposed to seven days of complete submergence. During submergence, Swarna accelerated the rate of stem and leaf elongation and rapidly consumed NSC. In contrast, Swarna Sub1 consumed energy resources more slowly and maintained similar growth rate to that of non-submerged plants. Swarna Sub1 showed better utilisation of carbohydrate than that of Swarna by progressive induction of alcohol dehydrogenase, starch phosphorylase and total and α-amylase enzyme activity during submergence. Overall, submergence tolerance conferred by the Swarna Sub1 QTL is correlated with better maintenance and utilisation of NSC than that of Swarna.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aalpha-amylase 3acultivars 3aenergy resources 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3aphosphorylase 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3astarch 3asubmergence1 aSARKAR, RAMANI KUMAR0 tExperimental agriculture.g2012 Oct., v. 48, no. 4 p.502-512dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797120003973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245016200169300001600331520156900347592002801916650001701944650000901961650001901970650001201989650002102001650002002022650002002042650001602062650002302078650001302101650000902114650001202123650001702135650000902152650002002161650001602181650001902197700001902216700001902235700001702254773008402271856008602355852000902441655001202450IND60096245920221119072252.0141104e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009624592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2011.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGurina, T.M.10aDevelopment of a cryopreservation protocol for testicular interstitial cells with the account of temperature intervals for controlled cooling below −60°С  ap. 107-114.  aA long course of anticancer therapy may lead to testicular steroidogenesis destruction. Cryopreservation of testicular interstitial cells (TIC) would be a strategy to protect hormonal and fertile potential of pre-pubertal boys treated with chemo – or radiotherapy. The aim of this research was to optimize protocols for freezing of TIC. Essential physical processes associated with the presence of dimethyl sulphoxide (Me₂SO) in the cryoprotectant solution take place at the temperatures below −60°С. These processes are the eutectic crystallization at the stage of freezing and the recrystallization before the melting of the eutectic mixture at the stage of heating. Both of the processes affect the viability of the cells subjected to cryopreservation. Temperature intervals when these processes take place were determined by the method of thermoplastic deformation for 10% Me₂SO selected for cryopreservation of TIC. Rat TIC were cryopreserved using five different protocols which varied in cooling rates within the chosen temperature intervals. Post-thaw cell viability and metabolic activity were evaluated by Trypan Blue and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining assays. Leydig cell recovery after cryopreservation was measured by 3-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reaction. Based on the obtained results, the authors developed a cryopreservation protocol for TIC which makes it possible to achieve great cell viability due to using controlled cooling rates within the temperature intervals below −60°С.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLeydig cells 3aboys 3acell viability 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3acryoprotectants 3acrystallization 3adeformation 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3afreezing 3aheat 3amelting 3aradiotherapy 3arats 3asteroidogenesis 3atemperature 3athermoplastics1 aPakhomov, A.V.1 aKyryliuk, A.L.1 aBozhok, G.A.0 tCryobiology.g2011 Apr., v. 62, no. 2 p.107-114dElsevier Inc.x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2011.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04589naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245008000207300001800287500002000305520297900325592002803304596006403332596003803396650002303434650002703457650002203484650002003506650001303526650000803539650002203547650001203569650001503581650001003596650001403606650001003620650002403630650001403654650001403668650000903682650001603691700006103707700006503768700005903833773012003892856007404012852000904086655001204095IND60788192220221117233358.0220811e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078819222DNAL7 a10.1111/fwb.139622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson‐Laing, Georgia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8337-548910aOptimised protocol for the extraction of fish DNA from freshwater sediments  ap. 1584-1603.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMonitoring fish is necessary for understanding population dynamics, tracking distribution patterns and evaluating conservation efforts. Molecular techniques targeting environmental DNA (eDNA) are now considered effective methods for detecting specific species or characterising fish communities. The analysis of DNA from lake‐surface sediments (sedDNA) can provide a time‐integrated sampling approach which reduces the variability sometimes observed in water samples. However, studies of sedDNA have had varying success in detecting fish. The present study aimed to determine the most effective extraction method for recovering fish DNA from lake‐surface sediments. A literature review was undertaken to identify DNA extraction methods used previously on aquatic sediments targeting aquatic and terrestrial animals. Five methods with various modifications were tested to establish their ability to desorb extracellular DNA. Based on these results, two methods were selected and optimised, and the recovery of fish sedDNA characterised using droplet digital PCR assays targeting eel and perch (Anguilla australis, Anguilla dieffenbachii, Perca fluviatilis). A range of sediment masses (0.25–20 g) were assessed to establish the optimal amount required to accurately assess fish sedDNA. The DNA extraction methods found to be most effective at recovering extracellular DNA spiked into small sediment masses (0.25 g) were the DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (QIAGEN), and the ABPS protocol which involved an initial alkaline buffer extraction followed by the PowerSoil extraction kit. For larger sediment masses (>0.25 g) the ABPS protocol or the DNeasy PowerMax Soil Kit (QIAGEN) with an additional ethanol DNA concentration step (PMET protocol) yielded the highest concentrations of target genes across a range of lake sediments. Larger sediment masses (≤20 g was tested) increased the likelihood of detection of fish in sedDNA. Optimisation of the ABPS protocol was required (65°C incubation temperature, pooling of multiple PowerSoil extractions) to overcome technical challenges related to co‐precipitation of organic content in lake‐surface sediments. This optimised ABPS protocol was called the “Lakes ABPS protocol”. We recommend the use of the Lakes ABPS protocol as it is cheaper than the PMET protocol. Additionally, after the first extraction step, the process can be automated on a DNA extraction robot, allowing for higher sample throughput. A mass of 10 g is suggested, although higher detection is achieved with more sediment, a suite of challenges, such as co‐precipitation of organic content, are encountered when the amount is increased. This study highlights the complexity of the extraction and detection of fish sedDNA from lake sediment, especially when it has a high organic content. We have optimised a DNA extraction method to overcome some of these complexities that can be applied to a wide range of lake sediments.  aPublisher supplied data  cNew Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment  cVictoria University of Wellington 3aAnguilla australis 3aAnguilla dieffenbachii 3aPerca fluviatilis 3acoprecipitation 3adroplets 3aeel 3aenvironmental DNA 3aethanol 3afreshwater 3alakes 3alimnology 3aperch 3apopulation dynamics 3aprotocols 3asediments 3asoil 3atemperature1 aHowarth, Jamie D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2237-97231 aVandergoes, Marcus J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7417-77471 aWood, Susie A.,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1976-82660 tFreshwater biology.g2022 Sept., v. 67, no. 9 p.1584-1603dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl1839x0046-50707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.139623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02803naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002100166245012500187300001400312520172200326592002802048653001402076653001802090653001002108653001602118700002002134700002602154700002102180700002602201773013902227856011402366852000902480655001202489IND60128231920221118133036.0151115e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823192DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[63:CAFCUI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlattner, Stefan10aClassifying and Forecasting Coastal Upwellings in Lake Michigan Using Satellite Derived Temperature Images and Buoy Data  ap. 63-76.  aCoastal upwellings are common in the Great Lakes but have lacked enumeration and systematic classification of spatial extent, frequency, duration, and magnitude. Near real-time sea surface temperature (SST) images derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) provide indices of upwelling events, but visual inspection of daily images can be tedious. Moreover, the definition of what constitutes an upwelling from AVHRR data is subjective. We developed a semi-automated method to classify upwellings during the period of thermal stratification using daily, cloud-free surface temperature charts from AVHRR SST data. Then we statistically evaluated the location, frequency, magnitude, extent, and duration of upwelling events in Lake Michigan from 1992––2000. Further, we analyzed meteorological data from the National Data Buoy Center buoys in an attempt to improve the reliability of the classification and to provide a means for future forecast of coastal upwelling. Although variable, upwelling events along the western shoreline were preceded by 4 days of southerly and west-to-north-westerly winds, while upwelling events occurring along the eastern shore were preceded by 4 days of northerly winds. Probability of an upwelling event occurring was a function of the direction-weighted wind speed, reaching a 100%% probability at direction weighted wind speeds of 11 m s⁻⁻¹ for the western shore. Probability of an upwelling occurrence along the east coast reached 73%% at 11 m s⁻⁻¹ and 100%% at 13 m s⁻⁻¹. Continuous measurements of wind data with a sufficient temporal resolution are required during the entire upwelling season to improve the predictability of upwellings.  aPublisher supplied data 0aUpwelling 0aLake Michigan 0aAVHRR 0aGreat Lakes1 aMason, Doran M.1 aLeshkevich, George A.1 aSchwab, David J.1 aRutherford, Edward S.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2006 Mar., v. 32, no. 1 p.63-76dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282006%2932%5B63%3ACAFCUI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02266naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009500168300001600263520094600279592002801225650001401253650002001267650002501287650003201312650003101344650002401375650002601399650001601425650001901441650001801460650001601478650000901494650001601503650002701519650001701546650001701563650002001580650002401600773011801624856008101742852000901823655001201832IND60519931720221117070544.0160511e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051993172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10499-015-9885-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteffens, Werner10aAquaculture produces wholesome food: cultured fish as a valuable source of n-3 fatty acids  ap. 787-802.  aLong-chain unsaturated n-3 fatty acids are of remarkable significance in human nutrition.

Aquaculture fish, e.g. cyprinids, such as silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), bighead carp (Aristichthys nobilis), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), tench (Tinca tinca), and salmonids like Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as well as European catfish (Silurus glanis), Baltic whitefish (Coregonus maraena), European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), are rich in these fatty acids. When fed on suitable diets, the fatty acid composition of cultured fish can be influenced advantageously. Several clinical tests proved the effectiveness of the consumption of farmed fish in promoting human health. Thus, aquaculture fish can be recommended as wholesome food.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoregonus 3aCyprinus carpio 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aHypophthalmichthys molitrix 3aHypophthalmichthys nobilis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aSalmo salar 3aSilurus glanis 3aSparus aurata 3aTinca tinca 3adiet 3afarmed fish 3afatty acid composition 3afish culture 3ahuman health 3ahuman nutrition 3aomega-3 fatty acids0 tAquaculture international.g2016 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.787-802dSpringer International Publishingx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-015-9885-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03004naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245023300154300001800387520168900405592002802094650002402122650003002146650001102176650001202187650002002199650002702219650001302246650002002259650001902279700001902298700001602317700001402333700001802347700002002365700001302385773012502398856007402523852000902597655001202606IND60662759220221120044517.0190906e20140818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275922DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00676c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Bei13aAn environmentally benign, mild, and catalyst-free reaction of quinones with heterocyclic ketene aminals in ethanol: site-selective synthesis of rarely fused [1,2-a]indolone derivatives via an unexpected anti-Nenitzescu strategy  ap. 4359-4370.  aAs a classical and well-established named reaction, the Nenitzescu reaction is of special value for the construction of biologically meaningful 5-hydroxyindole derivatives. However, to date, its sister, the anti-Nenitzescu reaction and the corresponding synthetic methodology for 3a-hydroxy-indol-6-one derivatives, has remained an unexplored area. We discovered herein an environmentally benign, mild, and catalyst-free reaction in ethanol for the site-selective construction of rarely fused [1,2-a]indolone derivatives (3) from quinones (1) and heterocyclic ketene aminals (HKAs) (2) via an unexpected anti-Nenitzescu strategy. This unconventional methodology suggests that it will be suitable for the site-selective synthesis of 3a-hydroxy-indol-6-one derivatives from a green perspective. On the other hand, the developed target compounds 3 have a promising future for the further synthesis of aromatic 6-hydroxyindoles or dehydroxylated indol-6-ones in situ. In order to systematically elucidate the mechanistic details and controlling factors of the two Nenitzescu reactions, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also performed. According to the computational results, the origin of site-selectivity can be explained by the following reasons: all energy barriers for the anti-Nenitzescu reaction can be overcome at room temperature, yet the extremely high energy barrier of imine–enamine tautomerization for the Nenitzescu reaction indicates its failure under the same conditions. The reduced density gradient (RDG) analysis hinted that the greater thermodynamic stability of the Nenitzescu product 3h′ mainly depends on the release of the strong steric effect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aethanol 3agreen chemistry 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aquinones 3atautomerization 3athermodynamics1 aLiu, Zhi-Cheng1 aQu, Wen-Wen1 aYang, Rui1 aLin, Xin-Rong1 aYan, Sheng-Jiao1 aLin, Jun0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 16, no. 9 p.4359-4370dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00676c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02200naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007700163300001600240520113200256592002801388650002101416650001201437650000901449650000901458650002001467650002001487650000901507650000701516650002401523650001301547653002901560653003101589653001801620773009501638856008401733852000901817655001201826IND60479758420221118071809.0160123e20060301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047975842DNAL7 a10.1556/AAlim.35.2006.1.122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSzamos, J.10aBehaviour of carp proteins and corn proteins in three-phase partitioning  ap. 109-116.  aIn three-phase partitioning (TPP) ammonium sulphate and 2-methyl-2-propanol (tert-butanol) are used for separation of proteins by collecting and concentrating them into the middle layer or third phase of the system. During the last two decades, TPP has been primarily applied to enzyme purification at laboratory scale, however, its analytical type application for investigating meat has also been reported. Here, an experimental set of TPP feasible to analytical scale experiments is described to study partitioning behaviour of carp and corn proteins. In partitioning experiments, corn proteins extractable with borate buffer, and sarcoplasmic proteins of carp were investigated. In the pH-range of 4.8-7.9, composition of partitioned corn proteins showed independence of pH as it was indicated by nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEpHGE) patterns. In case of carp, the alterations of protein composition in the pH-range of 3.7-8.0 unambiguously indicated the pH-dependent partitioning of carp proteins. The analytical scale method, based on three-phase partitioning is a new approach to investigate food proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium sulfate 3aborates 3acarp 3acorn 3adietary protein 3aelectrophoresis 3ameat 3apH 3aprotein composition 3aproteins 0athree-phase partitioning 0acarp sarcoplasmic proteins 0acorn proteins0 tActa alimentaria.g2006 Mar. 1, v. 35, no. 1 p.109-116dAkadémiai Kiadóx0139-30067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556%2FAAlim.35.2006.1.123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03629naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245010400182300001600286520160100302592002801903650002501931650002801956650002301984650001702007650002002024650001802044650001702062650001202079650001602091650005202107650001102159650001502170650002302185650001202208650005902220650003202279650003902311650003702350650002902387650003202416650003002448650002502478650003002503650003402533650008002567650003102647650004902678650003602727650000902763650002202772700001702794700001802811700001702829773010002846856004802946852000902994655001203003IND4484457420221123025724.0120317e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448445742DNAL7 a219319712pmid7 a10.1007/s00441-011-1232-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhang, Gilson10aNeurogenesis of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells onto β-mercaptoethanol-loaded PLGA film  ap. 713-724.  aBone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are of particular interest in the field of tissue engineering because of their potential to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and neuronal cells. In order to promote the differentiation of BMSCs into specific cell types, appropriate scaffold biomaterials and bioactive molecules that can support the differentiation of BMSCs into specific cell types are needed. We hypothesized that β-mercaptoethanol (BME), which has been reported to induce the differentiation of BMSCs into neural-like cells, promotes BMSCs to differentiate into neural-like cells when BME is added to polymeric scaffolds containing the BMSCs. We fabricated biocompatible film shaped scaffolds composed of poly(lacti-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) and various concentrations of BME to confirm that BME-promoted differentiation of BMSCs is concentration-dependent. Cell proliferation increased as the BME concentration in the films increased at the early stage, and the proliferation rate remained similar on the PLGA films for 3 weeks following the BMSC seeding. The expression of neuronal markers in differentiated BMSCs was assessed by RT-PCR. At 2- and 3-week time-points, mRNA expression of neurofilament and neuron specific enolase was significantly increased in PLGA/BME films containing 400 μM BME compared to PLGA films. Thus, we have identified BMSC-seeded PLGA/BME films with 200 μM and 400 μM BME as potentially useful candidates for neural tissue engineering applications by promoting BMSC proliferation and differentiation towards neural-like cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abiocompatible materials 3acell proliferation 3achondrocytes 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aneurogenesis 3aneurons 3aosteoblasts 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asowing 3astem cells 3atissue engineering 2aAnimals 2aBone Marrow Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCell Adhesionxdrug effects 2aCell Differentiationxdrug effects 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Shapexdrug effects 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aElectrophoresis, Agar Gel 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aLactic Acidxpharmacology 2aMercaptoethanolxpharmacology 2aMesenchymal Stem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aNeurogenesisxdrug effects 2aNeuronsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPolyglycolic Acidxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Inbred F3441 aKim, Hye Lin1 aHong, Minsung1 aLee, Dongwon0 tCell and tissue research.g2012 Mar., v. 347, no. 3 p.713-724dSpringer-Verlagx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-011-1232-4  aDNAL 7aarticle02497naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245008400187300001600271520131000287592002801597650002701625650002501652650001301677650000901690650001501699650001201714650001501726650001301741650001201754650001701766650001301783650002401796700002401820700003401844700001801878773008901896856010501985852000902090655001202099IND60131231620221119003040.0160903e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123162DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[803:GAROAC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobler, Mark A.10aGrowth and reproduction of a clonal plant in response to salinity and florivory  ap. 803-812.  aSalinity is increasing in wetland ecosystems, but the consequences for ecological communities are poorly understood. Iris hexagona is the only North American iris that survives in brackish marsh. Environmental salinity affects the physiology, growth, and reproduction of this glycophytic perennial, as well as plant-herbivore interactions. In brackish wetlands, 80% of iris flowers are consumed by whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), which rarely browse flowers in freshwater habitats. We investigated the effects of florivory and salinity on I. hexagona sexual and clonal reproduction. Irises that were protected from deer produced 20 times more mature seed capsules than unprotected plants. Experimental floral browsing increased both belowground clonal growth by 30% (P = 0.0003) and flower production the following year by 16% (P = 0.112). Iris populations differed significantly in clonal reproduction (P = 0.004), and interactions between salinity and population affected clonal (P = 0.005) and sexual (P = 0.054) output, suggesting that populations may be differentially adapted to environmental salinity. Brackish conditions can promote floral browsing and loss of sexual reproduction, but plants such as I. hexagona can compensate by allocating more resources to belowground clonal growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3aasexual reproduction 3abrowsing 3adeer 3aecosystems 3aflowers 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3amarshes 3aplant growth 3asalinity 3asexual reproduction1 aVan Zandt, Peter A.1 aHasenstein, K.

Widespread use of this compound has led to the elevated concentrations of diuron in groundwater and wastewater. The main objectives of this study were to investigate biodegradation of diuron by Pseudomonas aeruginosa FN and evolved degradation product, 3,4‐dichloroanilines (3,4‐DCA). The influence of temperature, initial optical density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa FN and initial diuron concentration were examined to further optimize biodegradation of diuron, and the effect of these factors were investigated by the response surface methodology (RSM) and full factorial design (FFD). The optimal biodegradation conditions were obtained at T = 25°C, γ (diuron) = 0.5 mg/L and initial optical density of 0.2. The biodegradation kinetic of diuron was described by Monod model and the obtained value of F‐test was grater that 0.96 which showed good correlation between Monod model and experimental results.  aPublisher supplied data  cModelling of Environmental Aspects of Advanced Water Treatment for Degradation of Priority Pollutants (MEAoWT) (IP‐09‐2014‐7992). 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aabsorbance 3abiodegradation 3adiuron 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3amodels 3aresponse surface methodology 3atemperature 3awastewater1 aOcelić Bulatović, Vesna1 aCvetnić, Matija1 aDujmić Vučinić, Željka1 aVuković Domanovac, Marija1 aMarkić, Marinko1 aBolanča, Tomislav0 tWater and environment journal.g2020 Dec., v. 34 Suppl S1 p.61-73dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3949847x1747-65857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wej.125053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03628naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245010300187300001600290520190800306592002802214650001802242650002102260650002402281650001402305650002202319650001702341650002402358650002102382650002002403650001002423650001602433650002102449650001602470650001702486650001202503650001402515650001402529650001402543650002702557650002302584650000902607650002502616650001102641650001602652650001002668650001802678650002102696700001602717700002102733700002502754700001902779700002502798773008902823856010502912852000903017655001203026IND60131231820221119002745.0160903e200609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123182DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[830:ROTTSC]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, David T.10aResponses of twelve tree species common in Everglades tree islands to simulated hydrologic regimes  ap. 830-844.  aTwelve tree species common in Everglades tree islands were subjected to three hydrologic regimes under controlled conditions for 25 weeks and assessed for growth and physiological responses. Treatments representing high, low, and no flood were maintained in pools of water to mimic seasonal variation in water depths at different positions in tree islands. Soil inundation under the high flood treatment resulted in reduced tree growth (height, basal diameter, crown volume) that was more pronounced and occurred earlier in mesic forest species than in swamp forest species. Physiological responses differed less among species, although stomatal conductance was a better predictor of the effects of flood stress on growth than either relative water content or chlorophyll fluorescence (Fᵥ/Fₘ). Some swamp species appeared to be better adapted to rising water levels than others; Annona glabra, Morella cerifera, and Salix caroliniana responded more positively to flooding, while Magnolia virginiana, Persea borbonia, Chrysobalanus icaco, and Ilex cassine were less flood-tolerant. The highest mortalities and lowest growth were observed in the five upland species: Bursera simaruba, Coccoloba diversifolia, Eugenia axillaris, Sideroxylon foetidissimum, and Simarouba glauca. Of these, Sideroxylon and Simarouba did not survive to the end of the study under the high flood treatment. The moist soil conditions simulated by the low flood treatment resulted in greater growth in all species compared to soil inundation under high flood, except for the most flood-tolerant (Annona, Morella, Salix). The arrangement of species according to their responses to experimental flooding roughly paralleled their spatial distribution in the tree islands. The gradient in species responses demonstrated in this experiment may help guide responsible water management and tree island restoration in the Everglades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnnona glabra 3aBursera simaruba 3aChrysobalanus icaco 3aCoccoloba 3aEugenia axillaris 3aIlex cassine 3aMagnolia virginiana 3aMorella cerifera 3aPersea borbonia 3aSalix 3aSideroxylon 3aSimarouba glauca 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aforests 3ahighlands 3ahydrology 3amortality 3aphysiological response 3aseasonal variation 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3aswamps 3atree growth 3atrees 3awater content 3awater management1 aSah, Jay P.1 aRoss, Michael S.1 aOberbauer, Steven F.1 aHwang, Bernice1 aJayachandran, K.

A remarkable example of this cognitive phenotypic plasticity is often observed when comparing individuals raised in a barren environment to individuals raised in an enriched environment. Evidence of enrichment-driven cognitive plasticity in teleost fish continues to grow, but it remains restricted to a few cognitive traits. The purpose of this study was to investigate how environmental enrichment affects multiple cognitive traits (learning, cognitive flexibility, and inhibitory control) in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. To reach this goal, we exposed new-born guppies to different treatments: an enrichment environment with social companions, natural substrate, vegetation, and live prey or a barren environment with none of the above. After a month of treatment, we tested the subjects in a battery of three cognitive tasks. Guppies from the enriched environment learned a color discrimination faster compared to guppies from the environment with no enrichments. We observed no difference between guppies of the two treatments in the cognitive flexibility task, requiring selection of a previously unrewarded stimulus, nor in the inhibitory control task, requiring the inhibition of the attack response toward live prey. Overall, the results indicated that environmental enrichment had an influence on guppies’ learning ability, but not on the remaining cognitive functions investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3acognition 3acolor 3aenvironmental enrichment 3afish 3aphenotypic plasticity 3avegetation1 aBertolucci, Cristiano 1 aLucon-Xiccato, Tyrone 0 tBiology.g2022 Jan. 02, v. 11, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21557x2079-77377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology110100643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245019200190300001600382520177900398592002802177653003402205653002702239653002102266653002602287700002002313700001802333700002402351773014102375856011502516852000902631655001202640IND60128232320221118133052.0151115e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823232DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[209:ARSOPB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDrouillard, Ken G.12aA River-wide Survey of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs), Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), and Selected Organochlorine Pesticide Residues in Sediments of the Detroit River——1999  ap. 209-226.  aThe spatial distribution of hydrophobic organic contaminants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and octachlorostyrene (OCS) in sediments of the Detroit River was established using data from a 1999 river-wide survey. The survey employed a stratified random sampling design that divided the river into six geostatistical zones consisting of upper, middle, and lower U.S. and equivalent Canadian river reaches. Organic carbon normalized OCS sediment concentrations demonstrated no significant differences between U.S. or Canadian sediments or upstream/downstream gradients suggesting that OCS is derived primarily from sources upstream of the Detroit River. In contrast, sum PCBs and sum PAHs were significantly elevated at U.S. as compared to Canadian stations and demonstrated significant increasing upstream/downstream gradients in organic carbon normalized sediment contamination. The upper and middle U.S. river reaches contained a number of near-shore stations with high localized PCB and PAH sediment concentrations suggesting multiple inputs along the upper U.S. portion of the river. Consistent with past surveys, wide-spread sediment contamination of PCBs and PAHs continues to be observed in the highly industrialized Trenton Channel and downstream of Grosse Isle. Threshold effect level (TEL) sediment quality guidelines for PAHs and PCBs were exceeded in 92.6 and 77.8%%, respectively, of stations in Trenton Channel and downstream of Grosse Isle. This large reservoir of degraded sediments in the lower U.S. river reach has the potential to enter Lake Erie during sediment disturbance events and likely contributes to gentoxic stress and increased bioaccumulation of PCBs in resident benthos, fish, and wildlife.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPersistent organic pollutants 0acontaminated sediments 0aAreas of Concern 0aRemedial Action Plans1 aTomczak, Maciek1 aReitsma, Stan1 aHaffner, G.

This study evaluated mulching maize stover, intercropping maize with soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) and desmodium (Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb.), and integration of mulching and intercropping for their effectiveness in reducing damage of Microtermes spp mainly Microtermes vadschaggae Sjostedt and Microtermes adschaggae (Sjosted) to maize. Five termite management treatments and a control (sole maize) were arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replicates on 2 farm sites in 2016 and 7 sites in 2017 cropping seasons in Sibu Sire and Gudeya Billa. Results indicated that application of maize stover as mulch combined with animal manure, maize-soybean intercrops and wood ash, maize-desmodium intercrops, and mulching combined with maize-soybean intercrops consistently reduced termite damage to maize in both cropping seasons. These results were comparable to application of Diazinon 60% EC (standard check). In addition, intercropping maize with desmodium, mulching + intercropping maize with soybean, and Diazinon 60% EC reduced the number of lodged plants per plot compared to control. Maize grain yield in treated plots was significantly higher than maize monocrop control. In order to reduce termite damage and to enhance maize productivity, mulching using maize stover, and intercropping of maize with soybean or desmodium can be used in termite prone areas of western Ethiopia and other countries in Africa with similar agroecologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDesmodium intortum 3aGlycine max 3aMicrotermes 3aZea mays 3aanimal manures 3abiotic factors 3acontinuous cropping 3acorn 3acorn stover 3adiazinon 3afarms 3agrain yield 3aintercropping 3amulching 3asires 3asoybeans 3awood ash 3aEthiopia 0aDesmodium 0aIntercropping 0aMaize 0aMulch 0aTermite1 aMendesil, Esayas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9915-643X1 aDiro, Debela1 aTefera, Tadele1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6373-08420 tCrop protection.g2019 Oct., v. 124 p.104723-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34114x0261-21947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2019.01.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245021400160506011700374506007600491520099500567592002801562506003701590650001401627650001601641650001901657650001901676650002401695650001501719650003401734650002501768653006301793653002401856653001401880653002101894653001301915653002501928653001001953653000701963653000801970653000801978653000701986653000901993653000802002653000702010653000802017653000802025653001002033653000802043653000802051653000902059653000802068653000902076700001802085700001502103700001502118700001702133700001702150700001502167700001702182700001802199700001502217700001402232700001502246700001602261773011202277856008202389852000902471655001202480IND60754688620221207134753.0220621e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075468862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2021.1048052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yue10aPolyphenol-rich fraction from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak attenuates the myocardial ischemia injury in mice induced by isoproterenol through inhibiting apoptosis, antioxidation and activating PI3K/AKT pathway  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThymus quinquecostatus Celak, a kind of food additive and folk medicine, has obvious antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. However, there have been no reports about the cardioprotective effects of polyphenol-rich fraction from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak (TCPRF). Here, we predicted the targets and pathways of TCPRF related to myocardial ischemia (MI) using network pharmacology, and examined the effects as well as the mechanisms of TCPRF in ISO-induced MI mice. The results verified that TCPRF could decrease the serum CK level, improve ECG and the pathological alterations of myocardium. TCPRF also increased SOD activity, decreased MDA content, reduced the positive apoptotic cells, decreased the expression of Bax, and increase the expression of Bcl-2, PI3K and p-AKT in the myocardium. These results demonstrated that TCPRF was able to alleviate ISO-induced MI injury, which is partly related to inhibiting myocardium apoptosis, antioxidation and activating PI3K/AKT pathway.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3ablood serum 3afood additives 3aisoproterenols 3amyocardial ischemia 3amyocardium 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3atraditional medicine 0aPolyphenol-rich fraction from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak 0aMyocardial ischemia 0aApoptosis 0aOxidative stress 0aPI3K/AKT 0aNetwork pharmacology 0aTCPRF 0aMI 0aCVD 0aISO 0aMT 0ai.p. 0aHPE 0aCK 0aMDA 0aSOD 0aBcl-2 0aBax 0aROS 0aPI3K 0aAKT 0aNrf21 aFan, Shusheng1 aNiu, Fenxi1 aLiu, Yanan1 aLiu, Xiaoyun1 aRen, Xueyang1 aYang, Yuan1 aFan, Guifang1 aDong, Huiling1 aShen, Meng1 aSui, Hong1 aFang, Fang1 aShe, Gaimei0 tJournal of functional foods.g2021 Dec., v. 87 p.104805-dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.1048053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01464naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245010200158300001800260520036200278592002800640650001600668650001400684650002300698650001900721650001300740650002000753650001800773650001600791650001400807650001300821650001400834700002100848700001300869773012500882856007401007852000901081655001201090IND60662759620221123043741.0190906e20140624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275962DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00723a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCho, Hong-je,10aBase free, one-pot synthesis of lactic acid from glycerol using a bifunctional Pt/Sn-MFI catalyst  ap. 3428-3433.  aUnder base free and mild reaction conditions, 80.5% selectivity of lactic acid (LA) was achieved at 89.8% conversion of glycerol using a bifunctional Pt/Sn-MFI catalyst.

This paper aimed to contribute to the discussion on the feasibility of offshore aquaculture development and its potential for multi-use with other maritime activities. A review of national and international projects forms the basis of the paper, where the Dutch North Sea is used as a case-study area. Analysis of technical, economic and ecological boundaries indicated that the potential of fish culture is limited, that seaweed cultivation is likely to gain potential when challenges related to processing will be overcome and that mussel culture has the highest potential in the near future. The North Sea is an area where many stakeholders claim space, which might set boundaries to the number of sites available for mussel culture. Competing claims are a potential source of conflict but may also lead to mutual benefits when smart combinations are sought, e.g. with wind parks, fisheries and nature conservation; especially, the possibility of combining mussel culture in or around wind parks is worthwhile to be further explored. A spatial distribution model adapted for the Dutch North Sea conditions demonstrated that offshore mussel production in wind farms can be profitable. Yet, the commercial interest for offshore development of mussel culture is still limited. Actions required to stimulate further development of the offshore mussel industry are presented for the government, the private sector, research institutes and civil society organizations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish culture 3afisheries 3amodels 3amollusc culture 3amussels 3anatural resources conservation 3aprivate sector 3aseaweed culture 3asociety 3astakeholders 3awind farms 3aNorth Sea1 aVan Den Burg, Sander1 aBolman, Bas1 aJak, Robbert G.1 aKamermans, Pauline1 aPoelman, Marnix1 aStuiver, Marian0 tAquaculture international.g2016 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.735-756dSpringer International Publishingx0967-61207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10499-016-9987-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002200167245018200189300001600371520191100387592002802298653001902326653001702345653001402362653002502376653002002401653002402421700002202445773014102467856011502608852000902723655001202732IND60128232520221118133024.0151115e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823252DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[242:DPGSOS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorden, W. Calvin10aDiscordant Population Genetic Structuring of Smallmouth Bass, Micropterus dolomieu Lacepèède, in Lake Erie Based on Mitochondrial DNA Sequences and Nuclear DNA Microsatellites  ap. 242-257.  aThe population genetic structure of smallmouth bass, Micropterus dolomieu, in Lake Erie was investigated using two mitochondrial DNA sequences (control region and cytochrome b) and eight nuclear DNA microsatellite loci. The objective was to evaluate relative resolution of fine-scale versus broad-scale spawning population genetic structure across Lake Erie. Results showed that only cytochrome b sequences supported the divergence of populations grouped by basins, suggesting little correspondence to bathymetric features of Lake Erie. The majority of sampling sites were characterized by large within site variances, particularly with the microsatellite data, reducing the efficiency to delimit populations with the given sample sizes. Although conclusions from mtDNA and microsatellites were not corroborative, all data sets revealed some divergent sites across and within basins. The apparently weak genetic structuring of populations does not reflect the strong behavioral patterns of male nest-site fidelity and adult migration. Finer-scale structure among geographically proximate sites was detected primarily with microsatellite data. Several locations were consistently identified as most genetically divergent suggesting that they may serve as long-term attractor areas for spawning populations. Mitochondrial DNA data indicated a broader-scale pattern reflecting either colonization from at least two glacial refugia or different dispersal routes from a common refugium with subsequent genetic divergence through drift. Genetic variation of smallmouth bass in Lake Erie is likely a product of glacial history with behavioral and stochastic factors interacting at different spatial and temporal scales. A precautionary management approach would weigh both genetic and behavioral patterns and develop appropriate conservation strategies for a non-panmictic smallmouth bass population in Lake Erie.  aPublisher supplied data 0aControl region 0acytochrome b 0aLake Erie 0aMicropterus dolomieu 0amicrosatellites 0apopulation genetics1 aStepien, Carol A.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2006 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.242-257dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282006%2932%5B242%3ADPGSOS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013900172300001800311520180600329592002802135650002302163650001502186650002102201650003002222650001702252650001302269650001802282650001602300650000902316650001402325650001302339650001302352650001602365650002202381650001902403650002502422650001402447650002602461650001102487650002302498700006202521700002502583700002202608700002202630700006102652700006502713773012902778856008402907852000902991655001203000IND60655800420190927000000.0190807e20190624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065580042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b007732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVander Ende, Emma10aPhysicochemical Trapping of Neurotransmitters in Polymer-Mediated Gold Nanoparticle Aggregates for Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy  ap. 9554-9562.  aBecause of the sharp distance dependence of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), analyte molecules that do not exhibit strong affinity for Au/Ag often elude detection. New methods of integrating such analytes with SERS substrates are required to circumvent this limitation and expand the sensitivity of SERS to new molecules and applications. We communicate here a solution-phase, capture agent-free method of aggregating Au nanospheres in the presence of five neurotransmitters (dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine) and preventing sedimentation by encapsulating the aggregated nanospheres with polyvinylpyrrolidone, thereby trapping the neurotransmitters in close proximity to the Au nanospheres and enabling SER detection. The primary advantages of this physicochemical trapping method, which is generalizable to analytes beyond the scope of this work, are the high signal-to-noise ratio and spectral consistency down to nM levels. Normal Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations corroborate the accuracy of the spectra. Spectra collected over a wide range of concentrations were used to construct adsorption isotherms for all five neurotransmitters, from which adsorption dissociation constants were calculated, spanning from 5.7 × 10–⁴ M to 1.7 × 10–¹⁰ M. We expect this method to produce high quality SER spectra of any molecule with an Au affinity known or expected (based on functional groups) to be within that range. Our results have implications for plasmonic detection of these neurotransmitters, particularly for mixtures of those that exhibited disparate Au affinity in our study. We also present evidence that this method produces spectra of sufficient resolution to explore hypotheses related to surface adsorption behavior.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3achemical species 3adensity functional theory 3adissociation 3adopamine 3aencapsulation 3aepinephrine 3agold 3ahistamine 3amoieties 3ananogold 3ananospheres 3aneurotransmitters 3anorepinephrine 3apolyvinylpyrrolidone 3aserotonin 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asilver 3asorption isotherms1 aBourgeois, Marc R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9435-90511 aHenry, Anne-Isabelle1 aChávez, Jorge L.1 aKrabacher, Rachel1 aSchatz, George C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5837-47401 aVan Duyne, Richard P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8861-22280 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 June 24, v. 91, no. 15 p.9554-9562dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b007733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04432naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245014400167300001800311520193600329536050102265592002802766596016302794596013502957596009803092596009103190596007803281596007703359650002603436650001203462650001603474650001903490650005003509650001903559650001503578650001803593650002503611650001603636651002003652700002303672700001803695700001703713773013803730856008503868852000903953655001203962IND60634488720221117225727.0190323e20190418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448872DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.15385832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Xiaoju10aDiel variability of vertical distributions of chlorophyll a at the SEATS and ALOHA stations: implications on remote sensing interpretations  ap. 2916-2935.  aThe effects of the diel (involving a 24 hour period) variations in the surface concentrations of chlorophyll a (C) on the use of once-daily remotely sensed C as the diel average were assessed from the diel records in the derived depth-weighted C (Cd) that should be detected by remote sensing and the in situ surface C at two time-series stations in the North Pacific: the SEATS (SouthEast Asian Time-series Study) station in the northern South China Sea and the ALOHA (A Long-Term Oligotrophic Habitat Assessment) station in the North Pacific subtropical gyre. In situ surface C varied by a factor of about 2.0 and 1.3 over a diel cycle, and by ±20% and ±9% over the diel average at the SEATS and ALOHA stations, respectively. As the overpass-times of the different satellites were not identical, Cd was satellite-dependent. While the Cd corresponding to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on Aqua (MODIS-Aqua) and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) overpass-times agreed to ±10%, the Cd corresponding to MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) overpass-time could differ from the other two by −22% to +28% at the SEATS station and −1% to +12% at the ALOHA station. In addition, Cd corresponding to the overpass-times of the three satellites deviated from the observed diel average in situ surface C by −19% to +32% at the SEATS station and by −6% to +13% at the ALOHA station. These results indicate that, as a result of diel variations, neither a one-time remotely-sensed nor a one-time observed in situ surface C can represent the diel average in situ surface C accurately. Furthermore, diel variations are an inherent source of uncertainty when data from multiple satellites are pooled for use. The magnitudes of these discrepancies can be comparable to the commonly claimed uncertainties in remotely sensed C and thus should be taken into consideration in its interpretation and use.  aThis work was supported by the Academia Sinica [Atmospheric Forcing on Ocean Biogeochemistry (AFOB,Ocean Acidification: Comparative biogeochemistry i];Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan [NSC100-2611-M-001-001,NSC98-2611-M-001-004-MY3];National Natural Science Foundation of China [41630966];Ocean University of China [201512011,201513037];Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology [2016ASKJ02];Department of Science and Technology of Shandong Province [2015GSF117017];  aPublisher supplied data  aAtmospheric Forcing on Ocean Biogeochemistry (AFOBaOcean Acidification: Comparative biogeochemistry icAcademia Sinicadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001869  aNSC100-2611-M-001-001aNSC98-2611-M-001-004-MY3cMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwandhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004663  a41630966cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  a201512011a201513037cOcean University of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004195  a2016ASKJ02cQingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology  a2015GSF117017cKey Research and Development Program of Shandong Province 3abiological assessment 3acadmium 3achlorophyll 3aimage analysis 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3aspectrometers 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 3aSouth China Sea1 aWong, George T.

Dysregulation of the host responses to LPS can lead to a systemic inflammatory condition named sepsis. In a typical scenario, activation of TLR4 is preceded by binding of LPS to CD14 protein anchored in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich microdomains of the plasma membrane called rafts. CD14 then transfers the LPS to the TLR4/MD-2 complex which dimerizes and triggers MyD88- and TRIF-dependent production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. The TRIF-dependent signaling is linked with endocytosis of the activated TLR4, which is controlled by CD14. In addition to CD14, other raft proteins like Lyn tyrosine kinase of the Src family, acid sphingomyelinase, CD44, Hsp70, and CD36 participate in the TLR4 signaling triggered by LPS and non-microbial endogenous ligands. In this review, we summarize the current state of the knowledge on the involvement of rafts in TLR4 signaling, with an emphasis on how the raft proteins regulate the TLR4 signaling pathways. CD14-bearing rafts, and possibly CD36-rich rafts, are believed to be preferred sites of the assembly of a multimolecular complex which mediates the endocytosis of activated TLR4.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aToll-like receptor 4 3acytokines 3aendocytosis 3ainterferons 3aligands 3alipopolysaccharides 3aplasma membrane 3asepsis (infection) 3asignal transduction 3atyrosine1 aHromada-Judycka, Aneta1 aBorzęcka, Kinga1 aKwiatkowska, Katarzyna0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2015 Feb., v. 72, no. 3 p.557-581dSpringer BaselwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-014-1762-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004400110040001800154100002400172245010800196300001600304500002000320520112400340592002801464650001401492650002001506650002701526650001601553650001701569650001001586650001101596650003301607650001501640650001801655650001201673650002501685650001401710650001201724650001401736650001801750650001201768650001301780650001201793650001801805650004401823650001901867650006301886650006201949650002802011650002602039700001802065700001802083700001902101773011802120852000902238856009002247655001202337IND2196322020221117080838.0160528e199811  ksu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219632202DNAL7 a98648552pmid7 a10.1111/j.1550-7408.1998.tb04562.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPllparampil, Nicole10aEncephalitozoon hellem in Two Eclectus Parrots (Eclectus roratus): Identification from Archival Tissues  ap. 651-655.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMembers of the phylum Microspora are obligate, intracellular, single‐celled parasites identified in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. Only a few cases of microsporidial infections have been documented in psittacine birds including peach‐faced, masked, and Fischer's lovebirds (Agapornis roseicollis, A. personata, and A. fischeri. respectively), budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus), and a double yellow‐headed Amazon parrot (Amazona ochrocephala). Parasite identification has typically been limited to phylum or genus, and no avian species of microsporidia has clearly been described. In this report, microsporidia were identified in the kidney and intestine of a new host, the eclectus parrot (Eclectus roratus). Parasites were identified as Encephalitozoon hellem using morphologic, ultrastructural, and small subunit ribosomal RNA gene sequence data obtained from archived tissues. This parasite species was first identified in immunocompromised humans and may be a potential zoonotic pathogen. The epidemiology and prevalence of this parasite in humans and birds should be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgapornis 3aAmazona oratrix 3aEncephalitozoon hellem 3abudgerigars 3aepidemiology 3ahosts 3ahumans 3aimmunocompromised population 3aintestines 3ainvertebrates 3akidneys 3anucleotide sequences 3aparasites 3aparrots 3apathogens 3aribosomal RNA 3atissues 3azoonoses 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBird Diseasesxparasitologyxpathology. 2aDNA, Protozoan 2aEncephalitozoonxclassificationxgeneticsxultrastructure. 2aEncephalitozoonosisxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aParrotsxparasitology1 aGraham, David1 aPhalen, David1 aSnowden, Karen0 tjournal of eukaryotic microbiology.g1998 Nov., v. 45, no. 6 p.651-655dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1066-52347nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1550-7408.1998.tb04562.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03695naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245009300205300001600298520199000314592002802304650001302332650002102345650001002366650002002376650001602396650001902412650002802431650002202459650002102481650001302502650001102515650001402526650001702540650001702557650001302574650002402587653002202611653001102633653002302644653003002667653001602697700005902713700002102772700002102793700001702814700001602831700001602847700001802863700001602881700001802897773011002915856008303025852000903108655001203117IND60629742220221121043638.0200103e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Wandong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6857-425210aAssociation of total cholesterol with severe acute pancreatitis: A U-shaped relationship  ap. 250-257.  aThere is no consensus on relationship between total cholesterol levels and incidence of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between total cholesterol (TC) and the disease severity of acute pancreatitis.We conducted a cross-sectional study on patients with acute pancreatitis between April 2012 and December 2015 in a university hospital. Fasting blood total cholesterol (TC) was assayed within 24 h of admission, as well as 3–5 days, 7–9 days and 13–15 days during hospitalization. Time interval before admission, age, gender, Body Mass Index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption, smoking, etiology and albumin were recorded as potential confounding factors. To assess the pattern of relationship of TC and SAP, we used restricted cubic spline analysis with multivariable logistic regression analysis. We also compared total cholesterol concentrations between patients with or without SAP at different time points.648 patients (median age: 47.5 years; 62.4% man) were enrolled. The incidence of SAP was 10%. A U-shaped association of TC level within 24 h of admission with severity was observed in acute pancreatitis. Patients with low TC levels (<160 mg/dL) and high TC levels (>240 mg/dL) had a significantly higher incidence of SAP and protracted hospital stays when compared to moderate TC levels (160–240 mg/dL). Low total cholesterol levels (OR 2.72; 95 %eCI 1.27–5.83; P = 0.01) and high total cholesterol levels (OR 2.54; 95 %eCI 1.09–5.89; P = 0.03), were still independently associated with development of SAP after adjusting for potential confounding factors. Longitudinal cohort study indicated that patients with SAP had lower total cholesterol concentrations among 3–15 days after admission compared to patients without SAP (P < 0.001).Both low TC level (<160 mg/dL) and high TC (>240 mg/dL) within 24 h of admission is independently associated with an increased risk of SAP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalbumins 3aalcohol drinking 3ablood 3abody mass index 3acholesterol 3acohort studies 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes mellitus 3adisease severity 3aetiology 3agender 3ahospitals 3ahypertension 3apancreatitis 3apatients 3aregression analysis 0aTotal cholesterol 0aLipids 0aAcute pancreatitis 0aSevere acute pancreatitis 0aRisk factor1 aZimmer, Vincent1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6298-47171 aBasharat, Zarrin1 aZippi, Maddalena1 aStock, Simon1 aGeng, Wujun1 aBao, Xueqin1 aDong, Junfeng1 aPan, Jingye1 aZhou, Mengtao0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.250-257dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02337naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003500148245011700183300001600300500001100316520102100327592002801348650002101376650001201397650002101409650002201430650001701452650002201469650001201491650001301503650000901516650000901525650001201534651001001546700002501556700005901581700002001640700002101660773014201681856008301823852000901906655001201915IND60795045320221119100022.0220929e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079504532DNAL7 a10.1007/s10342-022-01490-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXifré-Salvadó, Miquel Àngel10aRe-ignitions and soil importance on wildfire risk and management research proposals in a Mediterranean ecosystem  ap. 753-767.  aReview  aThis study was conducted following the fires that took place in Rocallaura (Spain) between 23/06/2016 and 19/07/2017. The aim is to analyse the importance of soil on forest planning and management mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of forest fire re-ignitions on risk and management framework. The main factors found to influence the occurrence of re-ignitions in a forest ecosystem dominated by Pinus halepensis were weather conditions, possible future climatic changes, soil and subsoil biomass amount and the physico-chemical properties of the organic layer. The re-ignition dynamics were included in the study as a new parameter—fire persistence—to be considered in fire regimes. It is proposed that fire persistence should be included in strategic framework for integrating wildfire risk in forest planning. This will entail identifying and including the potential for re-ignition in fire risk maps and fire suppression policies and implementing forest management actions in areas vulnerable to re-ignition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus halepensis 3abiomass 3afire suppression 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest fires 3aforest management 3aforests 3aresearch 3arisk 3asoil 3aweather 3aSpain1 aPrat-Guitart, Núria1 aFrancos, Marcos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3311-56861 aÚbeda, Xavier,1 aCastellnou, Marc0 tEuropean journal of forest research.g2022 Oct., v. 141, no. 5 p.753-767dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870054x1612-46697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10342-022-01490-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02673naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245007800186300001800264520119400282592002801476650001101504650002001515650001801535650001101553650001901564650001901583650001701602650001501619650001301634650001301647650001401660650001301674650001801687650002901705650001901734650003401753650002501787650002401812650002601836650004101862650005901903651001101962700002001973773011701993856004802110852000902158655001202167IND4464777420221119155243.0120507e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446477742DNAL7 a217134652pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-011-2198-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzkan, Ebru Yesim10aExamination of reactive phosphate fluxes in an eutrophicated coastal area  ap. 3443-3454.  aReactive phosphate (RP) fluxes over sediment in an eutrophic bay were obtained under different conditions. The results were assessed together with water column, sediment solid, and liquid-phase parameters. The RP fluxes ranged from 0 to 1,300 μgatP × m-2d-1 day depending on the sediment site and other variables. At stations with relatively high net RP fluxes, the clay fraction was >3% and disproportionate with salinity, which explained why the RP effluxes decreased by inhibition of the organic coating on particulate matter with increased SO4 −2 ions and good competition of RP anions with SO4 −2. The RP flux in Fe/RP ratios >2 in surface water decreased to approach a minimum asymptotically, which was thus defined with a hyperbolic curve to determine the maximum rate of the RP flux (JRP). The [RPporewater]initial/[RPambient] initial ratios were suggested to govern the net RP flux regionally, so the critical value where the RP flux turns positive could indicate eutrophication with Chl-a values <500 μg/g. So, this study investigated the phosphate fluxes between sediment and water column and determined the factors influencing the RP fluxes in the inner bay of Izmir.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanions 3abiogeochemistry 3aclay fraction 3acoasts 3aeutrophication 3ahydrochemistry 3aparticulates 3aphosphates 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asediments 3asulfates 3asurface water 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEutrophication 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aPhosphatesxanalysis 2aSeawaterxchemistry 2aWaste Disposal, Fluid 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysis 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxstatistics & numerical data 0aTurkey1 aBuyukisik, Baha0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2012 June, v. 184, no. 6 p.3443-3454dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-011-2198-0  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100006400191245013000255300001800385506007600403520142500479592002801904506003701932650004401969650001302013650002102026650002102047650001502068650002202083650000902105650002002114650001402134650001402148650001502162650002402177650002202201650001902223700006502242773012902307856008402436852000902520655001202529IND60655800520221207124550.0190807e20190701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065580052DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.9b008592doi7 aPMC70502922pmcid7 a312578562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohn, Christopher W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1713-122910aFourier Transform Infrared Spectrovoltammetry and Quantitative Modeling of Analytes in Kinetically Constrained Redox Mixtures  ap. 9563-9570.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRedox-active analytes that do not support direct electron transfer on the electrode, such as proteins with buried redox centers, pose challenges to characterization of their structural and thermodynamic properties. Investigations of indirect transitions in analytes supported by complex redox mixtures require a careful balance between kinetic limitations and spectral interference from the mediators. Using methylene green and thionine acetate as redox mediators and myoglobin as the analyte, we demonstrate that normal pulse spectrovoltammetry (NPSV) with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) detection and subsequent global spectral regression analysis can resolve structural and thermodynamic properties simultaneously with little a priori information. Both the E₁/₂ and unbiased redox difference FT-IR spectra of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couple of myoglobin in reduction and oxidation NPSV modes were in good agreement with those reported earlier by independent techniques. The thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of mediators/analyte interactions were investigated using comprehensive semiempirical kinetic simulation models. This modeling effort yielded a flexible computational tool capable of quantitatively predicting the redox response in mediated electrochemical studies and defining its limitations, thus greatly expanding the range and precision of the formal mediator/analyte concentration ratio rule.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aacetates 3achemical species 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aelectron transfer 3airon 3amethylene green 3amyoglobin 3aoxidation 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asimulation models 3athermodynamics1 aProshlyakov, Denis A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4625-03230 tAnalytical chemistry.g2019 July 01, v. 91, no. 15 p.9563-9570dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.9b008593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012700169520138300296592002801679650001801707650002401725650001401749650001201763650001101775650001801786650002901804650002201833650001101855650000901866650001701875650002101892653004301913653002401956653002201980653003102002653002402033653003502057700002602092700002102118773009002139856008502229852000902314655001202323IND60735723020221118180353.0220726e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073572302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1207542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbbas, Shahbaz10aSupply chain integrated decision model in order to synergize the energy system of textile industry from its resource waste  aIn order to foster sustainable production in the textile industry, it is essential to seek sustainable ways of energy management. Apart from conspicuous sources of biomass, this study has investigated the overlooked potential of cotton crop waste as a source of biomass energy supply. The cotton crop waste can supplement the energy system of the industry as well as the sustainable utilization of the agricultural waste. This study has explored and comprehensively analyzed the potential of cotton crop waste to synergize industrial energy systems by integrating strategic and tactical decision models into an integrated model. The results indicate that cotton crop waste is a conducive and convenient source of sustainable energy supply for the textile industry. Out of all proposed energy conversion technologies, oil heater and organic rankin cycle technology is less efficient over others, also the NPV analysis supports the investment decision into all of these technologies. In contrast, this augmented supply of energy can be affected during the off-season, along with the challenge of conversion technologies’ affordability for an already economically destabilized industry. However, the integration of seasonal agricultural waste and financial incentives from the government can transcend the textile industry, as a compensation for their pro-environmental approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffordability 3aagricultural wastes 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acotton 3acrop residues 3adecision support systems 3aenergy conversion 3amodels 3aoils 3asupply chain 3atextile industry 0aSustainable consumption and production 0aEnergy supply chain 0aCotton crop waste 0aIntegrated strategic model 0aLinear optimization 0aEnergy conversion technologies1 aChiang Hsieh, Lin-Han1 aTechato, Kuaanan0 tEnergy.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 229 p.120754-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1207543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001200156245010000168300001800268520127200286592002801558650000801586650001501594650001901609650001601628650001301644650001201657650002201669650001501691650003101706650002301737700001601760700001701776700001701793773008701810856009001897852000901987655001201996IND60090514720221122063945.0141102e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009051472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTao, Yu10aSelf-assembled, functionalized graphene and DNA as a universal platform for colorimetric assays  ap. 4810-4817.  aWe have demonstrated a robust sensing strategy by employing single-stranded probe DNA and the hemin-graphene hybrid (GH) to detect a broad range of targets including metal ions, DNA and small molecules. This nearly “universal” biosensor approach is based on the DNA-mediated assembly of the hemin-graphene composite upon addition of the targets. Afterwards, GH aggregate resulting from DNA hybridization will occur. The DNA-GH hybrids will settle on the bottom of the vial after centrifugation, leaving behind a transparent supernatant. After incubation with TMB and H₂O₂, the colorimetric signal of the centrifugal supernatant will be significantly lower compared to that in the absence of targets. Therefore, mediation of the assembly of DNA on GH by targets can yield a facile means with tunable optical properties in response to concentration changes of the targets. This colorimetric “readout” offers great advantages such as the simple operation process, low-cost portable instrument and easy-to-use applications. Therefore, we believe that this method promises a great potential of becoming a routine tool for quantitative detection of a wide spectrum of analytes for specific applications in biodiagnostics, nanoelectronics, and bionanotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3abiosensors 3acentrifugation 3acolorimetry 3agraphene 3ahybrids 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ametal ions 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aoptical properties1 aLin, Youhui1 aRen, Jinsong1 aQu, Xiaogang0 tBiomaterials.g2013 July, v. 34, no. 20 p.4810-4817dElsevier Ltdx0142-96127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.03.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02388naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005600094040001800150100002100168245011200189300001800301520134900319592002801668653000901696653002901705653001301734653003201747653001701779653001901796653001601815700001501831773010301846856011601949852000902065655001202074IND60131232320221119002705.0151127e200612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013123232DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[1004:SPAECI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeagin, Rusty A.10aSpatial pattern and edge characteristics in restored terrace versus reference salt marshes in galveston bay  ap. 1004-1011.  aTerraced salt marsh restoration projects have been designed to maximize edge because the edges between habitat types have been shown to be the most productive locations in Spartina alterniflora salt marshes for nekton and benthic infauna. We compared terraced plots with reference plots to see how much edge was created. We also quantified the differences in the spatial patterns of the habitat in the plots. We found that reference marshes had significantly more habitat diversity and more total low marsh area. We also found that reference marshes had a greater absolute amount of low marsh edge. Yet, we found little difference between terraced restoration marshes and nearby reference marshes in Galveston Bay, Texas, USA in terms of the percent of all habitat-to-habitat edge-type combinations that were aquatic edge ((water- or seagrass-to-low marsh interface)), and much of the reference marshes' area was in core marsh areas that were not suitable for high fisheries production value. Terracing appears an efficient strategy for the sole purpose of creating aquatic edge for fisheries production but does not appear to match other aspects of reference marshes in terms of their habitat composition or spatial configuration. This study shows the potential for using spatial pattern analysis to monitor restoration projects in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 0aedge 0aspatial pattern analysis 0aterraces 0aGalveston Island State Park 0aPierce Marsh 0areference site 0arestoration1 aBen Wu, X.0 tWetlands.g2006 Dec., v. 26, no. 4 p.1004-1011dThe Society of Wetland Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282006%2926%5B1004%3ASPAECI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02275naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005600139245013400195300001600329500001900345500002000364520090900384592002801293650001501321650001201336650001201348650002201360650002201382650002801404650002101432650001601453650001601469650001301485650001501498700005901513700001901572700005901591773013301650856007301783852000901856655001201865IND60722278320221121025201.0201230e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072227832DNAL7 a10.1111/wej.125962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarar, Amina1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1128-822510aInhibition of nucleation and crystal growth of calcium carbonate in hard waters using Paronychia arabica in an arid desert region  ap. 979-987.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe formation of CaCO₃ of groundwater has important implications in the industry.

The antiscaling properties of these extracts towards CaCO3 formation were tested using chronoamperometry (CA), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Fast Controlled Precipitation methods. Electrochemical and chemical analysis of Mkhadma groundwater shows a high calcium concentration and the deposit is a pure calcite. The nucleation and formation time were identified.

As there is little research exploring the performance of bicycle-sharing systems (BSS), many municipal authorities invest in their development without knowledge of their effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of this article is to identify factors that correlate with BSS performance. Data related to BSS and urban characteristics were collected for the 56 cities in Poland, which is the population of BSS systems in this country. The Ordinary Least Square regression model was used to estimate the model. Additionally, to support our findings, a survey of 3631 cyclists was conducted. Our main findings show that BSS performance was positively related to cities&rsquo; population, tourism, number of bike stations per capita, congestion, bicycle pathways&rsquo; length and higher temperature, and negatively related to precipitation. We have also found that one BSS operator was more effective compared to the others.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3abicycling 3acities 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3atemperature 3atourism 3atransportation 3aPoland1 aKwapisz, Agnieszka 1 aWażna, Agnieszka,0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 26, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110924583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02110naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008600165520091000251592002801161650002501189650001701214650001201231650001801243650002501261650002301286650001601309650002701325700002201352700003101374700001801405700002201423700002101445700001801466700003501484773011901519856007701638852000901715655001201724IND60703694620221120234839.0200721e20200317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070369462DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90303672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTeubner, Marlene 14aThe Chloroplast Ribonucleoprotein CP33B Quantitatively Binds the <i>psbA</i> mRNA  aChloroplast RNAs are stabilized and processed by a multitude of nuclear-encoded RNA-binding proteins, often in response to external stimuli like light and temperature. A particularly interesting RNA-based regulation occurs with the <i>psbA</i> mRNA, which shows light-dependent translation. Recently, the chloroplast ribonucleoprotein CP33B was identified as a ligand of the <i>psbA</i> mRNA. We here characterized the interaction of CP33B with chloroplast RNAs in greater detail using a combination of RIP-chip, quantitative dot-blot, and RNA-Bind-n-Seq experiments. We demonstrate that CP33B prefers <i>psbA</i> over all other chloroplast RNAs and associates with the vast majority of the <i>psbA</i> transcript pool. The RNA sequence target motif, determined in vitro, does not fully explain CP33B&rsquo;s preference for <i>psbA</i>, suggesting that there are other determinants of specificity in vivo.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA-binding proteins 3achloroplasts 3aligands 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aribonucleoproteins 3atemperature 3atranslation (genetics)1 aLenzen, Benjamin 1 aEspenberger, Lucas  Bernal1 aFuss, Janina 1 aNickelsen, Jörg 1 aKrause, Kirsten 1 aRuwe, Hannes 1 aSchmitz-Linneweber, Christian 0 tPlants.g2020 Mar. 17, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90303673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02850naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002000167245010800187300001600295520179300311592002802104653002102132653001402153653001802167653001402185653001702199653002202216700001802238700001502256773014102271856011502412852000902527655001202536IND60128232920221118133053.0151115e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823292DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[306:DICPTS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiana, James S.10aDo Increasing Cormorant Populations Threaten Sportfishes in the Great Lakes? A Case Study in Lake Huron  ap. 306-320.  aAfter near extirpation earlier this century in the Great Lakes, double-crested cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) populations reached all-time highs, raising concerns among sport anglers and fisheries managers, who see cormorants as a significant source of mortality for yellow perch (Perca flavescens), whose populations are perceived to have declined in concert with cormorant increases. We partitioned age-specific perch mortality for 1995 into that caused by (1) cormorant predation, (2) angler harvest, and (3) other sources. Cormorant consumption of perch was calculated by simultaneously estimating diet composition (using stomach analysis and number of foraging cormorants from aerial and ground surveys), and daily consumption (using energetic values from the literature). Consumption of perch by cormorants was heaviest during April and May (48%% of the diet by weight) when perch spawn, but yellow perch was not an important prey species overall (11%%). Primary prey groups were alewife (47%%) and sticklebacks (15%%). Cormorants consumed 11,400 kg of perch, mostly young fish (ages 1––3), but mortality caused by cormorant predation was estimated at ≤≤6.3%% of mortality for all ages of perch. Neither cormorants nor anglers contributed more than one-fourth of the total annual mortality of any age class of perch. Although cormorants were highly visible predators of perch in Les Cheneaux Islands area, they did not represent a major source of mortality in 1995. Impact of cormorants on perch may vary from year to year, and may relate to fluctuations in timing of the birds' migration relative to perch spawning. However, we conclude that overall impact is not significant, and control measures to limit their populations were not warranted at the time of this study.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPredator control 0apredation 0aprey dynamics 0amortality 0asportfishing 0apopulation growth1 aMaruca, Susan1 aLow, Bobbi0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2006 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.306-320dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282006%2932%5B306%3ADICPTS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02674naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245008200170300001600252520174200268592002802010650001202038650002202050650001702072650001402089650003002103650001702133700002102150773011102171856008102282852000902363655001202372IND60440332420221120123918.0151024e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033242DNAL7 a10.1007/s11852-015-0396-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolters, Michel L.10aVulnerability assessments of coastal river deltas - categorization and review  ap. 345-368.  aCoastal river deltas are densely populated areas and hotspots of vulnerability. The delta’s ecological, social, and economic components are vulnerable to a wide variety of natural and anthropogenic threats. Sea level rise, climate variability, and rapid socio-economic development exert pressure on the already highly dynamic regions. To protect river deltas and their components, it is necessary to assess the degree of vulnerability so that mitigation efforts can be recommended to stakeholders and policy makers. Many such vulnerability assessments have been undertaken for river deltas. However, as vulnerability and related terms, such as resilience, coping-, and adaptive capacity only entered geosciences in the past decades, these terms are often used ambiguously. This makes it hard to compare existing studies, which not only interpret the related terms differently, but also consider completely different threats to deltas and their components, at different spatial and temporal scales. A comprehensive overview of studies addressing vulnerability of river deltas is missing. This paper presents a review, based on a consolidated set of definitions of vulnerability and related concepts in the context of coastal river deltas. All studies reviewed were categorized depending on their focus on either the ecologic, social, or economic component of river deltas, and were classified according to their spatial scale, temporal resolution, and numerous other research characteristics. Clear trends on dominant research foci in the field of river delta vulnerability could be extracted. Additionally, based on the findings presented here, recommendations for future assessments considering existing research gaps, are formulated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aissues and policy 3ariver deltas 3asea level 3asocioeconomic development 3astakeholders1 aKuenzer, Claudia0 tJournal of coastal conservation.g2015 June, v. 19, no. 3 p.345-368dSpringer Netherlandsx1400-03507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11852-015-0396-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245013600181300001600317520156600333592002801899650001801927650001701945650001301962650002701975650002302002650001402025650001402039650001902053650001502072650001302087650001802100650001002118650003002128650001302158650001002171650001202181650004302193650001802236650000902254650001202263651001302275653001402288653001802302653001202320653000802332653001702340653001402357773023502371856008402606852000902690655001202699IND60543645320221119183455.0190411e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054364532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2015.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiwatanaratanabutr, Itsanun10aWolbachia infection in leafhoppers and planthoppers: Diversity, density and geographic distribution in tropical rice agroecosystems  ap. 277-282.  aMembers of the genus Wolbachia are a group of endosymbiotic bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods and cause reproductive alterations in their hosts. A survey of these endosymbionts in leafhoppers and planthoppers in rice agroecosystems from 20 provinces in 4 different geographic regions of Thailand was carried out during January 2012 to December 2013. Most species were collected from growing rice fields among 5 habitat types surveyed from the Central and the Northeast regions. Infections of Wolbachia were screened by using polymerase chain reaction with wsp, ftsZ, 16S rRNA and groE gene primers and distinguished between A and B supergroup using wsp primers. Species of 15 leafhoppers and 18 planthoppers were collected and identified with 1, 14, 2, 14, 1 and 1 sp. representing the family Aphrophoridae, Cicadellidae, Cixiidae, Delphacidae, Lophopidae and Meenoplidae, respectively. Wolbachia were detected in 1377 of 1849 individuals (74.5%) representing 17 of 33 species (51.5%) of leafhoppers and planthoppers. Wolbachia had not been previously reported from Oliarus sp., Pyrilla perpusilla, Sogatella kolophon and S. vibix. The relative densities of Wolbachia within each individual were determined using quantitative real-time PCR and the result showed that the small brown planthopper Laodelphax striatellus had the highest Wolbachia density. These findings indicated that Wolbachia are distributed throughout leafhoppers and planthoppers from Thailand, suggesting that Wolbachia dynamics in nature may be affected by ecological factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphrophoridae 3aCicadellidae 3aCixiidae 3aLaodelphax striatellus 3aPyrilla perpusilla 3aSogatella 3aWolbachia 3aagroecosystems 3aarthropods 3abacteria 3aendosymbionts 3agenes 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3apaddies 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arice 3asurveys 3aThailand 0aRice pest 0aEndosymbionts 0aHabitat 0aPCR 0aQuantitative 0aWolbachia0 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2015 June, v. 18, no. 2 p.277-282dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2015.03.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245019200165500001900357520220300376592002802579650001202607650000902619650001502628650001402643650000902657650001802666650001502684650001402699650001002713650001602723650000902739651001002748653001902758653001802777653002202795653002002817653004702837700001902884700001402903700001902917700001502936700001802951700001602969700006302985700002003048700001603068700001403084700001503098773011003113856008503223852000903308655001203317IND60714950820221119230605.0210212e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071495082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yue10aParent, alkylated, oxygenated and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in PM2.5 emitted from residential biomass burning and coal combustion: A novel database of 14 heating scenarios  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTo characterize the emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from residential biomass burning and coal combustion in field environments, smoke samples were collected from the combustion of six types of biomass in heated kangs and four types of coal in traditional stoves and semi-gasifier stoves. The emission factors (EFs) of the total PAH were in the range of 84.5–344 mg/kg for biomass burning, with lower EFs for biomass with higher densities, and in the range of 38.0–206 mg/kg for coal combustion, with lower EFs for coals with higher maturity. Moreover, EFs were lower from high-density biomass fuels (wood trunk, 84.5 ± 11.3 mg/kg) than low-maturity coals (bituminous coal, 206 ± 16.5 mg/kg). Parent, oxygenated, alkylated, and nitrated PAHs accounted for 81.1%, 12.6%, 6.2%, and 0.1%, respectively, of the total-PAH EFs from biomass burning, and 84.7%, 13.8%, 1.4%, and 0.1%, respectively, of the total-PAH EFs from coal combustion. PAH source profiles differed negligibly between biomass fuels but differed significantly between bituminous coal and anthracite coal fuels. The characteristic species of sources were phenanthrene, 9-fluorenone, and 2-nitrobiphenyl for biomass burning, and were phenanthrene, benzo[ghi]perylene, 1,4-naphthoquinone, and 2-nitrobiphenyl for coal combustion. The ratios of benzo[b]fluoranthene/(benzo[b]fluoranthene + benzo[k]fluoranthene) were 0.40–0.45 for biomass burning and 0.89–0.91 for coal combustion, and these significantly different values constitute unique markers for distinguishing these fuels in source apportionment. Benzo[a]pyrene-equivalent factor emissions were 2.79–11.3 mg/kg for biomass and 7.49–41.9 mg/kg for coal, where parent PAHs contributed 92.0%–95.1% from biomass burning and 98.6%–98.8% from coal combustion. Total-PAH emissions from residential heating were 1552 t across Shaanxi province, to which wheat straw (445 t) in biomass burning and bituminous coal (438 t) in coal combustion were the highest contributors. Results from this study provide crucial knowledge for the source identification of PAHs as well as for the design of abatement strategies against pollutant emissions.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acoal 3acombustion 3adatabases 3aheat 3aphenanthrenes 3apollutants 3apollution 3asmoke 3awheat straw 3awood 3aChina 0aPAHs emissions 0aRural heating 0aField experiments 0aSource profiles 0aBenzo[a]pyrene-equivalent factor emissions1 aShen, Zhenxing1 aSun, Jian1 aZhang, Leiming1 aZhang, Bin1 aZou, Haijiang1 aZhang, Tian1 aHang Ho, Steven Sai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4877-59941 aChang, Xiaojian1 aXu, Hongmei1 aWang, Tao1 aCao, Junji0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 268 p.115881-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1158813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02152naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245008400163300001600247500001100263520095300274592002801227650001601255650003101271650001301302650001401315650001701329650001401346650001201360650001701372700001501389700001901404700002001423700002001443700002001463700002001483700002001503773012801523856008201651852000901733655001201742IND60119993620221120142147.0180619e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011999362DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-014-1752-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIgaz, Peter10aMicroRNAs in adrenal tumors: relevance for pathogenesis, diagnosis, and therapy  ap. 417-428.  aReview  aSeveral lines of evidence support the relevance of microRNAs in both adrenocortical and adrenomedullary (pheochromocytomas) tumors. Significantly differentially expressed microRNAs have been described among benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors and different forms of pheochromocytomas that might affect different pathogenic pathways. MicroRNAs can be exploited as markers of malignancy or disease recurrence. Besides tissue microRNAs, novel data show that microRNAs are released in body fluids, and blood-borne microRNAs can be envisaged as minimally invasive markers of malignancy or prognosis. MicroRNAs might even serve as treatment targets that could expand the rather-limited therapeutic repertoire in the field of adrenal tumors. In this review, we present a critical synopsis of the recent observations made in the field of adrenal tumor-associated microRNAs regarding their pathogenic, diagnostic, and potential therapeutic relevance.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody fluids 3agene expression regulation 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3apathogenesis 3aprognosis 3arelapse 3atherapeutics1 aIgaz, Ivan1 aNagy, Zoltán,1 aNyírő, Gábor1 aSzabó, PeterM.1 aFalus, András,1 aPatócs, Attila1 aRácz, Károly,0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2015 Feb., v. 72, no. 3 p.417-428dSpringer BaselwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-014-1752-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002300167245013800190300001600328520144000344592002801784653002001812653000901832653001001841653001401851653001501865653001201880700002701892773014101919856011502060852000902175655001202184IND60128233320221118133042.0151115e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012823332DNAL7 a10.3394/0380-1330(2006)32[370:RFTUGL]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, Daniel L.10aResults from the U.S. Great Lakes Fish Monitoring Program and Effects of Lake Processes on Bioaccumulative Contaminant Concentrations  ap. 370-385.  aAn analysis of composite samples of 820 lake trout, walleye, steelhead, Chinook, and coho from the Laurentian Great Lakes reveals differences in contaminant processing among and between lakes which results in differing concentrations of bioaccumulative contaminants. Generally, contaminants are most concentrated in fish from Lake Michigan and least concentrated in fish from Lake Superior, with the notable exceptions of toxaphene and alpha-HCH. Differences in contamination patterns, however, are apparent not only among the lakes but between sites within a lake or even fish within a site. Lake trout composites from Lake Superior show an increase in the degree of chlorination of PCBs with increasing total PCBs. The PCB congener profile of lake trout from the Sturgeon Bay site of Lake Michigan is substantially different from that of the Saugatuck site of Lake Michigan, possibly due to the influence of contamination from nearby Green Bay. Finally, the ratios of selected PBDE and PCB congeners are much different in Lake Superior fish compared to fishes from all the other lakes. We hypothesize that this is a result of the colder temperatures and associated lower plankton growth rates in Lake Superior allowing PCB and PBDE uptake by phytoplankton to reach near equilibrium, thus enhancing the relative concentrations, in phytoplankton and the food web in general, of congeners that may be kinetically limited in other lakes.  aPublisher supplied data 0aBioaccumulation 0aPCBs 0aPBDEs 0atoxaphene 0alake trout 0awalleye1 aSwackhamer, Deborah L.0 tJournal of Great Lakes research.g2006 June, v. 32, no. 2 p.370-385dInternational Association for Great Lakes Researchx0380-13307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3394%2F0380-1330%282006%2932%5B370%3ARFTUGL%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02759naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245010400178300001800282520135700300536006101657592002801718596003301746650001701779650001901796650002201815650001801837650002001855650001201875650001501887650001501902650001101917650001901928650001701947650002801964650001601992650001702008651001202025700001902037700002502056773013802081856008502219852000902304655001202313IND60634489420221117225312.0190323e20190418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448942DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.15392712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMusa, Sulaiman Ibrahim10aGeospatial modelling of urban growth for sustainable development in the Niger Delta Region, Nigeria  ap. 3076-3104.  aUrban land expansion usually alters land-cover status, which may indirectly affect the physical environment.

In addition, we incorporated sustainable urban development goals in projecting the future urban expansion to observe their impact in this rapidly urbanizing region with a total area of 109,281.30 km². A Cellular Automata/Markov Chain (CA-Markov) model was used to project the year 2030 land cover of the region using two scenarios: by considering existing settlements as the only constraints and by combining them with some selected United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) constraints (forest reserves, population, and economy). Comparing the two scenarios, the projected land-cover changes under the first scenario resulted in net loss and gains of −7.37%, 11.84%, and 50.88%, while the second scenario produced net loss and gains of −4.72%, 7.43%, and 48.37% in forest, farmland, and built-up area between 2015 and 2030, respectively. The difference between the two scenarios showed that strict adherence to the UN SDGs will reduce tropical deforestation in Niger Delta or similar region.  aThis work was supported by Nigerian Public Universities.  aPublisher supplied data  cNigerian Public Universities 3aMarkov chain 3aUnited Nations 3aagricultural land 3adeforestation 3aforest reserves 3aforests 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3ariver deltas 3asustainable development 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aNigeria1 aHashim, Mazlan1 aReba, Mohd Nadzri Md0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Apr. 18, v. 40, no. 8 p.3076-3104dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.15392713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03519naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245015100208500002200359520210400381592002802485650001602513650002702529650001202556650003102568650001202599650001602611650001302627653002502640653001502665653001302680653002802693653002502721653000902746653000802755653000802763653000802771700002002779700001902799700005602818700001802874773007402892856008602966852000903052655001203061IND60629742820221121043630.0190401e20190115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDempsey, A.F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7085-625910aParent report of provider HPV vaccine communication strategies used during a randomized, controlled trial of a provider communication intervention  aPre-press version  aTo assess secondary, parent-reported outcomes from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a provider communication intervention aimed at improving adolescent HPV vaccination.A paper survey was provided to a random sample of 777 parents of adolescents from 8 control and 8 intervention clinics participating in the larger trial. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests assessed associations between study arm and providers’ HPV vaccine communication strategies, parents’ vaccination attitudes and parent’s HPV vaccine acceptance. Exploratory analyses assessed the association between receipt of ‘very strong’ or presumptive HPV vaccine recommendation (regardless of study arm) and parent’s perceptions about their providers’ vaccine communication, and parents’ attitudes and acceptance of the HPV vaccine.The response rate was 47%. There were no differences between study arms in parents’ report of how their provider communicated about the HPV vaccine, parent vaccination attitudes, or uptake of the HPV vaccine. Receipt of a ‘very strong’ recommendation was associated with greater perceived urgency for getting vaccinated, greater trust in the information received from the provider, decreased vaccine hesitancy, and increased vaccine receipt. Receipt of a presumptive recommendation was associated with a lower likelihood of having concerns about the vaccine’s safety, lower vaccine hesitancy, and an increased likelihood of vaccination. Neither recommendation strategy appeared to negatively impact parents’ visit experience or trust in the information being provided. Similar results were found in sub-analyses of vaccine hesitant parents.Providing very strong, presumptive HPV vaccine recommendations is associated with improved parent vaccination attitudes and acceptance, and does not seem to have significant negative impacts, even among parents who are vaccine hesitant. Response bias in our sample could explain why there were no reported differences between study arms in parents’ reports of how their adolescent’s providers communicated about the HPV vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3aattitudes and opinions 3aparents 3arandomized clinical trials 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aAdolescent 0aVaccines 0aProvider recommendation 0aHealth communication 0aTdap 0aMCV 0aHPV 0aCDC1 aPyrzanowski, J.1 aCampagna, E.J.1 aLockhart, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5528-17841 aO'Leary, S.T.0 tVaccine.g2019 Jan. 15, dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.01.0513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03397naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245010600188300001800294520123500312592002801547650001201575650001401587650001101601650001501612650001401627650002101641650001101662650001501673650001301688650002501701650003001726650004701756650003201803650006201835650006201897650002601959650007501985650007502060650007902135650003702214650001502251650004102266650004002307651001002347653001202357653002402369653004802393653002202441653001502463700002202478700001702500700002402517700002002541700002102561773008402582856008402666852000902750655001202759IND60088325320221116181511.0160901e20130415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008832532DNAL7 a234152452pmid7 a10.1016/j.watres.2013.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKodera, Hiroya10aPhosphate recovery as concentrated solution from treated wastewater by a PAO-enriched biofilm reactor  ap. 2025-2032.  aPhosphorus recovery from wastewaters and its recycling are of importance for sustaining agricultural production. During the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal process, phosphorus is removed by withdrawing excess sludge from wastewater. However, excess sludge disposal is costly and energy intensive. A proposed novel process for phosphorus recovery from sewage treatment will result in no excess sludge if a polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) enrichment biofilm can be applied to effluents containing phosphate. This process allows the recovery of phosphate as phosphate-concentrated solutions by controlling PAOs to absorb and release phosphate. A reactor consisting of a modified trickling filter with a synthetic substrate (5 mg P L−1) was operated to form a PAO-enriched biofilm. As a result of the enrichment, the concentration of phosphate of >100 mg P L−1 was successfully achieved. During this experiment, no sludge withdrawal was carried out over the duration of the operation of 255 days. To highlight the new process, the principle of enriching PAOs on biofilm and concentrating phosphate from treated sewage is explained, and a discussion on phosphate recovery performance is given.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofilm 3aeffluents 3aenergy 3aphosphorus 3arecycling 3asewage treatment 3asludge 3awastewater 2aBiofilms 2aBiological Transport 2aBioreactorsxmicrobiology 2aConservation of Natural Resourcesxmethods 2aFiltrationxinstrumentation 2aGram-Negative Bacteriaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGram-Positive Bacteriaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aOsmolar Concentration 2aPhosphatesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPhosphorusxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aPolyphosphatesxanalysisxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSewagexchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aSolubility 2aWastewaterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aWater Purificationxinstrumentation 0aJapan 0aBiofilm 0aPhosphorus recovery 0aPolyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) 0aTreatment process 0aWastewater1 aHatamoto, Masashi1 aAbe, Kenichi1 aKindaichi, Tomonori1 aOzaki, Noriatsu1 aOhashi, Akiyoshi0 tWater research.g2013 Apr. 15, v. 47 p.2025-2032dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2013.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245010000177300001800277520112600295592002801421650001101449650000901460650005001469650001901519650001101538650001801549650003001567650002401597650000901621651001501630773013801645856008501783852000901868655001201877IND60634489520221117225400.0190323e20190418xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448952DNAL7 a10.1080/01431161.2018.15392722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiappa, Achille Carlo14aThe summer upwelling of the Eastern Aegean Sea detected from MODIS SST scenes from 2003 to 2015  ap. 3105-3117.  aThe summer upwelling of the Eastern Aegean Sea is investigated by daily night-time MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Sea Surface Temperature scenes in the periods from June to November (extended summer) 2003–2015. The analysis is supported by wind data downloaded from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis archive. On average over these summers, upwelling and Etesian wind occurred 69% and 78% of time, respectively. The highest correlation between upwelling and wind was found from June to September, with the beginning of the upwelling events shifted between 24 and 48 h after the start of the Etesian wind. The upwelling always begins in the same areas of the Eastern Aegean coast with the only differences that these areas tesian wind pattern. The largest upwelling events occurred in summers 2003–2009 and not in the following years of the study period. The upwelled cold surface water, still pushed by the persistent Etesian wind, fills part of South-Eastern Aegean and eventually outflows the Aegean Sea through Kassos and Karpathos Straits of the eastern Cretan Arc.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3acold 3amoderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 3aremote sensing 3asummer 3asurface water 3asurface water temperature 3aweather forecasting 3awind 3aAegean Sea0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2019 Apr. 18, v. 40, no. 8 p.3105-3117dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2018.15392723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01914naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024002200126024001900148040001800167100002000185245005900205506007600264506031000340520035500650592002801005506003701033650002501070650002001095650001601115650001601131653002301147653001701170653001801187653001001205700002101215700002501236700001701261700002101278773011801299856007801417852000901495655001201504IND60519189320221207090429.0160421e20160330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051918932DNAL7 a10.4081/ijfs.2016.56482doi7 aPMC50767112pmcid7 a278004352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiuzzo, Gaetano10aRisk Assessment Terminology: Risk Communication Part 1  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.  aThe paper describes the terminology of risk communication in the view of food safety: the theory of stakeholders, the citizens’ involvement and the community interest and consultation are reported.

In areas where most of the crop cultivation is in large contiguous areas, and if the AVHRR data are selected for time period such that the crop of interest is well discriminated from other crops, these data can be used for monitoring vegetative growth and condition very effectively. The present study deals with the application of AVHRR data for the monitoring of the wheat crop in its seventeen main growing districts of the Rajasthan state. The fourteen date AVHRR data covering the entire growth period have been used to generate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDV1) growth profile for the crop by masking the non-crop pixels following the two-date NDVI change method. The growth profile parameters and other derived parameters, such as post-anthesis senescence rate and areas under the entire growth profile or under selected growth periods have been related to the district average wheat yield through statistical regression models. Various methods adopted for wheat pixels masking have been critically evaluated. It is found that the wheat yield can be predicted well by the area under the profile in different growth periods.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrops 3agrain yield 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3aradiometry 3aregression analysis 3aremote sensing 3avegetation 3avegetative growth 3awheat 3aIndia1 aPotdar, M.

A GC-helium ionisation detector (HID) system measured 15 C₂–C₅ hydrocarbons with 5 min time resolution and a dual channel GC-Electron Capture Detector (ECD) measured PAN with 90 s resolution. Both instruments had low parts per trillion by volume (pptV) detection limits and ran continuously at the remote Jungfraujoch (JFJ) research station in the Swiss Alps (46.55°N, 7.98°E), 3580 m above mean sea level (AMSL), during February/March 2003. Carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide and all odd nitrogen species (NOy) were also measured continuously. Hydrocarbons and CO were strongly correlated in all air-masses whilst PAN exhibited both positive and negative correlations with respect to O₃, dependent on age and origin of the air-mass sampled. PAN was found to contribute ∼20% to the NOy sampled on average. The experiment, as well as providing interesting datasets from this remote location, also demonstrated that when optimised, GC techniques have the potential to measure at a time resolution significantly greater than is traditionally considered, with high sensitivity and low uncertainty.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaircraft 3aaltitude 3acarbon monoxide 3adata collection 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3ahydrocarbons 3aionization 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrogen dioxide 3aozone 3asea level 3atroposphere 3auncertainty 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aLewis, A.

Each CCD-line sensor with different imaging times causes geometric problems of mosaicing three strips data together. In this paper, we propose the details of the design elements of system that caters to the need for accurate and automatic multi strip image registration without any second resampling of the data. The systematic geometric correction grid mapping is improved to facilitate accurate mosaicing by automatic image registration task that makes use of the overlap data within image strips and image registration is achieved up to sub-pixel level.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrid maps 3aimage analysis 3aremote sensing 3asatellites1 aMoorthi, S.

Simultaneous use of all data, including phenotypes, pedigree, and genotypes, is a condition to obtain unbiased EBV. However, this condition is not always fully met, mainly due to unavailability of foreign raw data for imported animals. In dairy cattle genetic evaluations, this issue is traditionally tackled through the multiple across-country evaluation (MACE) of sires, performed by Interbull Centre (Uppsala, Sweden). Multiple across-country evaluation regresses all the available national information onto a joint pedigree to obtain country-specific rankings of all sires without sharing the raw data. In the context of genomic selection, the issue is handled by exchanging sire genotypes and by using MACE information (i.e., MACE EBV and reliabilities), as a valuable source of “phenotypic” data. Although all the available data are considered, these “multi-national” genomic evaluations use multi-step methods assuming independence of various sources of information, which is not met in all situations. We developed a method that handles this by single-step genomic evaluation that jointly (1) uses national phenotypic, genomic, and pedigree data; (2) uses multi-national genomic information; and (3) avoids double counting dependent data contributions from an animal’s own records and relatives’ records. The method was demonstrated by integrating multi-national genomic EBV and reliabilities of Brown Swiss sires, included in the InterGenomics consortium at Interbull Centre, into the national evaluation in Slovenia. The results showed that the method could (1) increase reliability of a national (genomic) evaluation; (2) provide consistent ranking of all animals: bulls, cows, and young animals; and (3) increase the size of a genomic training population. These features provide more efficient and transparent selection throughout a breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrown Swiss 3abreeding programs 3abulls 3acows 3adairy cattle 3agenomics 3agenotype 3amarker-assisted selection 3apedigree 3aphenotype 3asires 3ayoung animals 3aSlovenia 0asingle-step genomic BLUP 0acombination 0amulti-national 0agenomically enhanced estimated breeding values1 aSpehar, M.1 aPotocnik, K.1 aGengler, N.1 aGorjanc, G.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.465-478dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-117333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01181naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245011600172300001600288520016800304592002800472653001200500653002000512653003200532653001800564653001600582653000900598700002400607773015400631856008500785852000900870655001200879IND60130976520221118111339.0151127e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013097652DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797-110.1.1962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrogan, William L.12aA New Species Of Biting Midge in the Subgenus Monoculicoides of Culicoides from Utah (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae)  ap. 196-203.  aCulicoides (Monoculicoides) grandensis Grogan and Phillips, a new species of biting midge is described and illustrated from Utah and compared with related species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aDiptera 0aCeratopogonidae 0aCulicoides (Monoculicoides) 0abiting midges 0anew species 0aUtah1 aPhillips, Robert A.0 tProceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington.g2008 Jan., v. 110, no. 1 p.196-203dThe Entomological Society of Washingtonx0013-87977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4289%2F0013-8797-110.1.1963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001400169245008000183300001800263520105500281592002801336650002901364650001601393650001201409650001001421650001201431650002401443650001301467650001301480650000701493650001801500650001601518650001801534650002701552650009201579650002601671650002501697650004501722650002701767650001401794650001601808700001701824700001101841700001801852700001501870773009901885856008601984852000902070655001202079IND4466979720221118075431.0141110e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446697972DNAL7 a214213012pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.02.0862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xin10aHydrogen production by the newly isolated Clostridium beijerinckii RZF-1108  ap. 8432-8436.  aA fermentative hydrogen-producing strain, RZF-1108, was isolated from a biohydrogen reactor, and identified as Clostridium beijerinckii on the basis of the 16S rRNA gene analysis and physiobiochemical characteristics. The effects of culture conditions on hydrogen production by C. beijerinckii RZF-1108 were investigated in batch cultures. The hydrogen production and growth of strain RZF-1108 were highly dependent on temperature, initial pH and substrate concentration. Yeast extract was a favorable nitrogen source for hydrogen production and growth of RZF-1108. Hydrogen production corresponded to cell biomass yield in different culture conditions. The maximum hydrogen evolution, yield and production rate of 2209ml H₂/l medium, 1.97mol H₂/mol glucose and 104.20ml H₂/g CDWh⁻¹ were obtained at 9g/l of glucose, initial pH of 7.0, inoculum volume of 8% and temperature of 35°C, respectively.

To highlight the benefits of CFDs for PAT studies, results from both experimental tests have been compared to better understand the reproduction error phenomena. For this, data analysis used in successful models has been applied to determine variables and parameters, and to report a low relative error. The results show that most of the studies focused on fixed speed rotation with some cases of variable speed rotation. Furthermore, there is not enough information in the academic literature for PAT of axial and mixed flows with fixed and variable speed. Finally, turbulence models based on Reynolds average Navier–Stokes (RANS) have been used to simulate PATs with fixed speed rotation in most cases.  aPublisher supplied data 3areproduction 3aturbulent flow 3awater1 aHidalgo, Victor 1 aLópez Jiménez, P.

This paper shows a study case study in which the dynamics of land use are analysed using a geographic information system applied to historical maps in order to evaluate the consequences of these land transformations over the last 179 years on the rural environment and landscape. The use of three-dimensional reconstructions, obtained through the creation of different digital terrain model, has allowed to appreciate the landscape modifications, in term of morphological and vegetation variation, determining its aesthetic quality. The analysis shows a common dynamic present in many rural areas of Southern Italy, i.e., the increase of agricultural areas replacing forested surfaces in an older period followed by the further phenomenon of spontaneous re-naturalisation of many of these areas, due to the abandonment of extensive cultivated areas. Moreover, through comparison with historical documents, it was possible to analyse how the agricultural activities influenced the quality of the forest ecosystem. The methodology employed in this study allows a detailed analysis of the processes that occurred in different rural context and the creation of appropriate tools for sustainable land management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaesthetics 3aagroforestry 3acartography 3acase studies 3acultivation area 3aforest ecosystems 3ageographic information systems 3ahumans 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amodels 3arural areas 3asustainable land management 3avegetation 3aItaly 0aRural land 0ageographic information system 0ahistorical maps 0aimage processing techniques 0alandscape analysis1 aCillis, Giuseppe1 aPicuno, Pietro0 tJournal of agricultural engineering.g2016 Mar. 08, v. 47, no. 1dPAGEPress Publications, Pavia, Italyx2239-62687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4081/jae.2016.4683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001300138245012000151300001400271520162900285592002801914650002701942650001301969650002201982650001802004650002102022650001102043650001302054650002102067650001302088650001202101650001102113650000702124650000902131650001802140700002402158700001602182773013902198856007202337852000902409655001202418IND60661864020221119094818.0190904e20040107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186402DNAL7 a10.1039/b310125h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHur, Jin10aEffects of organic ligands and pH on the leaching of copper from brake wear debris in model environmental solutions  ap. 89-94.  aCopper leaching from a disc brake wear debris sample was examined in a variety of aqueous solutions to simulate potential leaching processes during rain events and in surface waters. Synthetic rainwater leached 40% of the total copper present in the brake wear debris into solution after 18 h in batch reactors, which was approximately three times more copper than that extracted by the US Environmental Protection Agency's Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedure. Formate and acetate were responsible for the enhanced copper leaching, as demonstrated by higher average amounts of leached copper in synthetic rainwater with- versus without the organic acids (40 versus 31% recovery). This observation suggests leaching tests that do not incorporate the appropriate types and concentrations of organic ligands present in rainwater will likely underestimate copper mobilization from brake wear debris during rain events. Leaching of copper from the brake wear debris ranged from 23 to 40% in solutions containing 3 to 15 mg C L⁻¹ dissolved humic substances, and was higher still in solutions containing relatively high concentrations of the synthetic metal chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Static pH tests demonstrated that copper leaching from brake wear debris is highly pH dependent, with more leaching occurring at lower solution pH values. Leaching rate studies revealed that equilibrium generally was not attained within 48 h in the model solutions, indicating that additional copper can be expected to be released in environments where brake wear debris is exposed to long-term leaching processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aacetates 3aaqueous solutions 3abatch systems 3achelating agents 3acopper 3aformates 3ahumic substances 3aleaching 3aligands 3amodels 3apH 3arain 3asurface water1 aSchlautman, Mark A.1 aYim, Soobin0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Jan. 7, v. 6, no. 1 p.89-94dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b310125h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245009100163300001600254520161900270592002801889650001501917650002001932650001601952650001501968650002001983650002102003650001802024650001002042650002802052650001602080650001802096650000902114650003702123650004402160650002002204650002202224650001102246653002002257653001802277653001502295653002102310653001002331653001102341653000902352653000802361653001102369653001002380700001702390700002002407700001702427700001202444700001302456700001702469700001602486700001602502700001702518773012002535856008202655852000902737655001202746IND60528677920221123030656.0160716e20160513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052867792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.1562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xiaoju10aMEK1/2 inhibitors induce interleukin-5 expression in mouse macrophages and lymphocytes  ap. 939-946.  aUptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) by macrophages facilitates the formation of foam cells, the prominent part of atherosclerotic lesions. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a cytokine regulating interactions between immune cells. It also activates the production of T15/EO6 IgM antibodies in B-1 cells, which can bind oxLDL thereby demonstrating anti-atherogenic properties. We previously reported that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitors can reduce atherosclerosis. In this study, we determined the effects of MEK1/2 inhibitors on IL-5 production both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, MEK1/2 inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) substantially inhibited phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo, MEK1/2 inhibitors induced IL-5 protein expression in macrophages (RAW macrophages and peritoneal macrophages) and lymphocytes (EL-4 cells). In vivo, administration of mice with MEK1/2 inhibitors increased serum IL-5 levels, and IL-5 protein expression in mouse spleen and liver. At the mechanistic level, we determined that MEK1/2 inhibitors activated IL-5 mRNA expression and IL-5 promoter activity in the liver X receptor (LXR) dependent manner indicating the induction of IL-5 transcription. In addition, we determined that MEK1/2 inhibitors enhanced IL-5 protein stability. Taken together, our study demonstrates that MEK1/2 inhibitors induce IL-5 production which suggests another anti-atherogenic mechanism of MEK1/2 inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibodies 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3afoam cells 3agene expression 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainterleukin-5 3aliver 3alow density lipoprotein 3alymphocytes 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3aspleen 0aAtherosclerosis 0aInterleukin-5 0aMacrophage 0aMEK1/2 inhibitor 0aoxLDL 0aERK1/2 0aIL-5 0aLXR 0aMEK1/2 0aoxLDL1 aCao, Xingyue1 aZhang, Xiaomeng1 aKang, Yanhua1 aWenwen,1 aYu, Miao1 aMa, Chuanrui1 aHan, Jihong1 aDuan, Yajun1 aChen, Yuanli0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 May 13, v. 473 p.939-946dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.1563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013300166300001600299520137600315592002801691650003001719650001501749650002001764650002001784650001801804650001601822650001401838650002001852650002101872650001501893650001201908650002401920650002301944650001301967650001301980650002101993650001002014650002002024650002002044650001102064650001702075700002802092700002602120700001902146700001902165773012802184856008202312852000902394655001202403IND60516393420221121225314.0190727e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051639342DNAL7 a10.1017/S00144797110011892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPace, Roberta,10aGermination of untreated and primed seeds in rapeseed (brassica napus var oleifera del.) under salinity and low matric potential  ap. 238-251.  aSalt (NaCl) and matric stress (polyethylene glycol; PEG 6000) impacts on germination were analysed in two rapeseed (Brassica napus var oleifera Del.) cultivars (Exagone: salt and water stress tolerant; Toccata: salt and water stress sensitive), which had the same imbibition kinetics when incubated in distilled water. Final germination percentage (G) and time to reach 50% G (T50) were affected either by 325 mM NaCl or −0.9 MPa PEG in Toccata but not in Exagone. Cultivars did not differ for protein concentration and protease activity in any germination condition; thus, protein metabolism seems not to be implicated in response to stress. Hydroxurea and cytochalasine-D inhibited germination in Toccata exposed to −0.9 MPa PEG but not in Exagone, suggesting that Exagone tolerance could be due to a lower amount of damaged DNA and lower requirement for DNA replication due to cell elongation rather than cell division for radicle elongation. Soluble sugars concentration increased in salt-stressed seeds from Exagone more than in Toccata and this could have allowed osmotic adjustment and therefore cell elongation despite the presence of external NaCl. Priming treatments with gibberellic acid, kinetin, NaCl and PEG hastened seed germination under control conditions but had no effect or even negative effects on germination under both salt and matric stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aDNA damage 3aDNA replication 3aadverse effects 3acell division 3acell growth 3acultivars 3aenzyme activity 3agibberellic acid 3aimbibition 3akinetin 3apolyethylene glycol 3aprotein metabolism 3arapeseed 3asalinity 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asodium chloride 3astress response 3asugars 3awater stress1 aBenincasa, P.q(Paolo),1 aGHANEM, MICHEL EDMOND1 aQUINET, MURIEL1 aLUTTS, STANLEY0 tExperimental agriculture.g2012 Apr., v. 48, no. 2 p.238-251dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46155x1469-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00144797110011893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245007200160300001600232520212000248592002802368650001402396650001902410650001602429650003102445650001302476650001602489650002102505650001402526650001402540650001502554650002002569650001202589650003102601650001002632651001502642700001902657700001902676773014202695856007202837852000902909655001202918IND60661864220221119094941.0190904e20040121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186422DNAL7 a10.1039/b310351j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerfoot, Henry B.14aThe use of isotopes to identify landfill gas effects on groundwater  ap. 896-901.  aAn evaluation of the source of volatile organic compounds in groundwater samples was performed at a landfill in southern California. The ³H (tritium) content of the water in leachate and water from the gas-collection system (condensed water and entrained water droplets) and the δ ¹³C and ¹⁴C content of the inorganic carbon in landfill gas CO₂, leachate, and gas-collection system water were used to characterize the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) inside the landfill, while the same parameters were monitored in groundwater samples from affected monitoring wells and an unaffected well. Tritium levels from leachate and gas-collection system condensate ranged from approximately 2000 TU to over 4000 TU, orders of magnitude higher than unaffected groundwater. The average ¹⁴C content of DIC in the landfill pore-water samples was 121 pMC and the ¹⁴C content of unaffected groundwater DIC was 93 pMC, while the ¹⁴C content of the dissolved inorganic carbon in groundwater with VOC detections ranged from 105 to 119 pMC. The δ ¹³C of DIC in pore water was consistently above 0‰ and the δ ¹³C of unaffected groundwater DIC was −20.3‰, while the δ ¹³C of DIC in affected groundwater samples was increased from −17.3 to −13.2‰. The increases in both δ ¹³C and ¹⁴C in landfill gas-impacted groundwater DIC generally correlated with the number of volatile organic compounds detected and their concentrations. Based on the tritium and DIC ¹⁴C levels in leachate and water from the gas-collection system compared to those of unaffected water, significant increases in the tritium content of the water would be expected to accompany VOC detections and increases in δ ¹³C and ¹⁴C caused by landfill water. The results rule out landfill water as the VOC source, leaving landfill gas as the source. The identities and concentrations of the specific VOCs in affected groundwater samples varied among wells as well as between two leachate samples, ruling out the use of a VOC “fingerprint” for leachate or landfill gas to be compared to groundwater VOC concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 14 3acarbon dioxide 3acondensates 3adissolved inorganic carbon 3adroplets 3agroundwater 3ainorganic carbon 3alandfills 3aleachates 3amonitoring 3astable isotopes 3atritium 3avolatile organic compounds 3awells 3aCalifornia1 aBaker, John A.1 aBurt, David M.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Jan. 21, v. 5, no. 6 p.896-901dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b310351j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02568naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002700112245012900139300001600268520112500284592002801409650001401437650002501451650000901476650002301485650002001508650002401528650001701552650001101569650001601580650001401596650001501610651001001625653002101635653000801656653001401664653001501678653001801693700001501711700002101726700001801747700001601765700002001781700001401801700001401815700001301829700001501842773019601857852000902053655001202062IND60706284820221117161054.0201224e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070628482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaharia, Pabitra Kumar10aEconomic Impact of Bacterial Disease Caused by Motile Aeromonas (MAS) in Carp Culture Practices of Assam, India: An Analysis  ap. 245-250.  aThe study was carried out in three districts of Assam namely Nagaon, Morigaon and Sonitpur to estimate the economic loss in carp culture due to Motile Aeromonas septicemia (MAS) during 2016–18. A total of 91 small, medium and large farms were found to be affected by MAS out of 293 farms surveyed on the basis of information on occurrence of disease. The result revealed that highest mortality and maximum loss in income was observed in small pond category (<0.2 ha) where mean mortality 9.22 per cent was recorded in Nagaon district followed by Morigaon 9.14 per cent and Sonitpur 4.00 per cent. Similarly, mean loss in income (Rs/ha/yr) was highest in Nagaon district Rs. 23304.24 followed by Morigaon Rs. 19532.14 and Sonitpur Rs. 11304.56. The overall mean economic loss for the district under studies due to MAS was recorded to be Rs. 16031.32 ha/yr with a mean loss in weight 158.92 kg/ha/yr. This clearly depicts that mean financial loss of Rs. 16031.32 kg/ha/yr has been reported due to MAS in the three district under study. Thus it was found that MAS has significant impact in carpculture practices of Assam.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeromonas 3abacterial infections 3acarp 3adisease occurrence 3aeconomic impact 3afinancial economics 3afish culture 3aincome 3alarge farms 3amortality 3asepticemia 3aIndia 0aMotile Aeromonas 0aMAS 0aMortality 0aProduction 0aEconomic loss1 aKalita, B.1 aBhuyan, Sonmoina1 aHussain, I.A.1 aPokhral, H.1 aBhagabati, S.K.1 aDutta, R.1 aBorah, A.1 aBora, G.1 aSharma, R.0 tJournal of Community Mobilization and Sustainable Development.g2019 May, v. 14, no. 2 p.245-250dSociety for Community Mobilization for Sustainable DevelopmentwJournal:2289x2231-67367nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04170naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245010600210300001800316500001500334520197200349592002802321650001702349650001402366650003102380650001502411650001502426650001002441650001102451650001302462650001502475650000902490650001102499650001602510650001502526650001102541650004602552650002502598650002002623650002702643650003102670650001502701650003702716650004802753650002202801650001502823650005902838650001102897650004702908650003902955650003202994650002703026650002603053650002703079653001903106653001003125700001703135700001503152700002303167700001603190700002403206773009303230856008103323990002303404852000903427655001203436IND60094054420221120112708.0141104e20131202xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009405442DNAL7 a242684172pmid7 aPMC41166392pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2013.10.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajkut, Stephanie10aHeart-Specific Stiffening in Early Embryos Parallels Matrix and Myosin Expression to Optimize Beating  ap. 2434-2439.  a2019-12-06  aIn development and differentiation, morphological changes often accompany mechanical changes [1], but it is unclear whether or when cells in embryos sense tissue elasticity. The earliest embryo is uniformly pliable, while adult tissues vary widely in mechanics from soft brain and stiff heart to rigid bone [2]. However, cell sensitivity to microenvironment elasticity is debated based in part on results from complex three-dimensional culture models [3]. Regenerative cardiology provides strong motivation to clarify any cell-level sensitivities to tissue elasticity because rigid postinfarct regions limit pumping by the adult heart [4]. Here, we focus on the spontaneously beating embryonic heart and sparsely cultured cardiomyocytes, including cells derived from pluripotent stem cells. Tissue elasticity, Eₜ, increases daily for heart to 1–2 kPa by embryonic day 4 (E4), and although this is ∼10-fold softer than adult heart, the beating contractions of E4 cardiomyocytes prove optimal at ∼Eₜ,E₄ both in vivo and in vitro. Proteomics reveals daily increases in a small subset of proteins, namely collagen plus cardiac-specific excitation-contraction proteins. Rapid softening of the heart’s matrix with collagenase or stiffening it with enzymatic crosslinking suppresses beating. Sparsely cultured E4 cardiomyocytes on collagen-coated gels likewise show maximal contraction on matrices with native E4 stiffness, highlighting cell-intrinsic mechanosensitivity. While an optimal elasticity for striation proves consistent with the mathematics of force-driven sarcomere registration, contraction wave speed is linear in Eₜ as theorized for excitation-contraction coupled to matrix elasticity. Pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes also prove to be mechanosensitive to matrix and thus generalize the main observation that myosin II organization and contractile function are optimally matched to the load contributed by matrix elasticity.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrosslinking 3amechanics 3amathematics and statistics 3amotivation 3asarcomeres 3abrain 3amodels 3acollagen 3astem cells 3agels 3amyosin 3acollagenase 3aproteomics 3aadults 2aCardiac Myosinsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aCell Differentiation 2aCells, Cultured 2aCollagenxbiosynthesis 2aCollagenasesxpharmacology 2aElasticity 2aEmbryonic Stem Cellsxmetabolism 2aExtracellular Matrix Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aHeartxembryology 2aHeart Rate 2aHeterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Ringsxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aInduced Pluripotent Stem Cellsxmetabolism 2aMyocardial Contractionxphysiology 2aMyocytes, Cardiacxcytology 2aMyofibrilsxphysiology 2aMyosinsxbiosynthesis 2aSarcomeresxphysiology 0acardiomyocytes 0aheart1 aIdema, Timon1 aSwift, Joe1 aKrieger, Christine1 aLiu, Andrea1 aDischer, Dennis E.0 tCurrent biology.g2013 Dec. 2, v. 23, no. 23 p.2434-2439dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2013.10.0573Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01536naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245009200170300001400262520054500276592002800821653001400849653001300863653001700876653001500893653001600908653001100924700002700935700001500962773015200977856008401129852000901213655001201222IND60130977220221118111410.0151127e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013097722DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797-110.1.612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchaefer, Carl W.12aA New Species of Leptoglossus (Hemiptera: Coreidae: Coreinae: Anisoscelini) from Brazil  ap. 61-66.  aLeptoglossus katiae Schaefer and Packauskas, n. sp., is described from northeastern Brazil.

We consider the case where the real-time measurement of the actuation level is unavailable, and thus PID controller monitoring has to be achieved on the basis of process state measurements. A fault detection and isolation (FDI) method involving process models and real-time process measurements is used to monitor the PID control loops and compute appropriate residuals. Once poor tuning is detected and isolated, a PID tuning method based on the estimated transfer function of the control actuator is applied to the isolated, poorly functioning PID controller. An example of a non-linear reactor–separator process operating under MPC with low-level PID controllers regulating the control actuators is used to demonstrate the approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3acontrollers 3amodels 3amonitoring1 aChilin, David1 aLiu, Jinfeng1 aDavis, James F.1 aChristofides, Panagiotis D.0 tChemical engineering science.g2012 Feb. 13, v. 69, no. 1 p.287-295dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2011.10.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03941naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245012400184300001600308520163600324592002801960650002001988650003002008650002502038650001702063650001602080650001402096650001402110650001102124650001502135650002002150650001002170650001802180650002502198650002202223650001302245650001302258650001802271650004102289650003502330650004502365650004602410650004402456650003802500650001702538650004602555650005902601650001402660650004202674650004202716650003802758650001802796700001802814700002002832700002002852700001802872700001802890700001802908700002002926700001502946700002202961700001802983700001903001700001803020773010003038856004803138852000903186655001203195IND4469464520221118075730.0120607e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446946452DNAL7 a225809552pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-012-9919-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHyun, Tae Kyung13aDe novo transcriptome sequencing of Momordica cochinchinensis to identify genes involved in the carotenoid biosynthesis  ap. 413-427.  aThe ripe fruit of Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng, known as gac, is featured by very high carotenoid content. Although this plant might be a good resource for carotenoid metabolic engineering, so far, the genes involved in the carotenoid metabolic pathways in gac were unidentified due to lack of genomic information in the public database. In order to expedite the process of gene discovery, we have undertaken Illumina deep sequencing of mRNA prepared from aril of gac fruit. From 51,446,670 high-quality reads, we obtained 81,404 assembled unigenes with average length of 388 base pairs. At the protein level, gac aril transcripts showed about 81.5 % similarity with cucumber proteomes. In addition 17,104 unigenes have been assigned to specific metabolic pathways in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and all of known enzymes involved in terpenoid backbones biosynthetic and carotenoid biosynthetic pathways were also identified in our library. To analyze the relationship between putative carotenoid biosynthesis genes and alteration of carotenoid content during fruit ripening, digital gene expression analysis was performed on three different ripening stages of aril. This study has revealed putative phytoene synthase, 15-cis-phytone desaturase, zeta-carotene desaturase, carotenoid isomerase and lycopene epsilon cyclase might be key factors for controlling carotenoid contents during aril ripening. Taken together, this study has also made availability of a large gene database. This unique information for gac gene discovery would be helpful to facilitate functional studies for improving carotenoid quantities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3aMomordica cochinchinensis 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acarotenoids 3acucumbers 3adatabases 3afruits 3agene banks 3agene expression 3agenes 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aphytoene synthase 3aproteins 3aripening 3atranscriptome 2aCarotenoidsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aEnzymesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFruitxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Developmental 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMetabolic Networks and Pathwaysxgenetics 2aMomordicaxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Plantxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscriptome1 aRim, Yeonggil1 aJang, Hui-Jeong1 aKim, Cheol Hong1 aPark, Jongsun1 aKumar, Ritesh1 aLee, Sunghoon1 aKim, Byung Chul1 aBhak, Jong1 aNguyen-Quoc, Binh1 aKim, Seon-Won1 aLee, Sang Yeol1 aKim, Jae-Yean0 tPlant molecular biology.g2012 July, v. 79, no. 4-5 p.413-427dSpringer-Verlagx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-012-9919-9  aDNAL 7aarticle03057naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011600164300001600280520151500296592002801811650002101839650001301860650002501873650001401898650001501912650001601927650001401943650001401957650001601971650001201987650002101999650001002020650001902030650001102049650002202060650001202082653000902094653002902103653003202132653002902164700001202193700001502205700001702220700001702237700001702254700001602271700001702287773012002304856008202424852000902506655001202515IND60528678220221123030824.0160716e20160513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052867822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhuang, Lin10aIschemic Preconditioning protects hepatocytes from ischemia-reperfusion injury via TGR5-mediated anti-apoptosis  ap. 966-972.  aIschemic preconditioning (IP) has been shown to protect hepatic tissue from liver ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). TGR5, as a new-type bile acid receptor, has been shown protective roles in several liver diseases. However, the relationship between TGR5 and IP is still unknown. This study investigated effects of IP on TGR5 as well as the roles of TGR5 on hepatic tissue lesions and apoptosis in liver IRI. We showed that TGR5 was significantly upregulated in liver tissues after IP. To further analyzed effects of the TGR5 on liver IRI, wild type and TGR5 knockout mice were used to establish the liver IRI model. IP effectively alleviated liver IRI, but TGR5 deficiency significantly neutralized IP-related liver protection, as evidenced by serum alanine aminotransferase levels, histological liver damage, hepatocellular apoptosis and cytokines expressions. In addition, molecules related to apoptosis were detected by Western Blot, which showed that activation of TGR5 by IP increased expression of Bcl-2, and inhibited expressions of IRAK4 and cleaved caspase-3, but TGR5 deficiency abolished IP-induced expressions of anti-apoptosis molecule. In vitro, effects of TGR5 on hepatocytes were further analyzed by TGR5 agonist (INT-777) and hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R), which displayed that INT-777 markedly attenuated H/R-induced hepatocellular apoptosis. In conclusion, our study indicates that IP alleviates hepatocellular apoptosis, and reduces liver IRI through TGR5-mediated anti-apoptosis functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aagonists 3aalanine transaminase 3aapoptosis 3abile acids 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acytokines 3ahepatocytes 3ahypoxia 3aknockout mutants 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amodels 3aprotective effect 3atissues 0aTGR5 0aIschemic preconditioning 0aIschemia-reperfusion injury 0aHepatocellular apoptosis1 aFan, Ye1 aLü, Ling,1 aDing, Wenbin1 aNi, Chuangye1 aWang, Xuehao1 aZhang, Feng1 aRao, Jianhua0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 May 13, v. 473 p.966-972dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.03.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245010100160300001600261520173900277592002802016650002102044650001702065650001902082650000802101650001902109650002802128650001302156650001402169650002302183650001002206650001602216650001202232650001802244650001002262650001102272650001402283650001302297650001602310650001102326650002302337700002102360700001802381700002102399700002002420773014202440856007202582852000902654655001202663IND60661864520221119094829.0190904e20040331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066186452DNAL7 a10.1039/b310964j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfäffli, Pirkko,10aExposure to methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) in two workplaces of the electric industry  ap. 295-299.  aMethylhexahydrophthalic anhydride (MHHPA) is a hardener for hot-cured epoxy resins employed as insulators in the electric industry. MHHPA has only been measured as an ingredient with other alicyclic anhydrides, albeit there are also large processes which use only MHHPA. We collected MHHPA vapour in a set of devices: Teflon® filter, glass spiral, TenaxTA® tube connected consecutively together. Elution was performed with a solvent mixture of methyl-tert-butyl ether (70%), acetonitrile (30%), and acetic anhydride (0.5%). By capillary GC-ECD, the regression was linear (0.9994) in the practical low concentration range of 0.04–1 µg ml⁻¹ being equal to 0.001–0.035 mg m⁻³ in 30 l of air. The exposure was measured in two factories manufacturing electric appliances. The assembled objects were first impregnated with a liquid epoxy/hardener mixture, and then the resin hardened at elevated temperature. In condenser manufacturing, the operators' 8 h exposure ranged from 0.068 to 0.118 mg m⁻³, and the short-term exposure was during operation at ovens mean 1.90 mg m⁻³. The impregnation of coiled resistors and transfer of them to ovens caused the worst exposures, short-term mean 3.846 mg m⁻³ and long-term mean 2.191 mg m⁻³. During the ‘baking’, the ovens were closed and evacuated, but when the hot objects were moved out of the ovens, they continued during chilling to emit MHHPA, mean 0.366 mg m⁻³. In the adjacent areas, assembling, control rooms, offices, the exposure was still significant, 0.017–0.043 mg m³, due to leaks from the high exposure areas. Mechanical general ventilation and local exhausts were functioning. Respirators were available for short supervising of the hot equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic anhydride 3aacetonitrile 3aacute exposure 3aair 3acold treatment 3aelectric power industry 3aepoxides 3afactories 3agas chromatography 3aglass 3aingredients 3aliquids 3amanufacturing 3aovens 3aresins 3aresistors 3asolvents 3atemperature 3avapors 3aworking conditions1 aHämeilä, Mervi1 aRiala, Riitta1 aTornaeus, Jarkko1 aWirmoila, Ritva0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Mar. 31, v. 6, no. 4 p.295-299dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b310964j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245017700171300001300348520142400361592002801785650003001813650002201843650001001865650002301875650001101898650001401909650001401923650003001937650001801967650001801985650002202003651001002025700002902035700002502064700002202089773011202111856005502223852000902278655001202287IND4468430120221118075729.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446843012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.2011.01847.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehdi, Azadvar10aSequence Analysis of 16S rRNA and secA Genes Confirms the Association of 16SrIâB Subgroup Phytoplasma with Oil Palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.)

Leaf samples of symptomatic oil palms were collected, and the presence of phytoplasma was confirmed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal phytoplasmaâspecific primer pairs P1/P7 followed by R16F2n/R16R2 for amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and semiânested PCR using universal phytoplasmaâspecific primer pairs SecAfor1/SecArev3 followed by SecAfor2/SecArev3 for amplification of a part of the secA gene. Sequencing and BLAST analysis of the â¼1.25âkb and â¼480âbp of 16S rDNA and secA gene fragments indicated that the phytoplasma associated with oil palm stunting (OPS) disease was identical to 16SrI aster yellows group phytoplasma.

Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA and secA of OPS phytoplasma also grouped it with 16SrIâB. This is the first report of association of phytoplasma of the 16SrIâB subgroup phytoplasma with oil palm in the world.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAster yellows phytoplasma 3aElaeis guineensis 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3apalm oils 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aIndia1 aBaranwal, Virendra Kumar1 aKochu Babu, Madhavan1 aPraveena, Deepthi0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g2012 Jan., v. 160, no. 1 p.6-12dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.2011.01847.x  aDNAL 7aarticle03515naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017600159520236000335592002802695650002002723650001502743650001402758650001502772650001702787650002202804650001102826650001302837650001102850650001102861650001502872651001502887700001902902700001802921773012002939856007303059852000903132655001203141IND60746799420221120041021.0210806e20210803xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074679942DNAL7 a10.3390/w131521392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutton, Paul H.10aSupporting Restoration Decisions through Integration of Tree-Ring and Modeling Data: Reconstructing Flow and Salinity in the San Francisco Estuary over the Past Millennium  aThis work presents updated reconstructions of watershed runoff to San Francisco Estuary from tree-ring data to AD 903, coupled with models relating runoff to freshwater flow to the estuary and salinity intrusion. We characterize pre-development freshwater flow and salinity conditions in the estuary over the past millennium and compare this characterization with contemporary conditions to better understand the magnitude and seasonality of changes over this time. This work shows that the instrumented flow record spans the range of runoff patterns over the past millennium (averaged over 5, 10, 20 and 100 years), and thus serves as a reasonable basis for planning-level evaluations of historical hydrologic conditions in the estuary. Over annual timescales we show that, although median freshwater flow to the estuary has not changed significantly, it has been more variable over the past century compared to pre-development flow conditions. We further show that the contemporary period is generally associated with greater spring salinity intrusion and lesser summer–fall salinity intrusion relative to the pre-development period. Thus, salinity intrusion in summer and fall months was a common occurrence under pre-development conditions and has been moderated in the contemporary period due to the operations of upstream reservoirs, which were designed to hold winter and spring runoff for release in summer and fall. This work also confirms a dramatic decadal-scale hydrologic shift in the watershed from very wet to very dry conditions during the late 19th and early 20th centuries; while not unprecedented, these shifts have been seen only a few times in the past millennium. This shift resulted in an increase in salinity intrusion in the first three decades of the 20th century, as documented through early records. Population growth and extensive watershed modification during this period exacerbated this underlying hydrologic shift. Putting this shift in the context of other anthropogenic drivers is important in understanding the historical response of the estuary and in setting salinity targets for estuarine restoration. By characterizing the long-term behavior of San Francisco Estuary, this work supports decision-making in the State of California related to flow and salinity management for restoration of the estuarine ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3afreshwater 3agrowth rings 3apopulation growth 3arunoff 3asalinity 3aspring 3asummer 3awatersheds 3aCalifornia1 aMeko, David M.1 aRoy, Sujoy B.0 tWater.g2021 Aug. 03, v. 13, no. 15dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w131521393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001800112245008800130300001600218520073400234592002800968650001900996650001201015650001701027651001001044653001601054653001901070653001701089653003501106653002101141653001901162653001201181653001901193653001801212700002201230700001601252700003101268773019601299852000901495655001201504IND60706285220221122075735.0201224e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070628522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoni, Shalini10aWorking Women's Perspective on Sustainable Practices for Management of Menstruation  ap. 267-270.  aMore the technological advancements more are the options available to women for management of menstruation like sanitary napkins, tampons, menstrual cups, reusable cloth napkins, menstrual under wear.

The kinetic method was demonstrated to be free from interferences due to colour and turbidity normally observed when testing wastewater samples with this organism. This is of great importance for the application of the method to remote toxicity screening of wastewaters. The effect of colour, investigated using 50 ppm Zn²⁺ solutions containing the food-dye tropaeolin O, and the effect of turbidity, investigated using 50 ppm Zn²⁺ solutions containing white optically reflective and coloured optically absorbing polystyrene beads, is reported. It was also found that the design of the light detection system of the instrument ensures efficient collection of the light scattered by particles in the sample, which enables a greater range of turbid samples to be tested. In addition the natural light decay was found to be negligible during the duration of a 10 min test and thus one channel would be enough to carry out the tests. This would mean halving the quantity of bacterial reagent used and reducing the cost of the tests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio fischeri 3acolor 3afood colorants 3amonitoring 3apolystyrenes 3ascreening 3asolar radiation 3atoxicity 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3azinc1 aTreves Brown, Bernard J.1 aSnook, Richard D.0 tJournal of environmental monitoring.g2004 Feb. 4, v. 6, no. 2 p.97-102dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:27191x1464-03337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b311137g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02408naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012000161300001600281520102800297592002801325650001701353650001901370650001401389650001101403650001401414650002101428650001301449650001301462650001801475650001101493650001301504650001101517650001401528650001301542653001101555653002101566653002401587653001401611700001301625700001201638700001601650700001701666700001201683700001301695773010201708856008301810852000901893655001201902IND60678189720221119144440.0200330e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067818972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bo10aHost-guest chemistry immobilized nickel nanoparticles on zeolites as efficient catalysts for amination of 1-octanol  ap. 443-453.  aNickel silicate and NiAl-LDHs (layered double-hydroxides) have been controllably fabricated on the crystal surface of Si-rich and Al-rich USY zeolites, respectively, through a distinctive in-situ hydrothermal growth approach. This was realized by the host-guest chemistry that induced chemoselective interactions between adscititious Ni source and constituent species of zeolite framework. Upon hydrogen reduction, nickel silicate and NiAl-LDHs were transformed to highly dispersed Ni nanoparticles (NPs) immobilized in the SiO₂ and Al₂O₃ matrix, respectively, which were firmly anchored around the USY crystals. The controllable immobilization of Ni NPs created well preserved hierarchical porosity in USY zeolites. With highly dispersed metallic Ni active sites in Al₂O₃ matrix supported on USY zeolite, the USY@Ni-3 catalyst exhibited similar conversion but significantly enhanced selectivity in the reductive amination of 1-octanol to corresponding alkylamines in comparison to conventional Raney Ni catalyst.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aaluminum oxide 3aamination 3aamines 3acatalysts 3achemoselectivity 3acrystals 3ahydrogen 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3aporosity 3asilica 3asilicates 3azeolites 0aUSY@Ni 0aNi nanoparticles 0aReductive amination 0a1-octanol1 aDing, Yu1 aLu, Kun1 aGuan, Yejun1 aLi, Xiaohong1 aXu, Hao1 aWu, Peng0 tJournal of catalysis.g2020 Jan., v. 381 p.443-453dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2019.11.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01964naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245011900172300001600291520083500307592002801142650001901170650002201189650001001211650002101221651001501242651001601257653002301273653002101296653002301317653002001340700001801360700001901378773011001397856008601507852000901593655001201602IND60744154920221120103610.0210925e20210519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074415492DNAL7 a10.1080/02508060.2021.19110692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlphen, Jos van,10aStrategies for climate change adaptation: lessons learnt from long-term planning in the Netherlands and Bangladesh  ap. 477-504.  aThis paper evaluates long-term climate change adaptation strategies in the Netherlands and Bangladesh using the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (OECD) Principles of Good Water Governance. Deltas face complex challenges, and adequate long-term planning is essential for these regions. However, experience with these long-term planning efforts and linkages with theoretical frameworks on water-related policy and strategy development remain limited. Both countries politically approved significant investment portfolios for a durable adaptive strategy. This paper highlights the similarities and differences in the resulting strategies. Using the learning assessment methodology, we propose to add risk-based approaches and long-term strategic perspectives as additional OECD Principles in the conclusion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3awater 3awater management 3aBangladesh 3aNetherlands 0aClimate adaptation 0awater governance 0along-term planning 0athe Netherlands1 ade Heer, Jaap1 aMinkman, Ellen0 tWater international.g2021 May 19, v. 46, no. 4 p.477-504dRoutledgewJournal:J000000164x1941-17077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02508060.2021.19110693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03294naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016400169500001900333520193000352592002802282650002402310650001602334650001502350650001502365650004102380650002202421650001702443650001702460650002202477650001302499650001102512700002102523700006302544700002802607700001702635700002402652773011402676856008502790852000902875655001202884IND60720500520221119013030.0210114e20210111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072050052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4617842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, John T.10aImproving Quantification of tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin, and sulfur mustard by focusing agents: A field portable gas chromatography-mass spectrometry study  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCommercial gas chromatograph-mass spectrometers, one of which being Inficon's HAPSITE® ER, have demonstrated chemical detection and identification of nerve agents (G-series) and blistering agents (mustard gas) in the field; however most analyses relies on self-contained or external calibration that inherently drifts over time. We describe an analytical approach that uses target-based thermal desorption standards, called focusing agents, to accurately calculate concentrations of chemical warfare agents that are analyzed by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry. Here, we provide relative response factors of focusing agents (2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, diethyl methylphosphonate, diethyl malonate, methyl salicylate, and dichlorvos) that are used to quantify concentrations of tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin and sulfur mustard loaded on thermal desorption tubes (Tenax® TA). Aging effects of focusing agents are evaluated by monitoring deviations in quantification as thermal desorption tubes age in storage at room temperature and relative humidity. The addition of focusing agents improves the quantification of tabun, sarin, soman, cyclosarin and sulfur mustard that is analyzed within the same day as well as a 14-day period. Among the six focusing agents studied here, diisopropyl fluorophosphate has the best performance for nerve agents (G-series) and blistering agents (mustard gas) compared to other focusing agents in this work and is recommended for field use for quantification. The use of focusing agent in the field leads to more accurate and reliable quantification of Tabun (GA), Sarin (GB), Soman (GD), Cyclosarin (GF) and Sulfur Mustard (HD) than the traditional internal standard. Future improvements on the detection of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive materials (CBRNE) can be safely demonstrated with standards calibrated for harmful agents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acalibration 3adesorption 3adichlorvos 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3amethyl salicylate 3anerve agents 3anerve tissue 3arelative humidity 3asulfides 3asulfur1 aQualley, Anthony1 aHughes, Geoffrey T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4185-99841 aRubenstein, Mitchell H.1 aMalloy, Tom,1 aPiatkowski, Tedeusz0 tJournal of chromatography.g2021 Jan. 11, v. 1636 p.461784-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4617843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03329naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100003000162245014200192300001600334500002400350500001500374520175000389650001902139650002202158650002802180650002002208650002402228650001902252650001002271650001402281650001602295650001102311650001702322653002402339653002302363653001602386653001702402653001802419653002602437653002302463700001902486773013902505852000902644856007502653930003302728945002502761946001302786655001202799IND4439563120221122035330.0100706e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443956312DNAL7 a10.1603/AN100162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL700 0aL400 0aL0011 aMermudes, Jose Ricardo M.10aDescription of Males of Ptychoderes brevis and Ptychoderes jekeli, with a Cladistical Reanalysis of Ptychoderes (Coleoptera: Anthribidae)  ap. 523-531.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA recent study of the material housed in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle (Paris, France) provided new information to describe and illustrate the males of Ptychoderes brevis Jordan and Ptychoderes jekeli Mermudes & Napp (Coleoptera; Anthribidae). These males were previously unknown, and their characters had never been studied by the cladistical method. A reanalysis of the genus was carried out, which included 50 characters and 24 taxa (seven as outgroup). The resulting single most-parsimonious cladogram corroborates previous hypotheses of the relationships among the genera of Ptychoderini and groups of Ptychoderes species. The male of P. brevis is characterized by; rostrum 1.5× longer than wide across base; sides not swollen between scrobe and eye; scrobe with a deep narrow extension and a deep distal pit; antennae elongated, reaching middle of elytra; ventrite I swollen, with moderately developed setiferous sex patch, closer to apical margin, clothed with dense yellow pilosity; and ventrite V with lateroapical projections not acuminate. The male of P. jekeli has rostrum slightly longer than wide across base; sides not swollen and the extension shallow; antennae exceeding apical elytron by segment XI; ventrite I with well developed setiferous sex patch, closer to apical margin and with olive green pilosity; and ventrite V strongly impressed, with lateroapical angles not projected and somewhat expanded. The relationship between P. brevis and P. jekeli was confirmed, and this group belongs to the P. crustatus+, corroborating the most basal lineage by the vestiture of the sides of prosternum with a vitta of the same color as the dorsal vestiture, and elytra transversely impressed behind the basal gibbosities. 3ainsect anatomy 3ainsect morphology 3ainterspecific variation 3ainsect taxonomy 3ataxonomic revisions 3aredescriptions 3amales 3aphylogeny 3aAnthribidae 3aimagos 3abiogeography 0aspecies differences 0aPtychoderes brevis 0aPtychoderes 0aPtychoderini 0aadult insects 0aPtychoderes crustatus 0aPtychoderes jekeli1 aMattos, Ingrid0 tAnnals of the Entomological Society of America.g2010 July, v. 103, no. 4 p.523-531dEntomological Society of Americax0013-87467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN100163Available from publisher's Web site  a20100920b20101001c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/08/19  aOther US 7aarticle02789naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245013800163300002000301500001900321520152100340592002801861650001301889650002201902650002801924650001201952650001201964650001301976650000901989650001401998650001902012650001702031650001602048700005902064700001802123773017302141856008002314852000902394655001202403IND60704239320221121090924.0200722e20200624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070423932DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.iecr.0c016652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Hongna10aProbing the Effects of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and SO₄²– on Calcite–Oil Interactions by “Soft Tip” Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)  ap. 13069-13078.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe interactions of crude oil with calcite surface are influenced by the Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and SO₄²– ions in the aqueous solution in the context of wettability alteration and enhanced oil recovery; however, their effects are not well understood from the fundamental perspective. The force spectroscopy techniques that measure the attractive and repulsive forces between oil droplets and solid surfaces are crucial in developing this understanding. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and SO₄²– ions on calcite–oil interactions by immobilizing a droplet of crude oil to a tipless cantilever and used this “soft tip” to probe the calcite surface in different salt solutions with atomic force microscopy (AFM). The force behaviors at approach curves and the adhesion values at retract curves showed that the attractive calcite–oil interactions in the NaCl solution were enhanced by Mg²⁺ ions while the attractive interactions were mitigated by Ca²⁺ ions. In contrast, the calcite–oil interactions became repulsive in the presence of SO₄²– ions with an observation of small adhesions in the Na₂SO₄ solution. The adhesion works were correlated to the “effective contact angles” to evaluate the effects of Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and SO₄²– ions on calcite wettability. The results suggested that the Mg²⁺ ions made the calcite surface more oil-wet but the Ca²⁺ and SO₄²– ions made the calcite surface more water-wet compared to indifferent ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3acalcite 3acalcium 3adroplets 3aoils 3apetroleum 3aprocess design 3aspectroscopy 3awettability1 aMettu, Srinivas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8645-88181 aRahman, Sheik0 tIndustrial & engineering chemistry process design and development.g2020 June 24, v. 59, no. 29 p.13069-13078dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23342x1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.iecr.0c016653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009100167300001400258520217200272592002802444650001602472650002002488650001302508650002302521650002202544650002202566650001502588651001002603700001902613700002302632700002402655773010202679856008102781852000902862655001202871IND4477234320221118235835.0141111e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447723432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2011.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSantoro, Riccardo10aFocal species diversity patterns can provide diagnostic information on plant invasions  ap. 85-91.  aIn Europe, coastal sandy habitats are considered highly endangered among those included in the EC Directive 92/43/EEC (Habitats Directive). Among the different threats which affect coastal communities, the spread of alien plants has been claimed to induce changes in community diversity and structure. We therefore set out to analyse diversity patterns of native and focal species (diagnostic and characteristic of coastal dune habitats of European conservation interest) in sandy coastal habitats invaded by Carpobrotus aff. acinaciformis, a widespread alien plant. Focal species are a major conservation target for the Habitats Directive and their decline should be considered a serious threat for the whole habitat. The study was performed in the Central Western coast of Italy. We randomly sampled the vegetation of the holocenic dune by 2m×2m plots. First we split the collected data in two sets: invaded and non-invaded. We compared overall native and focal species richness patterns of the two sets by rarefaction curves. Then, in order to describe the singular aspects of species diversity (e.g. richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, Berger–Parker index), we also compared Rènyi's diversity profiles and we tested the significance of the differences between invaded and non invaded sets using a bootstrap procedure. Rarefaction curves of the non-invaded set rise quickly and reach higher accumulation values than the invaded set, but differences between the two curves were not significant. With respect to Rènyi's profiles, the profile for the invaded dataset was always below the non-invaded one, but differences in diversity were significant only when specifically considering the focal species (Shannon, Simpson and Berger–Parker indices). In the analysed case, the invasion is significantly associated with changes in focal species diversity, instead those differences are not evident on the all native species pool. In the case of recent invasions, a consistent decline on focal species diversity may represent an early alarm sign of diversity loss and may help define specific conservation actions to prevent the decrease of overall diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpobrotus 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3aItaly1 aCarboni, Marta1 aCarranza, Maria L.1 aAcosta, Alicia T.R.0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2012 Mar., v. 20, no. 2 p.85-91dElsevier GmbHx1617-13817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2011.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03820naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002200144245018100166300001600347520241200363592002802775650000802803650002002811650002802831650001502859650001302874650003802887650001002925650001002935650002102945650004302966653002803009653001403037653002103051653002903072700001303101700002403114700002003138773015203158856007903310852000903389655001203398IND60561735320221117221131.0190318e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056173532DNAL7 a10.3168/jds.2016-113842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFock-Chow-Tho, D.10aComparison of commercial DNA extraction kits and quantitative PCR systems for better sensitivity in detecting the causative agent of paratuberculosis in dairy cow fecal samples  ap. 572-581.  aMycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) causes ruminant paratuberculosis (Johne’s disease) worldwide. Oral-fecal contamination is the most important mode of transmission of paratuberculosis, so eradicating MAP-shedding animals could prevent disease propagation. Fecal culture, a well-known method for MAP diagnosis, requires costly specialized media and a long incubation time that sometimes ends in disappointing bacterial contamination. To facilitate the efforts of control programs, we evaluated the performance of direct fecal quantitative PCR (qPCR) assays for their sensitivity and robustness for MAP detection. Commercial kits use different strategies for extracting DNA, combined with qPCR systems, to detect the presence of MAP in fecal samples. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of 3 commercially available DNA extraction kits (A, B, and C) combined with 2 qPCR systems (T and V) for the detection of MAP in infectious cows. A total of 49 dairy cows from 5 herds were sampled twice a year for 3 yr and diagnosed using fecal culture and ELISA. Eight replicates of their fecal samples from the first sampling were tested using each DNA extraction method and qPCR detection system. Although all 3 of the commercial DNA extraction kits have been previously described as very efficient for the diagnosis of paratuberculosis, kit B provided the highest sensitivity. Indeed, 89% of the cows declared positive for paratuberculosis by both fecal culture and ELISA were identified with kit B, whereas only 23 and 43% of the cows were identified with kits A and C, respectively. Interestingly, kit B was able to detect some low-MAP shedders. The qPCR detection system also played a critical role: system T yielded qPCR with the highest sensitivity. The results of this study suggest that DNA extraction kit B combined with detection system T provides the best amplification of MAP DNA from fecal samples with the highest sensitivity and specificity. Although 1 DNA extraction and qPCR analysis should be adequate to confirm that an animal with diarrhea or other signs of paratuberculosis is positive, detecting low shedders at the highest sensitivity should include repetitive testing. This study demonstrates the importance of repetitions using the most appropriate method for extracting DNA from fecal samples, combined with a compatible qPCR system for identifying MAP-shedding animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aanalytical kits 3abacterial contamination 3adairy cows 3adiarrhea 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeces 3aherds 3aparatuberculosis 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0abovine paratuberculosis 0adiagnosis 0aquantitative PCR 0afecal DNA extraction kit1 aTopp, E.1 aIbeagha-Awemu, E.A.1 aBissonnette, N.0 tJournal of dairy science.g2017 Jan., v. 100, no. 1 p.572-581dElsevier Inc.aAmerican Dairy Science AssociationwJournal:jnl45500x0022-03027nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2016-113843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03029naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094024002200134024001900156040001800175100002400193245020700217300001200424506007600436520167500512592002802187506003702215650001502252650001202267650002102279650002002300650001302320650001002333650001102343650000802354650000902362650001202371650001202383650001802395700001902413773008002432856008602512852000902598655001202607IND60096244520221207062245.0141104e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009624452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cryobiol.2010.10.1592doi7 aPMC30418612pmcid7 a210553972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazur, P.q(Peter),10aSurvival of mouse oocytes after being cooled in a vitrification solution to −196°C at 95° to 70,000°C/min and warmed at 610° to 118,000°C/min: A new paradigm for cryopreservation by vitrification  ap. 1-7.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThere is great interest in achieving reproducibly high survivals of mammalian oocytes (especially human) after cryopreservation, but the results to date have not matched the interest. A prime cause of cell death is the formation of more than trace amounts of intracellular ice, and one strategy to avoid it is vitrification. In vitrification procedures, cells are loaded with high concentrations of glass-inducing solutes and cooled to −196°C at rates high enough to presumably induce the glassy state. In the last decade, several devices have been developed to achieve very high cooling rates. Nearly all in the field have assumed that the cooling rate is the critical factor. The purpose of our study was to test that assumption by examining the consequences of cooling mouse oocytes in a vitrification solution at four rates ranging from 95 to 69,250°C/min to −196°C and for each cooling rate, subjecting them to five warming rates back above 0°C at rates ranging from 610 to 118,000°C/min. In samples warmed at the highest rate (118,000°C/min), survivals were 70% to 85% regardless of the prior cooling rate. In samples warmed at the lowest rate (610°C/min), survivals were low regardless of the prior cooling rate, but decreased from 25% to 0% as the cooling rate was increased from 95 to 69,000°C/min. Intermediate cooling and warming rates gave intermediate survivals. The especially high sensitivity of survival to warming rate suggests that either the crystallization of intracellular glass during warming or the growth by recrystallization of small intracellular ice crystals formed during cooling are responsible for the lethality of slow warming.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell death 3acooling 3acryopreservation 3acrystallization 3acrystals 3aglass 3ahumans 3aice 3amice 3aoocytes 3asolutes 3avitrification1 aSeki, Shinsuke0 tCryobiology.g2011 Feb., v. 62, no. 1 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.x0011-22407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cryobiol.2010.10.1593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013100166300001600297520139600313592002801709650002101737650002601758650001601784650002001800650001001820650001901830650001301849650001401862650004301876650002401919650002601943653002901969653003101998653001302029653000802042700001302050700001502063700001602078700001702094700001502111773012002126856008202246852000902328655001202337IND60528678520221122235515.0160716e20160513xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052867852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Wenjun10aMicroRNA-376c suppresses non-small-cell lung cancer cell growth and invasion by targeting LRH-1-mediated Wnt signaling pathway  ap. 980-986.  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) that negatively regulate gene expression have emerged as novel therapeutic tools for cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the potential role of Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1), a novel oncogene, in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and examined the regulation of LRH-1 by miRNAs. We found that LRH-1 was highly overexpressed in NSCLC cell lines. Knockdown of LRH-1 by small interfering RNA significantly inhibited NSCLC cell growth and invasion. miR-376c directly targeted the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of LRH-1 and negatively regulated LRH-1 expression, as detected by dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Further data showed that miR-376c expression was inversely correlated with LRH-1 expression in clinical cancer samples. Overexpression of miR-376c could inhibit NSCLC cell growth and invasion as well as Wnt signaling. In contrast, depletion of miR-376c exhibited the opposite effects. Moreover, these effects of miR-376c overexpression were partially abrogated by overexpression of LRH-1. Taken together, these results indicate that LRH-1 is involved in regulating the growth and invasion of NSCLC cells and that miR-376c inhibits NSCLC cell growth and invasion by targeting LRH-1, providing a novel insight into the potential for development of anti-cancer drugs for NSCLC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aantineoplastic agents 3acell growth 3agene expression 3aliver 3alung neoplasms 3amicroRNA 3aoncogenes 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 0aLiver receptor homolog-1 0aNon-small-cell lung cancer 0amiR-376c 0aWnt1 aTian, Ye1 aJiang, Shu1 aLiu, Siyang1 aZhao, Xitong1 aTian, Dali0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2016 May 13, v. 473 p.980-986dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245007700176300001600253520145200269592002801721650001701749650001601766650001401782650001401796650001001810650001601820650002001836650001601856650001901872650001901891650001201910650001901922650001901941650002301960650001601983650001001999700002302009700001402032700001802046700001802064700001902082700001702101773009002118856008102208852000902289655001202298IND60439564620221120095406.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043956462DNAL7 a10.1007/s10681-014-1350-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalukder, Shyamal Krisna10aEffect of cytoplasmic diversity on post anthesis heat tolerance in wheat  ap. 383-394.  aTo study the cytoplasmic effects on heat tolerance, the nuclear genomes of ten alloplasmic lines were substituted by four or five backcrosses using ‘Karl 92’, ‘Ventnor’, ‘U1275’ and ‘Jagger’ as the recurrent parent. During the final backcross, reciprocal crosses were made to develop cytoplasmic near isogenic lines. Sixty-eight BC5F1/BC4F1 lines and their parents were evaluated in growth chambers for post anthesis heat tolerance. Plants were grown in the greenhouse and subjected to heat stress in growth chambers 10 days after anthesis for 14 days. Growth chambers were maintained at 35/30 °C for heat stress treatment. To create an optimum temperature treatment, the greenhouse was maintained at 20/15 °C. Effects of high temperature on chlorophyll content and Fv/Fm (photosystem II measuring parameter) were significantly affected by different cytoplasms. Seven cytoplasms showed improved tolerance to heat with at least one recurrent parent. These results indicate that cytoplasmic variations can contribute to an increase in chlorophyll content and quantum efficiency of photosystem II of wheat during heat stress, and also highlight the importance of the interaction between cytoplasmic and nuclear genes. The role of cytoplasm may be considered in wheat breeding programs aimed at improving heat tolerance, but the nature of the interaction between cytoplasm and nuclear gene content warrants further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abackcrossing 3achlorophyll 3acytoplasm 3aflowering 3agenes 3agreenhouses 3agrowth chambers 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aisogenic lines 3aparents 3aphotosystem II 3aplant breeding 3areciprocal crosses 3atemperature 3awheat1 aVara Prasad, P.

The composition and structure of the Cu&Fe₃O₄-mC were characterized by various physicochemical techniques, which indicated that the Cu NPs were monodispersed on the mesoporous carbon support with an average particle size of 21.2 nm. The material shows favorable activity and separability on the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol, and can be reused several times without a decrease in the catalytic activity. The maximum release concentration of Cu during the recycling process is 0.7 mg L⁻¹, which is below the limit of the Cu concentration in the surface water. This study would provide a green and sustainable pathway for simultaneous disposal of the biomass waste, removal of the heavy metal pollution, and pretreatment of 4-nitrophenol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abiosorption 3acarbon 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3acopper 3acopper nanoparticles 3agreen chemistry 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amagnetism 3ap-nitrophenol 3aparticle size 3aporous media 3apyrolysis 3arecycling 3asawdust 3asurface water 3avalue added 3awastewater1 aTian, Ke1 aJiang, Hong1 aYu, Han-Qing0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 16, no. 9 p.4198-4205dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00599f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245014900170300001600319520171200335592002802047650001302075650001302088650002002101650001802121650002402139650001602163653003002179653001902209653002702228653003502255653001502290700001302305700001302318700001302331700001402344773011602358856008702474852000902561655001202570IND60629740520221121055109.0200601e20190401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062974052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Yuxiang10aThermal-hydraulic performances in multiple twisted tapes inserted sinusoidal rib tube heat exchangers for exhaust gas heat recovery applications  ap. 271-290.  aThe article presents a numerical investigation on turbulent thermal and fluid flow characteristics of multiple twisted tapes (MTTs) inserted sinusoidal rib tube (SRT) heat exchangers based on exhaust gas heat recovery background. The effects including geometric parameters of tape number (single, twin, triple and quadruple twisted tapes) and tape arrangements (clockwise and anticlockwise or co-swirl and counter-swirl) in the SRT were comparably studied. A periodic RNG k-ε numerical model was employed to depict the heat transfer behaviors and flow structures in the SRTs at a constant wall temperature condition. The results showed that the alone use of the SRT yielded enhanced heat transfer of about 27.4%–39.5% and increased friction loss of around 49.4%–74.7% higher than that in the baseline of spirally corrugated tube (SCT). In addition, it was found that the diverse thermo-hydraulic performances in the SRTs fitted with MTTs were dominated by flow structures of swirl flows and shear flows. By the synergy of longitudinal vortexes from SRT and MTTs, the Nusselt number and friction factor obtained from the SRTs fitted with MTTs were, respectively, larger than that from SCT at about 1.43–1.87 times and 2.66–10.07 times. In contrast to the SCT, the overall thermal performance evaluation criterion (PEC) was enhanced up to 1.59 for the alone use of SRT. Moreover, the PEC could be improved under increased heat transfer and reasonable pressure drop via suitable tape arrangements in the SRTs mounted with MTTs, of which the best PEC was 1.49. At last, the comparisons of present results with previous studies proved that the proposed enhanced devices held some competitive advantages.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3ageometry 3aheat exchangers 3aheat recovery 3amathematical models 3atemperature 0aHeat transfer enhancement 0aSinusoidal rib 0aMultiple twisted tapes 0aMultiple longitudinal vortexes 0aSwirl flow1 aDu, Juan1 aLi, Qing1 aXu, Tong1 aLi, Wenyu0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2019 Apr. 01, v. 185 p.271-290dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2019.01.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012300163300001800286520095300304592002801257650002701285650001001312650002001322650001101342650002001353650001601373650002101389650001201410653000801422653001701430653002801447653002001475653001701495653001801512700002101530700001901551773008401570856008101654852000901735655001201744IND60655796320221121112014.0190805s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065579632DNAL7 a10.1163/1568539X-000035592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavey, Sara10aDifferences in flight initiation distance (FID) between rural and urban populations of two species of Australian birds  ap. 1151-1164.  aAlthough flight initiation distance (FID) has been shown to be shorter in urban compared to rural populations of birds, less is known about how the characteristics of the urban environment, such as the population size and age of the city influences the FID and other aspects of anti-predator behaviour. Urban willie wagtails and magpie larks in a relatively small and new town had shorter FID than rural conspecifics. Both species were more likely to show a short, rather than long, escape flight if the experimenter started walking towards the bird from further away. There was some indication that urban birds may be more likely to show a short escape flight than rural birds. We conclude that anti-predator responses of birds can be influenced by a relatively small, recently established and sparsely-populated town. Additionally, the possibility of the characteristics of the urban centre influencing variation in the FID response is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantipredatory behavior 3abirds 3aescape behavior 3aflight 3apopulation size 3aurban areas 3aurban population 3awalking 0aFID 0aurbanisation 0aanti-predator behaviour 0awillie wagtails 0amagpie larks 0adistance fled1 aMassaro, Melanie1 aFreire, Rafael0 tBehaviour.g, v. 156, no. 11 p.1151-1164dBrillwJournal:11664x0005-79597nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1568539X-000035593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02369naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245011200155520130100267592002801568650000801596650002301604650001501627650002501642650001101667650002601678650002801704651001001732700001301742700002001755700001501775700001901790773012701809856007401936852000902010655001202019IND60652944720221122030616.0190713e20190428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065294472DNAL7 a10.3390/su110924842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Ying 10aStudy on Structural Characteristics of China’s Passenger Airline Network Based on Network Motifs Analysis  aThe air passenger transport network system is an important agent of social and economic connections between cities. Studying on the airline network structure and providing optimization strategies can improve the airline industry sustainability evolution. As basic building blocks of broad networks, the concept of network motifs is cited in this paper to apply to the structural characteristic analysis of the passenger airline network. The ENUMERATE SUBGRAPHS (G, k) algorithm is used to identify the motifs and anti-motifs of the passenger airline network in China. A total of 37 airline companies are subjected to motif identification and exploring the structural and functional characteristics of the airline networks corresponding to different motifs. These 37 airline companies are classified according to the motif concentration curves into three development stages, which include mono-centric divergence companies at the low-level development stage, transitional companies at the intermediate development stage, and multi-centric and hierarchical companies at the advanced development stage. Finally, we found that adjusting the number of proper network motifs is useful to optimize the overall structure of airline networks, which is profitable for air transport sustainable development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair transportation 3aalgorithms 3abusiness enterprises 3acities 3afunctional properties 3asustainable development 3aChina1 aWei, Ye 1 aXiu, Chunliang 1 aSong, Wei 1 aYang, Kaixian 0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 28, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110924843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005500094040001800149100002500167245008700192300001600279520197300295592002802268653002502296653002002321653002202341653001602363700002402379700002602403773009802429856011502527852000902642655001202651IND60131229720221117003409.0151127e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013122972DNAL7 a10.1672/0277-5212(2006)26[558:LLDITW]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoi de Neiff, Alicia10aLeaf litter decomposition in three wetland types of the paranáá river floodplain  ap. 558-566.  aLeaf decomposition rates of nine types of litter, ranging in lignin content from 1.04 to 25.71%%, were measured at three wetlands with different inundation regimes and related to internal and external factors. In these sites (located in the alluvial floodplain along at transect perpendicular to the main channel of the Paranáá River), 180 litter bags were incubated under water. To test the importance of initial nitrogen, lignin, phosphorus, or L:N content of the litter in predicting decay rates, we analyzed the relationship between leaf quality and dry weight remaining (at 30 days and at the end of the incubation) within each wetland and under uniform environmental conditions. To elucidate the effects of environmental factors (especially hydroperiod) on decomposition processes, we compared the decay coefficient of one of these species (Eichhornia crassipes) across the three wetlands. Our results strongly suggest that under uniform environmental conditions, decomposition rates were best explained by a single internal factor related to litter quality. We found two different situations. 1) In the marsh with riverine forest, where decomposition was rapid and the half-life of the litter ranged from 9.6 to 63 days, the initial nitrogen content of leaves was a good predictor of decay rates both at 30 days and at the end of the incubation. 2) In the oxbow lake and palm swamp forest, where decomposition was lower and the half-life varied between 31.5 and 219 days, the L:N explains the variability on dry weight remaining at the end of the incubation. The decay coefficient of E. crassipes across sites was significantly related to NO₃⁻⁻ concentration of water. We concluded that both environmental variables (i.e., the fluvial quotient of connectivity and the number of days in high water) and leaf litter quality (i.e., nitrogen content and L:N) are important factors regulating leaf litter decomposition in Paranáá River floodplain wetlands.  aPublisher supplied data 0alitter decomposition 0aParanáá River 0ariparian wetlands 0ahydroperiod1 aNeiff, Juan Joséé1 aCasco, Sylvina Lorena0 tWetlands.g2006 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.558-566dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282006%2926%5B558%3ALLDITW%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245006800170300001600238520134900254592002801603650001201631650001601643650002901659650002101688650001301709650001801722650001301740650002001753650002801773650001201801650001001813650001301823650002001836651001101856700002401867700002601891700002001917773011001937856008102047852000902128655001202137IND60119991320221120192807.0151123e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011999132DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-014-0248-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLangevin, Brigitte10aSimulation of field NH3 and N2O emissions from slurry spreading  ap. 347-358.  aLand application of manures and slurries are a major source of pollution such as water contamination by nitrates and greenhouse gas emissions. NH₃ and N₂O emissions can be lowered by suitable spreading techniques. However, a comprehensive review of the impact of slurry spreading techniques is lacking. For that we developed a model, named OSEEP, that simulates the effect of slurry incorporation, slurry spatial distribution, and soil compaction on NH₃ and N₂O emissions. OSEEP integrates a soil compaction model, a hydraulic pedotransfer function, a NH₃ volatilization model, and a crop model. We ran OSEEP for five sites in France for 7 years. Four techniques were simulated: broadcast spreading, band spreading, incorporation after surface spreading, and injection. We tested various sizes of slurry tankers and tractors. We calculated NH₃ and N₂O relative emissions from various spreading techniques with respect to band spreading. Results show good agreement between model calculation and published field data. We found that slurry applied by a self-propelled 15-m³ tanker with extra large tires led to an increase of 20 % in N₂O emission, by comparison with a 15-m³ tanker trailed by a tractor.

The concept of AAEM passivation, by which the catalytic activity of AAEMs can be suppressed to enhance thermal depolymerization of lignocellulose to sugars, has been previously established at the microgram scale using batch reactors. The feasibility of increasing sugar yield via AAEM passivation has not been previously demonstrated at the kilogram scale in a continuous flow reactor. The goal of this research is to demonstrate the enhanced production of sugars from AAEM passivated feedstocks in a continuous auger pyrolyzer at the kilogram scale. Alkali and alkaline earth metal passivation prior to pyrolysis increased total sugars from red oak by 105% compared to conventional pyrolysis, increasing from 7.8 wt% to 15.9 wt% of feedstock. Light oxygenates and non-condensable gases (NCGs) simultaneously decreased 45%, from 27.1 wt% to 14.7 wt% of feedstock as a result of AAEM passivation. Similarly, AAEM passivation of switchgrass increased total sugars by 259%, from 4.5 wt% to 16.2 wt% of feedstock, while the light oxygenates and NCGs decreased by 48%, from 20.0 wt% to 10.5 wt% of feedstock. An undesirable outcome of AAEM passivation was an increase in char production, increasing by 65% and 30% for pyrolysis of red oak and switchgrass, respectively. Loss of lignin-derived phenolic compounds from the bio-oil can explain 67% and 38% of the increase in char for red oak and switchgrass, respectively. The remaining 33% char increase for red oak (3.1 wt% char) and 62% char increase for switchgrass (4.0 wt% char) appear to be from carbonization of sugars released during pyrolysis of acid-infused biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPanicum virgatum 3aalkaline earth metals 3abatch systems 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acarbonization 3acatalytic activity 3adepolymerization 3afeedstocks 3agases 3aglycosidic linkages 3agreen chemistry 3alignocellulose 3aphenolic compounds 3apyrolysis 3asugars1 aDaugaard, Tannon1 aJohnston, Patrick1 aKuzhiyil, Najeeb1 aWright, Mark M.1 aBrown, Robert C.0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 16, no. 9 p.4144-4155dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00602j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01755naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245009000160300001600250520068200266592002800948650001500976650001500991650001001006651001801016653002801034653002501062653001801087653001301105653002701118700001601145700001801161773013501179856008201314852000901396655001201405IND60754686820221122041324.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075468682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wse.2021.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Da10aStrengthening efficient usage, protection, and restoration of Yangtze River shoreline  ap. 257-259.  aWith the steady progress of the Yangtze River Protection Strategy, more and more attention has been paid to the protection and restoration of the Yangtze River shoreline.

We created a hydrologic model for vernal pools inhabited by wood frogs (Rana sylvatica). The hydrologic model used a classic water-budget approach, which had been applied to larger water bodies but not vernal pools. Depth profiles for eight pools in Cloquet, Minnesota, USA were measured for the open water seasons from June 2000 to September 2002. In the model, we adjusted infiltration rates and runoff coefficients to match depth profiles measured in 2000 and 2001 most closely. The simulated and observed depth profiles for 2000 and 2001 agreed well. In an assessment using novel depth profiles from 2002, modeled depths were somewhat deeper than observed depths for three pools, and four pools included sources of inflow that could not be explained by the model. We believe that the difference was from ground-water inflow rather than systematic changes in parameters, such as runoff curve numbers, because fit was good in 2000 and 2001, and some pools actually filled in 2002 during conditions when they typically would lose volume. Modeling hydroperiods using our methods for all pools in a region is problematic, as depth information is required for each pool studied, but the model will perform reasonably well for even small pools with adequate depth data.  aPublisher supplied data 0ahydroperiod 0avernal pools 0awater budget 0amodel 0asimulation modeling1 aJohnson, Catherine M.1 aJohnson, Lucinda B.0 tWetlands.g2006 June, v. 26, no. 2 p.581-592dSociety of Wetlands Scientistsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1672%2F0277-5212%282006%2926%5B581%3ASVPHIC%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009100171300001600262520187300278592002802151650002602179650001702205650001202222650002302234650001002257650001702267650002402284650001002308650002102318650002002339651000902359653001602368653001502384653002202399653002502421653002702446700002502473700002002498700002202518700002102540773013502561856008202696852000902778655001202787IND60754686920221122041242.0211213e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075468692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wse.2021.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharifazari, Salman10aOptimal reservoir operation using Nash bargaining solution and evolutionary algorithms  ap. 260-268.  aOptimizing reservoir operation is critical to ongoing sustainable water resources management. However, different stakeholders in reservoir management often have different interests and resource competition may provoke conflicts. Resource competition warrants the use of bargaining solution approaches to develop an optimal operational scheme. In this study, the Nash bargaining solution method was used to formulate an objective function for water allocation in a reservoir. Additionally, the genetic and ant colony optimization algorithms were used to achieve optimal solutions of the objective function. The Mahabad Dam in West Azerbaijan, Iran, was used as a case study site due to its complex water allocation requirements for multiple stakeholders, including agricultural, domestic, industrial, and environmental sectors. The relative weights of different sectors in the objective function were determined using a discrete kernel based on the priorities stipulated by the government (the Lake Urmia National Restoration Program). According to the policies for the agricultural sector, water allocation optimization for different sectors was carried out using three scenarios: (1) the current situation, (2) optimization of the cultivation pattern, and (3) changes to the irrigation system. The results showed that the objective function and the Nash bargaining solution method led to a water utility for all stakeholders of 98%. Furthermore, the two optimization algorithms were used to achieve the global optimal solution of the objective function, and reduced the failure of the domestic sector by 10% while meeting the required objective in water-limited periods. As the conflicts among stakeholders may become more common with a changing climate and an increase in water demand, these results have implications for reservoir operation and associated policies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural industry 3acase studies 3aclimate 3airrigation systems 3alakes 3astakeholders 3asystem optimization 3awater 3awater allocation 3awater utilities 3aIran 0aMahabad dam 0aLake urmia 0aGenetic algorithm 0aAnt colony algorithm 0aNash bargaining method1 aSadat-Noori, Mahmood1 aRahimi, Habibeh1 aKhojasteh, Danial1 aGlamore, William0 tWater Science and Engineering.g2021 Dec., v. 14, no. 4 p.260-268dElsevier B.V.aHohai UniversitywJournal:23243x1674-23707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wse.2021.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002300143245006600166300001400232520165800246592002801904650002201932650002201954650002901976650001402005650001202019650001502031650001502046650002502061650002102086650002502107650001102132650001802143650001802161650001702179650001302196650002002209650001802229653002302247653002802270653002402298653002102322653001402343653001402357700001902371700001802390700002502408773010502433856007702538852000902615655001202624IND60634487020190501000000.0190323e20190301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063448702DNAL7 a10.2478/eko-2019-00022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetlušová, Viera10aEffect of Landscape Use on Water Quality of the Žitava River  ap. 11-24.  aIntensification of landscape use brings along the negative effects on environmental components. These include surface water pollution. The aim was to determine the effect of landscape use on the water quality of the Žitava river. It was assumed that an area with the high proportion of anthropogenic activity would negatively affect water quality. At the same time, we assumed that an area with the lower proportion of anthropogenic use and with the higher proportion of natural and semi-natural elements contributes to self-cleaning ability of the watercourse. At the four observed sites, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH₄-N), nitrate-nitrogen (NO₃-N), phosphate-phosphorus (PO₄-P) and water conductivity were monitored. Landscape use was analysed using the database of land cover based on the CORINE Land Cover methodology. Subsequently, it was observed how the landscape use affects the water quality. It was found that the very good state, represented by the Class I water quality, is according to the measured indicators mostly present in the areas predominantly covered by forests along with extensive use of elements of the agricultural land. The area with predominance of agricultural and urbanised sites where the anthropogenic influence prevails is characterised by average water quality. As the overall water quality of the Žitava river reaches the average, it is necessary to eliminate the pollution by constructing the sewer systems in the villages through which the watercourse is passing and, in agriculture, to ensure the adherence to the legislation concerning the protection of surface water against pollution from agricultural sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aammonium nitrogen 3aanthropogenic activities 3adatabases 3aforests 3aland cover 3alandscapes 3alaws and regulations 3anitrate nitrogen 3aphosphate phosphorus 3arivers 3asewer systems 3asurface water 3aurbanization 3avillages 3awater pollution 3awater quality 0aland cover classes 0awater quality indicator 0aammoniacal nitrogen 0anitrate-nitrogen 0aphosphate 0awatershed1 aPetluš, Peter1 aZemko, Martin1 aRybanský, Ľubomír0 tEkológia (Bratislava).g2019 Mar. 01, v. 38, no. 1 p.11-24dSciendowJournal:23080x1337-947X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/eko-2019-00023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03022naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245010800170300001800278520180400296592002802100650001402128650001202142650001102154650002502165650001502190650002702205650001102232650001702243650002202260650001202282651001702294700001802311700002402329700001902353700002202372700002402394773010202418856008302520852000902603655001202612IND60795043620221119094817.0220929e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079504362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-021-00723-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLetessier, Tom B.10aEstimating Pelagic Fish Biomass in a Tropical Seascape Using Echosounding and Baited Stereo-Videography  ap. 1400-1417.  aThe pelagic ecosystem is the ocean’s largest by volume and of major importance for food provision and carbon cycling. The high fish species diversity common in the tropics presents a major challenge for biomass estimation using fisheries acoustics, the traditional approach for evaluating mid-water biomass. Converting echo intensities to biomass density requires information on species identity and size, which are typically obtained by lethal means, and thus unsuitable in the portion of the ocean that is ‘no take’. To improve conservation and ecosystem-based management, we present a procedure for determining fish biomass density, using data on species identity, relative abundance, and lengths obtained from stereo baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS) to inform the scaling of echosounder survey data (at 38 kHz). We apply the procedure in the British Indian Ocean Territory marine protected area, using acoustic data from 3025 km of survey transects and 546 BRUVS deployments recording relative abundance and size of 12,335 individual fish. Using a Generalised Additive Model of biomass density (GAM, adjR² = 0.61) we predict, on the basis of oceanographic conditions and bathymetry, that the top 200 m pelagic ecosystem in the Chagos Archipelago, some 118,324 km², held 3.84 (2.66, 5.62, 95% CI), 33.09 (23.41, 47.35) and 4.08 (3.1, 5.44) million tonnes of fish in November 2012, January 2015, and February 2016, respectively. Our non-extractive procedure yields ecologically credible patterns in biomass across multiple temporal (hours and years) and spatial (metres and kilometres) scales, and marks an improvement on the use of echo intensity alone as a biomass proxy. High seasonal and interannual variability has implication for pelagic fish monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aecosystem management 3aecosystems 3amarine protected areas 3amodels 3apelagic fish 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aIndian Ocean1 aProud, Roland1 aMeeuwig, Jessica J.1 aCox, Martin J.1 aHosegood, Phil J.1 aBrierley, Andrew S.0 tEcosystems.g2022 Sept., v. 25, no. 6 p.1400-1417dSpringer USwJournal:jnl70038x1432-98407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-021-00723-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02478naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007500166300001600241520123100257592002801488650002201516650002501538650002301563650001801586650002001604650001001624650001701634650001101651650001201662650001501674650001601689650001901705650001401724650002801738650002201766651001501788700002101803700002001824773011001844856008101954852000902035655001202044IND60119991520221120203505.0151123e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011999152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-014-0250-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChopin, Pierre12aA new method to assess farming system evolution at the landscape scale  ap. 325-337.  aAgriculture provides many ecosystem services such as food, fiber, clean water, and sequestration of carbon. The efficiency of such ecosystem services depends on crop composition and farmer decisions. Current knowledge on landscape changes is focused on crop allocation process at farm scale and rotations at field scale, whereas the impact of farmer decisions on the choice of crop acreages is poorly known. Therefore, we have built a method to assess the evolution of farm crop acreages in time and space and to identify factors ruling agricultural landscape changes. We use a dynamic typology, which is a multi-year classification of farmers. The seven steps of the method include three steps on farm typology, three steps on landscape changes, and then one step on change factors. We applied the method on 3,591 farms in Guadeloupe. Eight farm types were distinguished according to crop acreages. Our results show evidence of a diversification of 111 sugarcane growers toward production of vegetables and fruits. Spatial analysis revealed a relationship between diversification and water availability.

Meanwhile we note a growing inequity in terms of access and utilization of quality and affordable healthcare between urban and rural areas of the country. The Government of Ghana through its various policy initiatives in 2002 collaborated with civil societies with the aim of bringing healthcare to the doorsteps of rural folks in the country. Using a mixed method approach through a semi structured interviews and questionnaire administration, and focusing on the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) programme in Nsanfo community in the Mfanstiman municipal area, this study assesses the effectiveness and challenges confronting state–civil society partnership in co-producing a public good (healthcare). We found that synergy between the state (Mfanstiman Municipal Health Directorate) and the civil society (community health volunteers) has yielded positive results in bringing healthcare to the door steps as well as improving the health conditions of the local people in the study area. Nonetheless, certain challenges such as lack of volunteer motivation, deplorable state of the CHPS compound and logistics threaten the very existence of this collaboration. Our study has far reaching implications for healthcare planning in Ghana.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity health 3agovernance 3ahealth services 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amotivation 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3arural areas 3arural population 3asociety 3avolunteers 3aGhana1 aYeboah, Thomas0 tGeoJournal.g2016 June, v. 81, no. 3 p.411-425dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-015-9633-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245011800161300001600279520147700295592002801772650002001800650001201820650001701832650001301849650002201862650001501884650001101899650002001910650001101930650001201941650002401953650001401977650002201991651001002013700001902023700001402042773010102056856008102157852000902238655001202247IND60440330220221120174238.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033022DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-015-9291-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Wei14aThe Effects of the Sloping Land Conversion Program on Poverty Alleviation in the Wuling Mountainous Area of China  ap. 331-350.  aThe Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) is an important part of the Chinese ‘Priority Forestry Programs’ which has special effects on mountainous areas, ecologically and economically. This study was carried out in the Wuling mountainous area in Hunan Province of China. Based on data collected in a household survey of a sample of 375 households, a quantile regression model, Tobit regression model and weighted least square model were used to analyze the influence of participating in the SLCP on farmers’ sources of income (especially the poorest farmers), and the influence of forest type in SLCP land on farmers’ incomes. It was found that: (1) participating in the SLCP reduced farmers’ crop production income, but increased their forest income and subsidies; (2) participating in the SLCP increased farmers’ total income on average by 11.7 % and that of the poorest farmers by 24.7 %; and (3) choosing economic forest in the SLCP land increased farmers’ forest income, although its influence on total income was not statistically significant. These findings indicate that the SLCP has a positive effect on poverty alleviation in the Wuling mountainous area in the short run. However, the poverty alleviation effect is still unclear in the long run because the effect of the SLCP on changing farmers’ income structures is not obvious by observation, the subsidy term will have expired in 5 or 8 years and the forest revenue from the SLCP is low.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop production 3afarmers 3aforest types 3aforestry 3ahousehold surveys 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3aland use change 3amodels 3apoverty 3aregression analysis 3asubsidies 3atopographic slope 3aChina1 aLang, Zhengxin1 aWen, Yali0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2015 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.331-350dSpringer Netherlandsx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-015-9291-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245013400158520154500292592002801837650001601865650002001881650001901901650001901920650001201939650001901951650001201970650001001982650000901992650001102001650001302012650001102025650002202036650001402058650001302072650002202085650002002107650002602127700001702153700001802170700001502188700001702203773011902220856007702339852000902416655001202425IND60703691220221120233349.0200721e20200306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070369122DNAL7 a10.3390/plants90303362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWei, Qian 10aGenome-Wide Identification and Expression Profile Analysis of the NF-Y Transcription Factor Gene Family in <i>Petunia hybrida</i>  aNuclear Factor Ys (NF-Ys) are a class of heterotrimeric transcription factors that play key roles in many biological processes, such as abiotic stress responses, flowering time, and root development. The petunia (<i>Petunia hybrida</i>) is a model ornamental plant, and its draft genome has been published. However, no details regarding the NF-Y gene family in petunias are available. Here, 27 NF-Y members from the petunia genome were identified, including 10 PhNF-YAs, 13 PhNF-YBs, and 4 PhNF-YCs. Multiple alignments showed that all PhNF-Y proteins had clear conserved core regions flanked by non-conserved sequences. Phylogenetic analyses identified five pairs of orthologues NF-YB proteins from <i>Petunia</i> and <i>Arabidopsis</i>, and six pairs of paralogues NF-Y proteins in <i>Petunia</i>. Analysis of the gene structure and conserved motifs further confirmed the closer relationship in each subfamily. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that 16 PhNF-Ys could be targeted by 18 miRNA families. RNA-seq results showed that expression patterns of PhNF-Ys among four major organs (leaf, stem, flower, and root) were clustered into six major groups. The stress response pattern of PhNF-Ys was identified under cold, heat, drought, and salinity treatments. Based on the RNA-seq data, we found that 3 genes responded to drought, 4 genes responded to salt, 10 genes responded to cold, and 9 genes responded to hot. In conclusion, this study provides useful information for further studying the functions of <i>NF-Ys</i> in stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aPetunia hybrida 3aabiotic stress 3abioinformatics 3adrought 3aflowering time 3aflowers 3agenes 3aheat 3aleaves 3amicroRNA 3amodels 3aornamental plants 3aphylogeny 3asalinity 3asequence analysis 3astress response 3atranscription factors1 aWen, Shiyun 1 aLan, Chuying 1 aYu, Yixun 1 aChen, Guoju 0 tPlants.g2020 Mar. 06, v. 9, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants90303363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03131naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245006600155300001800221520179800239592002802037650001802065650001902083650002602102650002202128650002002150650001102170650002502181650002002206650001802226650001302244650001502257650001602272650002002288650001302308650001402321700001502335700001502350700001902365700001402384700001102398700001702409700001502426773012502441856007402566852000902640655001202649IND60662758320221120110842.0190906e20140818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066275832DNAL7 a10.1039/c4gc00613e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigoli, A.10aTowards non-toxic solvents for membrane preparation: a review  ap. 4034-4059.  aSolvents are used in every chemical process and affect its overall safety, environmental, and economic impact. Membrane processes have attracted increasing interest as sustainable alternatives to traditional technologies, being characterized by reduced energy consumption and use of chemicals. However, the most important membrane preparation techniques are often based on the use of toxic solvents, which reduces the benefit to the environment. Due to the influence of solvent properties such as viscosity, dielectric constant, polarity, and boiling point on the final features and the indispensable prerequisite of dissolving the selected polymer (at room or high temperature, depending on the technique), one of the most difficult but most interesting challenges for membrane scientists is replacing these solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and tetrahydrofuran (THF), with safer alternatives. In this review, the most relevant steps towards the use of non-toxic solvents in membrane preparation are reported, focusing particular attention on the non-solvent induced and temperature induced phase separation (NIPS and TIPS) techniques. Supercritical CO₂ (ScCO₂) and ionic liquids (ILs) are promising examples of benign solvents, and their use in membrane preparation will also be described. The total replacement of toxic diluents with greener alternatives still remains at the beginning stages. However, in several cases, membranes prepared using less/non-toxic solvents achieved performance comparable to those produced with classical toxic solvents. This review offers valid support for membrane scientists who wish to reduce the environmental impact of solvent use and increase membrane processes sustainability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aboiling point 3acarbon dioxide 3adielectric properties 3adimethylformamide 3aeconomic impact 3aenergy 3aenvironmental impact 3agreen chemistry 3aionic liquids 3apolymers 3aseparation 3atemperature 3atetrahydrofuran 3atoxicity 3aviscosity1 aMarino, T.1 aSimone, S.1 aDi Nicolò, E.1 aLi, X.-M.1 aHe, T.1 aTornaghi, S.1 aDrioli, E.0 tGreen chemistry.g2014 Aug. 18, v. 16, no. 9 p.4034-4059dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26906x1463-92707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c4gc00613e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02244naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009400163300001400257520104700271592002801318650001501346650002701361650002301388650002001411650002701431650002401458650002601482650001501508650002201523650002801545651001101573651001801584651001401602700001501616700001701631773010801648856008101756852000901837655001201846IND60119991620221120203344.0151123e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011999162DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-014-0259-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yongbo12aA 1961–2010 record of fertilizer use, pesticide application and cereal yields: a review  ap. 83-93.  aGlobal crop production has doubled since the Green Revolution on the average, but crop yield has stagnated or even declined in some regions. In the same time, food demand has highly increased due to population growth and higher living standards. The use of pesticides and mineral fertilizers has improved crop yields but also contaminated food and the environment, thus leading to a global food crisis. Here, we reviewed the historical trends of global pesticide and fertilizer application, cereal yields, and production. Our main findings are as follows: (1) fertilizer and pesticide consumption increased for 35–40 % of the countries; (2) cereal production in 38 % of countries and yields in 47 % of countries either stagnated or decreased from 1961 to 2010; (3) countries showing stagnated or decreased yields are countries with low gross domestic product per capita, mainly situated in Africa, South America, and West Asia. Our findings thus evidence a global imbalance in food production and the usage of fertilizers and pesticides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3afertilizer application 3afood contamination 3afood production 3agross domestic product 3amineral fertilizers 3apesticide application 3apesticides 3apopulation growth 3asustainable development 3aAfrica 3aSouth America 3aWest Asia1 aPan, Xubin1 aLi, Junsheng0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2015 Jan., v. 35, no. 1 p.83-93dSpringer Parisx1774-07467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-014-0259-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245007900165520138700244592002801631650001101659650001201670650000901682650002401691650001501715653002001730653002201750653001501772653002401787653002201811653003401833700001301867700001401880700001701894773009001911856008502001852000902086655001202095IND60735721020221118175918.0220726e20210815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073572102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1207082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Gang10aWorking mechanism and characteristics of gas parcels in the Stirling cycle  aThe Stirling engine is a promising device to efficiently utilize external heat sources for various purposes. The understanding of the thermodynamic cycle of the gas parcels present in the Stirling engine is vital to its design and optimization. In this paper, a one-dimensional transient numerical model for Stirling engines is developed. A system for a β-type prototype was built and investigated by using both experimental and numerical methods. The relative error between the experimental and theoretical results measures <6%. A post-processing method was further defined to track the gas parcels. Moreover, the Lagrange perspective was introduced to quantitatively describe the thermodynamic cycles, capturing the working mechanism of the gas parcels. The findings show that all the gas parcels produce periodic heat-to-work conversions despite their different thermodynamic cycles. The relay-style trend of adjacent gas parcels was observed in both the pressure-specific volume and the temperature-specific entropy diagrams. Finally, the thermodynamic processes of different volume phase angles were compared, showing that the specific work increases from 105.5 kJ/kg to 242.8 kJ/kg when the phase angle changes from 30° to 90°. This work provides a mesoscopic view to understand the working mechanism and build a solid foundation for the optimization of Stirling engines.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aentropy 3aheat 3amathematical models 3aprototypes 0aStirling engine 0aThird-order model 0aGas parcel 0aThermodynamic cycle 0aWorking mechanism 0aCompressible oscillating flow1 aQiu, Hao1 aWang, Kai1 aWang, Jintao0 tEnergy.g2021 Aug. 15, v. 229 p.120708-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1207083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02718naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245010700160520162700267592002801894650002501922650001201947650001801959650000801977650002601985650001302011650001702024650001902041650001602060650002302076700001702099700001502116700001502131773012702146856007402273852000902347655001202356IND60652945020221120083346.0190713e20190428xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065294502DNAL7 a10.3390/su110924862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoyan 10aExperimental Research on Heat Transfer and Strength Analysis of Backfill with Ice Grains in Deep Mines  aIn deep mines, two urgent problems are a high temperature thermal environment and solid waste. Filling the goaf with slurry mixed with ice grains is an effective way to solve these two problems simultaneously. The thermal property and mechanical property of the ice-added backfill have a great influence on the cooling effect in the deep mine. In this study, an experimental facility for measuring the temperature distribution of ice-added backfill slurry was established, and the temperature of backfill slurry with different proportions was measured. Then, the thermal properties of temperature distribution and cooling capacity and the mechanical property of uniaxial compressive strength of the backfill specimens were analyzed, and the results indicated the following: firstly, the cooling capacity of ice-added backfill specimens is negatively related with the slurry concentration C and is positively related with the ice-water ratio &Omega;; secondly, the strength of backfill specimens is affected by the slurry concentration C and ice-water ratio &Omega; by a contrary law compared to the cooling capacity; thirdly, ice-added backfill slurry with an ice-water ratio &Omega; of 1:1 has the best mechanical property after solidification. The effects of the slurry concentration and ice-water ratio on the thermal and mechanical properties were analyzed, and the results indicated that the optimum proportion of ice-added backfill slurry is a slurry concentration of 74% and an ice-water ratio of 1:1 in the present research range. This study is significant for the deep mine cooling method with ice-added backfill.  aPublisher supplied data 3acompression strength 3acooling 3aheat transfer 3aice 3amechanical properties 3aslurries 3asolid wastes 3asolidification 3atemperature 3athermal properties1 aJia, Yuhang 1 aWang, Mei 1 aLiu, Lang 0 tSustainability.g2019 Apr. 28, v. 11, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su110924863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02655naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245009900183300001600282520149600298592002801794650000901822650000801831650001201839650001701851650001701868650001501885650001201900650001301912650001501925650002201940650001701962650002201979651002302001700001802024700002402042773010102066856008102167852000902248655001202257IND60440330420221120184647.0151024e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044033042DNAL7 a10.1007/s11842-015-9292-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJemali, Noor Janatun Naim Binti10aStrategic Forest Management Options for Small-Scale Timber Harvesting on Okinawa Island, Japan  ap. 351-362.  aForest-related activities are important as the economic and social drivers for local residents in Okinawa Island. Therefore, strategic timber management planning is a prerequisite to achieve a sustainable timber yield and optimize forest resource utilization. In this study, the practicability of the Timber Harvest Simulation Model (HARVEST) developed by Eric Gustafson from USDA was tested with the aim of assessing the spatial pattern consequence of timber management plans in the subtropical Yambaru Forest of Okinawa Island. HARVEST evaluates options for timber harvesting by providing comparable predictions of age effect, forest spatial distribution and forest edge habitat, as well as patch structure in a targeted forest type and management area. The timber harvest simulation in 2.1 % of the Yambaru timber production areas was investigated using two alternative cutting methods (clustered and dispersed). It was found that small-area clear-cut harvesting, mimicked by a clustered method, was the practical harvesting practice in Yambaru with an estimated timber volume 12 % higher than that from the selective-logging mimicked by the dispersed method. The mean patch size of the harvested area and forest edge habitat were significantly correlated with timber harvesting method. In spite of some limitations quantified in the model, information generated from HARVEST model was applicable and practical for many forest stakeholders and effective for time-and-cost consideration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3aage 3acutting 3aedge effects 3aforest types 3aharvesting 3alogging 3aplanning 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3astakeholders 3atimber production 3aRyukyu Archipelago1 aShiba, Masami1 aZawawi, Azita Ahmad0 tSmall-scale forestry.g2015 Sept., v. 14, no. 3 p.351-362dSpringer Netherlandsx1873-76177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11842-015-9292-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014300169300001600312520096300328592002801291650001601319650001101335650001401346650002501360650000901385650001001394650001501404650000901419650001101428650001701439651002101456653003601477653001401513653002001527653001001547653004501557700002301602700006101625773023501686856008401921852000902005655001202014IND60543643020221119183648.0190411e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054364302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aspen.2014.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Man-Young14aThe green lacewing, Chrysoperla nipponensis in nature and in an insectary population in Korea: Song types and mitochondrial COI haplotypes  ap. 151-155.  aChrysoperla nipponensis s. lat. were collected as eggs or adults at five sites in Korea, and larvae were purchased from a Korean insectary (Osang-Kinsect Co.). A minimum of five complete courtship songs (= shortest repeated units or SRUs, the phrase exchanged between partners while duetting) of each specimen of C. nipponensis s. lat. were digitally recorded and the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene was analyzed, confirming that both cryptic species, types A and B, live in Korea. Within a population of C. nipponensis s. lat. sold by a commercial insectary in Korea, individuals whose larval head markings are type A, but whose mitochondrial sequence is type B were found. We also demonstrated that although most individuals derived from the commercial insectary had type A songs, several produced songs exhibiting key elements from type B, suggesting that mixture of the two species at the time the colony was established, or possibly later.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysoperla 3aadults 3acourtship 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aeggs 3agenes 3ahaplotypes 3ahead 3alarvae 3amitochondria 3aKorean Peninsula 0aChrysoperla nipponensis s. lat. 0aSong type 0aCryptic species 0aKorea 0aMitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI)1 aMochizuki, Atsushi1 aHenry, Charles S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7297-97030 tJournal of Asia-Pacific entomology.g2015 June, v. 18, no. 2 p.151-155dElsevier B.V.aKorean Society of Applied Entomology, Taiwan Entomological Society and Malaysian Plant Protection Society.wJournal:jnl4413786x1226-86157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aspen.2014.12.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
