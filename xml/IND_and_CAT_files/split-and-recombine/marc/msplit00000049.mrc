However, this methodology has been rarely used with older adults. The aim of this study was to measure the effectiveness of the CATA methodology to investigate the differences in sensory perception of Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) between younger and community dwelling older adults over successive sips of a full volume of two ONS. The study also sought to measure the effects of ONS on thirst, hunger and fullness.160 participants (eighty aged over 65 and eighty aged 18-35) evaluated two ONS over two different days. They consumed five 40 ml aliquots of ONS amounting to one serving. After each 40 ml they completed a CATA questionnaire, which recorded liking using a 9-point hedonic scale and hunger, fullness, desire, and thirst using 100 mm visual analogue scales.The results indicated significantly lower levels in hunger (p ≤ 0.01) and thirst (p ≤ 0.01) in the older cohort than the younger cohort. Significant differences in texture perception with age were also observed with the younger cohort selecting ‘Watery’ significantly more (p ≤ 0.05) than the older cohort for ONS 1 and ‘Thick’ and ‘Viscous’ significantly more (p ≤ 0.05) for ONS 2. The study showed that the CATA methodology is appropriate for use with older adults. The findings enhanced our understanding of how an older population experience ONS and drivers of ‘liking’. This information has the potential to enhance ONS adherence and ultimately improve the nutritional status of older people.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3adietary supplements 3aelderly 3ahedonic scales 3ahunger 3anutritional status 3aquestionnaires 3asensation 3asensory evaluation 3atexture 3athirst 0aCATA 0aOral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) 0aAgeing1 aO'Neill, Graham J.1 aHutchings, Scott C.1 aO'Riordan, Dolores0 tFood quality and preference.g2019 Dec., v. 78 p.103736-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46499x0950-32937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2019.1037363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245012000167500002200287520111200309592002801421650001301449650002301462650001701485650002101502650001101523650001401534650001601548653001801564653002201582653002801604653001401632700001601646700001601662700001801678700002001696773010301716856008701819852000901906655001201915IND60654823820221120212608.0190807e20190722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065482382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1218852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Xiaona10aActivation of lignin by selective oxidation: An emerging strategy for boosting lignin depolymerization to aromatics  aPre-press version  aLignin is the most abundant, renewable aromatic resource on earth and holds great potential for the production of value-added chemicals. The efficient valorization of lignin requires to deal with several formidable challenges, especially to prevent it from re-condensation reactions during its depolymerization. Recently, a strategy involving the activation of lignin side chains by selective oxidation of the benzylic alcohol in β-O-4 linkages to facilitate lignin degradation to aromatic monomers has become very popular. This strategy provides great advantages for lignin selective degradation to high yields of aromatics under mild conditions, but requires an additional pre-oxidation step. The purpose of this review is to provide the latest cutting-edge innovations of this novel approach. Various catalytic systems, including those using chemo-catalytic methods, physio-chemo catalytic methods, and/or bio-catalytic methods, for the oxidative activation of lignin side chains are summarized. By analyzing the current situation of lignin depolymerization, certain promising directions are emphasized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaromatic compounds 3abiocatalysis 3adepolymerization 3alignin 3aoxidation 3avalue added 0aPre-oxidation 0aLignin activation 0aLignin depolymerization 0aAromatics1 aWei, Ziqing1 aLu, Zhixian1 aPei, Haisheng1 aWang, Hongliang0 tBioresource technology.g2019 July 22,  p.121885-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2019.1218853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02958naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006800166520130400234592002801538650001401566650001601580650001601596650001401612650001301626650001701639650001801656650002201674650001001696650002301706650000901729650001701738650002701755650002101782650001701803650002801820650002501848650001701873650001501890650001401905653003001919653001401949700001501963700001801978700001801996700001902014700001702033700001802050700001502068700001402083700001202097700005602109773011202165856008202277852000902359655001202368IND60762307620221120114129.0220205e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1128052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Wenjuan10aBisphenol S exposure induces cytotoxicity in mouse Leydig cells  aBisphenol S (BPS), an increasingly used alternative to bisphenol A, has been linked to testosterone deficiency and male reproductive dysfunction in laboratory animals. This study aimed to examine the cytotoxicity of BPS exposure to Leydig cells and to investigate its possible mechanisms. After treatment with BPS (100, 200 and 400 μM) for 48 h in vitro, TM3 mouse Leydig cells exhibited a dose-dependent decrease in the viability. Furthermore, BPS challenge triggered oxidative stress manifested by compromised activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase with exaggerated formation of reactive oxygen species. Especially, BPS exposure resulted in augmented mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced ATP generation, along with an altered energy metabolism. Moreover, BPS stimulation enhanced BAX expression and caspase-3 activity and inhibited BCL-2 expression. In addition, BPS-treated TM3 cells showed an accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, together with increased Beclin1 and P62 expression and elevated LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio. These results demonstrated that in vitro exposure to BPS exerted cytotoxicity to TM3 Leydig cells through inducing oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, autophagic disturbance and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abisphenol A 3abisphenol S 3acaspase-3 3acatalase 3acytotoxicity 3adose response 3aenergy metabolism 3amales 3amembrane potential 3amice 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial membrane 3aoxidative stress 3apermeability 3areactive oxygen species 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atestosterone 3atoxicology 3aviability 0aMitochondrial dysfunction 0aAutophagy1 aHuang, Tao1 aSun, Zhangbei1 aKuang, Haibin1 aYuan, Yangyang1 aZou, Weiying1 aLiu, Fangming1 aZhang, Fan1 aYang, Bei1 aWu, Lei1 aZhang, Dalei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4241-74640 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 Feb., v. 160 p.112805-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1128053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03167naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013800168506011700306506007600423520161900499592002802118506003702146650002702183650000902210650001602219650001002235650001302245650001902258650001202277650001202289650000902301650001702310650001802327650001402345653001402359653000802373653002502381653003502406700001802441700001602459700001902475773011202494856008202606852000902688655001202697IND60762307720221207112914.0221004e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1128062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarlow, Susan M.10aReproductive and developmental evaluations of triclopyr acid, triclopyr butoxyethyl ester and triclopyr triethylamine salt in the rat  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted in rat and rabbit on triclopyr acid and its active-ingredient variants, triclopyr butoxyethyl ester (T-BEE) and triclopyr triethylamine salt (T-TEA). In this paper the results of a rat two-generation study on triclopyr acid are presented, together with a review of all the reproductive and developmental toxicity data available from the rat studies. In the rat two-generation study, triclopyr acid was administered in the diet, giving doses of 0, 5, 25 or 250 mg/kg bw per day. Parental toxicity, especially maternal toxicity, occurred at 250 mg/kg bw per day with reduced body weight and feed intake, organ weight changes, and kidney toxicity. Slight kidney toxicity was also evident at 25 mg/kg bw per day. Developmental toxicity, in the form of reduced postnatal survival in the F1 and F2 generations and reductions in pre-weaning offspring body weight in both generations, was seen only at a dose causing significant parental toxicity. There were no effects on any other reproductive or developmental parameters at any dose. It is concluded that the developmental toxicity, seen only at the highest dose, was most likely attributable to maternal toxicity. The no-observed-adverse-effect levels were 5 mg/kg bw per day for parental toxicity and 25 mg/kg bw per day for developmental toxicity. From the multigeneration and developmental toxicity studies on triclopyr and its variants, it can also be concluded that triclopyr is not specifically toxic to reproduction and is not selectively toxic to the embryo, fetus or neonate in the rat.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adevelopmental toxicity 3adiet 3afeed intake 3afetus 3aneonates 3anephrotoxicity 3aprogeny 3arabbits 3arats 3areproduction 3atissue weight 3atriclopyr 0aTriclopyr 0aRat 0aTwo-generation study 0aDevelopmental toxicity studies1 aTerry, Claire1 aGehen, Sean1 aCorvaro, Marco0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2022 Mar., v. 161 p.112806-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1128063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006200150245010100212300001400313520178400327592002802111650000802139650002202147650001202169650002002181650001002201650001502211650001202226650001102238650002602249650002002275653000902295653001302304653000802317653002902325653002202354653001502376700002202391700002302413700001902436700001702455700002502472773008802497856008502585852000902670655001202679IND60762308420221121022220.0220321e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biochi.2021.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIwuchukwu, Ifeanyi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7790-772510aNeuroprotectin D1, a lipid anti-inflammatory mediator, in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage  ap. 16-18.  aLittle is known of the lipid anti-inflammatory mediators, docosanoids, in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We aim to characterize the abundance of the docosanoid, Neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), in ICH patients. Blood samples (whole blood in PAXgene-blood-RNA tubes and plasma) were collected from consecutive patients with acute spontaneous ICH within 48 h of admission. A liquid-liquid lipid extraction was used for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and analyzed using MassLynx Mass Spectrometry Software with results normalized to internal standards. RNA was extracted from PAXgene-blood-RNA tubes for 15-LOX-1 gene expression, a critical enzyme in NPD1 synthesis. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Outcome measures included 90-day modified-rankin-score. Sixteen patients were included in the study with a mean age of 62.5years (SD13.5). Three abundant isomers were detected and analyzed – NPD1, PDX, and an uncharacterized isomer designated as NPD1-C. NPD1 levels were higher in patients with 90-day MRS 0–3 (49.63pg/mL SD43.78 vs. 1.88pg/mL SD1.7 p = 0.0012). ROC-AUC analysis showed an NPD1 cutoff of 2.9pg/mL differentiated 90-day MRS 0–3 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 88.89%, AUC 0.98 p = 0.0002). A Spearman correlation demonstrated an inverse relationship with NPD1 and 90-day MRS (rho −7.392 p = 0.0011). 15-LOX-1 gene was almost undetectable in patients with MRS 4–6. Though not significant, NPD1 levels were higher in patients <65 years, ICH volume <30 ml, and non-whites. NPD1 was abundant and significantly higher in ICH patients with MRS 0–3.15-LOX-1 was significantly under-expressed in patients with MRS 4–6. Early synthesis and abundance of NPD1 is likely an important protective mediator in ICH pathophysiology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3acomputer software 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahemorrhage 3aisomers 3alipids 3aliquid chromatography 3apathophysiology 0aNPD1 0a15-LOX-1 0aMRS 0aIntracerebral hemorrhage 0aNeuroprotectin D1 0aLipidomics1 aNguyễn, Đoàn,1 aShirazian, Alireza1 aAsatryan, Aram1 aJun, Bokkyoo1 aBazán, Nicolás G.,0 tBiochimie.g2022 Apr., v. 195 p.16-18dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6254x0300-90847nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biochi.2021.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02865naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245010300161300001600264520151700280592002801797650001401825650002101839650001501860650001301875650001601888650001301904650001801917650001301935650002401948650001301972650001401985650002101999650002402020650001902044651001002063700001602073700001502089700001902104700001402123700001402137700001202151700001802163773011402181856007902295852000902374655001202383IND60514991020221119020737.0160310e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499102DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2014.19052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaohong10aSeroepidemiology of Norovirus GII.3 and GII.4 Infections in Children with Diarrhea in Xi'an, China  ap. 500-505.  aObjective: The objective of this study was to investigate the seroepidemiology of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against Norovirus (NoV) GII.3 and GII.4 genotypes among children younger than 5 years with acute diarrhea in Xi'an, China.Materials and Methods: A total of 362 serum samples were collected from diarrheal children in the Department of Digestive Diseases of Xi'an Children's Hospital between March 2009 and October 2012. Recombinant capsid proteins of NoV genotypes GII.3 and GII.4 were expressed using the baculovirus expression system. The viruslike particles (VLPs) were examined by electron microscopy and Western blot, and VLPs were used as antigens for serological IgG tests using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.Results: The overall seroprevalence for GII.4 (86.2%) was significantly higher (p<0.01) than for GII.3 (67.9%). The seroprevalence remained in a high and stable level (70.9% for GII.3 and 88.7% for GII.4) in children under 1 year of age, then dropped in the age group 12–17 months (49.3% for GII.3 and 68.1% for GII.4), and finally increased to 77.8% for GII.3 and 96.8% for GII.4 in the group >18 months. The seroprevalence in the age group 12–17 months showed more statistically significant differences than the other age groups for both GII.3 and GII.4 (p<0.05).Conclusions: In conclusion, seroprevalence of NoV GII.3 and GII.4 was high in young children in Xi'an, China, and the anti-GII.4-positive rates were statistically higher than GII.3 across all the age groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNorovirus 3aWestern blotting 3aantibodies 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3achildren 3acoat proteins 3adiarrhea 3aelectron microscopy 3agenotype 3ahospitals 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3aChina1 aLiu, Pengbo1 aWang, Jiao1 aMoe, Christine1 aHu, Senke1 aCheng, Li1 aGu, Wei1 aWang, Xiaoqin0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2015 June 01, v. 12, no. 6 p.500-505dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2014.19053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03449naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003500143245015000178300001600328520186200344592002802206650002002234650001902254650001102273650001502284650001802299650001302317650002402330650001002354650001902364650001102383650001002394650000902404650002002413650001502433650001202448650001402460650002002474650001002494650002402504651001102528700003602539700003002575700003502605700003602640700003602676773013302712856007702845852000902922655001202931IND60514991620221119020229.0160310e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499162DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2014.18992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCueto González, Sergio Arturo10aPrevalence of Taenia saginata Larvae (Cysticercus bovis) in Feedlot Cattle Slaughtered in a Federal Inspection Type Abattoir in Northwest México  ap. 462-465.  aThe prevalence of bovine cysticercosis was established using routine postmortem inspection of 52,322 feedlot cattle slaughtered at 1 Federal Inspection Type abattoir (TIF 301) located in the Mexicali Valley in Baja California, México. The study included 31,393 animals (60.0%) purchased and transported to Baja California from stocker operations located in 17 states of México and 20,929 animals (40.0%) native to Baja California. A total of 208 carcasses showed lesions suggestive of cysticercosis, and 109 were confirmed as positive for the parasite with a prevalence of 0.21%, equivalent to 2.1 cases/1000 carcasses inspected, 2.8 cases/1000 carcasses for cattle purchased in other states, and 1.0 cases/1000 carcasses for cattle native from Baja California. The sensitivity of the postmortem inspection, when compared to a gold standard of stereoscopic microscopy, was 52.4%. The prevalence of cysticercosis was 2.8 times higher in cattle from other states compared with those native to Baja California. Cysticerci were most frequently found in the heart, followed by liver and masseter muscles. In cattle from other states, 96.6% of cysticerci were classified as calcified and <4% as viable; in cattle native to Baja California, 29% of cysticerci were classified as calcified and 71% as viable. The prevalence of bovine cysticercosis established at TIF 301 was found to be 28% lower than a previous report for Baja California. However, given the sensitivity of the postmortem inspection calculated between 10% and 50%, it is possible that an undetermined number of carcasses pass as being free of cysticerci and that the meat reached both domestic and international wholesale markets, increasing the possibility of human infection and causing substantial economic loss through condemnation of infected meat and trade restrictions for endemic regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTaenia saginata 3abeef carcasses 3acattle 3acysticerci 3acysticercosis 3afeedlots 3afinancial economics 3aheart 3ahuman diseases 3alarvae 3aliver 3ameat 3ameat inspection 3amicroscopy 3amuscles 3aparasites 3aslaughterhouses 3atrade 3awholesale marketing 3aMexico1 aRodríguez Castillo, José Luis1 aLópez Valencia, Gilberto1 aBermúdez Hurtado, Rosa María1 aHernández Robles, Erika Selene1 aMonge Navarro, Francisco Javier0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2015 May 01, v. 12, no. 5 p.462-465dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2014.18993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011000160300001600270520104300286592002801329650002601357650000801383650002501391650002401416650001001440650001201450650002001462650001201482650001201494650002201506650002401528650004301552650001401595650002201609650001101631650001601642650003601658653000801694653002301702700001801725700001501743700001901758700001601777700001801793700001601811773011201827856008201939852000902021655001202030IND60654825820221120174436.0190916e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065482582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2019.07.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Rui10aGrouper (Epinephelus coioides) MyD88 adaptor-like (Mal): Molecular cloning, expression, and functionality  ap. 308-312.  aInitiation of the innate immune response requires recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). MyD88 adaptor-like (Mal) is an adaptor that responds to TLR activation and acts as a bridging adaptor for MyD88. In the present study, the open reading frame of Mal was identified in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides), and named EcMal. It contained 831 bp encoding 276 aa, and was encoded by a 1299 bp DNA sequence with three exons and two introns. EcMal and the Mal sequence of other species shared different degrees of sequence identity, and clustered into the same group. EcMal was distributed in all tissues tested in healthy grouper, with the highest expression level in the head kidney. After infection with Cryptocaryon irritans, the expression level of EcMal was up-regulated in the gill and spleen. In addition, EcMal exhibited global cytosolic and nucleus localization, and could significantly activate NF-κB activity in grouper spleen cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCryptocaryon irritans 3aDNA 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aToll-like receptors 3aexons 3agrouper 3ainnate immunity 3aintrons 3akidneys 3amolecular cloning 3aopen reading frames 3apathogen-associated molecular patterns 3apathogens 3asequence analysis 3aspleen 3asplenocytes 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aMal 0aToll-like receptor1 aZeng, Yu-long1 aNi, Lu-Yun1 aLuo, Xiao-Chun1 aLi, An-Xing1 aDan, Xue-Ming1 aLi, Yan-Wei0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Oct., v. 93 p.308-312dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2019.07.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03245naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245010600159300001600265520194000281592002802221650002702249650001302276650002802289650002802317650005802345650001102403650001402414650001902428651001002447700002202457700002602479700001802505700002402523700002302547700002602570700001902596773013402615856007702749852000902826655001202835IND60514991920221119020413.0160310e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499192DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2013.17142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarco, Lisa10aMolecular Characterization of “Inconsistent” Variants of Salmonella Typhimurium Isolated in Italy  ap. 497-499.  aSalmonella 4,[5],12:i:- is a variant of Salmonella Typhimurium, which lacks the expression of phase-2 flagellar antigen, generally associated with the deletion of the fljB gene. Additional mechanisms involving the fljAB operon (fljA, fljB, and hin genes) lead to the lack of expression of phase-2 flagellar antigens also in Salmonella strains harboring the fljB gene. For 20 S. 4,[5],12:i:- strains, defined as “inconsistent” Salmonella Typhimurium variants since they had phenotypically behaved as monophasic, even though the fljB gene was conserved, the fljAB operon was characterized in order to explain the ineffective expression of the phase-2 flagellar antigen. The monophasic phenotype for a first group of strains (9) was likely due to the absence of the hin gene, leading to the inhibited switch between the expression of phase-1 and phase-2 flagellar genes. For a second group of strains (5), the monophasic phenotype could be attributed to nonconservative point mutations identified in fljA and hin genes, which could hamper the proper expression of invertase gene and the fljA, acting as repressor of the phase-1 flagellar gene. Finally, for a last group of inconsistent strains (6), a plausible reason for their monophasic phenotype was not found, since the genes involved in the expression of phase-2 flagellar antigen were fully conserved. Moreover, the collection of inconsistent Salmonella Typhimurium isolates investigated were characterized by distinct molecular profiles, as demonstrated by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis, and phenotype variability, as demonstrated by phage-typing. This study highlights the usefulness of investigating the entire fljAB operon when a definitive identification of the monophasic or biphasic status of Salmonella Typhimurium strains is needed (for instance, in the context of epidemiological investigations aimed to identify the relatedness among strains).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Typhimurium 3aantigens 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3aepidemiological studies 3amultiple-locus variable number tandem-repeat analysis 3aoperon 3aphenotype 3apoint mutation 3aItaly1 aLongo, Alessandra1 aLettini, Antonia Anna1 aCortini, Enzo1 aSaccardin, Cristina1 aMinorello, Claudio1 aOlsen, John Elmerdahl1 aRicci, Antonia0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 June 01, v. 11, no. 6 p.497-499dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2013.17143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245018300161300001600344520134200360592002801702650002701730650002601757650001001783650002201793650002001815650001001835650001901845650001101864650001601875650002601891650001401917650001401931650001801945650003701963650001802000650002802018650001402046651001002060700001602070700001502086700002002101700001702121700002002138700001702158700001802175773013302193856007702326852000902403655001202412IND60514992520221119014022.0160310e20150501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499252DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2014.18962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Xiujuan10aPhenotypic and Genotypic Characterization of Salmonella enterica Serovar Enteritidis Isolates Associated with a Mousse Cake–Related Outbreak of Gastroenteritis in Ningbo, China  ap. 433-440.  aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (Salmonella Enteritidis) is a major pathogen responsible for causing the largest number of sporadic cases and outbreaks of human salmonellosis worldwide. In this study, an outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis involving 112 cases in Ningbo, China was investigated with a combination of genotypic subtyping methods and phenotypic analysis. The pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus variable-number tandem-repeat analysis profiles showed that most of the outbreak clinical isolates (22/23) were indistinguishable from each other and were identical to the isolates obtained from implicated mousse cakes, demonstrating that this outbreak of gastroenteritis was caused by Salmonella Enteritidis–contaminated mousse cakes. Moreover, all isolates, irrespective of source, had an identical antibiotic susceptibility pattern. Five virulence-associated genes in Salmonella pathogenicity islands and the plasmid-associated virulence genes spvB/C were present in both the food and clinical isolates. Importantly, all of these isolates can survive well under low-temperature treatment, indicating that manufacturers of foodstuffs with raw ingredients (not subjected to thermal processing) should use an effective approach to prevent or eliminate the microbial hazards to public health.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella Enteritidis 3aantibiotic resistance 3acakes 3adisease incidence 3agastroenteritis 3agenes 3aheat treatment 3ahumans 3aingredients 3apathogenicity islands 3apathogens 3aphenotype 3apublic health 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3asalmonellosis 3atandem repeat sequences 3avirulence 3aChina1 aHe, Shoukui1 aSong, Qifa1 aZhuang, Xiaofei1 aWang, Yanyan1 aHuang, Xiaozhen1 aShi, Chunlei1 aShi, Xianming0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2015 May 01, v. 12, no. 5 p.433-440dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2014.18963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013000178520114500308592002801453650002401481650001901505650001101524650002001535650000901555650001401564650001401578650001101592650001301603650001601616650001301632653002201645653001601667653001701683653002001700653001701720700005801737700001801795773011801813856008601931852000902017655001202026IND60762310420221116152310.0220222e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHochberg, Sabrina Yael10aMaterials and energy recovery from oily sludges removed from crude oil storage tanks (tank bottoms): A review of technologies  aSludge and solids accumulating in crude oil storage tanks (referred as tank bottoms) reduces tank volume and requires periodic removal and disposal. Effective management of tank bottoms require considerations to reduce the toxicity of wastes and reduce potential environment impacts. This review compares alternative technologies for economical and environmentally beneficial management of oily sludges for recovery of hydrocarbons and energy with and without oil recovery. Management options with oil recovery include solvent extraction, centrifugation, surfactant oil recovery, and pyrolysis. Management options without oil recovery include incineration and anaerobic co-digestion. The selection of the appropriate technology depends on the characteristics of oily sludge, treatment capacity, as well as operation and maintenance costs. An efficient treatment can involve integration of different technologies for recovery of different oil fractions and to reduce energy demand. Technologies that utilize renewable energy (e.g., solar pyrolysis) can offset the high energy demand of pyrolysis process while recovering marketable products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3acentrifugation 3aenergy 3aenergy recovery 3aoils 3apetroleum 3apyrolysis 3asludge 3asolvents 3asurfactants 3atoxicity 0aCrude oil storage 0aOily sludge 0aTank bottoms 0aSolar pyrolysis 0aOil recovery1 aTansel, Berrin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3503-24861 aLaha, Shonali0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 305 p.114428-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03821naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100013600151245015200287500002200439520197700461592002802438650001702466650002202483650001002505650001402515650000902529650002402538650002602562650002902588650002602617650002102643650001302664650001202677650001302689650000702702650002302709650001702732650001102749650002102760650001202781650001602793650001702809651001102826653008902837700002802926700002802954700002702982700003703009700002803046773009803074856008603172852000903258655001203267IND60654827020221120144356.0190801e20190723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065482702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1055872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLucheta, Fabiane1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-1325 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-1325 https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1107-132510aLichens as indicators of environmental quality in Southern Brazil: an integrative approach based on community composition and functional parameters  aPre-press version  aLichens are widely used to assess the consequences of human activities, including urbanization, which has strong influence on the structure of their communities. Our hypothesis is that increasing human population density and modifying land use and cover cause structural and functional changes in lichen communities. The main objective of this study was to evaluate changes in lichen species composition and functional patterns along a gradient of urbanization in southern Brazil. The study was carried out in nine sites, classified a priori according to the matrix where they were inserted, as rural, suburban and urban, in which the lichen community was sampled in 10 phorophytes using the rubber band method. Several environmental variables and lichen functional traits were quantified. The sites inserted in the rural matrix were characterized by phorophytes with higher bark pH, higher percentage of agriculture areas in the vicinity of the sampling sites, and by the following functional groups: loosely attached crustose thalli, Trentepohlia photobiont, reproduction by thallus fragmentation and apothecia. The sites located in the urban matrix showed greater demographic density, vehicular fleet, percentage of urban and open fields coverage, foliose narrow lobed thalli, photobiont Chlorococcoid algae and reproduction by soredia. Regarding lichen functional patterns, sites located in the rural matrix presented higher species richness, functional richness, evenness and diversity. Based on our results, we showed that urbanization has a strong influence on lichen communities, since it has affected both species composition and functional patterns, besides species richness. The combined use of species composition, richness, functional composition and functional indexes proved to be effective in obtaining detailed information on the changes suffered by lichen communities and can be used as a tool to evaluate the environmental quality in urban environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrentepohlia 3aagricultural land 3aalgae 3aapothecia 3abark 3acommunity structure 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental indicators 3aenvironmental quality 3ahuman population 3aland use 3alichens 3amoieties 3apH 3apopulation density 3areproduction 3arubber 3aspecies richness 3athallus 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aBrazil 0aFunctional indexes.

The study was conducted 5 years after the construction of a modern, wastewater treatment facility near the town of Stara Zagora, whose wastewater is one of the main pollutants of the river. The main objective was to compare the values of the integral indicator for developmental stability (FA) in P. ridibundus with those obtained in a previouis study, conducted before the construction of wastewater treatment facility; and on the basis of that comparison to make an additional independent assessment parallel to the physicochemical analyses. The tested frogs in the present study (25 males and 25 females individuals from each site) were adult and sexually mature. Fluctuating asymmetry was defined according to 10 morphological traits, using the index frequency of asymmetric manifestation of an individual (FAMI). On the basis of the observed average FAMI values the status of the populations (respectively the corresponding biotops) was rated according to a scale from 1 to 5, describing the degree of environmental contamination. Lower values of FAMI were found in the populations of P. ridibundus that inhabit relatively clean sites, whereas higher values of FAMI were found in the sites with anthropogenic pollution. The results of our work give us the opportunity to assume that FA in meristic morphological traits in this species of anurans can be used as a reliable biomarker, an alternative to physicochemical analyses that require expensive laboratory equipment and consumables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPelophylax 3aadults 3aasymmetry 3abiomarkers 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental indicators 3afemales 3afrogs 3alaboratory equipment 3amales 3apollutants 3apollution 3arivers 3asewage 3asexual maturity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aBulgaria 0aPelophylax ridibundus 0aDevelopmental stability 0aFluctuating asymmetry 0aMeristic morphological traits1 aTsonev, Stefan V.1 aAngelov, Mladen V.0 tEcological indicators.g2019 Dec., v. 107 p.105589-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2019.1055893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245012700171300001600298520171200314592002802026650002102054650002702075650001502102650001302117650001202130650001602142650003702158650002202195650001502217650002802232650000902260650002102269650001902290650001902309650001302328650000902341650001002350650002102360651001102381700002102392700002702413700003102440700002802471700002702499700002302526773013402549856007702683852000902760655001202769IND60514992920221119014204.0160310e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499292DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2013.17122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieri, Fabio Alessandro10aRisky Consumption Habits and Safety of Fluid Milk Available in Retail Sales Outlets in Viçosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil  ap. 490-496.  aThis study aimed to assess raw milk consumption habits in the urban population of Viçosa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and the microbiological safety and quality of the fluid milk available in retail sales outlets in the same region. A simplified questionnaire regarding raw milk consumption was applied to the persons responsible for food acquisition in 411 residences. The regular consumption of raw milk was observed by 18.5% of the interviewers, and lack of knowledge of possible risks related to this food product. Microbiological safety and quality were assessed for raw (n=69), pasteurized (n=80), and ultra-high-temperature (UHT)-treated milk (n=80) by analyzing the counts of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, and Escherichia coli, and detection of Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp.; raw milk samples were also subjected to enumeration of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus. Concerning raw milk, 59.4% of the samples were considered as produced in inadequate hygienic conditions, 5.8% of the samples presented counts of coagulase-positive Staphylococcus lower than 100 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL, and no samples presented with positive results for L. monocytogenes or Salmonella spp. All pasteurized and UHT milk samples presented with low counts of mesophilic aerobes and coliforms, while L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were absent. The data demonstrated that raw milk was consumed by the population studied. Despite the absence of potential hazards, raw milk was of poor hygienic quality, in contrast with the processed fluid milk available in retail sales outlets that was safe and of good hygienic quality, highlighting the suitability of pasteurized and UHT milk for human consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aUHT milk 3aaerobes 3abreast milk 3acoagulase positive staphylococci 3acoliform bacteria 3afluid milk 3amicrobiological quality 3amilk 3amilk consumption 3apasteurization 3aquestionnaires 3araw milk 3arisk 3asales 3aurban population 3aBrazil1 aColombo, Monique1 aMerhi, Carolina Milner1 aJuliati, Vinícius Augusto1 aFerreira, Marcello Sebe1 aNero, Marcelo Antônio1 aNero, Luis Augusto0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 June 01, v. 11, no. 6 p.490-496dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2013.17123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245008000164300001600244520180500260592002802065650001802093650002002111650002202131650002802153650001102181650002402192650001502216650001402231650001802245651001802263700002402281700002502305773013402330856007702464852000902541655001202550IND60514993420221119021047.0160310e20150601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499342DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2014.19072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruber, Joann F.10aEvaluation of U.S. Poison Center Data for Surveillance of Foodborne Disease  ap. 467-478.  aIntroduction: Enhancing foodborne disease (FBD) surveillance and improving the timeliness of outbreak detection have been identified as public health priorities. Consumer complaint data have become increasingly useful for FBD surveillance and the detection of outbreaks. Calls to poison centers are a potential source of consumer complaint data. A retrospective analysis of data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS) (2000–2011) was undertaken to evaluate the value of data collected through the United States poison centers for detection of large national outbreaks and recalls.Methods: Demographic and clinical data were summarized. Prevalences of FBD calls were calculated and analyzed for time trends. Significant increases in daily call prevalences were identified, and dates of the increases were compared to the announcement of 18 national outbreaks/recalls.Results: Over the 12-year period, there were 433,788 unique calls self-reporting a suspected FBD exposure in humans. Overall, daily call prevalences decreased over time. Only about half of callers reported common gastrointestinal clinical effects. Of the 42 identified significant increases in call prevalences, none occurred within 14 days before an outbreak announcement; 7 occurred within 14 days after an outbreak announcement.Conclusions: Based on this analysis, there are significant limitations to using self-reported FBD exposures to NPDS as a source of information for FBD surveillance of large national outbreaks and recalls; however, a syndromic approach may yield different results and should be explored. Improved data collection and coordination with public health agencies may improve the ability to use NPDS data to monitor FBD in near real-time, identify potential outbreaks, and improve situational awareness.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata analysis 3adata collection 3afoodborne illness 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3ainformation sources 3amonitoring 3apoisoning 3apublic health 3aUnited States1 aBailey, Jennifer E.1 aKowalcyk, Barbara B.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2015 June 01, v. 12, no. 6 p.467-478dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2014.19073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245007100169520091300240592002801153650002301181650002301204650001501227650002201242650002901264650001801293650001601311650001901327650002001346700001801366700002001384700002501404773011801429856008601547852000901633655001201642IND60762311520221116152350.0220509e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManish Kumar,10aTackling water security: A global need of cross-cutting approaches  aThe Virtual Special Issue entitled “Tackling Water Security” is mainly focused on water availability, water quality, management, governance, biotic or abiotic emerging contaminants and policy development in the Anthropocene.

However, U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations allow the interstate sale of certain types of cheeses made from unpasteurized milk if specific aging requirements are met. We describe characteristics of these outbreaks, including differences between outbreaks linked to cheese made from pasteurized or unpasteurized milk.Methods: We reviewed reports of outbreaks submitted to the Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System during 1998–2011 in which cheese was implicated as the vehicle. We describe characteristics of these outbreaks, including differences between outbreaks linked to cheese made from pasteurized versus unpasteurized milk.Results: During 1998–2011, 90 outbreaks attributed to cheese were reported; 38 (42%) were due to cheese made with unpasteurized milk, 44 (49%) to cheese made with pasteurized milk, and the pasteurization status was not reported for the other eight (9%). The most common cheese–pathogen pairs were unpasteurized queso fresco or other Mexican-style cheese and Salmonella (10 outbreaks), and pasteurized queso fresco or other Mexican-style cheese and Listeria (6 outbreaks). The cheese was imported from Mexico in 38% of outbreaks caused by cheese made with unpasteurized milk. In at least five outbreaks, all due to cheese made from unpasteurized milk, the outbreak report noted that the cheese was produced or sold illegally. Outbreaks caused by cheese made from pasteurized milk occurred most commonly (64%) in restaurant, delis, or banquet settings where cross-contamination was the most common contributing factor.Conclusions: In addition to using pasteurized milk to make cheese, interventions to improve the safety of cheese include limiting illegal importation of cheese, strict sanitation and microbiologic monitoring in cheese-making facilities, and controls to limit food worker contamination.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aListeria 3aSalmonella 3acheesemaking 3acheeses 3across contamination 3adisease outbreaks 3afluid milk 3afoodborne illness 3amilk 3amonitoring 3apasteurization 3apasteurized milk 3araw milk 3arestaurants 3asales 3asanitation 3atrade 3aMexico 3aUnited States1 aMungai, Elisabeth1 aBarton Behravesh, Casey0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 July 01, v. 11, no. 7 p.545-551dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2013.16503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245012200167300001600289520144300305592002801748650004301776650002301819650002001842650002101862650001901883650001301902650001801915651001801933700002001951700002301971700001701994700001802011700001502029700002202044700002002066700002002086700002302106700002102129700001802150700001802168773013402186856007702320961001302397852000902410655001202419IND60514993720221119021042.0160310e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499372DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2013.16632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurinda, Shelton E.10aReal-Time Isothermal Detection of Shiga Toxin–Producing Escherichia coli Using Recombinase Polymerase Amplification  ap. 529-536.  aShiga toxin–producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are a major family of foodborne pathogens of public health, zoonotic, and economic significance in the United States and worldwide. To date, there are no published reports on use of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for STEC detection. The primary goal of this study was to assess the potential application of RPA in detection of STEC. This study focused on designing and evaluating RPA primers and fluorescent probes for isothermal (39°C) detection of STEC. Compatible sets of candidate primers and probes were designed for detection of Shiga toxin 1 and 2 (Stx1 and 2), respectively. The sets were evaluated for specificity and sensitivity against STEC (n=12) of various stx genotypes (stx1/stx2, stx1, or stx2, respectively), including non-Stx-producing E. coli (n=28) and other genera (n=7). The primers and probes that were designed targeted amplification of the subunit A moiety of stx1 and stx2. The assay detected STEC in real time (within 5–10 min at 39°C) with high sensitivity (93.5% vs. 90%; stx1 vs. stx2), specificity (99.1% vs. 100%; stx1 vs. stx2), and predictive value (97.9% for both stx1 vs. stx2).

The analysis of genomes belonging to 174 taxa (species or subspecies) of the genus Mycobacterium was conducted using both the Average Nucleotide Identity and the Genome to Genome Distance. A number of synonymous taxa were detected. The list of synonyms includes: two subspecies of M. chelonae (M. chelonae subsp. bovis and M. chelonae subsp. gwanakae), two subspecies of M. fortuitum (M. fortuitum subsp. fortuitum and M. fortuitum subsp. acetamidolyticum), four subspecies of M. avium (M. avium subsp. avium, M. avium subsp. silvaticum, M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis and “M. avium subsp. hominissuis”), two couples of subspecies of M. intracellulare (M. intracellulare subsp. intracellulare/M. intracellulare subsp. paraintracellulare and M. intracellulare subsp. chimaera/M. intracellulare subsp. yongonense), the species M. austroafricanum and M. vanbaalenii, the species M. senegalense and M. conceptionense, the species M. talmoniae and M. eburneum and the species M. marinum, M. ulcerans and M. pseudoshottsii. Furthermore one species were reclassified as subspecies of another mycobacterium: M. lepraemurium was reclassified as a subspecies of M. avium (M. avium subsp. lepraemurium). The updates to nomenclature are proposed basing on the priority of names according the Code of nomenclature of prokaryotes. For two species (M. bouchedurhonense and M. marseillense) the loss of standing in nomenclature is proposed because of unavailability of respective type strains in culture collections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycobacterium austroafricanum 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. avium 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis 3aMycobacterium avium subsp. silvaticum 3aMycobacterium chelonae 3aMycobacterium fortuitum 3aMycobacterium intracellulare 3aMycobacterium lepraemurium 3aMycobacterium marinum 3aMycobacterium senegalense 3aMycobacterium ulcerans 3aMycobacterium vanbaalenii 3agenome 3aparatuberculosis 3aprokaryotic cells 3ataxonomic revisions 0aMycobacterium 0aTaxonomy 0aSynonymous taxa 0aAverage nucleotide identity 0aGenome to genome distance1 aMeehan, Conor J.1 aGrottola, Antonella1 aFregni Serpini, Giulia1 aFabio, Anna1 aTrovato, Alberto1 aPecorari, Monica1 aCirillo, Daniela M.0 tInfection, genetics, and evolution.g2019 Nov., v. 75 p.103983-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12450x1567-13487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2019.1039833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03552naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245010800173520203800281592002802319650001702347650002902364650001102393650002302404650001002427650001002437650001502447650001502462650001302477650002302490650002002513650001502533650001902548650001902567650000902586650001802595650002102613650001302634650001302647653001302660653002502673653002202698653002802720700003002748700002702778700002102805773011702826856008202943852000903025655001203034IND60654828720221121064300.0190807e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065482872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jnc.2019.1257252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmaral, Yuri Teixeira10aLandscape structural analysis of the Lençóis Maranhenses national park: implications for conservation  aOur work evaluated the anthropic effects on the landscape structure of the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park (LMNP) and its Buffer Zone, and proposed strategies for the region’s conservation. LMNP is an important protected area in Brazilian north coast which protects a unique wetland ecosystem composed of sand dunes fields and a coastal vegetation called restinga. Supervised mapping of LMNP and a surrounding buffer of 3 km was carried out through high resolution and fine scale (1:5000) satellite images. The mapped area was subdivided in 1000 ha hexagonal Analysis Units (AU) and the following landscape metrics were calculated for each one of them: cover area (CA) of each soil cover class - dune fields (CA-DUNES), water bodies (CA-WATER), dense restinga (CADENSE), scattered restinga (CA-SCATTER), grassland (CA-SANDY), mangroves (CA-MANG), anthropogenic activity (CA-ANTRO) and, secondary vegetation (CA-SECOND); Landscape Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI), and; percentage of native vegetation cover (NV−COV). Pearson correlations were performed between the CA of each class and SHDI to identify the classes most correlated to CA-ANTRO. Our results showed that anthropic classes (crops, trails, and villages) had a stronger correlation (Pearson Correlation, r ≈ 0.65) with phytophysiognomies of dense restinga, secondary vegetation and SHDI, thus indicating that the land use conversion occurs in dense restinga areas and promotes vegetation secondarization, as well as increasing fragmentation. At least, 42% of the dense restinga habitats was destroyed due to human activities. Five conservation and restoration strategies were proposed in a local scale depending on the percentage of native vegetation cover on each AU, from the most to less conserved: (a) only conservation; (b) conservation with management; (c) management; (d) management and restoration; and, (e) restoration. The implementation of Agroforestry Systems with agro-successional restoration goals was recommended as an alternative for land use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroforestry 3aanthropogenic activities 3acoasts 3aconservation areas 3acrops 3adunes 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3anational parks 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3asurface water 3avegetation cover 3avillages 3awetlands 0aLand use 0aTerritorial planning 0aLandscape metrics 0aConservation strategies1 aSantos, Edyane Moraes dos1 aRibeiro, Milton Cézar1 aBarreto, Larissa0 tJournal for nature conservation.g2019 Oct., v. 51 p.125725-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:J000000095x1617-13817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2019.1257253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03426naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014700168520172700315592002802042650001402070650001202084650002402096650001302120650003302133650002002166650001102186650001902197650003002216650001402246650002302260650001302283650001302296650001302309650001302322650001102335650001802346650002502364650001502389653001202404653002502416653001702441653002402458653002102482700002302503700005402526700002402580700006702604773011802671856008602789852000902875655001202884IND60762312420221116152219.0220606e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKosugi, Yuka10aEffects of organic carbon and sulfide on the anammox reaction in the anoxic column in the SRDAPN process for treating high-strength wastewater  aLow energy consumption treatment of high-strength wastewater is crucial in controlling groundwater pollution and eutrophication in closed waterbodies. In this study, the sulfate reduction, denitrification/anammox, and partial nitrification (SRDAPN) process, which is an effective organic carbon and nitrogen removal process with low energy consumption for low strength wastewater, was applied to treat livestock wastewater with high COD and sulfate concentration, and microbial reaction and community were examined using an anaerobic–anoxic biological filter reactor that simulates circulation from an aerobic reactor. At a total organic carbon loading rate of 2.7–5.8 kgC/m³·day, sulfate reduction and methane production occurred simultaneously in the anaerobic column of the reactor. Specifically, sulfate reduction resulted in organic matter removal rates of 38 and 26% at ambient temperature and 25 °C, respectively. Furthermore, both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification occurred in the anoxic column, and when the organic loading rate in the anoxic reactor was below 0.2 kgC/m³·day, 33%–37% of ammonium and 33%–34% of nitrite were removed by the anammox reaction. Heterotrophic denitrification bacteria (Thauera, Comamonas, and Denitratisoma) and sulfur denitrification bacteria (Sulfurimonas denitriﬁcans) grew in the lower and middle parts of the anoxic column, whereas anammox bacteria (2.5% of Candidatus Brocadia at ambient temperature and 9.4% of Candidatus Kuenenia at 25 °C) grew in the upper part of the anoxic column. These results indicate that the SRDAPN process based on sulfur cycle and anammox is useful for treatment of high strength wastewater with low energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aComamonas 3aThauera 3aambient temperature 3aammonium 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3adenitrification 3aenergy 3aeutrophication 3agroundwater contamination 3alivestock 3amethane production 3anitrites 3anitrogen 3asulfates 3asulfides 3asulfur 3asurface water 3atotal organic carbon 3awastewater 0aAnammox 0aLivestock wastewater 0aSulfur cycle 0aMicrobial community 0aNitrogen removal1 aMatsuura, Norihisa1 aHonda, Ryo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2577-98261 aYamashita, Takahiro1 aYamamoto-Ikemoto, Ryoko1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2862-04260 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 307 p.114459-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245011800208520170700326592002802033650001502061650001502076650001102091650001902102650001202121650001902133650003202152650002902184650001102213650001802224650001402242650002902256653001502285653001902300653002902319653003102348653003202379653002302411700005702434700005602491700001902547773011802566856008602684852000902770655001202779IND60762313020221116152431.0220606e20220401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Weimin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1312-505910aInnovation, carbon emissions and the pollution haven hypothesis: Climate capitalism and global re-interpretations  aThis article considers impacts from innovation, defined in terms of research and development expenditure, on carbon emissions. We relate our study to scholarship about the Environmental Kuznets Curve and the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, situating this analysis within literature about the compatibility of broadly capitalist systems and combating climate change. We thus incorporate scholarship surrounding themes such as climate capitalism and ecological modernization. There are three main research questions. First, what is the impact of increasing levels of innovation on emissions? Second, how does the level of economic development affect impacts from greater innovation on emissions? Third, does this analysis generate evidence to support the Pollution Haven Hypothesis? To test these questions, and three parallel hypotheses, we initially deployed a panel data model, based on World Bank data, incorporating control variables covering economic, spatial and environmental factors. We then split the country sample into two GDP-based cohorts to test for variations in effects related to economic development. Subsequently, a multi-input regional-output model was deployed to incorporate analysis of a pollution haven effect. Our analysis suggests that whilst greater innovation diminished carbon dioxide emissions for high-income countries, this effect could not be identified elsewhere. Furthermore, the multi-input regional-output model implied that explanations for these contrasting results might lie in a pollution haven effect. Overall, this study implied some acutely limited support for climate capitalism and ecological modernization, constructed on data from high-income countries alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Bank 3acapitalism 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental Kuznets curve 3aenvironmental management 3amodels 3amodernization 3apollution 3aresearch and development 0aInnovation 0aClimate change 0aCarbon dioxide emissions 0aPollution haven hypothesis 0aEnvironmental Kuznets curve 0aClimate capitalism1 aCole, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1312-50591 aSun, Jiajing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0175-00251 aWang, Shouyang0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Apr. 01, v. 307 p.114465-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245009800167520187300265592002802138650001402166650003102180650001202211650002902223650002502252650001802277650001502295650003602310650001502346650001802361650001502379650001102394650003202405650001802437650003502455650001302490650001402503650001202517650001302529650001302542650002102555650001202576653002102588653001802609653001902627653001802646653002502664653002202689700001402711700001902725700002002744700001802764700002102782700001802803773012202821856008302943852000903026655001203035IND60654829620221121140038.0200106e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065482962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1012652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrinivasan, R.10aPhytochemical, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative potential of Elaeagnus indica  aThe present investigation was aimed to evaluate the phytochemical nature as well as antimicrobial, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties of Eleaegnus indica. Different solvent (hexane, chloroform, acetone, ethyl acetate, and methanol) leaf extracts of E. indica were tested for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, antiproliferative and phytochemical properties by adopting standard methods. The extracts of E. indica were found to be good sources of a variety of phytoconstituents i.e., phenols (72.97 μg/mg GAE), flavonoids (92.07 μg/mg CE), tannins (62.97 μg/mg TAE), ascorbic acid (154.07 μg/mg AAE), proteins (115.46 μg/mg BSAE) and carbohydrates (193.77 GE). The acetone extract exhibited strong in vitro antioxidant potentials (NO● IC₅₀ = 39.43 μg/mL, ●OH IC₅₀ = 43.91 μg/mL, O₂●⁻ IC₅₀ = 48.30 μg/mL, DPPH● IC₅₀ = 70.32 μg/mL, and FRAP EC₅₀ = 48.69 μg/mL and total antioxidants 425.92 μg/mg AAE of dry extract) in all the tested methods. All the extracts of E. indica expressed a wide range of antimicrobial potential (6–24 mm) against most of the pathogens used in this study. The methanol extract exhibited remarkably high antibacterial potential against S. epidermidis (24 mm) followed by S. pneumoniae (20 mm) in the well diffusion method. The results of the antiproliferative activity of acetone extract showed a concentration dependent activity on the tested cell lines (U-937 cell line IC₅₀ = 46.75 μg/mL and HL-60 cell line IC₅₀ = 59.46 μg/mL). The present investigation highlighted that the acetone extract exhibited significant antiproliferative, antimicrobial, and antioxidant capacities and has provided scientific evidence for the development of novel antimicrobial, antioxidant and antiproliferative agents from E. indica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aElaeagnus 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aacetone 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acell lines 3achemical constituents of plants 3achloroform 3aethyl acetate 3aflavonoids 3ahexane 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aleaf extracts 3amedian effective concentration 3amethanol 3apathogens 3aphenols 3aproteins 3asolvents 3asuperoxide anion 3atannins 0aElaeagnus indica 0aLeaf extracts 0aPhytochemicals 0aAntimicrobial 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAntiproliferative1 aAruna, A.1 aManigandan, K.1 aPugazhendhi, A.1 aKim, Myunghee1 aShivakumar, M.S.1 aNatarajan, D.0 tBiocatalysis and agricultural biotechnology.g2019 July, v. 20 p.101265-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6239x1878-81817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2019.1012653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03108naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245016700166520174800333592002802081650001502109650001202124650002202136650002902158650002002187650001902207650000702226650001502233650002102248650002002269650001602289653002602305653002302331653003302354653003002387700001802417700001802435700002002453773011802473856008602591852000902677655001202686IND60762313120221116152517.0220509e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qian10aAdsorption of benzene on soils under different influential factors: an experimental investigation, importance order and prediction using artificial neural network  aThe adsorption of benzene on soils is specifically associated with its migration and transformation. Although previous studies have proved that the adsorption of benzene is affected by various factors, studies simultaneously considering the effects of multiple factors are rare. This study aimed to identify the qualitative and quantitative relationships between multiple influential factors and the adsorption capacity of benzene (BC). Batch adsorption experiments considering different influential factors, including initial concentration (IC), pH, temperature (T), ion strength (IS) and organic matter content (OMC), were conducted in three kinds of soils collected in a chemical industry park. The correlation analysis between different influential factors and BC was carried out based on the experimental data. The artificial neural network (ANN) was applied to predict BC. The results showed that BC increased with the increase of T. As the pH increased, BCs on silty loam and loam increased, while that on sandy loam decreased. Besides, BCs on silty loam and loam raised with increasing OMC, while that on sandy loam remained unchanged. BCs on all three kinds of soils attained their peaks when IS was small and then become stable with an increase in IS. The sequence of correlation between BC and influential factors is listed as IC > OMC > T > IS > pH for silty loam, OMC > IC > T > IS > pH for loam and IC > T > IS > pH > OMC for sandy loam. ANN analysis showed satisfactory accuracy in predicting BC under different influential factors. These results help us understand the important factors affecting benzene adsorption and provide a tool to get the adsorption information easily in complex site conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abenzene 3achemical industry 3aenvironmental management 3aneural networks 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aprediction 3asandy loam soils 3asilt loam soils 3atemperature 0aAdsorption of benzene 0aSoil contamination 0aMultiple influential factors 0aArtificial neural network1 aBian, Jianmin1 aRuan, Dongmei1 aZhang, Chunpeng0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 306 p.114467-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245013200162300001600294520181800310592002802128650002602156650001302182650001602195650001102211650002202222650001102244650001602255650004802271650003102319650001302350650001302363650001002376651001002386651001102396700001702407700001602424773011402440856007902554852000902633655001202642IND60514995120221120110111.0160310e20140701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499512DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2013.17172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChao, Guoxiang10aMolecular Epidemiological Characteristics and Clonal Genetic Diversity of Staphylococcus aureus with Different Origins in China  ap. 503-510.  aTo understand the intrinsic links and epidemic features of Staphylococcus aureus, isolates of this bacterium were collected from different origins in China. A total of 503 isolates from different sources were tested for the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and types of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) elements. Of these isolates, 250 were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results showed that MRSA isolates account for 21.67% and have five types. SCCmec type I, II, and III isolates were all from humans, while SCCmec type IV, V, and untypeable MRSA isolates were from clinical origin, pigs, raw milk, or environments. The results by MLST showed considerable molecular heterogeneity in 52 different sequence types (STs) including 16 novel STs, which yielded 7 clonal complexes (CCs) and 5 doublets (Ds). The results from these analyses showed that hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA), rather than community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), remained the major pathogenic bacterium in the clinical setting. CA-MRSA infections have been increasing and forming new pandemic clones. CC630, CC239, D9, and D398 were important clones in this study. CC630 was a new epidemic CA clone circulating among humans, environments, and animals. CC239 was a HA-MRSA-III pandemic clone of clinical origin. The D9 clone was a livestock-associated (LA) clone, which up to now, has spread only in livestock and has not been found in humans that live in Jiangsu province. In Europe and America, there are many reports of the ST398-LA-clone in pigs and in humans who are in contact with pigs. However, various studies in China, including this one, indicate that the ST398 clone could be a CA clone rather than an LA clone. This clone also has been infecting humans for about 2 decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3achromosomes 3aclones 3agenetic variation 3ahumans 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3amultilocus sequence typing 3apandemic 3araw milk 3aswine 3aChina 3aEurope1 aBao, Guangyu1 aJiao, Xinan0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 July 01, v. 11, no. 7 p.503-510dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2013.17173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03746naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014700168520180300315592002802118650002002146650002702166650002502193650002902218650001302247650000902260650001702269650001702286650001302303650001502316650000902331650001002340650001702350650001902367650001702386650001302403653002302416653004102439653002002480653003302500653003702533653003702570653003602607653002302643653003302666653001602699653002602715653002002741653004102761700001702802700001402819700001602833700001602849700005402865773011802919856008603037852000903123655001203132IND60762313420221116152437.0220509e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Haojie10aSustainable and efficient stabilization/solidification of Pb, Cr, and Cd in lead-zinc tailings by using highly reactive pozzolanic solid waste  aLead-zinc tailings (LZTs) are industrial by-products containing a large number of heavy metals that seriously harm the ecological environment and human health. This study was performed to propose a sustainable and efficient method for immobilizing Pb, Cr, and Cd in LZTs by using solid waste. To better assess the immobilization performance and mechanism, the leaching toxicity, fraction distribution, unconfined compressive strength, environmental risk assessment, and hydration products were explored. The LZTs were mixed and molded with different constituents of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) and rice husk ashes (RHAs) at different curing temperatures. Results suggest that ≥99% of the Pb, Cr, and Cd were immobilized mainly in the form of residual fractions in the LZTs. The amounts of Pb, Cr, and Cd in the bioavailable fractions notably decreased by approximately 99.83%, 99.58%, and 97.05%, respectively. After stabilization/solidification (S/S) disposal, Pb, Cr, and Cd showed low to even no risk. The RHAs were effective to stabilize Pb, and GGBFS was effective to stabilize Cr. However, both materials showed almost equal effects to Cd. Ettringite, C–S–H gel, and portlandite were the main hydration products to immobilize Pb, Cr, and Cd, and these hydration products provided a source of strength. Honey-comb or reticular network C–S–H gel possessed higher specific surface area, higher pore volume, and bigger pore size than the other materials. The proposed method could explain the sustainability and efficiency of the S/S of Pb, Cr, and Cd in LZTs by using RHAs. This study opens up new perspectives for disposing heavy metal by using accessible agricultural solid waste (i.e., RHAs) in rural areas, and the solidified block shows certain economic benefits.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acombs (social insects) 3acompression strength 3aenvironmental assessment 3afurnaces 3agels 3aheavy metals 3ahuman health 3aporosity 3arice hulls 3arisk 3aslags 3asolid wastes 3asolidification 3asurface area 3atoxicity 0alead-zinc tailings 0aground granulated blast furnace slag 0arice husk ashes 0astabilization/solidification 0alead-zinc tailings mortar blocks 0aordinary portland cement PO 42.5 0aunconfined compressive strength 0aLead-zinc tailings 0aStabilization/solidification 0aHeavy metal 0aFraction distribution 0aRice hush ashes 0aGround granulated blast furnace slag1 aJu, Chenxuan1 aZhou, Min1 aChen, Jiaao1 aDong, Yiqie1 aHou, Haobo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3414-880X0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 306 p.114473-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1144733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03673naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245009500205300001600300506007600316520177500392592002802167506003702195650002602232650003302258650001302291650002702304650001502331650002102346650000902367650001902376650002002395650001602415650001902431650001402450650001402464650000902478650001402487650002402501651001802525700001602543700002502559700002102584700002102605700002402626700002102650700001602671700002302687700001302710700001402723700002002737700002002757700002902777700002602806773011502832856007902947852000903026655001203035IND60514995320221207130947.0160310e20140901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499532DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2014.17482doi7 aPMC41527872pmcid7 a248243682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNemser, Sarah M.10aInvestigation of Listeria, Salmonella, and Toxigenic Escherichia coli in Various Pet Foods  ap. 706-709.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Veterinary Laboratory Investigation and Response Network (Vet-LIRN), in collaboration with the Food Emergency Response Network (FERN) and its Microbiology Cooperative Agreement Program (MCAP) laboratories, conducted a study to evaluate the prevalence of selected microbial organisms in various types of pet foods. The goal of this blinded study was to help the Center for Veterinary Medicine prioritize potential future pet food–testing efforts. The study also increased the FERN laboratories' screening capabilities for foodborne pathogens in animal feed matrices, since such pathogens may also be a significant health risk to consumers who come into contact with pet foods. Six U.S. Food and Drug Administration FERN MCAP laboratories analyzed approximately 1056 samples over 2 years. Laboratories tested for Salmonella, Listeria, Escherichia coli O157:H7 enterohemorrhagic E. coli, and Shiga toxin–producing strains of E. coli (STEC). Dry and semimoist dog and cat foods purchased from local stores were tested during Phase 1. Raw dog and cat foods, exotic animal feed, and jerky-type treats purchased through the Internet were tested in Phase 2. Of the 480 dry and semimoist samples, only 2 tested positive: 1 for Salmonella and 1 for Listeria greyii. However, of the 576 samples analyzed during Phase 2, 66 samples were positive for Listeria (32 of those were Listeria monocytogenes) and 15 samples positive for Salmonella. These pathogens were isolated from raw foods and jerky-type treats, not the exotic animal dry feeds. This study showed that raw pet foods may harbor food safety pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella. Consumers should handle these products carefully, being mindful of the potential risks to human and animal health.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aInternet 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aanimal pathogens 3adogs 3afood pathogens 3afood purchasing 3afood safety 3amicroorganisms 3apet foods 3araw foods 3arisk 3ascreening 3aveterinary medicine 3aUnited States1 aDoran, Tara1 aGrabenstein, Michael1 aMcConnell, Terri1 aMcGrath, Timothy1 aPamboukian, Ruiqing1 aSmith, Angele C.1 aAchen, Maya1 aDanzeisen, Gregory1 aKim, Sun1 aLiu, Yong1 aRobeson, Sharon1 aRosario, Grisel1 aMcWilliams Wilson, Karen1 aReimschuessel, Renate0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 11, no. 9 p.706-709dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089%2Ffpd.2014.17483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009900161300001600260520128100276592002801557650002501585650002701610650001201637650002801649650001401677650001301691650001901704650002101723650001401744650001401758650004701772650003301819650001301852700001701865700001701882700001701899700001201916700004001928773013401968856007702102852000902179655001202188IND60514995420221120085555.0160310e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051499542DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2013.17272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Moutong10aPrevalence and Contamination Patterns of Listeria monocytogenes in Flammulina velutipes Plants  ap. 620-627.  aFour mushroom (Flammulina velutipes) production plants were sampled to investigate the prevalence and contamination source of Listeria monocytogenes. Among 295 samples, the prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 18.6%; the contamination appeared to originate from the mycelium-scraping machinery, contaminating both the product and upstream packaging equipment. Of 55 L. monocytogenes isolates, lineages I.1 (1/2a-3a) and II.2 (1/2b-3b-7) accounted for 65.5% and 34.5%, respectively. In addition, lineage I.1 formed significantly thicker biofilms than those within lineage II.2, as determined by crystal violet staining and scanning electron microscopy. Genotype analyses of L. monocytogenes isolates using enterobacteria repetitive intergenic consensus-polymerase chain reaction, and random amplified polymorphic DNA revealed that the surfaces of mycelium-scraping machinery may serve as the main source of L. monocytogenes contamination in three of the four plants. This study was the first report to explore the potential contamination sources of L. monocytogenes in the mushroom production chain, thereby providing baseline information for adopting prophylactic measures for critical control points during production in mushroom plants to avoid L. monocytogenes contamination.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFlammulina velutipes 3aListeria monocytogenes 3abiofilm 3acritical control points 3aequipment 3agenotype 3agentian violet 3amushroom growing 3amushrooms 3apackaging 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astaining1 aWu, Qingping1 aZhang, Jumei1 aGuo, Weipeng1 aWu, Shi1 aYang, Shelby X.q(Shelby Xiaobing),0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 8 p.620-627dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2013.17273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011300162520112200275592002801397650001401425650001401439650001301453650001801466650002301484650002001507650003101527650001401558650001401572653001201586700001901598700001501617700001301632700001301645700001501658700001901673773012101692856008201813852000901895655001201904IND60762314020221116152302.0220207e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2021.1115502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Juan10aLeukemia inhibitory factor prevents chicken follicular atresia through PI3K/AKT and Stat3 signaling pathways  aAutophagy of granulosa cell (GC) may be a supplementary mechanism involved in follicular atresia through cooperating with apoptosis. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has been shown to promote follicular growth, through the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, triggered the elevation of GC apoptosis within follicles, and then prevented follicular growth. However, combined treatment with LIF relieved the follicular regression caused by rapamycin, mainly resulting in alleviating the decline of GCs viability and cell autophagic apoptosis, and eventually, promoting follicle development. Further investigation revealed that LIF inhibited the GC autophagic apoptosis by activating PI3K/AKT and Stat3 pathways, reflecting an increase of BCL-2 expression but a decrease in BECN1. Additionally, blocking PI3K/AKT and Stat3 pathways resulted in the reduction of LIF protection against follicular atresia. These findings illustrated that LIF activated the PI3K/AKT and Stat3 signaling pathways to inhibit GC autophagic cell death, and further relieve chicken follicular atresia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3achickens 3aendocrinology 3afollicular atresia 3agranulosa cells 3aleukemia inhibitory factor 3arapamycin 3aviability 0aChicken1 aGuo, Changquan1 aZhou, Shuo1 aZhao, An1 aLi, Jian1 aMi, Yuling1 aZhang, Caiqiao0 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 543 p.111550-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1115503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02894naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245015500159520167000314592002801984650002302012650001802035650001502053650002202068653002202090653001302112653001002125653000802135653001902143700001602162700001602178700001802194700001802212700001602230700005002246773012102296856008202417852000902499655001202508IND60762314120221116152242.0220207e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076231412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.mce.2021.1115512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe, Fei10alncRNA ZNF674-AS1 inhibits the migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of thyroid cancer cells by modulating the miR-181a/SOCS4 axis  aThyroid cancer (TC) is a very common endocrine cancer worldwide. Further understanding and revealing the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer are indispensable for the development of effective diagnosis and treatments. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a series of non-coding RNAs with a length of >200 nts, have been regarded as crucial regulators of many cancers playing a tumor suppressive or oncogenic role, depending on circumstances. lncRNA ZNF674-AS1 was reported to be abnormally expressed in TC, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to probe the mechanism and roles of ZNF674-AS1 in TC. The expression patterns of RNAs and proteins were determined via qRT–PCR and western blotting, respectively. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion were detected using MTT and Transwell assays. ZNF674-AS1 and SOCS4 expression were remarkably reduced while miR-181a was upregulated in TC tissues and cells. Enforced expression of ZNF674-AS1 inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and reduced tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistic assays verified that ZNF674-AS1 directly interacted with miR-181a to increase SOCS4 expression. In addition, miR-181a overexpression aggravated proliferation, metastasis and EMT by inhibiting SOCS4. Interestingly, inhibition of miR-181a diminished the promoting effects of ZNF674-AS1 silencing on the malignant behaviours of TC cells. These data illustrated that ZNF674-AS1 alleviated TC progression by modulating the miR-181a/SOCS4 axis (graphical abstract), further suggesting that ZNF674-AS1 might be used as a therapheutic target in TC treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell proliferation 3aendocrinology 3ametastasis 3athyroid neoplasms 0alncRNA ZNF674-AS1 0amiR-181a 0aSOCS4 0aEMT 0aThyroid cancer1 aLi, Hong-Mi1 aLv, Qiao-Li1 aChen, Jun-Jun1 aLin, Qian-Xia1 aJi, Yu-Long1 aYi, Bo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0971-09920 tMolecular and cellular endocrinology.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 544 p.111551-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12477x0303-72077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2021.1115513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167520116400286592002801450650004401478650002901522650002201551650001201573650002201585650002801607650002701635650001201662650002301674650002401697650001701721650002001738650001501758650002401773650002101797650002001818650000901838650003301847650001501880650002101895650001601916653000801932653004201940653001201982653002101994700002002015700005802035773011002093856008402203852000902287655001202296IND60654830720221121232812.0200128e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065483072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1002952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Bikash10aPretreatment of rice straw using microwave assisted FeCl3-H3PO4 system for ethanol and oligosaccharides generation  aIn this study, Box–Behnken design Response Surface Methodology (BBD-RSM) was used to develop microwave-assisted pretreatment (MAP) for Rice Straw (RS) using FeCl₃-H₃PO₄ system. The concentration of FeCl₃ and H₃PO₄, pretreatment temperature and time was used as independent variables and complex severity considering the effect of all variables were also calculated. Based on BBD-RSM, 57.5% of sugar yield per biomass was obtained for pretreated (MAP) RS using FeCl₃ (0.35 M), H₃PO₄ (3%), pretreatment temperature and time of 155 °C and 10 min respectively with intermediate complex severity of 3.0. Based on the structural analysis using FTIR and XRD, it was suggested that the pretreatment results in reduction of crystallinity of RS that result in high crystallinity index (CrI) of 49.9% for efficient hydrolysis. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) of pretreated (MAP) RS resulted in maximum ethanol production of 7.0% (v/v) using in-house cellulase and Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTCC-173. The hydrolysis of pretreated (MAP) RS pulp using in-house produced endoxylanase resulted in generation of oligosaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aX-ray diffraction 3abiomass 3acrystal structure 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aendo-1,4-beta-xylanase 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aexperimental design 3afermentation 3aferric chloride 3ahydrolysis 3amicrowave treatment 3aoligosaccharides 3aphosphoric acid 3apulp 3aresponse surface methodology 3arice straw 3asaccharification 3atemperature 0aRSM 0aMicrowave-Assisted Pretreatment (MAP) 0aEthanol 0aOligosaccharides1 aBhardwaj, Nisha1 aVerma, Pradeep1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2266-94370 tBioresource technology reports.g2019 Sept., v. 7 p.100295-dElsevier LtdwJournal:26760x2589-014X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biteb.2019.1002953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03389naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005800139245016400197300001400361500001900375500002000394520194200414592002802356650001902384650001002403650001402413650001602427650001002443650002102453650002602474650001602500650001302516650001902529650002402548700002602572700002302598700005802621700002402679700002302703773014702726856007302873852000902946655001202955IND60726592320221121154855.0210207e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072659232DNAL7 a10.1111/vec.130112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLynch, Alex M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8747-094X10aEvaluation of point‐of‐care coagulation tests as alternatives to anti‐Xa activity for monitoring the anticoagulant effects of rivaroxaban in healthy dogs  ap. 18-24.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate a panel of coagulation assays for their potential utility in rivaroxaban monitoring as alternatives to the rivaroxaban‐specific anti‐Xa activity (RIVA). DESIGN: Prospective experimental study. SETTING: University research laboratory. ANIMALS: Five healthy neutered male Beagles. INTERVENTIONS: Dogs were administered a median dose of 1.8 mg/kg rivaroxaban (range, 1.6–1.8 mg/kg) orally once daily for 2 consecutive days as part of a pharmacodynamic study. Blood was collected from a preplaced jugular catheter at time points relative to their rivaroxaban administration (0, 2, 4, 8, 24, 36, and 48 h) for measurement of RIVA, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time, RapidTEG, and thrombin generation variables. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred forty data points were available for analysis. There was poor correlation between RIVA and RapidTEG variables: R time (R) (min) (r = 0.554, P < 0.0001), K time (K) (min) (r = –0.204, P = 0.016), alpha angle (degrees) (r = 0.152, P = 0.073), Maximum amplitude (MA) (mm) (r = 0.106, P = 0.215), and G value (G) (dynes/s) (r = 0.108, P = 0.205). A good correlation was noted between thrombin generation variables and RIVA: lag time (min) (r = 0.827, P < 0.0001), peak (nM) (r = –0.752, P < 0.0001), and endogenous thrombin potential (nM·min) (r = –0.762, P < 0.0001). There was an excellent correlation between PT and RIVA (r = 0.915, P < 0.0001) and a good correlation between activated partial thromboplastin time and RIVA (r = 0.772, P < 0 .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Of all the coagulation tests investigated, the PT correlated best with RIVA. There is potential for PT being a convenient second‐line monitoring option in dogs receiving rivaroxaban, but further work is necessary to validate other PT assays. Thromboelastography performed with strong activators correlated poorly with anti‐Xa activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanticoagulants 3ablood 3acatheters 3acoagulation 3amales 3apharmacodynamics 3apoint-of-care systems 3aprothrombin 3athrombin 3athromboplastin 3auniversity research1 aRuterbories, Laura K.1 aGriffith, Emily H.1 aHanel, Rita M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7088-63751 aStablein, Alyssa P.1 aBrooks, Marjory B.0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2021 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.18-24dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl69848x1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vec.130113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03013naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245011500159300001600274520183200290592002802122650001302150650000802163650001102171650001902182650002402201650002502225650001502250650001902265650001202284650001602296650001302312650001002325650001702335700001302352700002002365773010502385856008102490990002302571852000902594655001202603IND60092974920221121055104.0141103e20110315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009297492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cej.2011.01.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yu10aThermal and hydrothermal stability of a metal monolithic anodic alumina support for steam reforming of methane  ap. 341-350.  aIn this work, a plate-type Al/Fe–Cr alloy/Al clad material was prepared into a metal-monolithic anodic alumina support (Al₂O₃/Fe–Cr alloy/Al₂O₃) to investigate its thermal and hydrothermal stability and potential use in the steam reforming of methane (SRM). re-heating of the base material at 500°C for 3h or longer significantly enhanced the thermal resistance temperature of the support, which was associated with the formation of the diffusion layer between the alumina layer and the alloy layer. Pore widening treatment (PWT) in 4.0wt.% oxalic acid solution at 20°C for 4–8h provided an excellent anodic support that was strong enough to endure a 1000°C calcination without the alumina layer shelling off. The appearance of an increased number of smaller fragments and cracks on the support surface was considered to be one of the main reasons for the promotion effect of PWT. During a thermal shock test of the heating–cooling cycles from ambient temperature to 800°C for 5000 times, no alumina layer was found to shell off from the alloy interlayer, which highlighted the good adhesion between the alumina layer and the alloy layer in the anodic alumina support. Although an obvious decrease of surface area was observed when calcining the support in air or steam at 700°C, the anodic alumina-supported Ni catalyst showed favorable catalytic durability and hydrothermal stability in the stationary SRM test for 3000h and the DSS-like (daily start-up and shut-down) test for 500 times in a typical hydrothermal environment (700°C, Steam/Carbon=3, 157,000mL/(hg)). Especially, under an electrical-heating pattern, the SRM reaction system could reach stability within ca. 10min, offering a strong possibility for shortening the start-up time of conventional SRM reformers from 1 to 2h to a few minutes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aair 3aalloys 3aaluminum oxide 3aambient temperature 3achemical engineering 3adurability 3aheat tolerance 3amethane 3aoxalic acid 3ashelling 3asteam 3asurface area1 aZhou, Lu1 aKameyama, Hideo0 tChemical engineering journal.g2011 Mar. 15, v. 168, no. 1 p.341-350dElsevier B.V.x1385-89477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2011.01.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245010500164300001400269500001900283500002000302520195700322592002802279650001302307650001602320650001302336650001902349650002002368650001302388650001302401650001202414650001502426650001002441650001402451650001302465650001402478650001402492650002602506650001302532700001902545700001902564700001902583700001902602700002002621773014702641856007302788852000902861655001202870IND60726592520221121193604.0210207e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072659252DNAL7 a10.1111/vec.130262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScotti, Katherine M.10aRetrospective evaluation of the effects and outcome of bromethalin ingestion: 192 Dogs (2010–2016)  ap. 94-98.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of clinical signs, dose ingested, and outcome in a large group of dogs with bromethalin ingestion. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of dogs from 2010 to 2016. SETTING: Three university teaching hospitals and 1 private practice. ANIMALS: A total of 192 dogs with bromethalin ingestion. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Total 192 cases were identified, of which 25 dogs developed clinical signs. Five cases initially had severe neurological signs and were euthanized. A sum of 187 dogs survived to discharge. The total ingested dose was recorded in 59 dogs with a median (interquartile range) 0.2 mg/kg (0.28 mg/kg). The remaining 133 dogs had confirmed ingestion reported by owners (witnessed ingestion or colored feces) but the total dose could not be calculated. The median (interquartile range) time to presentation for all dogs was 2 hours (4.8 h). A majority of patients were treated on an outpatient basis (121/192) and 71 of 192 were treated as inpatients with 58 of 71 receiving fluid diuresis. Decontamination was performed in 179 dogs including emesis induction (14), activated charcoal administration (42), and both (123). Emesis was successful in 128 dogs and apomorphine was the most common emetic agent (121). Mild to severe clinical signs at admission were reported in 19 cases including vomiting (6), tremors (5), lethargy (4), ataxia (3), weakness (2), diarrhea (2), collapse (2), and and anorexia (2). One case developed ataxia and tremors within 72 hours of admission. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Symptoms of bromethalin toxicosis are uncommon, and most ingested doses are well below the reported dose expected to cause clinical signs. In this patient population, prognosis was excellent unless severe clinical signs were noted, which carried a high euthanasia rate. Effects of treatment on outcome could not be evaluated due to the low number of patients that developed clinical signs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia 3aapomorphine 3acharcoal 3acohort studies 3adecontamination 3adiarrhea 3adiuresis 3aemetics 3aeuthanasia 3afeces 3aingestion 3apatients 3apoisoning 3aprognosis 3aretrospective studies 3avomiting1 aLevy, Nyssa A.1 aThomas, Alicia1 aPfeifer, Julie1 aGarcia, Nicole1 aKoenigshof, Amy0 tJournal of veterinary emergency and critical care.g2021 Jan., v. 31, no. 1 p.94-98dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl69848x1479-32617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vec.130263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005500149245010300204500002200307520190100329592002802230650001302258650001802271650003802289650002102327650002002348650001602368650001802384650002002402650003302422650001302455650001502468650002102483650002502504653004102529653002902570653002102599700001702620700001702637700002002654773006702674856008302741852000902824655001202833IND60584522020221122143218.0171025s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058452202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jprot.2017.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yiying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6459-223110aMagnetic capture of polydopamine-encapsulated Hela cells for the analysis of cell surface proteins  aPre-press version  aA novel method to characterize cell surface proteins and complexes has been developed. Polydopamine (PDA)-encapsulated Hela cells were prepared for plasma membrane proteome research. Since the PDA protection, the encapsulated cells could be maintained for more than two weeks. Amino groups functionalized magnetic nanoparticles were also used for cell capture by the reaction with the PDA coatings. Plasma membrane fragments were isolated and enriched with assistance of an external magnetic field after disruption of the coated cells by ultrasonic treatment. Plasma membrane proteins (PMPs) and complexes were well preserved on the fragments and identified by shot-gun proteomic analytical strategy. 385 PMPs and 1411 non-PMPs were identified using the method. 85.2% of these PMPs were lipid-raft associated proteins. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed for bio-information extraction from the identified proteins. It was found that 653 non-PMPs had interactions with 140 PMPs. Among them, epidermal growth factor receptor and its complexes, and a series of important pathways including STAT3 pathway were observed. All these results demonstrated that the new approach is of great importance in applying to the research of physiological function and mechanism of the plasma membrane proteins.This work developed a novel strategy for the proteomic analysis of cell surface proteins. According to the results, 73.3% of total identified proteins were lipid-raft associated proteins, which imply that the proposed method is of great potential in the identification of lipid-raft associated proteins. In addition, a series of protein-protein interactions and pathways related to Hela cells were pointed out. All these results demonstrated that our proposed approach is of great importance and could well be applied to the physiological function and mechanism research of plasma membrane proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3aencapsulation 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3ahuman cell lines 3amagnetic fields 3amethodology 3ananoparticles 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteome 3aproteomics 3asurface proteins 3aultrasonic treatment 0aPolydopamine-encapsulated Hela cells 0aPlasma membrane proteins 0aMagnetic capture1 aYan, Guoquan1 aGao, Mingxia1 aZhang, Xiangmin0 tJournal of proteomics.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x1874-39197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jprot.2017.10.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01909naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245006700208300001600275520078800291592002801079650002801107650002901135650001701164650001001181650001001191650001801201650001901219651001101238700003301249700002901282700002401311700002201335773009801357856008301455852000901538655001201547IND60752372720221120032200.0211130e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075237272DNAL7 a10.1007/s13592-021-00878-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDa-Costa, Tairis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3970-476110aMite diversity is determined by the stingless bee host species  ap. 950-959.  aMites can establish ecologically mutualistic and/or commensal relationships with stingless bees. In the present study, we evaluated the acarine diversity associated with colonies of three stingless bee species (Melipona quadrifasciata quadrifasciata, Scaptotrigona bipunctata and Tetragonisca fiebrigi) in seven localities of southern Brazil. A total of 1458 mites from 18 species/morphospecies were sampled. The colonies of Melipona q. quadrifasciata showed the highest richness of mites, but T. fiebrigi was the bee species with the highest acari diversity among the evaluated species. This information suggests a close relationship between mites and stingless bees, which has direct implications for the transport of hives and non-naturally occurring species to different regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelipona quadrifasciata 3aScaptotrigona bipunctata 3aTetragonisca 3ahosts 3amites 3amorphospecies 3astingless bees 3aBrazil1 ados Santos, Charles Fernando1 aRodighero, Luana Fabrina1 aFerla, Noeli Juarez1 aBlochtein, Betina0 tApidologie.g2021 Oct., v. 52, no. 5 p.950-959dSpringer PariswJournal:1968x0044-84357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13592-021-00878-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245014500165300001600310520186900326592002802195650000902223650001502232650002002247650002202267650003402289650001602323650001602339650001202355650001102367650001002378650002702388650003602415650002102451650002402472650002102496650001202517650001702529650001002546651001302556700002402569700001902593700002402612700002702636700001402663700002002677773011602697856007702813852000902890655001202899IND60514978220221119010851.0160310e20131201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497822DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2013.00522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlaimo, Katherine10aEffects of Changes in Lunch-Time Competitive Foods, Nutrition Practices, and Nutrition Policies on Low-Income Middle-School Children's Diets  ap. 509-523.  aBackground: The School Nutrition Advances Kids project tested the effectiveness of school-initiated and state-recommended school nutrition practice and policy changes on student dietary intake in low-income middle schools.Methods: Schools recruited by an application for grant funding were randomly assigned to (1) complete an assessment of nutrition education, policies, and environments using the Healthy School Action Tools (HSAT) and implement an action plan, (2) complete the HSAT, implement an action plan, and convene a student nutrition action team, (3) complete the HSAT and implement an action plan and a Michigan State Board of Education nutrition policy in their cafeteria à la carte, or (4) a control group. All intervention schools were provided with funding and assistance to make self-selected nutrition practice, policy, or education changes. Block Youth Food Frequency Questionnaires were completed by 1176 seventh-grade students from 55 schools at baseline and during eighth-grade follow-up. Nutrient density and food group changes for the intervention groups were compared to the control group, controlling for baseline dietary intake values, gender, race/ethnicity, school kitchen type, urbanization, and percent of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. Analyses were conducted by randomization and based on changes the schools self-selected.Results: Improvements in students' nutrient density and food group intake were found when schools implemented at least three new nutrition practice changes and established at least three new nutrition policies. Students in schools that introduced mostly healthful foods in competitive venues at lunch demonstrated the most dietary improvements.Conclusions: New USDA nutrition standards for à la carte and vending will likely increase the healthfulness of middle school children's diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUSDA 3acafeterias 3achild nutrition 3achildhood obesity 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood groups 3afood intake 3afunding 3agender 3alunch 3amiddle school students 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anutrient density 3anutrition education 3anutrition policy 3aschools 3aurbanization 3ayouth 3aMichigan1 aOleksyk, Shannon C.1 aDrzal, Nick B.1 aGolzynski, Diane L.1 aLucarelli, Jennifer F.1 aWen, Yalu1 aVelie, Ellen M.0 tChildhood obesity.g2013 Dec. 01, v. 9, no. 6 p.509-523dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2013.00523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245009400161300001600255520187600271592002802147650003202175650001402207650002202221650001302243650002002256650001302276650001902289650001902308650001402327650001702341650001202358650001402370650001102384650001802395650001302413650001802426650001302444651001102457700002402468700002102492700001902513700002702532773011702559856007702676852000902753655001202762IND60514978620221119011443.0160310e20151201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497862DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2015.00312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, Karen10aUnderstanding Academic Clinicians' Decision Making for the Treatment of Childhood Obesity  ap. 696-706.  aBackground: Although most clinicians agree that obesity is a major problem, treatment rates remain low. We conducted this discrete choice experiment (DCE) to understand academic clinicians' decisions in treating childhood obesity.Methods: A total of 198 academic pediatric surgeons, pediatricians, family physicians, and allied health professionals were recruited from 15 teaching hospitals across Canada to participate in this DCE. Participants completed 15 tasks choosing between three obesity treatment scenarios to identify the scenario in which they would most likely treat pediatric obesity.Results: Latent class analysis revealed two classes with early intervention and late intervention preferences. Participants in the early intervention group (30%) were sensitive to variations in patient and family support. They would likely intervene if patients were obese, with normal lipid levels, were prediabetic, had high blood pressure, and when obesity was lifestyle associated. Late intervention clinicians (70%) were more likely to intervene if patients were morbidly obese, had abnormal lipid levels, required insulin for diabetes, had very high blood pressure, or when obesity impacted the patient's mental health. Simulations predicted that increasing colleague support for intervention, providing expert consultation, and mobilizing multidisciplinary support would increase the likelihood of treating pediatric obesity earlier from 16.1% to 81.5%.Conclusions: This DCE was implemented to understand the factors clinicians use in making decisions. Most academic clinicians choose to intervene late in the clinical course when more-severe obesity-related morbidities are present. Increased support from colleagues, expert consultation, and multidisciplinary support are likely to lead to earlier treatment of obesity among academic clinicians caring for children.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallied health professionals 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adecision making 3adiabetes 3adisease course 3afamily support 3ahospitals 3ahypertension 3ainsulin 3alifestyle 3alipids 3amental health 3apatients 3apediatricians 3asurgeons 3aCanada1 aCunningham, Charles1 aPemberton, Julia1 aRimas, Heather1 aMorrison, Katherine M.0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Dec. 01, v. 11, no. 6 p.696-706dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2015.00313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245012900170520139000299592002801689650003001717650001201747650000901759650001501768650001901783650002201802650001301824650001801837650001601855650002101871653000801892653000801900653001601908653001601924653001501940653001201955700001701967700002501984773011602009856008702125852000902212655001202221IND60762296720221120193140.0220509e20220215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076229672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1152162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerma, Piyush12aA direct contact cooler design for simultaneously recovering latent heat and capturing SOx and NOx from pressurized flue gas  aIntegrated SOₓ and NOₓ removal technology using a direct contact cooler is a promising alternative for cleaning coal combustion flue gas, especially for pressurized combustion systems. Past investigations of integrated SOₓ and NOₓ removal have been limited to low-temperature processes, where the flue gas has been cooled upstream of the removal unit, and the moisture in the flue gas has been condensed out. This work presents a novel design that recovers the flue gas heat while simultaneously removing SOₓ and NOₓ in a single reactive-absorption column – direct contact cooler. A validated model was used to evaluate different direct contact cooler designs. Modeling results suggested that a counter-current column with a single water inlet can scrub 83% of the NOₓ and 96.5% of the SOₓ in 115 s, while an optimized design with multiple water inlets enhances the scrubbing of NOₓ by 9 percentage points and SOₓ by 3.5 percentage points, due to a 34% increase in residence time. It is also observed that the liquid-phase reaction between absorbed SOₓ and NOₓ plays a significant role in the removal of SO₂ from the flue gas for high-temperature scrubbing compared with low-temperature scrubbing. The design reinforces the potential of high-temperature SOₓ-NOₓ removal and heat recovery and suggests a means of reducing capital costs for such columns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3acapital 3acoal 3acombustion 3adirect contact 3aenergy conversion 3aflue gas 3aheat recovery 3alatent heat 3amodel validation 0aSOx 0aNOx 0aLatent heat 0aPressurized 0aCombustion 0aOxyfuel1 aYang, Zhiwei1 aAxelbaum, Richard L.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Feb. 15, v. 254 p.115216-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1152163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03879naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245013300170520195600303592002802259650001902287650001302306650001802319650001602337650002402353650002302377650000902400650001202409650002202421650001102443650002002454650001102474650002002485650002202505650001502527650001902542650001402561650001702575650001202592650002102604650001002625650001402635650000902649650002502658650002202683650002502705650003702730650001702767650001702784650002502801653003702826653002602863700001402889700002002903700001702923700001602940700002402956700001902980773012102999856008803120852000903208655001203217IND60654812520221118235204.0190807e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.1038242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Ai-Tian10aArbuscular mycorrhizal fungus alters root-sourced signal (abscisic acid) for better drought acclimation in Zea mays L. seedlings  aInoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can modify stomatal behavior and increase antioxidant enzyme activities and therefore play a pivotal role in plant growth. We hypothesised that inoculation with AM fungi postpones the non-hydraulic root signal and alters physiological and biochemical traits, which enhances drought tolerance and water-use efficiency (WUEB) for plant biomass. Two pot experiments (including progressive soil drying and partial root-zone drying) were conducted to reveal how mycorrhizal colonization altered root signal and its effects on plant growth, biochemical traits and WUEB in maize seedlings in drying soil. In our experiments, inoculation with Funneliformis mosseae improved water absorption and reduced the sensitivity of roots to drought. In addition, it decreased leaf abscisic acid (ABA) content of inoculated plants. Regardless of water conditions, plant biomass production, antioxidant enzyme activity, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and WUEB were elevated in AM fungal treatments compared to non-AM fungal treatments. Under water-stressed conditions, inoculation with F. mosseae greatly reduced leaf ABA content, and postponed the decline in photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance and osmotic adjustment. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was significantly lower in mycorrhizal plants than in non-inoculation plants. However, inoculation with F. mosseae increased antioxidant enzyme activities including peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). In this study, inoculation with F. mosseae reduced ABA accumulation that acts as a non-hydraulic root signal and thereby postponed a decline in stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, improved water use efficiency and antioxidant enzymes activities, and accordingly reduced proline and MDA content. Thus, inoculation with AM fungi played a role in effective defense for better drought acclimation in water-stressed maize seedlings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus mosseae 3aZea mays 3aabscisic acid 3aacclimation 3aantioxidant enzymes 3abiomass production 3acorn 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3adrying 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aperoxidase 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aproline 3aroot zone drying 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asoil 3astomatal conductance 3astomatal movement 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3awater use efficiency 0aArbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis 0aNon-hydraulic signals1 aZhu, Ying1 aChen, Ying-Long1 aRen, Hong-Xu1 aLi, Ji-Yuan1 aKay Abbott, Lynette1 aXiong, You-Cai0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2019 Nov., v. 167 p.103824-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2019.1038243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245012400167520106200291592002801353650001201381650001601393650001001409650001401419650002801433650002501461650001401486650001101500650001701511650002201528650001201550650002001562650002201582650003101604650002001635650001801655653001301673653000801686653002001694700001401714700001501728700001501743700001701758700001601775700001801791700005601809700001601865773010801881856008601989852000902075655001202084IND60654812620221118235225.0190807e20191101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1150802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Siqi10aFacile fabrication and characterization of highly stretchable lignin-based hydroxyethyl cellulose self-healing hydrogel  aIn this study, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the framework, borax as the cross-linker, and biomass lignin from pulping black liquors and biorefinery as the plasticizer were used to synthesize the lignin-based HEC-PVA (LCP) self-healing conductive hydrogel with highly stretchable and thermosensitive properties by the one-step fabrication method.

The LCP hydrogel also presented good thermosensitivity and electrical conductivity, and were very promising for applications in the fields of 3D printing and wearable electronic devices, that broadened the efficient utilization of biorefinery lignin.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3abiorefining 3aborax 3acellulose 3aelectrical conductivity 3aelectronic equipment 3ahydrogels 3alignin 3aplasticizers 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3apulping 3astorage modulus 3athermosensitivity 3athree-dimensional printing 3aviscoelasticity 3awaste liquors 0aRheology 0aPVA 0aThermosensitive1 aShuyi, Su1 aGan, Haibo1 aLinjun, Wu1 aLin, Chaohui1 aDanyuan, Xu1 aZhou, Haifeng1 aLin, Xuliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2170-59851 aQin, Yanlin0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2019 Nov. 01, v. 223 p.115080-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl47819x0144-86177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2019.1150803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02767naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245013900204300001400343506007600357520136800433592002801801506003701829650002201866650001301888650001601901650002501917650002201942650001201964650002201976650001401998650002602012650001502038650001002053700002302063700002802086700001802114773011502132856007702247852000902324655001202333IND60514979220221207073103.0160310e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497922DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2013.00702doi7 aPMC39221402pmcid7 a242991182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Dawn K.12aA Pilot Study of the Effects of a Tailored Web-Based Intervention on Promoting Fruit and Vegetable Intake in African American Families  ap. 77-84.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The current study examined the effects of a Web-based tailored parenting intervention on increasing fruit and vegetable intake in African American families.Methods: Forty-seven African American parents (mean age, 41.32±7.30; 93.6% female) with an adolescent (mean age, 13.32±1.46; 59.6% female) participated in a Web-based autonomy-support parenting tailored intervention session to increase both parent and youth fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake. The session lasted 45–60 minutes and included three phases: a feedback phase; a Web-based information phase, and a goal-setting and action plan phase. Self-reported measures of parenting skills [based on autonomy (choice), support, and communication] and F&V intake (assessed as average daily intake) were assessed at baseline and at a 1-week follow-up session.Results: There was a significant increase in parents' self-reports of daily fruit intake from pretest to the 1-week follow-up. Parent and adolescent combined F&V intake also significantly increased from pretest to 1-week follow-up. Overall, parents reported that the program was easy to navigate and that they enjoyed participating in the Web-based online program.Conclusions: Current findings provide preliminary support for an autonomy-support parent tailored Web-based program for improving dietary intake in African American families.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aInternet 3aadolescents 3aaverage daily intake 3achildhood obesity 3afemales 3afruit consumption 3aparenting 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 3ayouth1 aAlia, Kassandra A.1 aKitzman-Ulrich, Heather1 aResnicow, Ken0 tChildhood obesity.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 10, no. 1 p.77-84dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2013.00703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04256naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245015700169500002200326520202300348592002802371650002502399650001502424650002502439650001702464650001002481650002702491650001702518650001002535650002702545650001102572650001502583650001302598650002202611653009602633653002602729653003502755653004302790653004102833653004202874653002602916653003502942653004402977653003503021653002703056653005103083653003603134653002603170653003503196700002403231700002603255700002103281700003603302700001703338700003603355700002603391773010903417856008303526852000903609655001203618IND60762297720221123032645.0220124e20211223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076229772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2021.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuthu, Ram Kumar10aExtending Omega 3/6 Fatty Acid Pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana using Microalgal Gene Δ6Des for Stearidonic acid and Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid Production  aPre-press version  aTo enhance the quality and quantity of oils in plant systems, specific candidate genes such as desaturase and elongase that can extend the biosynthetic pathways of very long chain poly unsaturated fatty acids (VLCPUFAs) are essential. In general, plant systems are capable of synthesizing essential fatty acids (EFAs). However, incorporation of a preliminary gene, Δ6Desaturase (Δ6Des), in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway will elongate the pathway further to produce successive fatty acids. In this study, Δ6Des gene extracted from the marine microalga Isochrysis sp. was used to extend the omega (ω) 3/6 fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in a model plant Arabidopsis thaliana using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation. Hygromycin-resistant plants were (25 mg/L) used for GUS and GFP assays and for molecular confirmation. GUS assay showed an intense blue color in F₁ transgenic A. thaliana plant tissues grown in the selection medium, which confirmed the presence of GUS gene in the T-DNA region, whereas non-transformed plant tissues such as leaf or stem did not show any blue color. GFP analysis also showed a green fluorescent color in tissues such as leaf, stem, and floral parts of F1 transgenic A. thaliana plants, which confirmed the presence of T-DNA. PCR and Southern blotting analyses also clearly showed the presence of Δ6Des in the T-DNA region of the F₁ transgenic plants. The fatty acid profile of F₁ transgenic plants showed the production of new fatty acids such as stearidonic acid (SDA-0.58%) and dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA-25.34%) that were not observed in non-transformed control plants. All these results showed the synthesis of new fatty acids in the transgenic plant, which proved that PUFA biosynthetic pathway can be extended in oilseed plants if specific genes are introduced through genetic transformation. This is the first study to report the productions of new fatty acids like SDA and DGLA in A. thaliana using Δ6Des gene from marine microalga Isochrysis sp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aIsochrysis 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acolor 3afatty acid composition 3afluorescence 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3aleaves 3amicroalgae 3aoilseeds 3atransgenic plants 0aΔ6Desaturase, Arabidopsis thaliana, Genetic Transformation, PUFA, SDA, DGLA.

An Exploratory Analysis  ap. 87-93.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: It is unknown if parents with more than one adolescent child use similar or different parenting practices of relevance to weight-related health with different children. In particular, it is unclear whether parenting practices differ based on whether siblings are discordant on weight status (i.e., one is overweight/obese, one is nonoverweight/obese) or are different sexes.Methods: Data from two linked population-based studies, Eating and Activity in Teens (EAT) 2010 and Families and Eating and Activity in Teens (F-EAT), were used in this exploratory cross-sectional analysis. Participants included socioeconomically and racially/ethnically diverse parents (n = 57; 93% females) and adolescent siblings (n = 57 pairs; 60% girls; mean age = 14.5, range = 11–18). Students filled out surveys and had anthropometric measures taken in school. Parents filled out mailed surveys in their homes.Results: Overall, results from this exploratory study showed limited evidence that parents use different parenting practices with adolescents of different weight status or sex. However, potentially important patterns emerged when exploring parenting practices and siblings' weight status. For example, within sibling dyads with discordant weight status, parents reported significantly more negative weight-related conversations with overweight/obese siblings compared to nonoverweight/obese siblings (p < 0.05). Although observed differences were not statistically significant, parents also reported higher levels of food restriction (p = 0.05) and encouragement to diet (p = 0.07) with overweight/obese siblings compared to nonoverweight/obese siblings. There were no significant differences in parenting practices by adolescent sex.Conclusions: Results generally suggest that parents use similar parenting practices with adolescent siblings. However, notable patterns emerged when examining parenting practices and siblings' weight status that may be important to explore in future research.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3adiet 3aethnic differences 3afemales 3agirls 3aparents 3aphysical activity 3asiblings 3astudents 3asurveys1 aMeyer, Craig1 aMacLehose, Richard F.1 aLoth, Katie1 aNeumark-Sztainer, Dianne0 tChildhood obesity.g2016 Apr. 01, v. 12, no. 2 p.87-93dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2015.00493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008300204300001400287506007600301520147700377592002801854506003701882650001401919650002001933650002001953650002201973650001301995650002402008650002302032650002202055650001902077650002202096650001202118650002302130650001002153650001102163650002802174650001602202700002202218700002002240700001902260700002102279700001702300700001802317700002302335773011502358856007702473961001302550852000902563655001202572IND60514979820221207045221.0160310e20140201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497982DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2013.01162doi7 aPMC39222442pmcid7 a243679222pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaranowski, Tom10aSchool Year Versus Summer Differences in Child Weight Gain: A Narrative Review  ap. 18-24.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe causes of the current high prevalence of overweight and obesity among children are not clearly known. Schools have been implicated in the causal chain to high child obesity prevalence. Recent studies have compared school year versus summertime changes (herein called seasonal differences) in child adiposity or related phenomena. The most common seasonal pattern in six longitudinal descriptive studies was that overweight and obese children experienced accelerated gain in weight or some BMI indicator during the summer, whereas healthy weight children gained less or not at all. Four physical activity (PA) intervention studies demonstrated that school year fitness improvements were lost during the summer. One study showed that PA declined across the summer. Another study provided conflicting results of lower total energy expenditure in the summer, but no seasonal difference in total energy expenditure after adjusting for fat-free mass. This pattern of fairly rapid seasonal differences suggests that PA is the primary factor contributing to seasonal differences in weight or BMI, but the documented seasonal pattern in PA (i.e., higher in summer) does not support this relationship. Sleep duration has also been inversely related to child adiposity. Seasonal patterns in adiposity, PA, and sleep need to be clearly established separately for overweight and healthy weight children in further longitudinal research to provide a clear focus for national policy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadiposity 3abehavior change 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adescriptive studies 3aenergy expenditure 3aissues and policy 3alean body mass 3aphysical activity 3aschools 3aseasonal variation 3asleep 3asummer 3aweight control programs 3aweight gain1 aO'Connor, Teresia1 aJohnston, Craig1 aHughes, Sheryl1 aMoreno, Jennette1 aChen, Tzu-An1 aMeltzer, Lisa1 aBaranowski, Janice0 tChildhood obesity.g2014 Feb. 01, v. 10, no. 1 p.18-24dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2013.01163Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245013100166300001600297520181200313592002802125650001902153650002002172650001202192650003102204650001002235650003402245650001302279650001102292650002002303650001402323650002102337650002202358653001902380653002102399653002602420653004402446653002702490653004502517653002002562700001702582700001902599700002202618700002002640700002102660700002602681700001502707773011602722856008302838852000902921655001202930IND60762298520221120043540.0220809e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076229852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNehra, Ashima10aComprehensive genomic insight deciphers significance of EF-hand gene family in foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.]  ap. 652-665.  aAs a signaling molecule, calcium plays a vital role in the intracellular signaling in plants in response to various physiological and environmental factors. Signaling processes start just after stimulus-receptor interaction, and these signals are relayed and decoded by a range of calcium-binding proteins. The majority of calcium-binding proteins comprise the EF-hand motif with a helix-loop-helix structure. This study reports genome-wide analysis of EF-hand (SiEF-hand) gene family in foxtail millet [Setaria italica (L.) P. Beauv.]. The analysis resulted in the identification of 180 SiEF-hand genes. Further, we carried out phylogenetic, gene structure and motif analysis that resulted in clustering of the SiEF-hand genes in 13 clades broadly as per different subfamilies - calmodulins (CaMs), calmodulins-like proteins (CMLs), calcium-dependent proteins (CDPKs), calcineurin B-like (CBLs), respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rboh) and others. The domain architecture analysis highlighted 24 different domain compositions. Further, SiEF-hand genes are mapped to all nine chromosomes with uneven distribution. Cis-regulatory element analysis showed the presence of multiple stress and hormone-responsive elements in the promoter region of SiEF-hand genes. The most abundant cis-regulatory elements in SiEF-hand genes are ABRE, TGACG-motif, G-box, MYC, and MYB. Expression profiling of SiEF-hand genes in different tissues leaf, root, stem, and tassel inflorescence revealed differential expression patterns. Further, 8 SiEF-hand genes exhibited tissue-specific expression - four are expressed in roots and four in tassel inflorescences. In a nutshell, the present study provides a detailed insight into the SiEF-hand gene family and may serve as a base for further characterization of Ca²⁺ sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEF hand motifs 3aSetaria italica 3acalcium 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3aleaves 3aoxidoreductases 3aphylogeny 3apromoter regions 3arespiratory burst 0aEF-hand domain 0aCaM (Calmodulin) 0aCML (Calmodulin like) 0aCDPK (calcium-dependent protein kinase) 0aCBL (calcineurin like) 0aRboh (respiratory burst oxidase homolog) 0aCalcium-binding1 aKundu, Punam1 aAhlawat, Kirti1 aChhikara, Ashmita1 aAgarwala, Niraj1 aTuteja, Narendra1 aGill, Sarvajeet Singh1 aGill, Ritu0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Aug., v. 148 p.652-665dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014800165300001600313520201000329592002802339650002302367650001602390650001902406650002302425650001502448650001602463650002602479650002202505650001502527650001802542650002202560650001602582650001102598650001502609650002002624650001002644650001002654650001602664650001302680653001502693653002302708653001802731653001602749653002602765700001902791700001702810700002502827773015702852856008303009852000903092655001203101IND60654814220221118235033.0191004e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2019.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, M.G.F.10aEffects of three antimitotic agents on karyotype of Allium cepa L. and Lactuca sativa L.: two plant model species for cytogenotoxic assessments  ap. 244-250.  aAllium cepa L. and Lactuca sativa L. are two model plant species used in studies of environmental pollutants risk assessments. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of three antimitotic agents on the chromosome complement of A. cepa L. and L. sativa L. and compare the suitability of each one as model for evaluate the effects of environmental pollutants or natural toxic products in the chromosome morphology and cell cycle. To obtain the c-metaphase for the karyotype study, seeds of both species were germinated under controlled temperature, without photoperiod. The obtained roots (up to 2 cm) were treated with three antimitotic agents (colchicine, 8-hydroxyquinoline (8HQ) and cycloheximide) and then fixed in Carnoy. The slides were prepared by squash technique and stained with Schiff's reactive. Metaphases with chromosomes well spread and also individualized presenting defined centromeres were used for karyotype analysis. The A. cepa chromosomes were predominantly metacentric and the size of its chromosomes varied according to the antimitotic applied: 8.74 to 13.44 μm when treated with colchicine, 5.77 to 9.18 μm for 8-HQ and 7.71 to 12.00 μm for cycloheximide. They were categorized as large (L) chromosomes. The chromosomes of L. sativa were predominantly submetacentric and the size of them ranged from 2.60 to 5.30 μm (colchicine), 1.76 to 3.49 μm (8-HQ) and 1.46 to 3.31 μm (cycloheximide), having been classified as small (S). Antimitotic agents caused varying degrees of condensation in the chromosomes of the two species. Under the concentration and exposure time tested, cycloheximide proved to be the antimitotic agent best suited for obtaining best quality C-metaphase in A. cepa, with spread, adequately condensed chromosomes and with well-defined morphology. For L. sativa, the best results were obtained with 8-HQ. Apart from this, A. cepa presents karyotype more homogeneous contributing for a more confident assessment in cytogenetoxic studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3a8-hydroxyquinoline 3aAllium cepa 3aLactuca sativa 3aantimitotic agents 3acell cycle 3acentromeres 3achromosome morphology 3achromosome number 3acolchicine 3acycloheximide 3aexposure duration 3akaryotyping 3amodels 3apollutants 3arisk assessment 3aroots 3aseeds 3atemperature 3atoxicity 0aColchicine 0a8-hydroxyquinoline 0aCycloheximide 0aC-metaphase 0aChromosome complement1 aSilveira, G.L.1 aTechio, V.H.1 aAndrade-Vieira, L.F.0 tSouth African journal of botany.g2019 Sept., v. 125 p.244-250dElsevier B.V.aSouth African Association of BotanistswJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2019.07.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245008400204300001600288506007600304520206100380592002802441506003702469650001402506650001202520650001402532650001502546650002202561650001302583650002402596650001602620650001202636650001802648650001102666650001002677650002002687650002502707650001502732650001502747650001402762650002402776650001102800650002102811650001502832650001502847650001002862651001802872700002202890700002402912700002502936700003602961700002402997700002103021773011703042856007703159852000903236655001203245IND60514980720221207121150.0160310e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498072DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2014.00932doi7 aPMC45289892pmcid7 a262585612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConlon, Beth A.14aThe Role of Parenting Practices in the Home Environment among Underserved Youth  ap. 394-405.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: The home environment, which includes parenting practices, is an important setting in which children develop their health behaviors. We examined the role of parenting practices in the home environment among underserved youth.Methods: We examined baseline data of a family-focused pediatric obesity intervention. Parenting practices (monitoring, discipline, limit setting of soda/snacks [SS] and screen media [SM], pressure to eat, and reinforcement) and availability of fruits/vegetables (FV) and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), family meals, television (TV) watching during meals, TVs in the home, owning active video games/sports equipment, and household food security were assessed in 301 parent/caregivers of overweight/obese children (ages 7–12 years; BMI≥85th percentile). Associations were evaluated using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients and logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders.Results: Parents/caregivers (ages 22–67 years) were largely Hispanic/Latino (74.1%), female (92.4%), and reported high levels of limit setting SS and low levels of pressure to eat. Parent age, gender, country of birth, and years living in the United States accounted for differences among several parenting practices. Adjusted logistic regression models identified several statistically significant associations, including: Monitoring was positively associated with availability FV (odds ratio [OR]=2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25, 3.82); limit setting SS was inversely associated with availability of SSBs (OR=0.40; 95% CI, 0.21, 0.75); and limit setting SM was inversely associated with TV viewing during family meals (OR=0.51; 95% CI, 0.31, 0.85). Nearly 40% of our population was food insecure, and food insecurity was positively associated with pressure to eat (OR=1.77; 95% CI, 1.01, 3.15).Conclusions: Parenting practices play an important role in the home environment, and longitudinal studies are needed to examine these associations in the context of family-focused pediatric obesity interventions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHispanics 3aLatinos 3abeverages 3acaregivers 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3afemales 3afood security 3afruits 3agames 3ahealth behavior 3alongitudinal studies 3amonitoring 3aodds ratio 3aparenting 3aregression analysis 3asnacks 3asports equipment 3atelevision 3avegetables 3ayouth 3aUnited States1 aMcGinn, Aileen P.1 aLounsbury, David W.1 aDiamantis, Pamela M.1 aGroisman-Perelstein, Adriana E.1 aWylie-Rosett, Judy,1 aIsasi, Carmen R.0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 4 p.394-405dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2014.00933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100006200152245014700214520154300361592002801904650002801932650001001960650001301970650001301983650000901996650002602005650001302031650003102044653001902075653002102094653002102115653002302136653002402159653002002183700005902203700001702262700001902279773011002298856008702408852000902495655001202504IND60762299320221122044757.0220124e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076229932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.1109422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFahmy, Ahmed Raouf1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0218-938010aHardness targeted design and modulation of food textures in the elastic-regime using 3D printing of closed-cell foams in point lattice systems  aRecently, 3D printing has become an innovative technique in the structuring and modulation of food textures. The objective is to systematically extended 3D food printing to allow the production of cellular structures with specifically targeted textural properties. This study presents an approach for 3D printing structures with predefined hardness. As a step in the foundation of textural design, parameter fitting of 3D printed foams and finite element simulations was used to obtain a generalized hardness design formula for the 3D printing of closed-cell foams. Structures incorporating spherical bubbles arranged in point lattice cubic configurations were printed at different porosity levels. A complete 3D printing-stabilization method was applied with an integrated on-board layer-based heating and optimized for targeting heat induced material transitions to actively modulate the material's mechanical properties. FEM simulations were performed at different Young's moduli adjusted using variable heating speeds where the results showed an independency of hardness on the foam configuration and the distance between the closed-cell bubbles. Comparable hardness results were observed between the 3D printed and simulated samples where the same exponential decrease behavior was achieved. The hardness design formula was developed in relation to the material's Young's modulus, porosity, and printed geometry. The performance of the obtained relation showed comparable results to the FEM simulations and the 3D printed structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3afinite element analysis 3afoams 3ageometry 3ahardness 3aheat 3amodulus of elasticity 3aporosity 3athree-dimensional printing 0aTexture design 0aClosed-cell foam 0a3D food printing 0aTexture simulation 0aHardness modulation 0aIn-line heating1 aVogt, Ulrike T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0695-62951 aJekle, Mario1 aBecker, Thomas0 tJournal of food engineering.g2022 May, v. 320 p.110942-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2022.1109423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03735naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245013900175300001800314520198000332592002802312650002102340650001502361650001302376650002002389650001202409650001402421650001702435650001902452650002102471650001002492650001902502650001402521650001602535650001302551653002502564653001002589653001202599653001102611653001702622653002102639653001602660700001902676700002102695700002102716700002002737700005602757700002102813700001302834700002602847700001902873700002502892700002102917773010002938856008603038852000903124655001203133IND60654815020221118235101.0190830e20190903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacIntyre, C.

We conducted a multi-centre clinical trial to determine the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of HPV vaccine in immunocompromised children. Here we present the immunogenicity results 5 years post vaccination.We followed up immunocompromised children (5–18 years) with a range of specified underlying conditions who were previously recruited from three Australian paediatric hospitals. Participants received three doses of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil Quadrivalent HPV Types 6, 11, 16, 18) and were followed up between 2007 and 2016 (60 months post-vaccination). The immunogenicity primary outcome was seroconversion and geometric mean titres (GMT) of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine serotypes in the study.Of the 59 original participants, 37 were followed up at 60 months. The proportion of participants who seroconverted were: 86.5%, 89.2%, 89.2%, 91.9% by competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA) and 83.8%, 83.8%, 94.6%, 78.4% by total immunoglobulin G assays (IgG) for serotypes 6, 11, 16 and 18 respectively. GMT values ranged from 118 (95%CI: 79–177) for serotype 11, to 373 (95%CI: 215–649) for serotype 16 by cLIA. For IgG, serotype 16 had the highest GMT of 261 (95%CI: 143–477) and serotype 18 had the lowest value of 37 (95%CI: 21–68). All antibody titres were lower in females compared to males but the difference was not statistically significant except for serotype 16. No serious adverse event was reported during this follow-up period.Our evidence, although limited by small numbers, is reassuring that a three dose schedule of HPV vaccine remains immunogenic in immunocompromised children to five years post vaccination. Large scale studies are required to determine long term protection in immunocompromised children.Clinical trial registration: NCT02263703 (ClinicalTrials.gov).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPapillomaviridae 3aantibodies 3achildren 3aclinical trials 3afemales 3ahospitals 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunogenicity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3amales 3aseroconversion 3aserotypes 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aHuman papillomavirus 0aWarts 0aVaccine 0aCancer 0aImmunisation 0aImmunodeficiency 0aAdolescents1 aShaw, Peter J.1 aMackie, Fiona E.1 aBoros, Christina1 aMarshall, Helen1 aSeale, Holly1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1877-53951 aKennedy, Sean E.1 aMoa, Aye1 aChughtai, Abrar Ahmad1 aTrent, Mallory1 aO'Loughlin, Edward V1 aStormon, Michael0 tVaccine.g2019 Sept. 03, v. 37, no. 37 p.5630-5636dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.07.0723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100007200138245008700210500002000297520158400317592002801901596007701929596005202006596006702058650002302125650001202148650002502160650001202185650002602197650001202223650002402235650001902259651001202278651001102290700005902301700006302360700006202423773010902485856007202594852000902666655001202675IND60752376120221121032333.0211002e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075237612DNAL7 a10.1002/ecy.34582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFélix‐Burruel, Ricardo E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3803-748810aEpisodic recruitment in the saguaro cactus is driven by multidecadal periodicities  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aEach year, an individual mature large saguaro cactus produces about one million seeds in attractive juicy fruits that lure seed predators and seed dispersers to a 3‐month feast. From the million seeds produced, however, only a few will persist into mature saguaros. A century of research on saguaro population dynamics has led to the conclusion that saguaro recruitment is an episodic event that depends on the convergence of suitable conditions for survival during the critical early stages. Because most data have been collected in Arizona, particularly in the surroundings of Tucson, most research has relied on a limited amount of environmental variation. In this study, we upscaled this knowledge on saguaro recruitment to a regional scale with a new method that used the inverse‐growth modeling of 1,487 saguaros belonging to 13 populations in a latitudinal gradient ranging from arid desert to tropical thornscrub forest in Sonora, Mexico. Using generalized linear and additive mixed models, we created two 110‐yr‐long saguaro recruitment curves: one driven only by previous size, and the second driven by size, drought, and soil structure. We found evidence that saguaro recruitment is indeed episodic, with periodicities of 20–30 yr, possibly related to strong El Niño Southern Oscillation events. Our results suggest that saguaros rely on multidecadal periodic pulses of good beneficial years to incorporate new individuals into their populations. Inverse‐growth modeling can be used in a wide variety of plant species to study their recruitment dynamics.  aPublisher supplied data  aES008cComisión Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad  cEcologia para la Conservacion del Gran Desierto  aPAPIIT ‐ IN213814cUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México 3aCarnegiea gigantea 3aEl Nino 3acacti and succulents 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3apopulation dynamics 3asoil structure 3aArizona 3aMexico1 aLarios, Eugenio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4501-46521 aGonzález, Edgar J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9113-10701 aBúrquez, Alberto,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7738-700X0 tEcology.g2021 Oct., v. 102, no. 10 p.e03458-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46164x0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.34583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245011800170300001600288520178000304592002802084650001102112650001402123650002502137650002002162650002202182650001602204650002402220650002702244650001202271650002002283650001402303650003102317650001002348650001502358650001302373650002402386650002802410650001902438650001002457700002002467700001802487700002002505700002702525700002002552700002402572700002002596700002302616700001702639700002102656700002102677700002302698700001802721700002502739700001802764773011702782856007702899852000902976655001202985IND60514981420221120085325.0160310e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498142DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2015.00532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJasik, Carolyn Bradner10aCharacteristics of Youth Presenting for Weight Management: Retrospective National Data from the POWER Study Group  ap. 630-637.  aBackground: There are no existing multisite national data on obese youth presenting for pediatric weight management. The primary aim was to describe BMI status and comorbidities among youth with obesity presenting for pediatric weight management (PWM) at programs within the Pediatric Obesity Weight Evaluation Registry (POWER).Methods: Data were collected from 2009–2010 among 6737 obese patients ages 2–17. Patients were classified in three groups by BMI (kg/m²) cutoffs and percent of the 95th percentile for BMI: (1) obesity; (2) severe obesity class 2; and (3) severe obesity class 3. Weighted percentages are presented for baseline laboratory tests, blood pressure, and demographics. Generalized logistic regression with clustering was used to examine the relationships between BMI status and comorbidities.Results: Study youth were 11.6 ± 3.4 years of age, 56% female, 31% black, 17% Hispanic, and 53% publicly insured. Twenty-five percent of patients had obesity (n = 1674), 34% (2337) had severe obesity class 2, and 41% (2726) had severe obesity class 3. Logistic regression revealed that males (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5–2.0), blacks (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5–2.0), age <6 years (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5–2.6), and public insurance (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5–2.0) had a higher odds of severe obesity class 3. Severe obesity class 3 was associated with higher odds of laboratory abnormalities for hemoglobin A1c (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3–2.2), alanine aminotransferase ≥40 U/L (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3–2.6), and elevated systolic blood pressure (OR, 2.5; 95% CI, 2.0–3.0).Conclusions: Youth with obesity need earlier access to PWM given that they are presenting when they have severe obesity with significant comorbidities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBlacks 3aHispanics 3aalanine transaminase 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3acomorbidity 3aconfidence interval 3ademographic statistics 3afemales 3aglycohemoglobin 3ainsurance 3alaboratory experimentation 3amales 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3asystolic blood pressure 3aweight control 3ayouth1 aKing, Eileen C.1 aRhodes, Erinn1 aSweeney, Brooke1 aMietus-Snyder, Michele1 aGrow, H.

This study first constructs a growth model to investigate the correlation among land leasing revenue, infrastructure development and economic growth, and finds that with higher land-capital more land leasing revenue could directly accelerate economic growth and land leasing revenue could also indirectly slow economic growth by increasing public productive investment if the government size is large. Then we empirically testified these results using 280 cities' panel dataset, and it confirmed our theoretical results. The regression results show that increase of land leasing revenue will directly speed up economic growth, while the economic growth will increase by 0.2% with 1% increase of land leasing revenue; land leasing revenue, on the other side, successfully used as a municipal financing tool to sustain public infrastructure investments, indirectly hampers economic growth, where the indirect negative effect is -0.14. Our study contributes to better understanding of the special role of land leasing revenue in local economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3adata collection 3aeconomic development 3afunding 3agrowth models 3aincome 3ainfrastructure 3aleasing 3apublic lands 0aPublic land leasing 0aPublic productive spending 0aEconomic growth 0aChina0 tLand use policy.g2019 Nov., v. 88 p.104076-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.1040763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245008100168520113800249592002801387650001501415650001401430650001301444650001301457650000901470650001801479650001901497650002001516650001301536650001001549650001301559650001201572650001601584650001201600650000901612650002701621653001701648653001801665653003501683700001901718700001501737700001301752700001801765773010101783856008601884852000901970655001201979IND60654815720221118235047.0200220e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1052302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ruican10aSoymilk gelation: The determinant roles of incubation time and gelation rate  aThis study aimed to understand the soymilk gelation process concerning the fundamental elements that govern gel properties. The rheology, textural properties, water holding capacity, and microstructure of soymilk gels were compared as a matter of incubation time and gelling conditions. Rheological results showed that G′ increased as long as incubation prolonged. Temperature, coagulant concentration, polyacidic basic salts, and soybean cultivars all altered the gelation rate and consequently manipulated the gel properties. “Time-temperature/rate superposition” principle was applied to the soymilk gelation process itself, where the increment of G’ in terms of t/t₀ was independent from kinetic factors. Incubation time and gelation rate are the basic determinants of the gel properties and they played equivalent roles in reaching a certain degree of gelation. Increasing either of them resulted in gels with hardened gel texture but deteriorated network fineness, water holding capacity and deformation-resistance. This study provided a fundamental reference to the quality control of tofu and relevant gel products.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoagulants 3acultivars 3afineness 3agelation 3agels 3ahydrocolloids 3amicrostructure 3aquality control 3arheology 3asalts 3asoybeans 3asoymilk 3atemperature 3atexture 3atofu 3awater holding capacity 0aSoymilk gels 0aRate constant 0aTime-temperature superposition1 aKim, Sŏr-hwa,1 aSu, Shiwei1 aLu, Yeye1 aGuo, Shuntang0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Dec., v. 97 p.105230-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2019.1052303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245008600175300001400261520132500275592002801600650001901628650001501647650002001662650001801682650001501700650002501715650001001740650001501750650001001765650001501775650001701790650001301807651001201820651001001832653001401842653001201856653001001868653001301878700001601891700001701907700001301924773010601937856008502043852000902128655001202137IND60654816120221118235418.0190809e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSturgess-Osborne, C.10aMultiple resistance to macrocyclic lactones in the sheep scab mite Psoroptes ovis  ap. 79-82.  aThe astigmatid mite Psoroptes ovis (Acari: Proroptidae) causes the highly contagious and debilitating ovine disease, sheep scab. This ectoparasitic infection has a high economic and animal welfare impact on British sheep farming. Following recent work demonstrating resistance of Psoroptes mites to moxidectin, a widely used macrocyclic lactone (ML) treatment for scab, the current study compared the toxicity of three of the commonly administered macrocylic lactone therapeutic treatments (moxidectin, ivermectin and doramectin) to P. ovis from outbreak populations that had appeared unresponsive to treatment. These outbreak populations were from Wales and south west England. The data presented demonstrate that there is resistance to all three available ML compounds in populations of Psoroptes mites. However, considerable variation in response suggested that resistance alone was not responsible for the reported lack of efficacy in all of the submitted cases; lack of response in others may be associated with inappropriate treatment application or management. These data highlight the importance of the appropriate use of these compounds to manage national scab incidence at levels that are consistent with acceptable animal welfare standards, while attempting to reduce the development and spread of resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPsoroptes ovis 3adoramectin 3adrug resistance 3aectoparasites 3aivermectin 3alivestock production 3amites 3amoxidectin 3asheep 3asheep scab 3atherapeutics 3atoxicity 3aEngland 3aWales 0aAcariasis 0aDisease 0aMange 0aParasite1 aBurgess, S.1 aMitchell, S.1 aWall, R.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2019 Aug., v. 272 p.79-82dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11815x0304-40177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2019.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245006500158300001800223500001100241520090300252592002801155596009701183596007901280596007901359596008301438596008301521596007101604596007401675596007401749650002401823650001201847650001801859650001101877650001901888650001901907650002001926700002101946700001901967700001901986700002202005700001602027700005802043773015202101856007302253852000902326655001202335IND60752377320221121043254.0211002e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075237732DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.68102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Wen‐Ping10aConversion of levulinic acid to valuable chemicals: a review  ap. 3009-3024.  aREVIEW  aLevulinic acid (LA), a class of important chemical intermediates and new energy chemicals, has been considered one of the top‐12 platform compounds that can be converted from biomass resources. Substantial progress on the conversion of lignocellulose biomass to LA and the further conversion of LA to high value downstream chemicals have been achieved recently. This review summarizes the preparation and separation processes of LA firstly, and then, emphatically discusses the catalytic system for LA conversion to valuable downstream products, including levulinate esters, 2‐methyl tetrahydrofuran (MTHF), Gamma‐valerolactone (GVL), 5‐aminolevulinic acid (DALA), and diphenolic acid (DPA). An outlook is provided at the end of this paper to highlight the challenges and opportunities for the comprehensive utilization of lignocellulose biomass. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  aE 0290107cthe foundation of Key Laboratory of Renewable Energy, Chinese Academy of Sciences  a2019A1515011843cthe Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation  a2020A1515010516cthe Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation  a2018A030313150cthe Project of Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation  a2018A030310126cthe Project of Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation  aBE 2018342cthe Project of Jiangsu Province Science and Technology  a51876207cthe Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China  a52006229cthe Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aaminolevulinic acid 3abiomass 3abiotechnology 3aenergy 3alevulinic acid 3alignocellulose 3atetrahydrofuran1 aChen, Xue‐Fang1 aGuo, Hai‐Jun1 aLi, Hai‐Long1 aZhang, Hai‐Rong1 aXiong, Lian1 aChen, Xin‐De1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2602-87410 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Nov., v. 96, no. 11 p.3009-3024dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.68103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013700171300001800308520127900326592002801605650003301633650001501666650002001681650001001701650001301711650001401724650002301738650001901761650002201780650001501802650001101817650001601828700001901844773009801863856008601961852000902047655001202056IND60762301420221120061952.0220502e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.12.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoo, Emily Jane10aPostmarketing safety surveillance of high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine: Reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System  ap. 1026-1030.  aOn November 4, 2019, the Food and Drug Administration approved high-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluzone High-Dose Quadrivalent; QIV-HD) for active immunization for the prevention of influenza disease in individuals 65 years of age and older. A prelicensure randomized, active-controlled, modified double-blind trial did not reveal any major differences in adverse events following QIV-HD versus Fluzone High-Dose (trivalent). To improve our understanding of the safety profile of QIV-HD, we reviewed and summarized reports of adverse events after QIV-HD to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). From July 30, 2020 through June 30, 2021, VAERS received 2,122 reports after QIV-HD. The vast majority (2,018; 95.1%) were non-serious and included events that had been observed in the prelicensure clinical trial, such as injection site reactions, fever, headache, and nausea.

To recover TFP from its aqueous solution, conventional distillation cannot be adopted because TFP and water can form a minimum azeotrope. RESULTS: In this work, extractive distillation is applied to separate the azeotropic mixture of TFP and water using 1‐ethyl‐3‐methylimidazolium acetate ([EMIM][Ac]) as an entrainer. Based on the analysis of residual curve map, three processes are designed to separate the mixture. Extractive distillation processes (EDP) I and II consist of an extractive column and two flashes, and EDP III consists of an extractive column, a flash, and a stripper. For evaluating the three processes, total annual cost (TAC), CO₂ emissions and global energy consumption (GEC) are considered into the objective function. CONCLUSION: The simulated results show that EDP III with an extractive column, a flash, and a stripper can provide better economic and environmental benefits. Water can be obtained from the extractive column with a molar purity of 99.7%. TFP can be separated from the top of the flash and stripper with a molar purity of 99.7%. Furthermore, the control structure with two‐point temperature for EDP III is explored and it shows good responses for the disturbances of feed flow rate and composition.  aPublisher supplied data  a21978155cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aQUSTHX202007cOpen Project of Qingdao University of Science and Technology Chemistry Department 3aacetates 3aaqueous solutions 3abiotechnology 3acarbon dioxide 3adistillation 3aenergy 3aindustry 3aionic liquids 3aprocess design 3atemperature1 aDiao, Baotao1 aGao, Jun1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1145-95651 aXu, Dongmei1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0193-75431 aZhang, Lianzheng1 aMa, Yixin1 aWang, Yinglong0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Nov., v. 96, no. 11 p.3175-3184dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.68723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245007000206300001900276500001500295506007600310520199100386592002802377506003702405650001502442650001702457650002702474650001802501650002202519650001602541650002502557650001102582650001202593650002502605650001302630650002202643650002502665650001402690650001602704653001802720700002302738700002002761700001702781700001802798700001802816700001802834700001802852773012002870856007702990961001303067852000903080655001203089IND60514983420221207134454.0160310e20130801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498342DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2013.00322doi7 aPMC37462392pmcid7 a239449282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Sheryl O.10aFood Parenting Measurement Issues: Working Group Consensus Report  ap.

As more researchers become involved in the study of parenting influences on childhood obesity, there appears to be a lack of agreement regarding the most important parenting constructs of interest, definitions of those constructs, and measurement of those constructs in a consistent manner across studies. This article aims to summarize findings from a working group that convened specifically to discuss measurement issues related to parental influences on childhood obesity. Six subgroups were formed to address key measurement issues. The conceptualization subgroup proposed to define and distinguish constructs of general parenting styles, feeding styles, and food parenting practices with the goal of understanding interrelating levels of parental influence on child eating behaviors. The observational subgroup identified the need to map constructs for use in coding direct observations and create observational measures that can capture the bidirectional effects of parent–child interactions. The self-regulation subgroup proposed an operational definition of child self-regulation of energy intake and suggested future measures of self-regulation across different stages of development. The translational/community involvement subgroup proposed the involvement of community in the development of surveys so that measures adequately reflect cultural understanding and practices of the community. The qualitative methods subgroup proposed qualitative methods as a way to better understand the breadth of food parenting practices and motivations for the use of such practices. The longitudinal subgroup stressed the importance of food parenting measures sensitive to change for use in longitudinal studies. In the creation of new measures, it is important to consider cultural sensitivity and context-specific food parenting domains. Moderating variables such as child temperament and child food preferences should be considered in models.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amotivation 3afood choices 3atranslation (genetics) 3aenergy intake 3acommunity service 3atemperament 3adevelopmental stages 3amodels 3asurveys 3alongitudinal studies 3achildren 3achildhood obesity 3aqualitative analysis 3aparenting 3aresearchers 0aeating habits1 aFrankel, Leslie A.1 aBeltran, Alicia1 aHodges, Eric1 aHoerr, Sharon1 aLumeng, Julie1 aTovar, Alison1 aKremers, Stef0 tChildhood obesity.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 9, no. s1 p.S-95-S-102dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2013.00323Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle04243naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011000171300001800281506010400299506007600403520209100479592002802570506003702598650001702635650003002652650002502682650002602707650002202733650002202755650001502777650001702792650001402809650001102823650002102834650001402855650002002869650001802889650001302907650000902920650001102929650000902940650002002949650001602969650001302985653001502998653001203013653001803025653001703043653001503060653002003075653000903095653000903104653001003113653000803123653000803131653000903139653001003148653000803158700001903166700002603185700002903211700002203240700002103262700002103283773009803304856008603402852000903488655001203497IND60762301720221207111250.0220502e20220211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalter, Kyle B.10aVariability in non-core vaccination rates of dogs and cats in veterinary clinics across the United States  ap. 1001-1009.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aVaccination guidelines for dogs and cats indicate that core vaccines (for dogs, rabies, distemper, adenovirus, parvovirus; for cats, feline parvovirus, herpes virus-1, calicivirus) are essential to maintain health, and that non-core vaccines be administered according to a clinician’s assessment of a pet’s risk of exposure and susceptibility to infection. A reliance on individual risk assessment introduces the potential for between-practice inconsistencies in non-core vaccine recommendations. A study was initiated to determine non-core vaccination rates of dogs (Leptospira, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bordetella bronchiseptica, canine influenza virus) and cats (feline leukemia virus) in patients current for core vaccines in veterinary practices across the United States. Transactional data for 5,531,866 dogs (1,670 practices) and 1,914,373 cats (1,661 practices) were retrieved from practice management systems for the period November 1, 2016 through January 1, 2020, deidentified and normalized. Non-core vaccination status was evaluated in 2,798,875 dogs and 788,772 cats that were core-vaccine current. Nationally, median clinic vaccination rates for dogs were highest for leptospirosis (70.5%) and B. bronchiseptica (68.7%), and much lower for canine influenza (4.8%). In Lyme-endemic states, the median clinic borreliosis vaccination rate was 51.8%. Feline leukemia median clinic vaccination rates were low for adult cats (34.6%) and for kittens and 1-year old cats (36.8%). Individual clinic vaccination rates ranged from 0 to 100% for leptospirosis, B. bronchiseptica and feline leukemia, 0–96% for canine influenza, and 0–94% for borreliosis. Wide variation in non-core vaccination rates between clinics in similar geographies indicates that factors other than disease risk are driving the use of non-core vaccines in pet dogs and cats, highlighting a need for veterinary practices to address gaps in patient protection. Failure to implement effective non-core vaccination strategies leaves susceptible dogs and cats unprotected against vaccine-preventable diseases.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAdenoviridae 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aFeline leukemia virus 3aFeline parvovirus 3aInfluenza A virus 3aLeptospira 3aLyme disease 3aVesivirus 3aadults 3acanine influenza 3adistemper 3afeline leukemia 3aleptospirosis 3apatients 3apets 3arabies 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3avaccination 3avaccines 0aVeterinary 0aVaccine 0aLeptospirosis 0aLyme disease 0aBordetella 0aFeline leukemia 0aAAHA 0aAAFP 0aACVIM 0aCIV 0aDAP 0aFeLV 0aFVRCP 0aIQR1 aTugel, Mara E.1 aGil Rodriguez, Maria,1 aGuardia, Guillermo de la1 aJackson, Sally W.1 aRyan, William G.1 aMoore, George E.0 tVaccine.g2022 Feb. 11, v. 40, no. 7 p.1001-1009dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005700151245008600208520142500294592002801719650002001747650001401767650001801781650001101799650001501810650000901825650001901834650001401853650001301867650002501880650002601905650001301931650001501944650001401959650001901973651001101992653002302003653002502026653002202051653001802073653001502091700002702106700003702133700003502170773010902205856008602314852000902400655001202409IND60654817420221118234942.0200103e20191117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1087222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTerao, Daniel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0834-383910aOzonated water combined with heat treatment to control the stem-end rot of papaya  aStem-end rot is the major postharvest disease of papaya in Brazil, causing significant losses, specially, during long-term transportation and storage. The infection occurs mainly during the flowering period and remains quiescent, without showing any symptom, until the fruit ripening stage begins. The current method of control, using fungicides, has not been effective, besides contaminating the fruit. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the combined treatment using hot water followed by ozonated water to control the disease. The results showed that, as stand-alone treatment, heat and ozone treatment significantly reduced the stem-end rot, controlling around 50% of the severity, and delaying the onset of the symptoms in 3 and 4 days, respectively. A synergistic effect was observed when the treatments were applied combined. The efficacy of the control increased to over 90% and the symptoms onset delayed 7 days. Moreover, the combined treatment delayed the maturation process, increased the PPO activity, and preserved the overall fruit quality, thus extending the shelf life. The integrated approach, combining heat treatment by immersion of peduncle of papaya in hot water at 70 °C followed by immersion in ozonated water (3 mg L⁻¹), controlled efficiently the stem-end rot, therefore being a safe and sustainable alternative for the use of chemicals in postharvest treatment of papaya.  aPublisher supplied data 3adisease control 3aflowering 3afruit quality 3afruits 3afungicides 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3aozonation 3apeduncle 3apostharvest diseases 3apostharvest treatment 3aripening 3ashelf life 3asynergism 3atransportation 3aBrazil 0aPhysical treatment 0aResistance induction 0aPostharvest decay 0aFruit quality 0aShelf-life1 ade Lima Nechet, Kátia1 aShiraishi Frighetto, Rosa Toyoko1 aCerqueira Sasaki, Fabiana Fumi0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Nov. 17, v. 257 p.108722-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1087223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03104naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245011400174300001600288520157600304592002801880650002401908650002201932650001601954650002501970650001801995650002102013650000902034650001102043650001702054650002002071650001202091650001302103650001102116650001502127650001602142650001202158653001502170653001602185653002202201653002302223700002002246700002102266700001802287700002202305700002302327700002202350773010602372856008702478852000902565655001202574IND60654817620221118235407.0190830e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKühnhold, Holger10aAcclimation capability inferred by metabolic performance in two sea cucumber species from different latitudes  ap. 407-413.  aThe notion that thermal specialists from tropical regions live closer to their temperature limits than temperate eurytherms, seems too generalized. Species specific differences in physiological and biochemical stress reactions are linked to key components of organism fitness, like metabolic capacity, which indicates that acclimation potential across latitudes might be highly diverse rather than simplistic. In this study the exposure of a tropical (Holothuria scabra) and a temperate (Holothuria forskali) sea cucumber species to identical cold- and warm-acclimation stress was compared using the key metabolic parameters, respiration rate, enzyme activity (ETS, LDH, IDH), and energy reserve fractions (lipid, carbohydrate and protein). Results show much broader respiratory adjustments, as response to temperature change, in H. scabra (2–30 μgO2*gww−1*h−1) compared to H. forskali (1.5–6.6 μgO2*gww−1*h−1). Moreover, the tropical species showed clearly pronounced up and down regulation of metabolic enzymes and shifts in energy reserves, due to thermal acclimation, while the same metabolic indicators remained consistent in the temperate species. In summary, these findings indicate enhanced metabolic plasticity in H. scabra at the cost of elevated energy expenditures, which seems to favor the tropical stenotherm in terms of thermal acclimation capacity. The comparison of such holistic metabolic analyses between conspecifics and congeners, may help to predict the heterogeneous effects of global temperature changes across latitudinal gradients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolothuria forskali 3aHolothuria scabra 3aacclimation 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbohydrates 3acell respiration 3acold 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3alatitude 3alipids 3ametabolism 3atemperature 3atropics 0aEurytherms 0aStenotherms 0aEnergy metabolism 0aTemperature stress1 aNovais, Sara C.1 aAlves, Luis M.F.1 aKamyab, Elham1 aLemos, Marco F.L.1 aSlater, Matthew J.1 aKunzmann, Andreas0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2019 Aug., v. 84 p.407-413dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2019.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02635naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006800139245011100207300001800318500001100336520126800347592002801615596003001643650002601673650001801699650002101717650001501738650002501753650000901778650001801787650000901805650001201814700003201826700007101858700002101929700002001950700002101970773015201991856007302143852000902216655001202225IND60752378720221121043317.0211002e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075237872DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.68242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro‐Muñoz, Roberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7657-330210aRecovery of protein‐based compounds from meat by‐products by membrane‐assisted separations: a review  ap. 3025-3042.  aREVIEW  aMeat by‐products and co‐products, including poultry and fish wastes, represent a current challenge for the food processing industry due to their harmful impact on the environment. Membrane technologies, thanks to their intrinsic properties, represent an emerging tool for the valorization of these streams according to the principles of a sustainable circular economy. A review of significant applications of membrane‐based technologies, including pressure‐driven membrane processes and electro‐membrane processes, for the recovery of protein‐based compounds from meat by‐products is presented along with their trends and future potentials in the production of functional ingredients. Classic and recent development works are analyzed and critically discussed according to the relevant results in the field. Literature data clearly indicate that membrane technologies represent an efficient and environmentally friendly option for the separation, fractionation, and purification of bioactive compounds from different meat co‐products. The implementation of such processes as a way of recovering biomolecules also gives environmental benefits by reducing the organic load of both by‐ and co‐products. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).  aPublisher supplied data  cTecnológico de Monterrey 3abiochemical compounds 3abiotechnology 3acircular economy 3acoproducts 3aenvironmental impact 3afish 3afractionation 3ameat 3apoultry1 aGarcía‐Depraect, Octavio1 aLeón‐Becerril, Elizabeth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7220-52541 aCassano, Alfredo1 aConidi, Carmela1 aFíla, Vlastimil0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2021 Nov., v. 96, no. 11 p.3025-3042dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.68243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245010400171520137300275592002801648650001701676650002001693650001001713650001601723650002401739650002601763650001301789651001001802653002901812653001801841653002701859653003001886653001601916700001501932700001801947700001601965700001301981700001801994773009602012856008902108852000902197655001202206IND60762302020221120220657.0220307e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1059772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Yueming10aExperience and lessons from the implementing of the latest Land Certificated Program in rural China  aThe Chinese central government is determined to finish the latest national Land Certificated Program (LCP) in 2018, but the implementation of LCP lagged far behind the national target in some rural areas. The overall goal of this study is to summarize the experience and lessons of implementing the latest LCP by analyzing its status and determinants. The mixed methods are adopted based on a panel dataset with a nationally representative sample of 100 rural villages in five provinces and two cases. The results show that only 56% of villages have finished the latest LCP due to the planed deadline, and there are temporal and regional disparities in the process of LCP among the sample provinces. The case study and quantitative analysis indicate that the experience of village leader, off-farm employment, and land acquisition have significant effects on the accomplishing of the latest LCP. However, geographical features have no effect because of the adoption of GIS technology in measuring plots. These findings imply that the local management organization, such as village committee, should seek help from former village cadres or stimulate villagers to promote the implementation of LCP. Advanced technology could alleviate the heavy workload of LCP. The communities with lots of off-farm employment labor should be paid more attention when promoting the LCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adata collection 3alabor 3aland policy 3aoff-farm employment 3aquantitative analysis 3avillages 3aChina 0aFarmland property rights 0aMixed methods 0aVillage characteristic 0aLand Certificated Program 0aSmith model1 aBai, Yunli1 aSun, Mingxing1 aXu, Xiangbo1 aFu, Chao1 aZhang, Linxiu0 tLand use policy.g2022 Mar., v. 114 p.105977-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2022.1059773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245012600153300001600279500002000295520151000315592002801825596005701853650001701910650001101927650002701938650002701965650001301992650001102005700002202016700002002038700001702058700001902075700002102094700006002115700002102175700002202196700002002218700001402238700001602252700006202268773010602330856007202436852000902508655001202517IND60752379220221121060300.0211002e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075237922DNAL7 a10.1002/yea.36552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Pengli10aFatty acid composition of the methylotrophic yeast Komagataella phaffii grown under low‐ and high‐methanol conditions  ap. 541-548.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, we analysed the intracellular fatty acid profiles of Komagataella phaffii during methylotrophic growth. K. phaffii grown on methanol had significantly lower total fatty acid contents in the cells compared with glucose‐grown cells. C18 and C16 fatty acids were the predominant fatty acids in K. phaffii, although the contents of odd‐chain fatty acids such as C17 fatty acids were also relatively high. Moreover, the intracellular fatty acid composition of K. phaffii changed in response to not only carbon sources but also methanol concentrations: C17 fatty acids and C18:2 content increased significantly as methanol concentration increased, whereas C18:1 and C18:3 contents were significantly lower in methanol‐grown cells. The intracellular content of unidentified compounds (CₙH₂ₙO₄), on the other hand, was significantly greater in cells grown on methanol. As the intracellular contents of these CₙH₂ₙO₄ compounds were significantly higher in a gene‐disrupted strain for glutathione peroxidase (gpx1Δ) than in the wild‐type strain, we presume that the CₙH₂ₙO₄ compounds are fatty acid peroxides. These results indicate that K. phaffii can coordinate intracellular fatty acid composition during methylotrophic growth in order to adapt to high‐methanol conditions and that certain fatty acid species such as C17:0, C17:1, C17:2 and C18:2 may be related to the physiological functions by which K. phaffii adapts to high‐methanol conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  a18K19875cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science 3aKomagataella 3acarbon 3afatty acid composition 3aglutathione peroxidase 3amethanol 3ayeasts1 aTakashima, Shigeo1 aFujita, Chikako1 aYamada, Saya1 aOshima, Yusuke1 aCai, Hao‐Liang1 aYurimoto, Hiroya1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7506-61841 aSakai, Yasuyoshi1 aHayakawa, Takashi1 aShimada, Masaya1 aNing, Xia1 aWei, Baoyao1 aNakagawa, Tomoyuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0112-03490 tYeast.g2021 Oct., v. 38, no. 10 p.541-548dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39201x0749-503X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/yea.36553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02607naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245013400179500002200313520109800335592002801433650001601461650002501477650001001502650001301512650001901525650002601544650000701570650003301577650002001610650001101630650001901641653001101660653001501671653002001686653001701706653002701723700001901750700003001769700003101799700002201830700001801852700006501870773009401935856008702029852000902116655001202125IND60654818220221118235122.0190726e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1252562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez-Narváez, Faver10aOccurrence of acrylamide and other heat-induced compounds in panela: Relationship with physicochemical and antioxidant parameters  aPre-press version  aPanela is a natural, unrefined non-centrifugal sugar obtained by intense dehydration of sugarcane juice. Acrylamide, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furfural were determined in 40 panela samples distributed as granulated and block according to the technological process. Colour, browning, moisture, water activity, pH and antioxidant capacity were also evaluated. Acrylamide ranged between 60-3058µg/kg; granulated panela reporting the highest concentration (812 µg/kg) compared with block panela (540 µg/kg). The lower content in HMF and furfural, the intense dehydration, and the extensive darkening of granulated panela suggested the browning reactions were boosted due to the application of more severe thermal treatments. Principal component analysis showed a significant relationship between the panela presentation and the concentration of the analysed compounds. Benchmark values considering both types of processes would help to establish mitigation initiatives in panela products. The chromatic parameter a* could be used as an indirect index of the acrylamide content in panela.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aantioxidant activity 3acolor 3afurfural 3aheat treatment 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3apH 3aprincipal component analysis 3asugarcane juice 3asugars 3awater activity 0aPanela 0aAcrylamide 0aFuran compounds 0aAntioxidants 0aNon-enzymatic browning1 aMesías, Marta1 aDelgado-Andrade, Cristina1 aContreras-Calderón, José1 aUbillús, Fabiola1 aCruz, Gastón1 aMorales, Francisco J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3984-70090 tFood chemistry.g2019 July 24,  p.125256-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1252563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02146naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245005400171520099900225592002801224650001101252650001701263650004401280650001501324650001401339650002501353650001401378653002401392653001901416653001001435653002801445700002201473700002101495700006001516773010001576856008701676852000901763655001201772IND60654818320221118235157.0190807e20191215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065481832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1252572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGougeon, Louis10a1H NMR metabolomics applied to Bordeaux red wines  aThe q-NMR metabolomics has already demonstrated its potential for classifying wines of different geographical origins, grape varieties, or vintages. This study focuses on the characterisation of Bordeaux red wines, seeking to discriminate them from others produced in the major French wine regions. A sampling of 224 commercial French wines was analysed by 1H NMR and forty compounds were quantified. Non-supervised and supervised statistical analyses revealed a singular imprint of Bordeaux wines in comparison with other French wines, with classification rates ranging from 71% to 100%. Within the Bordeaux vineyards, red wines from the different Bordeaux subdivisions were analysed from different vintages. Our results indicate that q-NMR metabolomics enables the differentiation of Médoc and Libournais vineyard highlighting the most discriminant constituents. In addition, the effects of wine evolution during bottle aging and vintage on Bordeaux red wines were pointed out and discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrapes 3ametabolomics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aprovenance 3ared wines 3astatistical analysis 3avineyards 0aWine classification 0aBordeaux wines 0aq-NMR 0aMultivariate statistics1 ada Costa, Gregory1 aGuyon, François1 aRichard, Tristan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8739-20210 tFood chemistry.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 301 p.125257-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.1252573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02908naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245011200165300001600277520139100293592002801684650001801712650002601730650001901756650002701775650001501802650002601817650001301843650001201856650002401868650001801892650001901910650001001929650000901939650000901948650001701957650001301974650002301987650001002010651001202020700002002032700002602052700002902078700001902107700002002126700002402146773013402170856007702304852000902381655001202390IND60514984720221121071422.0160310e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498472DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2015.20572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiolacu, Luminita10aTracking Foodborne Pathogenic Bacteria in Raw and Ready-to-Eat Food Illegally Sold at the Eastern EU Border  ap. 148-155.  aFood illegally brought into the European Union, mainly in the personal luggage of travelers, represents a potential threat to consumers' health. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of five pathogens in food brought into the European Union by Moldavian citizens as personal goods and illegally sold in Romania in the vicinity of the border. The occurrence of Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes was 7.5% and 8%, while Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, and Salmonella spp. were absent in all samples. L. monocytogenes sequence type 2, 9, 121, and 155, highly prevalent among foodstuffs worldwide, was also present among isolates from ready-to-eat food illegally sold in Romania, even at the same date of sampling, indicating cross-contamination during food handling. S. aureus spa types t449, t304, and t524 were most often isolated from raw-milk cheeses contaminated with 10³–10⁵ colony-forming units per gram, evidencing a contamination at herd level or unhygienic conditions during processing. S. aureus t011 and t3625, both included in the livestock-associated CC398, were isolated from pork lard and poultry meat. This study shows that cross-border trade from nonmember states represents a neglected route of transmission of foodborne pathogens into the European Union that could lead to sporadic or family-associated cases of disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCampylobacter 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aEuropean Union 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aSalmonella 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3abacteria 3acheeses 3across contamination 3afood handling 3afood pathogens 3aherds 3alard 3apork 3apoultry meat 3araw milk 3aready-to-eat foods 3atrade 3aRomania1 aStessl, Beatrix1 aBolocan, Andrei Sorin1 aOniciuc, Elena Alexandra1 aWagner, Martin1 aRychli, Kathrin1 aNicolau, Anca Ioana0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 13, no. 3 p.148-155dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2015.20573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001800143245013500161300001600296520166200312592002801974650002402002650002202026650001302048650001002061650001902071650001102090650001102101650003002112650003702142650002502179650001602204700002202220700001702242700001502259773013402274856007702408852000902485655001202494IND60514984920221121071424.0160310e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498492DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2013.16612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDouidah, Laid10aTowards a Typing Strategy for Arcobacter Species Isolated from Humans and Animals and Assessment of the In Vitro Genomic Stability  ap. 272-280.  aArcobacter species have a widespread distribution with a broad range of animal hosts and environmental reservoirs, and are increasingly associated with human illness. To elucidate the routes of infection, several characterization methods such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment-length polymorphism, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC)-PCR have already been applied, but without proper validation or comparison. At present, no criterion standard typing method or strategy has been proposed. Therefore, after the validation of PFGE, those commonly applied typing methods were compared for the characterization of six human- and animal-associated Arcobacter species. With a limited number of isolates to be characterized, PFGE with restriction by KpnI is proposed as the first method of choice. However, ERIC-PCR represents a more convenient genomic fingerprinting technique when a large number of isolates is involved. Therefore, a first clustering of similar patterns obtained after ERIC-PCR, with a subsequent typing of some representatives per ERIC cluster by PFGE, is recommended. As multiple genotypes are commonly isolated from the same host and food, genomic plasticity has been suggested. The in vitro genomic stability of Arcobacter butzleri and A. cryaerophilus was assessed under two temperatures and two oxygen concentrations. Variability in the genomic profile of A. cryaerophilus was observed after different passages for different strains at 37°C under microaerobic conditions. The bias due to these genomic changes must be taken into account in the evaluation of the relationship of strains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArcobacter butzleri 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahosts 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3aoxygen 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arepetitive sequences 3atemperature1 aDe Zutter, Lieven1 aBaré, Julie1 aHouf, Kurt0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 11, no. 4 p.272-280dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2013.16613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245007400205300001600279506007600295520038600371592002800757506003700785650002600822650002800848650001200876650002200888650001900910650000900929650001100938700002100949773011400970856007901084852000901163655001201172IND60514985620221207130823.0160310e20150301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498562DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2014.18422doi7 aPMC43675192pmcid7 a255994212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLund, Barbara M.12aA Possible Route for Foodborne Transmission of Clostridium difficile?  ap. 177-182.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpores of toxigenic Clostridium difficile and spores of food-poisoning strains of Clostridium perfringens show a similar prevalence in meats.

However, their combined effect on crop WUE and CO2 emissions is not clear. Here, our objective was to document the combined effects of NT and pre-summer maize sowing irrigation on utilization of water applied and carbon emission activity during crop production. Field experiments were carried out in the North China Plain (NCP) in 2016 and 2017 to test NT and conventional tillage (CT) (only performed during the winter wheat planting season), and three irrigation treatments (termed pre-summer maize sowing irrigation, 30, 70, and 110 mm) during the summer maize growing seasons. The results showed that, compared with CT, NT significantly reduced carbon cumulative emissions (CO2-C) and water consumption, and it increased grain yield by 11.3% and 7.4% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. No significant difference was found for WUE between the 70-mm and 110-mm pre-sowing irrigation treatments, but it was significantly higher in either case than WUE under the 30-mm pre-sowing irrigation treatment. Further, WUE and carbon emission efficiency (CEE) were highest under the 70- and the 110-mm irrigation treatment in both years, whereas carbon emissions per unit water consumption (WUECE) were the lowest under the 70-mm irrigation treatment. These results indicated that a combination of NT with 70-mm pre-sowing irrigation can improve the regulation of soil carbon emissions and water consumption by summer maize in the NCP.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3aconventional tillage 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3airrigation 3ano-tillage 3aplanting season 3asoil carbon 3asowing 3awater use efficiency 3awinter wheat 3aChina 0aEvapotranspiration 0aCarbon emission 0aPre-sowing irrigation 0aStraw mulching1 aWang, Xuejie1 aWang, Shaobo1 aTan, Dechong1 aHan, Huifang1 aNing, Tangyuan1 aLi, Quanqi0 tAgricultural water management.g2019 Aug. 20, v. 223 p.105729-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl8460x0378-37747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2019.1057293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02951naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245012700164520164000291592002801931650001701959650001401976650001901990650001902009650002402028650001002052650002602062650001902088650001402107653001602121653002402137653002902161653002402190700001802214700001902232700001602251700001602267700001602283700001402299773011002313856008502423852000902508655001202517IND60762304120221122045026.0220509e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1187872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDing, Qin10aMultiple pathways for the anaerobic biodegradation of microcystin-LR in the enriched microbial communities from Lake Taihu  aAnaerobic biodegradation is a non-negligible elimination approach for microcystin (MC) pollution and exhibits important bioremediation potential for environmental problems. However, the specific anaerobic MC-degrading mechanism remains unclear and few functional bacteria have been found. In this study, three microbial communities of sludges from different locations in Lake Taihu were collected and further enriched by microcystin-LR (MC-LR) under anaerobic conditions. MC-LR (1 mg/L) could be completely degraded by these enriched microbial communities under anaerobic conditions, but their degradation rates were significantly different. In addition, two different ring-opening sites of MC-LR in Ala-Leu and Arg-Adda were observed, and three new anaerobic degradation products were first identified, including two hexapeptides (MeAsp-Arg-Adda-Glu-Mdha-Ala and Adda-Glu-Mdha-Ala-Leu-MeAsp) and one end-product pentapeptide (Glu-Mdha-Ala-Leu-MeAsp). Based on the chemical structures and temporal trends of all detected degradation products, two novel anaerobic biodegradation pathways of MC-LR were proposed. Moreover, the MC-degrading genes mlrABC were not detected among all microbial communities, which suggested that some new MC-degrading mechanisms might exist under anaerobic conditions. Finally, through the comparison of microbial community structure, Gemmatimonas and Smithella were deduced as possible anaerobic MC-degrading bacteria. These findings strongly indicate that anaerobic biodegradation is an important method of self-repair in the natural environment and provides a potential removal strategy for MC pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGemmatimonas 3aSmithella 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acommunity structure 3alakes 3amicrobial communities 3amicrocystin-LR 3apollution 0aMicrocystin 0aMicrobial community 0aAnaerobic biodegradation 0aDegradation pathway1 aSong, Xiaolei1 aYuan, Mengxuan1 aSun, Rongli1 aZhang, Juan1 aYin, Lihong1 aPu, Yuepu0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 297 p.118787-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1187873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02664naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011000165520135700275592002801632650001201660650001201672650001201684650001901696650003101715650001101746650000701757650001801764650001501782650001501797650001401812650001101826650000901837650000901846653002401855653001201879653001701891653002801908653001001936700001501946700001501961700001401976773011001990856008502100852000902185655001202194IND60762304220221122024014.0220509e20220315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076230422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1187882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuelei10aEffects of biochar on transport and retention of phosphorus in porous media: Laboratory test and modeling  aGiven the complexity of soil components, a detailed understanding of the effects of single factors on phosphorus transport and retention will play a key role in understanding the environmental effects of phosphorus. In this work, quartz sand columns (considering five factors: doping rate, pH, particle size, ionic strength and cation type), combined with a two-site nonequilibrium transport model (TSM), were used to investigate phosphate (P) transport behavior. The results show that changes in doping ratio (0.4%–1.6%) and pH (5–9) have a notable effect on the transport of P, while, particle size of quartz sand hardly impacts the transport. When biochar was added at 1.6%, the surface of biochar increased the P fixation rate by about 37% through direct interaction with phosphate and bridging action with metal ions. As the morphology of P changed under different pH conditions, a part of P was immobilized in the form of precipitation. The immobilization of P was further enhanced with the increase of ionic strength. Compared with the direct interaction of P with biochar in Na⁺ solution, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ solutions are more likely to adsorb P. Meanwhile, the TSM model also fits the transport behavior well. This study provides a perspective for evaluating the environmental behavior of P in the porous media interaction with biochar.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acalcium 3acations 3aionic strength 3alaboratory experimentation 3amodels 3apH 3aparticle size 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollution 3aquartz 3asand 3asoil 0aPhosphate transport 0aBiochar 0aPorous media 0aPhysicochemical factors 0aModel1 aZhao, Ying1 aCheng, Kui1 aYang, Fan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Mar. 15, v. 297 p.118788-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1187883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03042naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245012900163300001600292520154500308592002801853650001301881650002601894650001301920650000901933650003701942650002801979650001002007650002602017650001402043650001902057650001402076650001402090650001302104650001402117650001802131650004702149650001502196651001302211651001102224700002102235700002302256700002302279700002602302773013402328856007702462852000902539655001202548IND60514986420221121162539.0160310e20160301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051498642DNAL7 a10.1089/fpd.2015.20492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPieri, Fabio A.10aPhenotypic and Molecular Aspects of Staphylococcus spp. Isolated from Hospitalized Patients and Beef in the Brazilian Amazon  ap. 128-134.  aThe aim of this study was to characterize and compare Staphylococcus spp. isolated from hospitalized patients and beef marketed in the city of Porto Velho-RO, Brazil. The isolates were subjected to antibiogram tests, adherence capacity tests, detection of the mecA gene, and epidemiological investigation by the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, using the primers M13 and H12. Among the 123 Staphylococcus spp. isolates, 50 were identified as S. aureus and 73 as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus; among the latter, 7 species were identified. It was observed that the coagulase-negative Staphylococcus isolates showed greater adhesion ability than S. aureus. The profile of antimicrobial susceptibility was different among isolates, all of which were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid, and had high penicillin resistance rates, varying according to the bacterial class and the source. In this study, all strains were negative for mecA gene detection; however, 36% of S. aureus and 17% of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were resistant to oxacillin. The genetic relationship of these bacteria, analyzed by RAPD, was able to discriminate the species of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus strains of S. aureus along its origin. It was concluded that the isolates of Staphylococcus spp. derived from beef and human infections differ genetically. Thus, it is suggested that isolates from beef, which were grouped within hospital isolates, were probably carried via contact with beef in hospital professionals or patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abeef 3acoagulase negative staphylococci 3aepidemiological studies 3agenes 3agenetic relationships 3ahospitals 3ahuman diseases 3alinezolid 3aoxacillin 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprofessionals 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3avancomycin 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aVargas, Taise F.1 aGalvão, Newton N.1 aNogueira, Paulo A.1 aOrlandi, Patrícia P.0 tFoodborne pathogens & disease.g2016 Mar. 01, v. 13, no. 3 p.128-134dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl3973649x1556-71257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2015.20493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03235naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015200171520163600323592002801959650001701987650001602004650001302020650001302033650001902046650001902065650001102084650001702095650001602112650002402128650001202152650001302164650002002177650001302197650003002210650001402240650001502254650001802269650001302287653001902300653001702319653003702336653001702373653003002390700001702420700002002437700002902457773012502486856008502611852000902696655001202705IND60762287520221120213432.0220228e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076228752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJha, Sunil Kumar10aEnterobacter sp. SWLC2 for biodegradation of chlorpyrifos in the aqueous medium: Modeling of the process using artificial neural network approaches  aChlorpyrifos is a widely used organochlorine pesticide. The unsystematic use of pesticides for the restrain of soil-borne pests and bacterium causes pollution of ecosystems and harming the health of animals and humans. Moreover, due to high persistence, mobility, and higher toxicity in soil environments, it causes severe destruction of species. Therefore the investigation of the degradation process of chlorpyrifos polluted locations to diminish its lethal effect is important. With this objective, the present study reports the efficiency of new isolated bacterial strain SWLC2 for chlorpyrifos degradation in an aqueous medium and the biotic/abiotic factors influencing the process and their optimization using statistical Taguchi design and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches. Results revealed a higher efficiency of bacterium SWLC2 for chlorpyrifos degradation at optimal environmental and general conditions (800 μL inoculum, glucose (97%), arginine (89%), and succinic acid (83%)). External supplements (carbon and nitrogen sources) had stimulating effects on chlorpyrifos biodegradation depending on the concentration of supplemented substrate. Chlorpyrifos biodegradation by SWLC2 also varied as the initial concentration of the tested compound changes, following first-order kinetics. The finding provides a basic understanding of the application of the bacteria strain SWLC2 in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with chlorpyrifos pesticide. ANN approaches have achieved an average R² equal to 0.98–0.99 in the prediction of chlorpyrifos degradation considering the affecting biotic/abiotic factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEnterobacter 3aagriculture 3aarginine 3abacteria 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3acarbon 3achlorpyrifos 3aelectronics 3aexperimental design 3aglucose 3ainoculum 3aneural networks 3anitrogen 3aorganochlorine pesticides 3apollution 3aprediction 3asuccinic acid 3atoxicity 0aBiodegradation 0aChlorpyrifos 0aAqueous medium, Enterobacter sp. 0aOptimization 0aArtificial neural network1 aChishti, Zia1 aAhmad, Zulfiqar1 aArshad, Khaliq-ur-Rehman0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Feb., v. 193 p.106680-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2021.1066803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006800148245014200216300001800358520176200376592002802138596002502166650002302191650002102214650002502235650002602260650002502286650002202311650002702333650001502360650002602375650002402401650002302425650001102448650001402459650002902473650001502502650001302517650002102530650001702551650001802568650001002586650001402596651001102610700003502621700003402656700002902690700007502719700006702794700006402861700002202925700007202947700004203019700003003061700003903091700002803130773011203158856008203270852000903352655001203361IND60752364120221123041658.0211002e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075236412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00284-021-02650-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoura, Fernanda Morcatti1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2243-312510aVirulence Genes Profile and Antimicrobial Susceptibility of Community-Acquired Bacterial Urinary Tract Infections in a Brazilian Hospital  ap. 3913-3923.  aUrinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common diseases worldwide and Escherichia coli is the most common causative bacteria. Empirical treatment is challenging due to antimicrobial or multidrug-resistance. The aims of this study were to determine the uropathogens and their antimicrobial susceptibility profile, as well as to identify the phylogroups and virulence genes of E. coli strains, associated with community-acquired UTI in outpatients admitted at a Brazilian Hospital in southeast Brazil. In total, 47 bacterial strains were isolated from 47 patients, 44 women and 2 men (no gender record from one patient). The age of the patients whose urine culture were positive varied from 0 (less than one month) to 104 years. Most of the isolates were E. coli (41/47), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (2/47), Klebsiella variicola/Klebsiella aerogenes (1/47), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1/47), Proteus mirabilis (1/47), and Citrobacter koseri (1/47). Most E. coli strains were classified as phylogroup B2 (15/41 = 36.59%) and B1 (12/41 = 29.27%) and the most common virulence genes among E. coli strains were fimH (31/41 = 75.61%), iutA (21/41 = 51.22%), and tratT (16/41 = 39.02%). Among the E. coli strains, 59% were multidrug-resistance and strains that were ampicillin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, or tetracycline-resistant exhibited more chance to be multidrug-resistance, with an odds ratio of 100.00 [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.44–1059.26], 22.50 (95% CI 3.95–128.30), and 12.83 (95% CI 2.68–61.45), respectively. Our results showed that E. coli was the main etiological agent identified and demonstrated high frequency of multidrug-resistance and virulence factors in bacterial strains isolated from UTIs.  aPublisher supplied data  aEdital 65/2018cIFMG 3aCitrobacter koseri 3aEscherichia coli 3aKlebsiella aerogenes 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3aKlebsiella variicola 3aProteus mirabilis 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aampicillin 3aantibiotic resistance 3aconfidence interval 3aetiological agents 3agender 3ahospitals 3amultiple drug resistance 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3asulfamethoxazole 3atrimethoprim 3aurinary tract 3aurine 3avirulence 3aBrazil1 aSavini, Vitoria Marra de Souza1 aXavier, Rafael Gariglio Clark1 aRamos, Carolina Pantuzza1 aSilva, Rodrigo Otávio Silveira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0074-24881 aHeinemann, Marcos Bryan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6444-97881 aMoreno, Andrea Micke1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3290-566X1 aKnöbl, Terezinha1 aDorneles, Elaine Maria Seles1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2753-12961 aCustódio, Dirceia Aparecida da Costa1 aPereira, Carine Rodrigues1 aRodrigues e Oliveira, Pedro Felipe1 aPulinelli, Amanda Bruno0 tCurrent microbiology.g2021 Nov., v. 78, no. 11 p.3913-3923dSpringer USwJournal:jnl10978x0343-86517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02650-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245012600164300001600290520179000306592002802096650003402124650001102158650002002169650002202189650001402211650001902225650002302244650001302267650002202280650001802302650001202320650001302332650001002345651001502355700002202370700001602392700001902408700001702427700001802444700002202462700002402484700002602508773011702534856007702651852000902728655001202737IND60514970420221119010450.0160310e20140601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497042DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2013.00752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMyers, Esther F.10aEnergy Balance for Kids with Play: Design and Implementation of a Multi-Component School-Based Obesity Prevention Program  ap. 251-259.  aBackground: Improving nutrition and physical activity behaviors associated with childhood obesity are significant national public health goals. Energy Balance for Kids with Play (EB4K with Play), developed through a partnership between the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Foundation and Playworks, is a multi-component school-based intervention designed to address youth's nutrition and physical activity behaviors. This article describes the EB4K with Play intervention and evaluation study and presents the baseline data.Methods: The evaluation is a 2-year cluster-randomized design targeting third- to fifth-grade students enrolled in a low-income, urban school district in northern California. Six schools were recruited to participate. Four were randomized to the intervention group and two into a control group. Baseline student-level data pertaining to nutrition, physical activity, fitness, and BMI were collected in the fall of 2011. The EB4K with Play program, which includes direct-to-student nutrition and physical activity interventions, a school wellness component, and parent/community partner outreach components, began immediately after baseline data collection.Results: An ethnically diverse sample of students (n=844) was recruited to participate in the study. Baseline data showed a higher percent of eligibility for free and reduced-price school lunch and higher rates of obesity/overweight than the California state averages. Fitness levels and levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were comparable to state averages.Conclusions: End-point data will be collected after 2 years of the intervention. The findings from this study should help guide future efforts to design effective intervention programs to support the prevention of pediatric obesity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational School Lunch Program 3aautumn 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3adietetics 3aenergy balance 3aethnic differences 3aoutreach 3aphysical activity 3apublic health 3aschools 3astudents 3ayouth 3aCalifornia1 aGerstein, Dana E.1 aFoster, Jan1 aRoss, Michelle1 aBrown, Katie1 aKennedy, Evan1 aLinchey, Jennifer1 aMadsen, Kristine A.1 aCrawford, Patricia B.0 tChildhood obesity.g2014 June 01, v. 10, no. 3 p.251-259dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2013.00753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03511naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245016500156300001600321500002000337520186100357592002802218596002402246596003402270596003802304596002902342596002702371650001202398650001502410650003002425650002402455650002602479650001502505650001102520650001702531650001202548650001102560650001502571650002002586650001202606650001902618650001802637651001702655700002102672700001402693700001502707700005602722773012102778856007302899852000902972655001202981IND60654747620221121204926.0190726e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065474762DNAL7 a10.1111/acv.124702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZungu, M.

Nestedness is presumed to be primarily a result of selective extinction of species and thus is important for determining mechanisms of species impoverishment in fragmented landscapes. In this study, we investigated the effects of forest fragment attributes and species' life‐history traits on nestedness patterns of terrestrial mammals in an urban‐forest mosaic in EThekwini Municipality Area, Durban, South Africa. A presence/absence matrix of mammals (16 species) in forest fragments (28 fragments) was compiled based on the mammalian survey conducted using remote‐triggered camera traps. The mammalian assemblage in the study area displayed significant nestedness. The nested ranking of forest fragments was strongly correlated with fragment area and proximity index but not with shape index and foliage height diversity. The best model based on Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) showed that among species' life‐history traits, body mass, trophic level, niche breadth and sociality were the most suited as predictors of extinction vulnerability. In particular, niche breadth was strongly associated with extinction vulnerability. Thus, the ability to persist in forest fragments of various sizes as well as the ability to move to fragments with different degrees of isolation shape fragment dynamics in this landscape. Furthermore, species with broad resource requirements are more likely to persist with further habitat disturbance. Overall, this study showed the importance of integrating forest fragment attributes and ecological traits of species in nestedness analyses for determining species in most need of conservation action which is important for preventing further loss of species.  aPublisher supplied data  cHans Hoheisen Trust  cUniversity of KwaZulu‐Natal  cNational Research Foundation (ZA)  cFord Wildlife Foundation  cEThekwini Municipality 3acameras 3aextinction 3ageographical distribution 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitat fragmentation 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3alife history 3amammals 3amodels 3anestedness 3asocial behavior 3asurveys 3atrophic levels 3aurban forests 3aSouth Africa1 aMaseko, M.

However, Australian farms are large meaning that many of Australia’s livestock are unmonitored which impacts farm profit, animal welfare and the environment. Effective animal localisation and counting by analysing satellite imagery overcomes this management hurdle however, high resolution satellite imagery is expensive. Thus, to minimise cost the lowest spatial resolution data that enables accurate livestock detection should be selected. In our work, we determine the association between object detector performance and spatial degradation for cattle, sheep and dogs. Accurate ground truth was established using high resolution drone images which were then downsampled to various ground sample distances (GSDs). Both circular and cassegrain aperture optics were simulated to generate point spread functions (PSFs) corresponding to various optical qualities. By simulating the PSF, rather than approximating it as a Gaussian, the images were accurately degraded to match the spatial resolution and blurring structure of satellite imagery. Two existing datasets were combined and used to train and test a YoloV5 object detection network. Detector performance was found to drop steeply around a GSD of 0.5 m/px and was associated with PSF matrix structure within this GSD region. Detector mAP performance fell by 52% when a cassegrain, rather than circular, aperture was used at a 0.5 m/px GSD. Overall blurring magnitude also had a small impact when matched to GSD, as did the internal network resolution. Our results here inform the selection of remote sensing data requirements for animal detection tasks, allowing farmers and ecologists to use more accessible medium resolution imagery with confidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagriculture 3aanimal welfare 3aautomation 3acattle 3adata collection 3aelectronics 3afarm profitability 3aoptics 3aremote sensing 3asheep 3aAustralia 0aRemote sensing 0aLivestock monitoring 0aObject detection 0aSpatial resolution1 aQiao, Yongliang1 aClark, Cameron1 aLomax, Sabrina1 aRafique, Khalid1 aSukkarieh, Salah0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2022 Feb., v. 193 p.106689-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2022.1066893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03015naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245009800210300001600308506007600324520159500400592002801995506003702023650001402060650002002074650002202094650001302116650001102129650001202140650002402152650002402176650001902200650001602219651001802235700002002253700002002273700002102293700002102314700001902335773011702354856007702471852000902548655001202557IND60514970820221207050209.0160310e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497082DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2014.01202doi7 aPMC45291032pmcid7 a259501402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParra-Medina, Deborah10aPromoting Weight Maintenance among Overweight and Obese Hispanic Children in a Rural Practice  ap. 355-363.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: US Hispanic children experience a disproportionate burden of overweight and obesity. Comprehensive high-intensity behavioral programs have demonstrated effectiveness in improving weight status among obese children. However, there remains a need to develop more efficient interventions that are feasible in primary care and demonstrate effectiveness in Hispanic children.Methods: The pilot study used a two-group randomized design. Eligible overweight (BMI between the 85th and 94th percentile for age and gender) or obese (BMI ≥95th percentile) Hispanic children and their parents (N=118 child/parent dyads) were recruited from a rural pediatric clinic and randomized to: standard care (SC; n=61 dyads) or behavioral intervention (INT; n=57 dyads). The primary outcomes—weight, waist circumference, and zBMI—were measured at baseline, 2, 6, and 18 weeks. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the effect of INT on the likelihood of weight maintenance adjusting for potential confounding variables.Results: Significantly fewer INT children (68.5%) experienced weight gain, compared to SC children (89.7%; p=0.009). The same pattern was observed for waist circumference, where fewer INT children (44%) experienced an increase in waist circumference, compared to SC children (68.6%; p=0.02). Although a trend of improvement in favor of the INT was observed for zBMI, it was not significant.Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence for the feasibility of a primary-care–based approach to promoting weight maintenance among a high-risk population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHispanics 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3agender 3aparents 3aregression analysis 3awaist circumference 3aweight control 3aweight gain 3aUnited States1 aMojica, Cynthia1 aLiang, Yuanyuan1 aOuyang, Yongjian1 aRamos, Awilda I.1 aGomez, Ismaela0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 4 p.355-363dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2014.01203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148242010100169245009900270300001600369520179200385592002802177650002402205650001402229650002202243650001302265650002302278650002802301650001702329650002102346651001102367651001802378651001402396700002302410700002402433773014302457856008202600852000902682655001202691IND60752364720220218000000.0211002e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6075236472DNAL7 a10.1007/s00506-021-00787-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalhofer, Stefan10aAusbildung als Schlüssel für eine adäquate Behandlung von Elektroaltgeräten in Lateinamerika10aEducation as a key for the appropriate treatment of waste electrical and electronic equipment  ap. 408-417.  aAs in other parts of the world, households in Latin America are increasingly equipped with electrical and electronic appliances.

In most Latin American countries, the separate collection of waste is hardly developed, and facilities for specific treatment of waste such as WEEE are largely lacking. Collection and treatment are mainly carried out by the informal sector.This paper takes a closer look at two countries as examples, Nicaragua, as one of the least developed countries, and Brazil, a large and partly industrialised country, which, however, does not have developed waste collection and treatment structures. In Nicaragua, there are currently no specific legal regulations for the handling of WEEE and only individual, smaller initiatives for collection, as well as a treatment facility in Managua.In Brazil, the informal sector dominates the collection and treatment of WEEE. Legal regulations have been discussed for many years. An industry regulation is supposed to introduce producer responsibility, but the roles and obligations of the stakeholders are not clear. In the existing waste management system, cooperatives play an important role.Expert knowledge is essential for planning, implementing and monitoring waste management systems. Currently, there are hardly any opportunities for specialised training in this field in both countries. In order to meet the expected future needs, the LaWEEEda project (funded by the Erasmus+programme) was launched to establish an academic programme for waste management and treatment of WEEE as well as an in-service training programme for practitioners in this field at the four participating universities.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeveloped countries 3aeducation 3aelectronic wastes 3aindustry 3amanagement systems 3aproducer responsibility 3astakeholders 3awaste management 3aBrazil 3aLatin America 3aNicaragua1 aSchmied, Elisabeth1 aJandric, Aleksander0 tÖsterreichische Wasser- und Abfallwirtschaft.g2021 Oct., v. 73, no. 9-10 p.408-417dSpringer ViennawJournal:J000000413x0945-358X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00506-021-00787-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005300148242006000201245007300261300001600334520153500350592002801885650001901913650001301932650002101945650002601966650001101992650002502003650001602028650001102044650000902055650001002064700005602074773014302130856008202273852000902355655001202364IND60752364920220218000000.0211002e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||ger||7 aIND6075236492DNAL7 a10.1007/s00506-021-00785-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeigl, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4233-456510aRückgewinnung von Wertstoffen aus Elektrokleingeräten10aRecovery of resources from small electrical and electronic equipment  ap. 402-407.  aThe circular economy package adopted by the European Union in 2017 provides for several strategies to make better use of resources. In addition to sustainable product design, measures to reduce waste generation, an intensification of recycling and the closing of material cycles are essential approaches. The increase in recycling targets is particularly targeted in resource-intensive sectors; in addition to plastics, textiles and the construction industry, the electronics sector plays an important role here. In the recycling of WEEE, the collection category of small electrical appliances poses a particular challenge; this collection category is heterogeneous, the individual types of appliances differ significantly in their structure and their content of recyclable materials. In addition, this category will gain importance as it is one of the fastest growing waste streams in the EU. Recovery typically consists of pre-treatment (dismantling and de-pollution, shredding and separation of material streams), recovery of secondary resources in the form of materials (iron and steel, non-ferrous metals such as aluminium and copper) and energy, and disposal of non-recyclable materials. The optimisation of processes for reprocessing requires more comprehensive data bases for the characterisation of this heterogeneous waste stream. The paper presents a method for mapping the material composition of small electrical appliances more precisely by appliance group and how these data can be used to optimise pre-treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aaluminum 3acircular economy 3aconstruction industry 3acopper 3aelectronic equipment 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3airon 3asteel1 aSalhofer, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0727-17030 tÖsterreichische Wasser- und Abfallwirtschaft.g2021 Oct., v. 73, no. 9-10 p.402-407dSpringer ViennawJournal:J000000413x0945-358X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00506-021-00785-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148242013400167245011100301300001400412520197300426592002802399650002102427650001902448650001102467650001102478650001402489650001002503650001002513650001602523650001402539650000902553650000902562650002002571650001102591650001502602650001602617650001002633651001402643773012702657856008302784852000902867655001202876IND60752365220221117164303.0211003e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075236522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-021-00584-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöse, Bülent10aBewertung der Phänologie von Weintrauben unter Verwendung verschiedener Klimaindizes, angebaut in der Schwarzmeerregion, Türkei10aEvaluating of Wine Grapes Phenology by Using Different Climatic Indices, Grown in Black Sea Region, Turkey  ap. 77-88.  aAnatolia is one of the most important main gene centers of V. vinifera grapes in the world. Although The Black Sea Region has a fairly wide geographic area in Turkey, the European grapes are the least grown in this region except for V. labrusca grapes. Because of the having heavy rainfall in both spring and autumn of the region, when combined with insufficient sunshine during the vegetation period, V. vinifera cultivars are not be grown economically in this humid northern area. Samsun city is settled in the Black Sea region, and has two important agricultural plains. Although Samsun settled in this humid region, it has the least rainfall compared to other coastal provinces towards the Eastern Black Sea Region. In this study, the adaptation of some wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L.) in Samsun conditions is evaluated by examining the phenology and ripening characteristics of ‘Merlot’, ‘Cabernet Sauvignon’, ‘Syrah’, ‘Ugni Blanc’, ‘Kalecik Karası’, ‘Muscat’ and ‘Chardonnay’grapes from 2014 to 2016. Some different climatic indices were used to assess the potential of wine grape cultivars grown in this region. In the study, grapes were evaluated whether will grow or not suitable in this location by using Winkler Index (WI), Huglin Index (HI), Branas Heliothermic Index (BHI), and Hydrothermic Index (Hyl). When the climatic indices evaluated according to long term climate records; Huglin index 1983; Winkler index 1848; Branas Hyl 3991, and Heliothermic index were found as 3.5 ᵒC. According to average values of 2014, 2015, and 2016 years; the Huglin index 2290; Winkler index 2132; Branas Hyl index 5198, and Heliothermic index was determined as 3.8 ᵒC. The phenological investigations and the evaluated climatic records showed that the research area is very favorable to grow wine grapes. According to Hyl results, moderate fungal disease risk might be considered for the central coastal area of the Samsun region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aVitis vinifera 3aautumn 3acoasts 3acultivars 3afungi 3agenes 3ahumid zones 3aphenology 3arain 3arisk 3asolar radiation 3aspring 3avegetation 3awine grapes 3awines 3aBlack Sea0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2021 Oct., v. 63, no.

Sampling data for a wide size range enabled investigating the selection process for this species in detail, both for the grid and the square mesh panel. Contrary to earlier studies modelling size selectivity for grids and square mesh panels, which assume that the escape behaviour of all sizes of fish is equal, we applied a model that accounted for haddock of different sizes showing different escape behaviours. Our results demonstrated that this model could describe the experimental data collected better than existing models. Specifically, our results showed that the likelihood for smaller haddock to seek escape through the grid and the square mesh panel was higher than that for bigger haddock that still would manage to escape through the devices if they attempted. The new modelling approach presented in this study may be applicable to other species, selection devices, and fisheries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMelanogrammus aeglefinus 3adata collection 3aescape behavior 3afisheries 3ahaddock 3amodels 3aBarents Sea1 aSistiaga, Manu1 aGrimaldo, Eduardo1 aLarsen, Roger B.1 aOlsen, Leonore1 aBrinkhof, Jesse1 aTatone, Ivan0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2019, v. 76, no. 8 p.1350-1361dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2017-04613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245014300167300001800310520124600328592002801574650002901602650002201631650001601653650000901669650002601678650002701704650001601731650001501747650002301762650002101785650001401806650001401820650001201834650002601846650001601872700001901888700001601907700003001923700002301953773014301976856007902119852000902198655001202207IND60654748820221121224420.0190726s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065474882DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2018-00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThorn, Michael W.10aTransgenerational effects of egg nutrients on the early development of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) across a thermal gradient  ap. 1253-1262.  aThe transgenerational effect of maternal diet, expressed as variation in the composition and quantity of egg nutrients available to offspring during endogenous development (i.e., prior to free-feeding), has the potential to greatly influence the response of offspring phenotypes to varying environmental conditions. For this study, we examined how natural variation in the fatty acid and proximate composition of eggs from three Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations influenced early development across a thermal gradient using a common garden hatchery experiment. We found that the relative quantity of fat, lean mass, and water in the eggs was similar among populations. However, the fatty acid composition of the eggs differed among all populations. After controlling for egg mass, egg fatty acid and proximate composition influenced hatch length, swim-up length, and hatch to swim-up growth. Importantly, the magnitude and direction of these egg quality effects depended on the population of origin and temperature. Overall, our results demonstrate that natural variation in egg nutrient composition, likely driven by maternal diet, has transgenerational effects on offspring development under varying thermal conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus tshawytscha 3aearly development 3aegg quality 3aeggs 3aenvironmental factors 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3ahatcheries 3amaternal nutrition 3anutrient content 3anutrients 3aphenotype 3aprogeny 3aproximate composition 3atemperature1 aDick, Morag F.1 aOviedo, Leo1 aGuglielmo, Christopher G.1 aMorbey, Yolanda E.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2019, v. 76, no. 8 p.1253-1262dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-00133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03317naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245014300203300001600346506007600362520177200438592002802210506003702238650002202275650001402297650001602311650001602327650001402343650002702357650002002384650002202404650001502426650001502441650001502456650001802471650002402489650000902513650001002522700002902532700002002561700001502581700002402596773011702620856007702737852000902814655001202823IND60514972020221207050149.0160310e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497202DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2014.01132doi7 aPMC45290912pmcid7 a261724232pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeller, Meg H.10aYouth Whose Weight Exceeds Healthy Guidelines Are High-Risk Targets for Tobacco Prevention Messaging and Close Monitoring of Cigarette Use  ap. 406-414.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Adolescents are long-standing tobacco prevention targets, given that smoking patterns typically originate before adulthood. Pediatric overweight/obesity remains at epidemic levels. Links between these two biobehavioral risks are not well understood, yet of keen public health and pediatric care relevance. The aims of the present study were to examine smoking behaviors and attitudes of overweight (OV), obese (OB), and severely obese (SO) adolescents, compared to healthy weight (HW), utilizing the nationally representative sample, Monitoring the Future.Methods: Smoking behavior prevalence (ever, current, or age of initiation), perceived risk of harm, disapproval of others smoking, and peer smoking were determined for a pooled 2008–2009 sample of 19,678 10th graders (Mₐgₑ=16.09±0.47 years) by CDC-defined BMI percentile-based categories within race/ethnic group (69.5% white, 14.5% African American, and 16.0% Hispanic). Logistic regression examined the impact of excess weight status on smoking behaviors and attitudes relative to HW.Results: Relative to HW of same race/ethnicity, white or African American OV, OB, and SO had higher odds of recent smoking, with the highest prevalence among SO. For white youth, excess weight increased odds of ever smoking, early daily smoking (before grade 9), perceiving low risk of harm, and not disapproving of others smoking. Findings varied for African American or Hispanic youth.Conclusions: As we move toward fostering a tobacco-free generation, youth whose weight exceeds healthy guidelines are high-risk targets for tobacco prevention messaging and close monitoring of cigarette use, particularly those who are severely obese as well as white youth of excess weight, starting before adolescence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3aHispanics 3aadolescence 3aadolescents 3aadulthood 3aattitudes and opinions 3abody mass index 3achildhood obesity 3acigarettes 3aguidelines 3amonitoring 3apublic health 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3ayouth1 aReiter-Purtill, Jennifer1 aPeugh, James L.1 aWu, Yelena1 aBecnel, Jennifer N.0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 4 p.406-414dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2014.01133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05323naa a2201885 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245005300166300001600219520138900235592002801624650001701652650001701669650001401686650001701700650002001717650001601737650002101753650001801774650002101792650002201813650002601835650001701861650001301878653002801891653002301919653002101942653002501963653002101988653001002009653000802019653000702027653000902034653001002043653001002053653000802063653000802071653001002079653000802089653001202097653000802109653001002117653000802127653001702135653000802152653000802160653000902168653000802177653001102185653000602196653000802202653000802210653000902218653000802227653000802235653000802243653001202251653000802263653000802271653000702279653001502286653000802301653000902309653000802318653001102326653000802337653000902345653001102354653000902365653000902374653001002383653001002393653001002403653000802413653000802421653000902429653001002438653000902448653000902457653001102466653001002477653000802487653001102495653000702506653000802513653000702521653000802528653000902536653000902545653000802554653000802562653000902570653001802579653001102597653001802608653000702626653000802633653001102641653000802652653000702660653001102667653000802678653000802686653000602694653001002700653001002710653000802720653000902728653001002737653000902747653000802756653002402764653000802788653000902796653000802805653002002813653000902833653001202842653001302854653000902867653001902876653000702895653000702902653000802909653000802917653001002925653000902935653000802944653000702952653001002959653000802969653000902977653000802986653001102994653000803005653001103013653001103024653001003035653000803045653001003053653001103063653000803074653000703082653000903089700001803098700001803116700001503134700001703149700001903166700001803185700001603203773011103219856008603330852000903416655001203425IND60762289520221120172552.0220929e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076228952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Tianqi10aPolymer nanotherapeutics to correct autoimmunity  ap. 152-174.  aThe immune system maintains homeostasis and protects the body from pathogens, mutated cells, and other harmful substances. When immune homeostasis is disrupted, excessive autoimmunity will lead to diseases. To inhibit the unexpected immune responses and reduce the impact of treatment on immunoprotective functions, polymer nanotherapeutics, such as nanomedicines, nanovaccines, and nanodecoys, were developed as part of an advanced strategy for precise immunomodulation. Nanomedicines transport cytotoxic drugs to target sites to reduce the occurrence of side effects and increase the stability and bioactivity of various immunomodulating agents, especially nucleic acids and cytokines. In addition, polymer nanomaterials carrying autoantigens used as nanovaccines can induce antigen-specific immune tolerance without interfering with protective immune responses. The precise immunomodulatory function of nanovaccines has broad prospects for the treatment of immune related-diseases. Besides, nanodecoys, which are designed to protect the body from various pathogenic substances by intravenous administration, are simple and relatively noninvasive treatments. Herein, we have discussed and predicted the application of polymer nanotherapeutics in the correction of autoimmunity, including treating autoimmune diseases, controlling hypersensitivity, and avoiding transplant rejection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautoantigens 3aautoimmunity 3acytokines 3acytotoxicity 3agraft rejection 3ahomeostasis 3ahypersensitivity 3aimmune system 3aimmunomodulators 3aimmunosuppression 3aintravenous injection 3ananomedicine 3apolymers 0aPolymer nanotherapeutic 0aAutoimmune disease 0aHypersensitivity 0aTransplant rejection 0aImmunomodulation 0aAct D 0aAIT 0aAN 0aAPCs 0aBregs 0aBRNPs 0aBSA 0aCEL 0acfDNA 0aCLT 0aCpG-ODN 0aCsA 0aCS-NP 0aCUR 0adAg-ECDI-NPs 0aDEX 0aDIR 0aDMSO 0aDSP 0aDSP-NP 0aE 0aEAE 0aEAU 0aECDI 0aEDC 0aETO 0aEVE 0aFITC-AN 0aGBM 0aGCL 0aHA 0aHA-LCS-NP3 0aHAS 0aHEVs 0aH&E 0aIFN-γ 0aIIF 0aIL-1 0aIL-1β 0aIL-2 0aIL-6 0aIL-10 0aIL-17 0aIL-22 0aINL 0aITP 0ai.a. 0ai.LN. 0ai.p. 0ai.v. 0aLCS-NP 0aLSECs 0aMBP 0aMBP-NP 0aMC 0aMHC 0aMM 0aMMF 0aMMVs 0aMNPs 0aMPA 0aMOG 0amPEG 0amPEG−hexPLA 0aMP-TAC 0aMP-TAC-MECA79 0aMS 0aMTX 0aNF-κB 0aNIM 0aNP 0aNSAIDs 0aONL 0aOVA 0aP 0aPAMAM 0aPCADK 0aPCL 0aPD-1 0aPD-L1 0aPDMA 0aPEG 0aPEG-b-PLLys-b-PLLeu 0aPEI 0aPEMA 0aPLA 0aPLA−PEG−PLA 0aPLGA 0aPLGA NP 0aPLGA(Ag) 0aPNAd 0aPoly1/GpG PEMs 0aPS 0aRA 0aRBC 0aRES 0arhMBP 0aRNPs 0aRPE 0aSD 0asiRNA 0aSLE 0as.c. 0aTAC 0aTGF-β 0aTLR 0aT-MNPs 0aTNF-α 0aT-NPs 0aTPL 0aTregs 0aT-RNPs 0aUCB 0aUS 0aVEGF1 aFeng, Xiangru1 aYang, Jiazhen1 aXu, Weiguo1 aLiu, Tongjun1 aZhang, Minglei1 aDing, Jianxun1 aChen, Xuesi0 tJournal of controlled release.g2022 Mar., v. 343 p.152-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12462x0168-36597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2021.12.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001500143245014300158300001600301520165700317592002801974650004402002650001602046650001102062650001702073650002002090650001902110650001402129650002202143650001302165650002002178650001302198650001402211650002102225650002502246650002502271650002402296651002302320651001802343700002202361700002102383700002302404700001702427700001802444700002202462773011702484856007702601852000902678655001202687IND60514972520221119010339.0160310e20150801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497252DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2015.00262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmer, Amna10aAssociation between Breastfeeding and Childhood Obesity: Analysis of a Linked Longitudinal Study of Rural Appalachian Fifth-Grade Children  ap. 449-455.  aIntroduction: Although breastfeeding is associated with improving numerous health outcomes for the child, its role in reducing childhood obesity is contested. Despite this controversy, both the CDC and the US Department of Health and Human Services promote breastfeeding as one of the strategies for reducing childhood obesity. Rural Appalachia has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity and low rates of breastfeeding, compared to rest of the nation. The aim of this study was to examine the association between breastfeeding and childhood obesity at 11 years in the rural Appalachian state of West Virginia (WV).Methods: The study used linked data from two cross-sectional data sets to examine this relationship longitudinally in fifth-grade WV children. The main outcome variable was BMI adjusted percent (BMI%) and the main exposure was defined as occurrence of breastfeeding. Mean BMI% of children who were not breastfed was significantly higher, compared to children who were breastfed.Results: The result of the multiple regression analysis showed that breastfeeding significantly predicted BMI% of children after controlling for maternal education, health insurance, family history of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, child's asthma status, and birth weight of the infant.Conclusions: Our results are consistent with other studies that have shown a significant, but small, inverse association between breastfeeding and childhood obesity. Findings from this study suggest the need to improve breastfeeding rates in the rural Appalachian state of WV as one of the potential strategies to prevent obesity during childhood and adolescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDepartment of Health and Human Services 3aadolescence 3aasthma 3abirth weight 3abody mass index 3abreast feeding 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adata collection 3adiabetes 3aeducation 3ahealth insurance 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alongitudinal studies 3aregression analysis 3aAppalachian region 3aWest Virginia1 aHamilton, Candice1 aBritton, Cris M.1 aMullett, Martha D.1 aJohn, Collin1 aNeal, William1 aLilly, Christa L.0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 4 p.449-455dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2015.00263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03374naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245022400205300001600429506007600445520180300521592002802324506003702352650001202389650002702401650002202428650001002450650002102460650001202481650001502493650001702508650001202525650002302537650001802560650001502578651001102593700002102604700002002625700003302645700002302678773011702701856007702818852000902895655001202904IND60514972620221207062548.0160310e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497262DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2015.00112doi7 aPMC48082852pmcid7 a261862852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Rachel E.10a“It Hurts a Latina When They Tell Us Anything About Our Children”: Implications of Mexican-Origin Mothers' Maternal Identities, Aspirations, and Attitudes About Cultural Transmission for Childhood Obesity Prevention  ap. 608-615.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: This qualitative study explored values, attitudes, and beliefs held by Mexican-origin mothers of preschool-aged children to enhance understanding of cultural influences on behaviors associated with childhood obesity risk.Methods: During face-to-face interviews, 39 Mexican-origin mothers of preschool-aged children discussed their hopes for their children, their image of the perfect mother, Mexican and American foods, why they taught their children about these foods, and their opinions about television (TV) viewing language.Results: Participants wanted their children to become successful, “good” people, which necessitated doing well in school. Mothers also wanted their children to know them, which required understanding the mothers' Mexican backgrounds. Mothers wanted their children to maintain Mexican values and identities. Some mothers viewed American culture as harmful. Many participants prepared their child for going to Mexico by exposing them to Mexican culture and foods. Some mothers fed their children American foods to prepare them for school. Perceptions of American foods generally reflected stereotypical unhealthy foods. TV helped teach children Spanish and English. Being a good mother was core to participants' identities; thus, hearing about child overweight made some mothers feel like failures.Conclusions: Health promotion programs may be more salient to mothers if they: underscore how a healthy weight can help children in school; teach mothers to prepare healthy American foods that their children will encounter in kindergarten; assist mothers in teaching their children about Mexico; and present information about childhood obesity in ways that reinforce what mothers are doing well, enhance mothers' self-efficacy, and allay feelings of failure.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLatinos 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood obesity 3afoods 3ahealth promotion 3ahearing 3ainterviews 3akindergarten 3amothers 3apreschool children 3aself-efficacy 3atelevision 3aMexico1 aCole, Suzanne M.1 aReyes, Ligia I.1 aMcKenney-Shubert, Shannon J.1 aPeterson, Karen E.0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 11, no. 5 p.608-615dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2015.00113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148242017900169245014600348300001400494520166500508592002802173650002102201650001902222650001102241650001102252650001402263650001102277650000902288650001202297650001002309650001302319650001102332650002002343650001002363650001402373700001602387700001602403773012702419856008302546852000902629655001202638IND60752366620221120022843.0211003e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075236662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10341-021-00583-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSabir, Ferhan K.10aErhaltung der Beerenqualität bei ökologisch angebauten Reben (Vitis vinifera L.) durch Belassen der Trauben an der Rebe bei gemäßigten Klimabedingungen der Provinz Konya10aMaintaining the Grape Quality on Organically Grown Vines (Vitis vinifera L.) at Vineyard Condition under Temperate Climate of Konya Province  ap. 71-76.  aOrganically produced conventional products have gained great attention in accordance with the increasing awareness on healthy foods as well as improvements in living standards. Environment friendly strategies to extend the quality of grapes after commercial maturity provide healthy and profitable sustainability in market chain. In the present study, possibilities to maintain the quality of grape clusters on grapevines without any chemical treatments have been studied under vineyard conditions in temperate climate characteristics of Konya Province in Central Anatolia. Grape clusters of ‘Alphonse Lavallée’ and ‘Narince’, one of the most popular conventional grape cultivar in Turkey, were kept on the vines trained with bilateral cordon system. The vines were drip irrigated during the hot summer and the vine canopy was covered with black nets after veraison to protect from the birds, hail and climatic extremities. After commercial maturity, twelve cluster samples per cultivar were collected with monthly intervals to investigate the changes in quality. Up to the 3rd sampling date (at the end of November 2019), little losses in quality features were determined in both cultivars. At the end of the study, at 4th moth (December), significant decay incidences were observed with similar patterns in cultivars. General findings demonstrated that the grape clusters could be maintained on grapevines under intact condition of the cool autumn season in temperate zone by protecting them from the external damages using convenient protective materials up to three or four months depending on the response of cultivars to environmental variables.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTurkey (country) 3aVitis vinifera 3aautumn 3acanopy 3acultivars 3agrapes 3ahail 3amarkets 3amoths 3aripening 3asummer 3atemperate zones 3avines 3avineyards1 aAli, Sabir,1 aUnal, Sevil0 tErwerbsobstbau.g2021 Oct., v. 63, no.

Further, data on consumers only may further elucidate beverage intake patterns.Purpose: The aim of this study was to update the current body of literature describing beverage intake in children by weight category, with the addition of consumer-only data.Methods: Day one 24-hour recalls from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005–2010 were analyzed to assess beverage intake of children 2–18 years old and differences by weight category. Beverages were coded as water, milk, 100% juice, coffee/tea, fruit drinks, soda, or low-calorie/diet drinks.Results: On average, 18.7% of total daily calories for 2- to 18-year-old children came from beverages; 60% of total daily calories from added sugar came from beverages. Mean calories from beverages were 359, 358, and 386 kcal for normal weight, overweight, and obese children, respectively. Across all weight categories, there were clinically significant differences between overall means and means for consumers only. There were overlapping confidence intervals for intake of calories from soda and fruit drinks consumed by 2- to 5-year-olds and 12- to 18-year-olds, suggesting nonsignificant differences in intake across weight categories for these age groups.Conclusions: Messaging around beverage intake may be beneficial for children of all weights, particularly for those known to consume sugar-sweetened beverages. The per-consumer estimates may represent a better measure of intakes in future examinations of 24-hour recall data.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3aadolescents 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3aconfidence interval 3aenergy 3afruit drinks 3ajuices 3amilk 3asugars 3atea 3aUnited States1 aAnderson, Sarah E.1 aKaye, Gail L.1 aTaylor, Christopher A.0 tChildhood obesity.g2015 Aug. 01, v. 11, no. 4 p.475-483dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2015.00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245012300168300001800291520116800309592002801477650002401505650001401529650002001543650001501563650000901578650001401587650002101601650000801622650001501630650001101645650001401656650001101670700002001681700002201701700002401723700001901747700002501766700002101791700001901812700002601831700002201857773014301879856007902022852000902101655001202110IND60654750120221120213042.0190726s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065475012DNAL7 a10.1139/cjfas-2018-02932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Breanna M.10aDistinct diel and seasonal behaviours in rainbow trout detected by fine-scale acoustic telemetry in a lake environment  ap. 1432-1445.  aThe fine-scale behavioural activities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in nature are not well understood, but are of importance for identifying interactions with the ecosystem and of interest to conservationists and recreational anglers. We have undertaken a high-resolution acoustic telemetry study to identify the distinct movement patterns of 30 rainbow trout in a freshwater lake, specifically examining swim speed, area of movement, and site preference in both summer and winter. Activity levels were reduced in winter compared with summer across all fish, but ranking of individuals was consistent. In summer, 16/30 fish displayed diel movement, in which they travelled to a different area of the lake at dawn and returned at dusk, while other fish maintained their site preference regardless of the time of day or swam more randomly throughout the lake. These patterns were minimized in winter, where there was a reduction in cross-lake movement under ice and only 4/30 fish displayed diel movement. Winter conditions may limit the capability (physiological limitations) and (or) motivation (prey availability) for diel behaviours observed in summer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aacoustics 3aanimal behavior 3aecosystems 3afish 3afishermen 3afreshwater lakes 3aice 3amotivation 3asummer 3atelemetry 3awinter1 aBiagi, Carlo A.1 aNorthrup, Sara L.1 aOhata, Michael L.A.1 aCharles, Colin1 aBlanchfield, Paul J.1 aJohnston, Sam V.1 aAskey, Paul J.1 avan Poorten, Brett T.1 aDevlin, Robert H.0 tCanadian journal of fisheries and aquatic sciences.g2019, v. 76, no. 8 p.1432-1445dNRC Research PresswJournal:jnl32083x1205-75337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjfas-2018-02933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010000164300001600264500001500280520151300295592002801808650001401836650000901850650002201859650001001881650001501891650002301906650002301929650001501952650002401967650001601991650002602007650001102033650002102044650002402065650002202089650000902111650002302120651001302143653001602156700002102172700002302193700002002216773011702236856007702353852000902430655001202439IND60514973020221119005934.0160315e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497302DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2014.00222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeedn, Ashley E.10aTrends in Obesity Prevalence and Disparities among Low-Income Children in Oklahoma, 2005–2010  ap. 318-325.  a2019-12-06  aBackground: National WIC (the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children) data indicate a decrease in obesity prevalence among most low-income preschool-aged children. Though racial/ethnic disparities exist, studies examining obesity trends among various racial/ethnic groups are lacking. The aims of this study were to identify racial/ethnic disparities in obesity among low-income preschool children in Oklahoma and describe trends in obesity prevalence among four major racial/ethnic groups.Methods: Subjects included 218,486 children 2–4 years of age who participated in WIC in Oklahoma from 2005 to 2010. Logistic regression was performed to identify disparities and trends in obesity among American Indian, Hispanic, White, and African American children.Results: Racial/ethnic disparities in obesity were evident, with prevalence highest in Hispanics and lowest in African Americans. Obesity increased among girls for all racial/ethnic groups from 2005 to 2010 (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01, 1.03). Among boys, obesity increased in African Americans (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01, 1.07), but remained stable in other racial/ethnic groups.Conclusions: In Oklahoma, in contrast to recent national studies, obesity is increasing among certain groups of low-income preschool children. These findings suggest geographic diversity in obesity and that state-specific obesity surveillance is important to help target interventions to those at highest risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHispanics 3arisk 3aAfrican Americans 3agirls 3amonitoring 3aat-risk population 3aethnic differences 3aodds ratio 3aconfidence interval 3aWIC Program 3alow income households 3aWhites 3anational surveys 3aregression analysis 3achildhood obesity 3aboys 3apreschool children 3aOklahoma 0arisk groups1 aHale, Jessica J.1 aThompson, David M.1 aDarden, Paul M.0 tChildhood obesity.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 4 p.318-325dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2014.00223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03253naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245009500206300001600301500001500317506007600332520162500408592002802033506003702061650001402098650000902112650001502121650002302136650002602159650002402185650001702209650002602226650001302252650001002265650001302275650002202288650001802310650002002328650002802348651001002376653001602386700001402402700002102416700002402437700002202461700002502483773011702508856007702625852000902702655001202711IND60514973120221207062644.0160310e20140801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051497312DNAL7 a10.1089/chi.2014.00362doi7 aPMC41209282pmcid7 a250462062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolacsek, Michele10aSustainability of Key Maine Youth Overweight Collaborative Improvements: A Follow-Up Study  ap. 326-333.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Primary care is an opportune setting to contribute to obesity prevention and treatment. However, there is limited evidence for effective and sustainable interventions in primary care. The Maine Youth Overweight Collaborative (MYOC) successfully affected office systems, provider behavior, and patient experience. The current study evaluates the effect of MYOC on provider knowledge, beliefs, practices, patient experience, and office systems, in 2012, three years postintervention.Methods: A quasi-experimental field trial was used with all seven original MYOC intervention sites that participated in MYOC between 2004 and 2009 and two non-MYOC control sites. Data from immediately post-MYOC in 2009 served as the baseline comparison. Main outcome measures included rates of recording of BMI percentile in chart, weight classification, use of the 5210 behavioral screening tool, parental reports of counseling received on 5210 topics, and clinician reports of changes in knowledge, beliefs, and practices.Results: Many key MYOC improvements were sustained or improved 3 years postintervention and demonstrated improvements, as compared to control sites.Conclusion: In an environment where obesity has become a priority for healthcare providers and systems, we demonstrate sustainable improvements in clinical decision support and family management of risk behaviors within a primary-care–based approach to addressing overweight risk among children and youth. Some declines were observed for more-complex behavioral and system outcomes. Many opportunities for office system and provider improvements remain.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ascreening 3arisk 3acounseling 3aat-risk population 3abehavior modification 3ahealth care workers 3atherapeutics 3afield experimentation 3achildren 3ayouth 3apatients 3achildhood obesity 3arisk behavior 3abody mass index 3aweight control programs 3aMaine 0arisk groups1 aOrr, Joan1 aO'Brien, Liam M.1 aRogers, Victoria W.1 aFanburg, Jonathan1 aGortmaker, Steven L.0 tChildhood obesity.g2014 Aug. 01, v. 10, no. 4 p.326-333dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:23081x2153-21767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1089/chi.2014.00363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03451naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245006200163300001400225520191500239592002802154596005902182596011202241650002302353650005202376650002002428650001402448650001402462650001402476650001702490650001202507650001102519650001802530650002202548650001702570650001602587650001002603650001402613650001202627700001702639700001302656700001902669700001502688700002002703773014202723856008302865852000902948655001202957IND60752367420221120032244.0220424e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075236742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-021-00656-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchulz, A.10aEthanol inactivation of orthonairoviruses in ixodid ticks  ap. 75-81.  aIxodid ticks represent vectors and reservoirs for a broad range of zoonotic pathogens. Collected ticks from field studies are therefore usually stored in ethanol, which in higher concentrations effectively inactivates most of the known tick-borne pathogens. Although commonly practiced as gold standard for inactivation, hardly any scientific data demonstrate that ethanol sufficiently penetrates the comparatively thick cuticula of ticks. Therefore, Amblyomma hebraeum tick pools were stored for 21 days in ethanol (96%). Afterwards, the ethanol was removed and the ticks were homogenized. Quantitative ¹H-NMR spectroscopic analysis was applied to determine the residual concentration of ethanol inside the ticks. ¹H-NMR spectroscopic analysis revealed that ethanol constituted 28.3–42.6 mg of the total weight of three ticks in the pools (89.9–121.5 mg). In addition, the low-pathogenic Hazara orthonairovirus (HAZV) was used as a cell culture model for this study. The virus was exposed to ethanol concentrations between 0 and 60% and incubated under various temperature conditions for four time periods. Afterwards, the residual virus infectivity was determined by titration. Following ethanol exposure, HAZV did not grow in cells after 9 h of exposure to an ethanol concentration of 25%. These results demonstrate an extremely low ethanol resistance of the virus, which was generally in line with previously reported ethanol inactivation data for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV). After prolonged storage and impregnation, comparable ethanol concentrations are achieved in the ticks, indicating the suitability of this inactivation method also for Bunyaviruses in ticks. At the very least, a massive virus inactivation can be assumed. Definitive proof of virus inactivation would require a bioassay of ethanol-treated infected ticks under appropriate biosafety conditions.  aPublisher supplied data  aGR980/4-1 AOBJ 630130cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aESF_14-BM-A55-0005_16cMecklenburg-Pomerania Excellence Initiative (Germany) and European Social Fund (ESF) 3aAmblyomma hebraeum 3aCrimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus 3aOrthobunyavirus 3aacarology 3abioassays 3abiosafety 3acell culture 3aethanol 3amodels 3apathogenicity 3aspectral analysis 3astorage time 3atemperature 3aticks 3atitration 3aviruses1 aMethling, K.1 aLalk, M.1 aEisenbarth, A.1 aKeller, M.1 aGroschup, M.

Rhipicephalus microplus causes economic losses both through direct feeding on livestock and through disease transmission. Reports of the failure of chemical ixodicides to control this tick have led to a search for control alternatives, such as bacteria with ixodicide activity. The objective of this work was to select a bacterial strain with ixodicide activity against R. microplus. In total, 83 bacterial strains were isolated from soil and dead R. microplus specimens, and all strains were evaluated against larvae in a screening test. Bacteria with ixodicide activity were evaluated in larvae and engorged adult female ticks. The larvae were challenged using the larval immersion test (LIT) with 20 µg/mL total protein. The median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) for larvae was obtained by using nine total protein concentrations. Engorged adult female ticks were challenged using the adult immersion test (AIT) with six protein concentrations. We evaluated adult mortality on day 10, oviposition rate on day 14 and hatching rate on day 40 after challenge. Only one bacterial strain (EC-35) showed ixodicide activity against larvae and adult R. microplus. The highest larval mortality, 52.3%, occurred with a total protein concentration of 40 μg/mL, and the LC₅₀ was 13.9 µg/mL of protein. In adults, a total protein concentration of 10 µg/mL had the highest mortality (55%), oviposition inhibition (50.9%) and reproductive potential inhibition (52.5%). However, there was no significant effect on hatching.

We investigated a frequent association of cucurbit powdery mildew (Podosphaera xanthii), Tarsonemus bilobatus, and Proprioseiopsis mexicanus in watermelon and pumpkin fields to determine whether P. mexicanus is consuming either or both of the other organisms. We also examined developmental and reproductive capability of P. mexicanus on these diets. If P. mexicanus is an effective predator of T. bilobatus, it may also be useful in controlling pest tarsonemids, such as broad mites. Proprioseiopsis mexicanus either starved or escaped from arenas rather than consume P. xanthii. When consuming T. bilobatus, P. mexicanus females developed from larva to adult in ca. 3 days. On this diet, the preoviposition period was ca. 2 days and P. mexicanus laid 1.7 eggs/day. These results are comparable to some of the higher-quality non-prey resources investigated in the literature. Starved female P. mexicanus consumed 6.5 T. bilobatus of mixed stages in 1 h. This study provides support for further research into the importance of non-pest tarsonemids as a resource to maintain the presence of generalist predatory mites as an early-intervention natural enemy. Further work should examine the efficacy of P. mexicanus as a natural enemy of economically important pest tarsonemids.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018-67012-27994/Project accession no. 1015537cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aCucurbitaceae 3aPodosphaera xanthii 3aTarsonemus 3aacarology 3aadults 3aagroecosystems 3adiet 3afemales 3anatural enemies 3apests 3apowdery mildew 3apumpkins 3awatermelons 3aSoutheastern United States1 aCoffey, John1 aSchmidt-Jeffris, Rebecca A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6149-53750 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2021 Sept., v. 85, no. 1 p.31-40dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl37160x0168-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-021-00658-83Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006100155245015700216520190900373592002802282650001302310650001402323650001502337650001802352650001102370650001202381653001502393653003302408653004002441653002702481653002602508653001702534700005602551773011002607856009002717852000902807655001202816IND60762291120221119113645.0220404e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076229112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1043512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasegawa, Yoshimi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1506-767310aComprehensive audio-visual environmental effects on residential soundscapes and satisfaction: Partial least square structural equation modeling approach  aVarious auditory and non-auditory factors influence soundscape experiences in urban environments. However, there is little work for revealing their comprehensive impacts as a single systematic phenomenon; thus, the specification of the predominant factors for explaining the residential soundscapes and consequential satisfaction is still unclear. This study explores the overview of the residential pleasantness-eventfulness (PL-EV) soundscape as a single comprehensive phenomenon and determines prioritized factors for the residential soundscapes and satisfaction. A structural equation modeling (SEM) of the residential soundscape was constructed using perceptive status of audio (sound sources), visual (viewing cues), and emotional (mood) factors, adjusted for demographic confounders. The model was further extended to the impact of PL-EV soundscape qualities on the residential satisfaction evaluation. The influence of the neighborhood characteristics on the constructed soundscape SEM model was subsequently examined. The results showed that the audio-visual perceptions of the traffic and natural environments were substantially important indicators on the PL soundscape, whereas none of the audio-visual indicators showed unique importance for the EV soundscape. The PL soundscape was a highly important predictor for the residential satisfaction rather than the EV soundscape. The impact of the PL-EV soundscape qualities on the residential satisfaction differed by the residents’ neighborhood characteristics; thus, the importance and performance of the PL-EV soundscape constructs consequently differed. The results of this study provide insights into the preceding audio-visual factors for the residential soundscapes and consequential satisfaction, which supports the overarching view of the theoretical soundscape models used for diagnosing the reality in the residential environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemotions 3aequations 3alandscapes 3aleast squares 3amodels 3atraffic 0aSoundscape 0aStructural equation modeling 0aImportance-performance map analysis 0aAudio-visual indicator 0aPerson-related factor 0aSatisfaction1 aLau, Siu-Kit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2357-82810 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Apr., v. 220 p.104351-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1043513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03311naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245011200175300001600287520176000303592002802063650001502091650001102106650002402117650001302141650001802154650002802172650001502200650001102215650003502226650001402261650002202275650001602297650001102313653003202324653001002356653002402366653002202390653001302412653001702425653001502442653001302457700002002470700002502490700002302515700002102538700002002559773010802579856008502687852000902772655001202781IND60654807320221118235429.0190913e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065480732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2019.07.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarnagaud, Jean-Yves10aInterspecific variations in shorebird responses to management practices on protected Mediterranean saltpans  ap. 470-479.  aTidal habitats sustain fragile ecosystems, undergoing pressures from coastal artificialization and rising sea levels. Saltpans are a substitution habitat for birds that breed, winter or stop-over along coastlands where most pristine tidal habitats have been removed. Balancing the economical, patrimonial and biodiversity values of former saltpans is thus needed to mitigate the threats posed by global changes on waterbirds. In this study, we scrutinized the influence of management practices on waterbirds on two isolated saltpans located on the French Mediterranean shore, several tens of kilometres apart from other suitable habitats. We analysed three years of bird counts for nine protected species that breed, forage and roost on these saltpans. We used a multispecies hierarchical model to relate variations in bird counts to water levels, oxygenation and salinity, the three parameters targeted by the saltpans management plan to promote bird settlement. We showed that the hypersaline conditions that dominate in these saltpans are suboptimum to most species, suggesting that waterbird concentrations are dictated by the lack of alternatives in the surrounding landscape rather than by habitat suitability. Intraspecific variations in species' responses to these variables should orient towards the creation of a habitat mosaic within the saltpans. Eventually, between-site differences in bird responses to water conditions pointed the effects of disturbance, predation and other landscape-level features. Our results reveal that high waterbird numbers on isolated saltpans may be a misleading measure of their ecological suitability, and that management on these sites needs to incorporate conflicts and complementarity in species' habitat use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aecosystems 3aforage 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3ahypersalinity 3ainterspecific variation 3alandscapes 3amodels 3anatural resources conservation 3apredation 3aprotected species 3awater birds 3awinter 0aBayesian hierarchical model 0aGulls 0aPopulation dynamics 0aRamsar convention 0aSalinity 0aWater levels 0aWaterbirds 0aWetlands1 aPapaïx, Julien1 aAudevard, Aurélien,1 aLascève, Matthieu1 aWroza, Stanislas1 aGeoffroy, David0 tBiological conservation.g2019 Sept., v. 237 p.470-479dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44607x0006-32077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.07.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02846naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245009100210300001800301520143100319592002801750596008101778596007401859596004501933596004501978650002402023650001902047650002002066650000902086650002102095650001402116650001102130650001902141700002602160700002102186700002202207773012802229856008202357852000902439655001202448IND60752368220221120055554.0211002e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075236822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-021-04676-w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPleizier, Naomi K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5255-082X14aThe lack of avoidance of total dissolved gas supersaturation in juvenile rainbow trout  ap. 4837-4850.  aWe investigated whether individual rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss; 9–53 g) avoid a potentially lethal level of total dissolved gas (TDG) supersaturation using lateral movements during an acute exposure. As there is no mechanism by which fish can detect and avoid TDG supersaturation in shallow water, we hypothesize that rainbow trout do not directly detect TDG supersaturation. Most previous studies have tested TDG avoidance in groups of fish, which may confound responses because many fishes, such as juvenile rainbow trout, display territorial behavior. We placed rainbow trout individually into a flume and allowed them to swim freely between two channels for 6 min: one channel contained water at 145% TDG and the other contained air-equilibrated water. We then switched treatments between channels and tested fish in the same way for an additional 6 min. We quantified the duration spent by fish in each channel during the last 2 min of each 6 min exposure. Fish spent a mean duration of 11s longer in 145% TDG water compared to air-equilibrated water, and the inclusion of TDG treatment as a factor improved the model of the duration spent by fish in a channel. These results indicate that fish did not avoid a potentially lethal level of TDG. This suggests that some fishes in shallow water may be unable to avoid harmful TGD supersaturation generated by events such as spilling from hydroelectric dams.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRDPJ 474297-14cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  aPGS 6564cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada  a4YF 6569cUniversity of British Columbia  aFYF 6456cUniversity of British Columbia 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aacute exposure 3adissolved gases 3afish 3ahydraulic flumes 3ajuveniles 3amodels 3aterritoriality1 aRost-Komiya, Beatrice1 aCooke, Steven J.1 aBrauner, Colin J.0 tHydrobiologia.g2021 Nov., v. 848, no. 20 p.4837-4850dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl42390x0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-021-04676-w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245011900169300001800288520163600306592002801942650002301970650004401993650001602037650002002053650001802073650002202091650001202113650001402125650001002139650001702149650001202166650000902178650002102187650001502208650001302223650001802236650002002254650001402274650001202288650002302300700002402323773009502347856008502442852000902527655001202536IND60113965720221118205539.0141112e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011396572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2011.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Mehraj10aImpact of legume seed extracts on degradation and functional properties of gelatin from unicorn leatherjacket skin  ap. 2021-2029.  aTrypsin inhibitor was extracted from the seed flour of soybean (SB; Glycine max), mung bean (MB; Vigna radiata), cowpea bean (CP; Vigna unguiculata) and adzuki bean (AB; Vigna angularis) using 0.15M NaCl, followed by heat precipitation at 70°C. The extract from SB showed the highest specific trypsin inhibitory activity, followed by those from MB, CP and AB, respectively. Based on inhibitory activity staining, molecular weights (MWs) of trypsin inhibitor from SB, MB, CP and AB were 20.1, 14, 10 and 13kDa, respectively. The SB extract powder (SBEP) containing trypsin inhibitor in the range of 10–100TIU/g effectively prevented the degradation of γ-, β- and α-chains of collagenolytic proteins of leatherjacket skin subjected to incubation at 50°C for 30min. The impact of SBEP on the extraction yield, physical and functional properties of gelatin from leatherjacket skin was investigated. The gelatin extracted in the presence of SBEP contained α₁ and α₂ chains as the predominant components with some degradation peptides. FTIR spectra indicated the significant loss of molecular order of triple helix and higher degradation was found in gelatin extracted in the absence of SBEP. Gelatin extracted in the presence of SBEP had the higher gel strength (232.8–268.5g) than that extracted in the absence of SBEP (90.4g). Higher foam stability (FS) but lower emulsion stability index (ESI) was observed in the former. Therefore, the addition of SBEP effectively prevented the degradation of gelatin from the skin of unicorn leatherjacket, thereby yielding the gelatin with improved gel strength and foam stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAluterus monoceros 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGlycine max 3aVigna angularis 3aVigna radiata 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3aemulsions 3afoams 3agel strength 3agelatin 3aheat 3amolecular weight 3amung beans 3apeptides 3aseed extracts 3asodium chloride 3asoy flour 3atrypsin 3atrypsin inhibitors1 aBenjakul, Soottawat0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Oct., v. 46, no. 10 p.2021-2029dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03669naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010000174300001600274520178100290592002802071650001902099650002602118650001102144650002202155650002802177650001302205650001802218650001602236653002102252653002302273653003802296653004802334653002502382653001002407653002802417653002502445700002202470700001502492700002102507700005802528700002302586700002002609700002602629700001802655700006802673700005702741700002002798700002102818700005902839773011102898856008503009852000903094655001203103IND60743962320221119212339.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074396232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsci.2021.06.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColloff, Matthew J.10aAdapting transformation and transforming adaptation to climate change using a pathways approach  ap. 163-174.  aHuman actions have driven earth systems close to irreversible and profound change. The need to shift towards intentional transformative adaptation (ITA) is clear. Using case studies from the Transformative Adaptation Research Alliance (TARA), we explore ITA as a way of thinking and acting that is transformative in concept and objectives, but achieved through a mix of incremental and transformative co-production processes that ultimately lead to the social-ecological system being transformed. Central to ITA are social and political issues of how individuals and collectives address environmental and social change and deal with power imbalances. ITA approaches are claimed to help overcome adaptation challenges, including: 1) re-framing human-nature relationships; 2) dealing with uncertainty; 3) engendering empowerment and agency and 4) addressing conflicting values and interests. However, it is unclear if these approaches work in practice. We examined six adaptation case studies in which participants used processes of: 1) co-producing visions of the future; 2) re-framing values, rules and knowledge to shift decision contexts for adaptation and 3) implementing actions using theories of change and adaptation pathways. We assessed the extent to which participants could use these processes to address their adaptation challenges. We found evidence of many positive achievements towards the implementation of ITA, but also examples where processes were not working, such as communities having difficulties in finding ways to work co-operatively. Different processes will be needed to address these issues, such as promoting pluralism, knowledge contestation, and deliberative re-politicisation of the adaptation agenda to shift power imbalances and enable change.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aenvironmental science 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amulticultural diversity 3apolitics 3asocial change 3auncertainty 0aDecision context 0aAdaptation pathway 0aValues, rules and knowledge (VRK) 0aNature’s contribution to adaptation (NCA) 0aStructure and agency 0aPower 0aKnowledge co-production 0aKnowledge governance1 aGorddard, Russell1 aAbel, Nick1 aLocatelli, Bruno1 aWyborn, Carina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4314-347X1 aButler, James R.A.1 aLavorel, Sandra1 aVan Kerkhoff, Lorrae,1 aMeharg, Seona1 aMúnera-Roldán, Claudia1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0601-23121 aBruley, Enora1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3416-18681 aFedele, Giacomo1 aWise, Russell M.1 aDunlop, Michael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8032-91960 tEnvironmental science & policy.g2021 Oct., v. 124 p.163-174dElsevier LtdwJournal:12413x1462-90117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2021.06.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03178naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245010200162300001800264500000900282520188300291592002802174650002102202650002802223650001602251650002602267650002402293650002502317650002702342650002902369650001802398650002202416650000902438650001302447650003102460650002702491700002202518773014002540852000902680856007902689655001202768IND4443811520221120071716.0191228e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444381152DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj2009.03982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRedwan, Mostafa10aSimultaneous Monitoring of Water Saturation and Fluid Conductivity in Unconsolidated Sand Columns  ap. 1457-1468.  aepub  aElectrical conductivity can easily be measured, but interpretation is ambiguous since saturation, fluid conductivity, and material properties are interacting parameters. This study aims to indirectly obtain fluid conductivity evolution in time and space in column experiments by repetitively applying two independent non-destructive multi-level methods. Water saturation, is derived from the difference in x-ray attenuation by dry, partially and fully saturated sand filled columns. Also, it is used to calculate fluid conductivity from the electrical conductivity in time intervals for each depth level in the column. The investigated columns show distinct patterns for water saturation, electrical conductivity, and calculated fluid conductivity for individual imbibition and drainage steps at distinct grain-size distributions. During imbibition, the unsaturated capillary fringe head shows a very unusual increase in electrical conductivity gaining with each step of capillary rise. During the drainage cycle, the electrical conductivity peak broadens and moves downward. The calculated fluid conductivities are much higher than expected, but correspond well to conductivity and ion strength of the extracted fluids. The strong increase in electrical conductivity was attributed to the fast rising capillary head fluids, which quickly accumulated all available ions around the particles and moved upward. The slow water was depleted, and showed even a different ion distribution pattern due to slowly reacting minerals. Monitoring of fluid conductivity in time and space by non-destructive methods provides access to enrichment–depletion processes in the critical zone, in the laboratory and in the field. This is essential for understanding the development of hardpans in natural and anthropogenic environments, causing eventually supergene economic enrichment of metals.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapillary fringe 3aelectrical conductivity 3acapillarity 3alaboratory techniques 3aexperimental design 3asaturated conditions 3aunsaturated conditions 3ainfiltration (hydrology) 3aparticle size 3aspatial variation 3asand 3adrainage 3aparticle size distribution 3anondestructive methods1 aRammlmair, Dieter0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g2010 Sept., v. 74, no. 5 p.1457-1468dSoil Science SocietywJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2009.03983Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02727naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245009700165300001800262520149600280592002801776650002701804650002301831650000901854650001001863650001001873650001401883650001101897650002501908650001701933650001301950650002001963650003001983650001902013650001002032650001402042700001802056700001702074700002002091773011802111856005502229852000902284655001202293IND4396400820221119155305.0150424e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439640082DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03414.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaur, S.10aListeria monocytogenes in spontaneous abortions in humans and its detection by multiplex PCR  ap. 1889-1896.  aAim: To assess the extent of Listeria monocytogenes in causation of human spontaneous abortions by isolation methods and PCR analysis for the presence of virulenceâassociated genes. Methods and Results: A total of 305 samples comprising blood, urine, placental bits, faecal and vaginal swabs were collected from 61 patients with spontaneous abortions. Listeria spp. were isolated from 10 samples collected from nine (14Â·8%) patients. Confirmation of these isolates was based on biochemical tests, haemolysis on blood agar, CAMP test, phosphatidylinositolâspecific phospholipase C (PIâPLC) assay followed by in vivo pathogenicity tests and multiplex PCR to detect virulenceâassociated genes (prfA, plcA, hlyA, actA and iap). Three isolates were confirmed as L. monocytogenes. Of these, two isolates turned out to be pathogenic and found to posses all five genes. However, the remaining two haemolytic L. monocytogenes isolates lacking the plcA gene and activity in the PIâPLC assay were found to be nonpathogenic by in vivo tests. Conclusions: The occurrence of pathogenic L. monocytogenes in cases of spontaneous abortions was 3Â·3%. It seems that the plcA gene and its expression have an important role as essential virulence determinants in pathogenic Listeria spp. Significance and Impact of the Study: The recovery of pathogenic L. monocytogenes isolates from cases of spontaneous abortion indicates the significance of listeric infection in pregnant women.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aabortion (animals) 3aagar 3ablood 3agenes 3ahemolysis 3ahumans 3aisolation techniques 3amicrobiology 3apatients 3aphospholipase C 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apregnant women 3aurine 3avirulence1 aMalik, S.V.S.1 aVaidya, V.M.1 aBarbuddhe, S.B.0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2007 Nov., v. 103, no. 5 p.1889-1896dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03414.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02934naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010100160520176300261592002802024650001702052650002102069650001502090650001602105650002602121651002102147700002302168700001702191700001902208700001702227700002102244700002102265700001802286700001902304700002002323773012302343856007302466852000902539655001202548IND60742511320221119030234.0210624e20210604xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074251132DNAL7 a10.3390/d130602482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhite, Thomas H.10aQuantifying Threats to Biodiversity and Prioritizing Responses: An Example from Papua New Guinea  aAccurately identifying threats to global biodiversity is the first step towards effectively countering or ameliorating them. However, such threats are usually only qualitatively categorized, without any comparative quantitative assessment of threat levels either within or across ecosystems. As part of recent efforts in Papua New Guinea to develop a long-term strategic plan for reducing threats to biodiversity at the national level, we developed a novel and quantitative method for not only assessing relative effects of specific biodiversity threats across multiple ecosystems, but also identifying and prioritizing conservation actions best suited for countering identified threats. To do so, we used an abbreviated quantitative SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis and multivariate cluster analysis to identify the most significant threats to biodiversity in Papua New Guinea. Of 27 specific threats identified, there were nine major threats (each >5% of total) which accounted for approximately 72% of the total quantified biodiversity threat in Papua New Guinea. We then used the information to identify underlying crosscutting threat drivers and specific conservation actions that would have the greatest probability of reducing biodiversity threats across multiple ecosystem realms. We categorized recommended actions within three strategic categories; with actions within each category targeting two different spatial scales. Our integrated quantitative approach to identifying and addressing biodiversity threats is intuitive, comprehensive, repeatable and computationally simple. Analyses of this nature can be invaluable for avoiding not only wasted resources, but also ineffective measures for conserving biodiversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acluster analysis 3aecosystems 3aprobability 3aquantitative analysis 3aPapua New Guinea1 aBickley, Patricia 1 aBrown, Cory 1 aBusch, Dave E.1 aDutson, Guy 1 aFreifeld, Holly 1 aKrofta, Douglas 1 aLawlor, Sean 1 aPolhemus, Dan 1 aRounds, Rachel 0 tDiversity.g2021 June 04, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130602483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02794naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010500168500002200273520137500295592002801670650002701698650002201725650001401747650001201761650002801773650001101801650001201812650001601824650001301840650001101853650001201864653001101876653002701887653001601914653001801930653002601948700001801974700001301992700001202005700001602017700001202033700001702045700001702062700001802079773009602097856008602193852000902279655001202288IND60584142420221122225040.0171024s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058414242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.1012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jing10aProteolytic activation of Bacillus thuringiensis Vip3Aa protein by Spodoptera exigua midgut protease  aPre-press version  aProteolysis of Vip3Aa by insect midgut proteases is essential for their toxicity against target insects. In the present study, proteolysis of Vip3Aa was evaluated by Spodoptera exigua midgut proteases (MJ). Trypsin was verified involved in the activation of Vip3Aa and three potential cleavage sites (Lys195, Lys197 and Lys198) were identified. Four Vip3Aa mutants (KKK195197198AAA, KK197198AA, KK195198AA and KK195197AA) were designed and constructed by replacing residues Lys195,197,198, Lys197,198, Lys195,198 and Lys195,197 with Ala, respectively. Proteolytic processing assays revealed that mutants KK197198AA, KK195198AA and KK195197AA could be processed into 66kDa activated toxins by trypsin or MJ while mutant KKK195197198AAA was not cleaved by trypsin and less susceptible to MJ. Bioassays demonstrated that mutants KK197198AA, KK195198AA and KK195197AA were toxic against S. exigua resembled that of wild-type Vip3Aa, however, the LC50 of mutant KKK195197198AAA against S. exigua was higher than wild-type. Those results suggested that proteolysis by MJ was associated with the insecticidal toxicity of Vip3Aa against S. exigua. It also revealed that trypsin played an important role in the formation of Vip3Aa activated toxin. Our studies characterized the proteolytic processing of Vip3Aa and provided new insight into the activation of this novel Bt toxin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aSpodoptera exigua 3abioassays 3ainsects 3alethal concentration 50 3amidgut 3amutants 3aproteolysis 3atoxicity 3atoxins 3atrypsin 0aVip3Aa 0aBacillus thuringiensis 0aproteolysis 0acleavage site 0ainsecticidal toxicity1 aPan, Zhi-Zhen1 aXu, Lian1 aLiu, Bo1 aChen, Zheng1 aLi, Jie1 aNiu, Li-Yang1 aZhu, Yu-Jing1 aChen, Qing-Xi0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2017.09.1013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03304naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100006000187245015300247300001600400506007600416520146800492536011901960592002802079506003702107650002802144650002602172650002102198650001302219650003102232650002102263650001102284650002302295650002502318650001002343650002002353650001302373650001702386650001402403650004302417653003902460700001602499700002102515700003102536773014202567856008002709852000902789655001202798IND60662473820221207083933.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066247382DNAL7 a10.1177/10406387198616862doi7 aPMC67271252pmcid7 a312461622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehinagic, Kemal1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4089-202610aCoinfection of Swiss cattle with bovine parainfluenza virus 3 and Mycoplasma bovis at acute and chronic stages of bovine respiratory disease complex  ap. 674-680.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aViral agents such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPIV-3) are considered primary infectious agents in bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC). Information regarding the pathogenesis of BRDC is scarce, especially at an advanced chronicity stage, in addition to ongoing coinfection with other primary agents such as Mycoplasma bovis. Based on a retrospective review of histology slides from 104 autopsy cases, we classified cases according to type of pneumonia and chronicity. We performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for BRSV, BPIV-3, and M. bovis as well as real-time PCR (rtPCR) for M. bovis on lung tissue of all 104 cases and correlated results with the morphologic type of pneumonia. Histomorphologically, 79 cases were classified as bronchopneumonia, 16 as bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and 9 as interstitial pneumonia. In 89 cases, at least 1 of the investigated agents was detected by IHC; 44 of these cases had a coinfection. BPIV-3 was the predominant agent present, as a single infection in 39 cases, and in coinfection with M. bovis in 39 cases. Comparing the detection methods for M. bovis, rtPCR was more specific and sensitive than IHC. The combination of both methods provided a good visual tool for assessing severity and distribution of M. bovis antigen within the tissue. Unlike BRSV, BPIV-3 and M. bovis persisted in chronic BRDC, suggesting ongoing impairment of defense mechanisms in the lung.  aFunding We thank the Specialization Committee of the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Bern, for financial support.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBovine orthopneumovirus 3aBovine respirovirus 3 3aMycoplasma bovis 3aantigens 3abovine respiratory disease 3abronchopneumonia 3acattle 3adefense mechanisms 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alungs 3amixed infection 3anecropsy 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 0abovine respiratory disease complex1 aPilo, Paola1 aVidondo, Beatriz1 aStokar-Regenscheit, Nadine0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g2019 Sept., v. 31, no. 5 p.674-680dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1943-49367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10406387198616863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03158naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245008000171300001800251520155100269592002801820650001101848650002201859650001301881650002801894650001301922650001001935650002201945650001301967650001301980650001501993650000902008650002102017650002502038650001402063650002202077650001302099650001602112650002602128650001402154653001602168653001202184653001702196653001702213653001402230700002502244700002302269700002002292700002602312700002302338773013702361856008502498852000902583655001202592IND60619786520221122193040.0190416e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061978652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.funbio.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAylward, Janneke10aGenomic overview of closely related fungi with different Protea host ranges  ap. 1201-1214.  aGenome comparisons of species with distinctive ecological traits can elucidate genetic divergence that influenced their differentiation. The interaction of a microorganism with its biotic environment is largely regulated by secreted compounds, and these can be predicted from genome sequences. In this study, we considered Knoxdaviesia capensis and Knoxdaviesia proteae, two closely related saprotrophic fungi found exclusively in Protea plants. We investigated their genome structure to compare their potential inter-specific interactions based on gene content. Their genomes displayed macrosynteny and were approximately 10 % repetitive. Both species had fewer secreted proteins than pathogens and other saprotrophs, reflecting their specialized habitat. The bulk of the predicted species-specific and secreted proteins coded for carbohydrate metabolism, with a slightly higher number of unique carbohydrate-degrading proteins in the broad host-range K. capensis. These fungi have few secondary metabolite gene clusters, suggesting minimal competition with other microbes and symbiosis with antibiotic-producing bacteria common in this niche. Secreted proteins associated with detoxification and iron sequestration likely enable these Knoxdaviesia species to tolerate antifungal compounds and compete for resources, facilitating their unusual dominance. This study confirms the genetic cohesion between Protea-associated Knoxdaviesia species and reveals aspects of their ecology that have likely evolved in response to their specialist niche.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtea 3aantifungal agents 3abacteria 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acohesion 3afungi 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahabitats 3ahost range 3airon 3amultigene family 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3aprotein secretion 3aproteins 3asaprotrophs 3asecondary metabolites 3asymbiosis 0aCompetition 0aGenomes 0aInteractions 0aKnoxdaviesia 0aSecretome1 aWingfield, Brenda D.1 aDreyer, Léanne L.1 aRoets, Francois1 aWingfield, Michael J.1 aSteenkamp, Emma T.0 tFungal biology.g2018 Dec., v. 122, no. 12 p.1201-1214dElsevier LtdaBritish Mycological SocietywJournal:jnl43377x1878-61467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2018.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245017500166300001800341520220100359592002802560650001402588650001302602650002302615650002202638650001202660650002302672650002602695700001402721773010502735856008602840852000902926655001202935IND60578091220221122043104.0170811e20150811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057809122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b013112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Shangyi10aOrientation of Azobenzene Mesogens in Side-Chain Liquid Crystalline Polymers: Interplay between Effects of Mechanical Stretching, Photoisomerization and Thermal Annealing  ap. 5088-5098.  aThe interplay of the mechanically and optically induced orientation of azobenzene mesogens as well as the effect of thermal annealing was investigated for both a side-chain liquid crystalline polymer (SCLCP) and a diblock copolymer comprising two SCLCPs bearing azobenzene and biphenyl mesogens, respectively. Typically, the polymer film was first subjected to stretching in either nematic or smectic phase to yield orientation of azobenzene mesogens either parallel or perpendicular to the strain direction, then exposed to unpolarized UV light to erase the mechanically induced orientation upon the trans–cis isomerization, followed by linearly polarized visible light for photoinduced reorientation as a result of the cis–trans backisomerization, and finally heated to different liquid crystalline phases for thermal annealing. The change in orientation was monitored by means of infrared dichroism. The results have unveiled complex and different orientational behaviors for the homopolymer of poly{6-[4-(4-methoxyphenylazo)phenoxy]hexyl methacrylate} (PAzMA) and the diblock copolymer of poly{6-[4-(4-methoxyphenylazo)phenoxy]hexyl methacrylate}-block-poly{6-[4-(4-cyanophenyl)phenoxy]hexyl methacrylate} (PAzMA-PBiPh). In particular, the stretching-induced orientation of the homopolymer exerts no memory effect on the photoinduced reorientation, the direction of which is determined by the polarization of the visible light regardless of the mechanically induced orientation direction in the stretched film. Moreover, subsequent thermal annealing in the nematic phase leads to parallel orientation independently of the initial mechanically or photoinduced orientation direction. In contrast, the diblock copolymer displays a strong orientation memory effect. Regardless of the condition used, either for photoinduced reorientation or thermal annealing in the liquid crystalline phase, only the initial stretching-induced perpendicular orientation of azobenzene mesogens can be recovered. The reported findings provide new insight into the different orientation mechanisms, and help understanding the important issue of orientation induction and control in azobenzene-containing SCLCPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3abiphenyl 3acomposite polymers 3afilms (materials) 3aliquids 3aphotoisomerization 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZhao, Yue0 tMacromolecules.g2015 Aug. 11, v. 48, no. 15 p.5088-5098dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b013113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245015800170300001600328520150000344592002801844650001501872650001601887650001801903650002101921650001701942650001601959650001901975650001601994650001602010650002302026650003002049650001402079650001302093650002602106650001402132650000902146650001402155650001702169650000902186650001702195650001702212650001102229651001702240700001502257700001702272700002502289773013402314856008302448852000902531655001202540IND60660377420221121210409.0190919e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066037742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-019-01710-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarmichael, P.

This study evaluated the diversity of microbial communities associated with naturally present Botrytis cinerea inoculum, with special emphasis on populations of potential biocontrol yeasts during berry development in table grapes. Samples were collected from two agro-ecological habitats in South Africa (Northern Province), characterised by low rainfall (site A) and high rainfall (site B). The phenological development samples included those at full bloom, pea size and mature berry stages. Within the group of yeasts known to be natural antagonists, Aureobasidium, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces could be cultured, while pathogenic fungal genera from asymptomatic samples included Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Aspergillus. Botrytis cinerea could only be cultured at the harvest stage from symptomatic and asymptomatic berries. Overall, the study showed the highest prevalence of Alternaria (35.6%), Cladosporium (27.2%) and Rhodoturula (21.2%). In conclusion, the study reveals a diverse pathogenic and beneficial naturally-known yeast genera in the presence of B. cinerea. Such information and knowledge can be further explored to manipulate potential antagonistic populations to prevent establishment of pathogenic populations and secure dominance of antagonistic populations at the harvest stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aAspergillus 3aAureobasidium 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aCladosporium 3aRhodotorula 3aSporobolomyces 3aagroecology 3aantagonists 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aflowering 3ainoculum 3amicrobial communities 3apathogens 3apeas 3aphenology 3aphyllosphere 3arain 3asmall fruits 3atable grapes 3ayeasts 3aSouth Africa1 aSiyoum, N.1 aChidamba, L.1 aKorsten, L.q(Lise),0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2019 Aug., v. 154, no. 4 p.919-930dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl51791x0929-18737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-019-01710-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245012900162300002000291520156700311592002801878650002401906650002801930650001101958650001401969650001301983650001101996650002502007700002702032700002002059700002302079773014402102856007402246852000902320655001202329IND60701766020221119111247.0200715e20200714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070176602DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03841e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Tribhuwan10aUltralow thermal conductivity and high thermoelectric figure of merit in mixed valence In₅X₅Br (X = S, and Se) compounds  ap. 13812-13819.  aDiscovering a material with a combination of high electrical conductivity, high thermopower, and low lattice thermal conductivity is crucial for designing efficient thermoelectric materials. Here, we show that a perfect balance of these properties can be realized in In₅X₅Br (X = S and Se) compounds, where indium simultaneously exists in three different oxidation states (In¹⁺, In²⁺ and In³⁺). The presence of multiple charge carrier pockets near the band edge results in a high thermopower of 250–300 μV K⁻¹ for both p- and n-type doping over a wide range of carrier concentrations and temperatures. Furthermore, our calculations find an exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.55 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ and 1.1 W m⁻¹ K⁻¹ for In₅Se₅Br and In₅S₅Br at room temperature, respectively. This ultralow lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to In¹⁺, which is very weakly bound in the lattice. These In¹⁺ atoms are located in a flat potential well and exhibit large mean square displacements demonstrating the strong anharmonic behavior. The strong anharmonicity was further confirmed by the large negative Grüneisen parameters. Remarkably, these compounds possess a rare combination of low thermal conductivity and high thermopower leading to an exceptionally high ZT of ∼2.4 and 2.7 for n-type In₅S₅Br and In₅Se₅Br, respectively, at high temperatures. The insights obtained from this work suggest an opportunity to discover efficient thermoelectric materials among other unexplored mixed valence compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectrical conductivity 3aindium 3aoxidation 3aselenium 3asulfur 3athermal conductivity1 aNissimagoudar, Arun S.1 aMishra, Avanish1 aSingh, Abhishek K.0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 14, v. 8, no. 27 p.13812-13819dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03841e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245011200156520113600268592002801404650002101432650001701453650002601470650001101496650003601507650004601543650004301589650001601632650003701648650004401685650002201729650002001751651001801771700001301789700002101802700002001823773012601843856007401969852000902043655001202052IND60707873320221118035712.0200821e20200724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070787332DNAL7 a10.3390/md180803852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYi, Wenwen 10aNew Antifungal Metabolites from the Mariana Trench Sediment-Associated Actinomycete Streptomyces sp.

These MSUs allow AQ measurements in many new applications, such as ambulatory exposure analyses and citizen science. Typically, the performance of these devices is assessed using the mean error or correlation coefficients with respect to a laboratory equipment. However, these criteria do not represent how such sensors perform outside of laboratory conditions in large-scale field applications, and do not cover all aspects of possible differences in performance between the sensor-based and standardized equipment, or changes in performance over time. This paper presents a comprehensive Sensor Evaluation Toolbox (SET) for evaluating AQ MSUs by a range of criteria, to better assess their performance in varied applications and environments. Within the SET are included four new schemes for evaluating sensors' capability to: locate pollution sources; represent the pollution level on a coarse scale; capture the high temporal variability of the observed pollutant and their reliability. Each of the evaluation criteria allows for assessing sensors' performance in a different way, together constituting a holistic evaluation of the suitability and usability of the sensors in a wide range of applications. Application of the SET on measurements acquired by 25 MSUs deployed in eight cities across Europe showed that the suggested schemes facilitates a comprehensive cross platform analysis that can be used to determine and compare the sensors' performance. The SET was implemented in R and the code is available on the first author's website.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aair quality 3acities 3acommunications technology 3acorrelation 3aexposure assessment 3alaboratory equipment 3apollutants 3atemporal variation 3aEurope 0aAir quality 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aMicro sensing units 0aWireless distributed sensor network 0aSensors performance1 aLerner, Uri1 aCastell, Nuria1 aCole-Hunter, Tom1 aPopoola, Olalekan1 aBroday, David M.1 aIñiguez, Tania Martinez1 aNieuwenhuijsen, Mark1 aJovasevic-Stojanovic, Milena1 aTopalovic, Dusan1 aJones, Roderic L.1 aGalea, Karen S.1 aEtzion, Yael1 aKizel, Fadi1 aGolumbic, Yaela N.1 aBaram-Tsabari, Ayelet1 aYacobi, Tamar1 aDrahler, Dana1 aRobinson, Johanna A.1 aKocman, David1 aHorvat, Milena1 aSvecova, Vlasta1 aArpaci, Alexander1 aBartonova, Alena0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 575 p.639-648dElsevier B.V.aElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02482naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245010800174300001600282520123700298592002801535650001901563650001701582650003101599650001101630650001501641650001101656650001301667651001001680653001901690653001201709653001501721653001301736700002201749700002201771700002001793700002601813773013801839856008601977852000902063655001202072IND60730367120221120074243.0211117e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073036712DNAL7 a10.1080/10888705.2020.18572522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarliani, Giovanna10aEvaluation of Horses’ Daytime Activity Budget in a Model of Ethological Stable: A Case Study in Italy  ap. 200-213.  aThe increasing interest in animal welfare and the knowledge of equine physiological and ethological needs have led to the development of different types of horses’ management and housing systems. The research presented here aimed to assess the daytime activity budget of horses. Focal animal sampling was used as an observational sampling method, and the five animals were observed for a total of 9920 minutes in the paddock and inside the stall. The results showed that horses spent most of the daytime in foraging behaviors, followed by resting behaviors, and locomotion. Social behaviors (s.e. allogrooming, olfactory investigation) were rare, and the stereotypic behaviors (s.e. oral and locomotor stereotypies) occupied 2.74%±2.74% of the total time. The percentage of time spent in foraging, resting, and locomotion, reflects the activity budget observed in free-roaming feral horses. However, the rare occurrence of positive social interactions and the presence of some stereotypies could be aspects to ameliorate. This kind of housing facility could be considered a good alternative to traditional management; indeed, it might offer a better trade-off between the needs of the horse and the management goals from humans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal welfare 3acase studies 3agrooming (animal behavior) 3ahorses 3alocomotion 3amodels 3apastures 3aItaly 0aEquus caballus 0awelfare 0amanagement 0abehavior1 aSprocatti, Ilaria1 aSchiavoni, Giulia1 aBellodi, Andrea1 aAccorsi, Pier Attilio0 tJournal of applied animal welfare science.g2021 Apr. 03, v. 24, no. 2 p.200-213dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56472x1532-76047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10888705.2020.18572523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003800140245011300178300002000291520156300311592002801874650001401902650002301916650002101939650001801960650001401978650001901992650001802011650002202029650001202051700002402063700002202087700002302109700002102132773014402153856007402297852000902371655001202380IND60701766120221119111218.0200715e20200714xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070176612DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ta03898a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbdelkader-Fernández, Víctor K.10aAdvanced framework-modified POM@ZIF-67 nanocomposites as enhanced oxygen evolution reaction electrocatalysts  ap. 13509-13521.  aThe smart assembly of Co-containing polyoxometalates (POMs) and Co-based zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-67) is a promising tool to produce active electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The encapsulation of SiW₁₁Co inside ZIF-67 cavities via ‘in situ’ synthesis produced two novel POM@ZIF-67 nanocomposites with low and high POM loadings—SiW₁₁Co@ZIF-67 and SiW₁₁Co[h]@ZIF-67, respectively. Other materials involving the analogue tri-substituted silicotungstate, SiW₉Co₃@ZIF-67 and SiW₉Co₃[h]@ZIF-67, have been prepared for comparison reasons. Regardless of the POM substitution degree, we demonstrated that the bidirectional synergistic POM-ZIF-67 interaction found for the already reported material, SiW₉Co₃@ZIF-67, is applicable to the other first-time prepared nanocomposites. Remarkably, this synergy is radically enhanced in the case of the two high POM loading samples, with these nanostructured materials being very active OER electrocatalysts, exhibiting 150–160 mV decreased overpotentials and much faster kinetics (∼35% decreased Tafel slopes) in relation to pristine ZIF-67. Moreover, they reveal intrinsic OER activities higher than those developed by the expensive commercial references (RuO₂ and IrO₂ powders) especially in the case of SiW₉Co₃[h]@ZIF-67. This important electrocatalytic improvement can be related to the higher POM loadings achieved, as well as to the formation of an open defect-enriched phase wrapping the ‘standard’ ZIF-67 framework in these nanomaterials.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aelectrochemistry 3aencapsulation 3aimidazole 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aoxygen production 3apowders1 aFernandes, Diana M.1 aBalula, Salete S.1 aCunha-Silva, Luís1 aFreire, Cristina0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2020 July 14, v. 8, no. 27 p.13509-13521dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ta03898a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03048naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245018700159520147400346592002801820650002101848650002901869650002401898650001401922650001601936650001501952650001501967650001501982650001801997650002202015650002802037650002602065650001102091650001702102650001102119650002102130650003402151650001902185650002202204650001302226650002802239650001102267650001302278700002102291700002102312773012602333856007402459852000902533655001202542IND60707873420221118035821.0200821e20200725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070787342DNAL7 a10.3390/md180803872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Chao-Wen 10aProtective Effect of Astaxanthin on Blue Light Light-Emitting Diode-Induced Retinal Cell Damage via Free Radical Scavenging and Activation of PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 Pathway in 661W Cell Model  aLight-emitting diodes (LEDs) are widely used and energy-efficient light sources in modern life that emit higher levels of short-wavelength blue light. Excessive blue light exposure may damage the photoreceptor cells in our eyes. Astaxanthin, a xanthophyll that is abundantly available in seafood, is a potent free radical scavenger and anti-inflammatory agent. We used a 661W photoreceptor cell line to investigate the protective effect of astaxanthin on blue light LED-induced retinal injury. The cells were treated with various concentrations of astaxanthin and then exposed to blue light LED. Our results showed that pretreatment with astaxanthin inhibited blue light LED-induced cell apoptosis and prevented cell death. Moreover, the protective effect was concentration dependent. Astaxanthin suppressed the production of reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress biomarkers and diminished mitochondrial damage induced by blue light exposure. Western blot analysis confirmed that astaxanthin activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, induced the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, and increased the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes. The expression of antioxidant enzymes and the suppression of apoptosis-related proteins eventually protected the 661W cells against blue light LED-induced cell damage. Thus, our results demonstrated that astaxanthin exerted a dose-dependent protective effect on photoreceptor cells against damage mediated by blue light LED exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWestern blotting 3aanti-inflammatory agents 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapoptosis 3aastaxanthin 3abiomarkers 3ablue light 3acell lines 3adose response 3aenergy efficiency 3afree radical scavengers 3alight emitting diodes 3alutein 3amitochondria 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3aphotoreceptors 3aprotective effect 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3aretina 3aseafoods1 aYang, Chung-May 1 aYang, Chang-Hao 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 July 25, v. 18, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180803873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01294naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245010600164300001800270520022100288592002800509650002300537650002300560650002100583650001100604700001700615700002300632700002700655700001900682700002200701700002300723773012900746856007200875852000900947655001200956IND60658130120221118210640.0190816e20071017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065813012DNAL7 a10.1039/b707458a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAakeröy, Christer B.10aCombining halogen bonds and hydrogen bonds in the modular assembly of heteromeric infinite 1-D chains  ap. 4236-4238.  aHydrogen bonds and halogen bonds operate in concert in the directed assembly of infinite 1-D chains in binary co-crystals of iodine iso-nicotinamide (2 : 2), 1 and tetrafluorodiiodobenzene iso-nicotinamide (1 : 2) 2.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen bonding 3aiodine1 aDesper, John1 aHelfrich, Brian A.1 aMetrangolo, Pierangelo1 aPilati, Tullio1 aResnati, Giuseppe1 aStevenazzi, Andrea0 tChemical communications.g2007 Oct. 17, , no. 41 p.4236-4238dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b707458a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245020300166300001600369520127800385592002801663650001601691650001201707650001601719650001201735650001701747650001301764650001101777650001001788650001201798650000901810650001001819650001401829650001201843650002001855650001901875650001101894650001401905650000901919650002001928650000901948651001901957653002201976653001701998653002002015653002002035653002502055700005702080700002802137700001402165700001602179773011902195856008802314852000902402655001202411IND60556803120221119224801.0190516e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055680312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jun10aTrace element concentrations, risks and their correlation with metallothionein genes polymorphism: A case study of narrow-ridged finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) in the East China Sea  ap. 628-638.  aThe concentration of trace elements (TEs) and their risk to narrow-ridged finless porpoises (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis) are still unclear. The present study determined the concentration of typical TEs in liver, kidney, and muscle tissues from porpoises in the East China Sea, assessed potential health risk of TEs to porpoises, and explored the relationship between TE concentration and metallothionein genes (MTs) polymorphism. It was found that Zn, Cu, Mn, Cd and Hg were highly accumulated in liver, and Cd was highly accumulated in kidney. The concentrations of Cr, As, Pb and Ni were very low in all three tissues. TE concentrations showed significant positive correlation with body length, and sexual variation. The levels of most TEs were higher in tissues of porpoises in Ningbo and Nantong than in Pingtan, which is likely related to the local environment pollution level. The risk assessment showed that porpoises from Nantong and Ningbo could face health risks due to Hg, As, Cd, Pb, and Cr exposure. Moreover, two polymorphic sites on the MT4 gene were found to be significantly associated with increased levels of Hg, Cd, Zn and Mn. Whether these two polymorphic sites are involved in expression of MTs, or other functional processes, needs further research.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeophocaena 3aarsenic 3abody length 3acadmium 3acase studies 3achromium 3acopper 3agenes 3akidneys 3alead 3aliver 3amanganese 3amercury 3ametallothionein 3amuscle tissues 3anickel 3apollution 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3azinc 3aEast China Sea 0aFinless porpoises 0aHeavy metals 0aMetallothionein 0aRisk assessment 0aTissue trace element1 aChen, Bingyao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0393-53411 aJefferson, Thomas Allen1 aWang, Hui1 aYang, Guang0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 575 p.628-638dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003200149245011800181520122600299592002801525650002801553650002401581650001301605650001601618650002401634650002201658650000901680650001401689650002001703650002001723650001401743650001701757650001401774653000801788653000701796653000701803653000801810653000801818653000701826653000801833653000901841653000901850653001101859653001401870653001201884653001501896653001301911653001501924700002101939700003201960700003401992773010002026856008402126852000902210655001202219IND60685020220221118023815.0201024e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068502022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1003032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGruli Barbosa, Lívia Maria10aEffect of environmental thermal fluctuations on innate immune responses in pacu Piaractus mesopotamicus juveniles  aImmune functions in teleosts are straightly influenced by environmental temperature. Low temperatures usually affect negatively the immune status of fishes favoring the incidence of diseases. Immune cells in fishes are protected from peroxidation by dietary vitamin E. Innate immune defenses of Piaractus mesopotamicus were evaluated in fish fed with diets supplemented with vitamin E for 45 days. The fish endured decreases in environmental fluctuations of temperature for 24 and 72 h. The most effects were observed at the 24th hour, in which the level of plasma cortisol increased independently of dietary supplement of vitamin E and a lessening of MNL and a raise of GL counting were observed in fish fed with supplemented diets. The lowest SL variation was observed in fish fed with the maximum level of vitamin E, but the dietary vitamin E decreased the HAC. However, the stressing condition increased HAC. Dietary vitamin E used in the present experimental conditions did not present remarkable effects on the immune frame of pacu to cope with environmental thermal fluctuations but other investigations concerning the vitamin half-life and its association with unsaturated dietary lipids seem to be fundamental.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPiaractus mesopotamicus 3aambient temperature 3acortisol 3adietary fat 3adietary supplements 3adisease incidence 3afish 3ahalf life 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ajuveniles 3aperoxidation 3avitamin E 0aMNL 0aGL 0aSL 0aHAC 0aROS 0aOD 0aTEA 0aEDTA 0aEGTA 0aStress 0aVitamin E 0aTeleost 0aComplement 0aLysozyme 0aLeukocytes1 aMoraes, Gilberto1 ade Freitas Anibal, Fernanda1 aMarzocchi-Machado, Cleni Mara0 tAquaculture reports.g2020 July, v. 17 p.100303-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2020.1003033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245003800177300001400215520104500229592002801274650002601302650001901328650002001347650001901367650001601386650002201402650001701424650001001441650004201451650000901493650001701502650001501519650001801534650001501552650001401567653001601581653001701597653003101614653001701645653002801662700002401690700001901714773009301733856008601826852000901912655001201921IND60610958520221119181902.0190712e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061095852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.04.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinroth, Margaret D.10aGenetics and microbiology of meat  ap. 15-21.  aDetection, reduction, and public health monitoring of foodborne pathogens has advanced in precision and efficiency as technology has progressed.

Atherosclerosis, in particular, is a progressive, chronic inflammatory cardiovascular disease caused by persistent damage to blood vessels due to elevated cholesterol levels and hyperlipidemia. This condition is characterized by an increase in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein, and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein. Although existing therapies with hypolipidemic effects can improve the living standards of patients with cardiovascular diseases, the drugs currently used in clinical practice have certain side effects, which insists on the need for the development of new types of drugs with lipid-lowering effects. Some marine-derived substances have proven hypolipidemic activities with fewer side effects and stand as a good alternative for drug development. Recently, there have been thousands of studies on substances with lipid-lowering properties of marine origin, and some are already implemented in clinical practice. Here, we summarize the active components of marine-derived products having a hypolipidemic effect. These active constituents according to their source are divided into algal, animal, plant and microbial and contribute to the development and utilization of marine medicinal products with hypolipidemic effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aalgae 3aanimals 3aatherosclerosis 3ablood serum 3ablood vessels 3acholesterol 3adrug development 3adrugs 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahyperlipidemia 3alipemic effect 3alow density lipoprotein 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3atriacylglycerols1 aCao, Qi 1 aXing, Maochen 1 aXiao, Han 1 aCheng, Zeyu 1 aSong, Shuliang 1 aJi, Aiguo 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 July 27, v. 18, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180803903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03403naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245008200168520173500250592002801985650002302013650002502036650001302061650001202074650001702086650001002103650001102113650000902124650001802133650001202151650001402163650002402177650001902201650001402220650001102234653002502245653004702270653004202317653003102359700002502390700001802415700002102433700002302454700002402477700002502501700002502526700002702551700001802578700002002596700002102616773010602637856008502743852000902828655001202837IND60674250920221117180200.0191220e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067425092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.micres.2019.1263512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZoppo, Marina10aCpALS4770 and CpALS4780 contribution to the virulence of Candida parapsilosis  aThe ability of yeast to adhere to biotic and abiotic surfaces represents an essential trait during the early stages of infection. Agglutinin-like sequence (Als) cell-wall proteins play a key role in adhesion of Candida species. Candida parapsilosis genome encompasses 5 ALS members, of which only the role of CPAR2_404800 has been elucidated. The present project was aimed at investigating the contribution of C. parapsilosis Als proteins by generating edited strains lacking functional Als proteins. CPAR2_404770 and CPAR2_404780, further indicated as CpALS4770 and CpALS4780, were selected for the generation of single and double edited strains using an episomal CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Phenotypic characterization of mutant strains revealed that editing of both genes had no impact on the in vitro growth of C. parapsilosis or on morphogenesis. Notably, CpALS4770-edited strain showed a reduction of biofilm formation and adhesive properties to human buccal cells (HBECs). Conversely, single CpALS4780-edited strain did not show any difference compared to the wild-type strain in all the assays performed, while the double CpALS4770-CpALS4780 mutant revealed an increased ability to produce biofilm, a hyper-adhesive phenotype to HBECs, and a marked tendency to form cellular aggregates. Murine vaginal infection experiments indicated a significant reduction in CFUs recovered from BALC/c mice infected with single and double edited strains, compared to those infected with the wild-type strain. These finding clearly indicate that CpAls4770 plays a role in adhesion to biotic and abiotic surfaces, while both CpALS4770 and CpALS4780 genes are required for C. parapsilosis ability to colonize and persist in the vaginal mucosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCRISPR-Cas systems 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aadhesion 3abiofilm 3agene editing 3agenes 3ahumans 3amice 3amorphogenesis 3amutants 3aphenotype 3astructural proteins 3avaginal mucosa 3avirulence 3ayeasts 0aEpisomal CRISPR/Cas9 0aAgglutinin-like sequence (ALS) gene family 0aHuman buccal epithelial cells (HBECs) 0aMurine vaginal candidiasis1 aDi Luca, Mariagrazia1 aFranco, Mauro1 aRizzato, Cosmeri1 aLupetti, Antonella1 aStringaro, Annarita1 aDe Bernardis, Flavia1 aSchaudinn, Christoph1 aBarrasa, M.

Although fat is important as regards energy reduction, no quantitative data are available on the sensory sensitivity of the human towards fat content in complex emulsions. After developing vanilla custards which varied in fat content (1–29g/100g) but were controlled with respect to viscosity, sweetness and flavor, the constant stimulus method was used to determine the difference threshold for fat. Irrespective of reference fat concentration (5, 15 and 25g/100g), difference thresholds were found to be almost constant at 14–15g/100g. In another set of experiments sweetness difference thresholds were determined for reference sugar concentrations of 3%, 6% and 12% at different levels of fat content. Weber fractions for sweetness slightly decreased with increasing reference concentration. At higher sugar concentration levels, a higher sensitivity of the subjects towards sweetness differences was observed when the fat content of the emulsions was increased.  aPublisher supplied data 3acustards 3aemulsions 3aenergy 3ahumans 3alipid content 3asugars 3asweetness 3aviscosity1 aZahn, Susann1 aPuschmann, Antje1 aUllmann, Ines1 aRohm, Harald0 tFood quality and preference.g2012 Oct., v. 26, no. 1 p.52-57dElsevier Ltdx0950-32937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2012.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03630naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245015600172300001800328520203700346592002802383650001402411650003502425650001202460650001402472650001402486650001402500650002202514650001502536650002202551650001602573650001602589650001302605651001502618653001402633653001002647653001202657653002302669700001602692700001502708700002402723700002002747700002002767700001802787700002402805700001702829700006002846773009902906856008603005852000903091655001203100IND60534986320221122212528.0190319e20140716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053498632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.05.0492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraig, Andrew P.12aA 5-year Chlamydia vaccination programme could reverse disease-related koala population decline: Predictions from a mathematical model using field data  ap. 4163-4170.  aMany koala populations around Australia are in serious decline, with a substantial component of this decline in some Southeast Queensland populations attributed to the impact of Chlamydia. A Chlamydia vaccine for koalas is in development and has shown promise in early trials. This study contributes to implementation preparedness by simulating vaccination strategies designed to reverse population decline and by identifying which age and sex category it would be most effective to target.We used field data to inform the development and parameterisation of an individual-based stochastic simulation model of a koala population endemic with Chlamydia. The model took into account transmission, morbidity and mortality caused by Chlamydia infections. We calibrated the model to characteristics of typical Southeast Queensland koala populations. As there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of the vaccine in real-world settings, a variety of potential vaccine efficacies, half-lives and dosing schedules were simulated.Assuming other threats remain constant, it is expected that current population declines could be reversed in around 5–6 years if female koalas aged 1–2 years are targeted, average vaccine protective efficacy is 75%, and vaccine coverage is around 10% per year. At lower vaccine efficacies the immunological effects of boosting become important: at 45% vaccine efficacy population decline is predicted to reverse in 6 years under optimistic boosting assumptions but in 9 years under pessimistic boosting assumptions. Terminating a successful vaccination programme at 5 years would lead to a rise in Chlamydia prevalence towards pre-vaccination levels.For a range of vaccine efficacy levels it is projected that population decline due to endemic Chlamydia can be reversed under realistic dosing schedules, potentially in just 5 years. However, a vaccination programme might need to continue indefinitely in order to maintain Chlamydia prevalence at a sufficiently low level for population growth to continue.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlamydia 3aPhascolarctos cinereus adustus 3afemales 3ahalf life 3amorbidity 3amortality 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3asimulation models 3auncertainty 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aQueensland 0aChlamydia 0aKoala 0aVaccine 0aMathematical model1 aHanger, Jon1 aLoader, Jo1 aEllis, William A.H.1 aCallaghan, John1 aDexter, Cathryn1 aJones, Darryl1 aBeagley, Kenneth W.1 aTimms, Peter1 aWilson, David P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6855-39260 tVaccine.g2014 July 16, v. 32, no. 33 p.4163-4170dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.05.0493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03164naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010600167520150800273592002801781650001001809650002201819650003701841650001101878650001001889650002301899650001101922650002301933650002101956650001101977650001301988650001902001650001402020650001302034650001402047650000702061650001302068650001502081650003402096650003302130650002102163650002502184653003502209653003102244653001902275653002102294700005702315700001202372700001602384773011502400856008602515852000902601655001202610IND60689054920221120182049.0201202e20200905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068905492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1227232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Jingju10aStable boron and cobalt co-doped TiO2 nanotubes anode for efficient degradation of organic pollutants  aAnode materials are crucial to anodic oxidation for wastewater treatment. In this regard, stable boron and cobalt co-doped TiO₂ nanotube (B, Co-TNT) was prepared for the first time, and its lifetime was found increased significantly while electrocatalytic activity decreased with the increase of Co(NO₃)₂ in preparation from 1 to 10 mM. Characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Photo-electronic Spectroscopy (XPS), B and Co content were optimized and successfully doped on TNT, which was more smooth without ripple with Co content of 0.038 mg/cm² in a valence of +2, and B atomic content of 2.17 at.% in form of Ti-B-O. This optimized anode enhanced electrode lifetime 122.8 times while the electrochemical activity decreased slightly when compared to the undoped TNT. The effects of current density, initial pH and initial 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) concentration were investigated, and the mainly responsible radical for degradation was confirmed to be the surface OH on B, Co-TNT anode. This anode had better performance on the TOC removal, mineralization current density (MCE) and energy consumption (Ec) when compared with BDD, PbO₂, DSA and Pt anodes, and it also presented a very stable degradation for 10 cycles oxidation of 20 mg/L 2,4-D with allowable Co leaching. Therefore, B, Co-TNT anode is a promising, stable, safety and cost-effective anode for application in electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs).  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,4-D 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aanodes 3aboron 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acost effectiveness 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3aleaching 3amineralization 3ananotubes 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3apH 3aplatinum 3apollutants 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atitanium dioxide 3awastewater treatment 0a2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 0aBoron and cobalt co-doping 0aTiO2 nanotubes 0aHydroxyl radical1 aZhou, Minghua1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1306-35051 aXu, Xin1 aDu, Xuedong0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Sept. 05, v. 396 p.122723-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1227233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03362naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245013900216300001800355520185400373592002802227650001502255650001302270650001202283650002202295650001202317650001502329650001602344650001402360650003102374650001002405650001402415650000902429650001402438650001302452653004602465653002202511653003802533653003502571700001702606700001602623700002002639700002102659773010402680856008702784852000902871655001202880IND60556803420221119224659.0170713e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055680342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRonen-Eliraz, Gefen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3837-012210aInvestigating geochemical aspects of managed aquifer recharge by column experiments with alternating desalinated water and groundwater  ap. 1174-1181.  aManaged aquifer recharge (MAR) events are occasionally carried out with surplus desalinated seawater that has been post-treated with CaCO3 in infiltration ponds overlying the northern part of the Israeli Coastal Aquifer. This water's chemical characteristics differ from those of any other water recharged to the aquifer and of the natural groundwater. As the MAR events are short (hours to weeks), the sediment under the infiltration ponds will intermittently host desalinated and natural groundwater. As part of comprehensive research on the influence of those events, column experiments were designed to simulate the alternation of the two water types: post-treated desalinated seawater (PTDES) and natural groundwater (GW). Each experiment included three stages: (i) saturation with GW; (ii) inflow of PTDES; (iii) inflow of GW. Three runs were conducted, each with different sediments extracted from the field and representing a different layer below the infiltration pond: (i) sand (<1% CaCO3), (ii) sand containing 7% CaCO3, and (iii) crushed calcareous sandstone (35% CaCO3). The results from all columns showed enrichment of K+ and Mg2+ (up to 0.4meq/L for 20 pore volumes) when PTDES replaced GW, whereas an opposite trend of Ca2+ depletion (up to 0.5meq/L) was observed only in the columns that contained a high percentage of CaCO3. When GW replaced PTDES, depletion of Mg2+ and K+ was noted. The results indicated that adsorption/desorption of cations are the main processes causing the observed enrichment/depletion. It was concluded that the high concentration of Ca2+ (relative to the total concentration of cations) and the low concentration of Mg2+ in the PTDES relative to natural GW are the factors controlling the main sediment–water interaction. The enrichment of PTDES with Mg2+ may be viewed as an additional post-treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aaquifers 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acations 3adesorption 3agroundwater 3amagnesium 3aphysicochemical properties 3aponds 3apotassium 3asand 3asandstone 3aseawater 0aPost-treated desalinated seawater (PTDES) 0aColumn experiment 0aAlternating PTDES and groundwater 0aManaged aquifer recharge (MAR)1 aRussak, Amos1 aNitzan, Ido1 aGuttman, Joseph1 aKurtzman, Daniel0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 574 p.1174-1181dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02924naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009900163300001600262520151400278592002801792650001001820650001701830650000901847650001201856650001401868650001701882650002601899650001301925650002201938650001101960650001101971650002101982650001802003650002002021650001002041650001002051650000902061650000902070700001702079700001602096700002002112700002002132700001702152773010302169852000902272856008102281930003302362946001102395655001202406IND4387045220221120045056.0160903e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438704522DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-006-9149-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaxted, A.

This study tested various soil amendments intended to increase soil metal availability to Salix, investigated the distribution of metal between different tree fractions and assessed the viability of phytoextraction using SRC on arable soils. Several Salix genotypes were grown in field trials over 4 years. Cd and Zn concentrations were generally ranked in the order leaves > bark > wood. Metal concentrations in wood increased towards the top of the willow stems, whereas concentrations in leaves showed the opposite trend. None of the amendments significantly increased uptake of Zn by willow. However, in response to a range of soil HCl treatments, mean Cd concentrations in stems and leaves were 112% and 130% of control values. Data from the current experiment, and previous studies, were combined to develop a predictive model of Cd and Zn stem uptake by Salix. The minimum biological concentration factor (BCF) required to achieve a prescribed soil metal target was also calculated based on typical proportions of bioavailable Cd in sludge-amended soils for a 25-year Salix rotation. The best Salix genotypes investigated achieved less than 20% of the uptake rate required to remove one third of the soil Cd content (equivalent to the average isotopically exchangeable Cd fraction in soils at the study site).  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix 3aarable soils 3abark 3acadmium 3acoppicing 3aenergy crops 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3ahydrochloric acid 3aleaves 3amodels 3aphytoremediation 3asewage sludge 3asoil amendments 3astems 3atrees 3awood 3azinc1 aBlack, C.

The total volatile basic-nitrogen (TVB-N) and pH value of pork were detected as freshness evaluation indicators. A multi-index statistical information fusion (MSIF) modeling method based on variable selection was proposed to evaluate pork freshness. In the experiment, the proposed MSIF was compared with other state-of-the-art variable selection methods. Results showed that the proposed method achieved the best generalization performance and stability. The prediction correlation coefficient (Rval) and root mean square error (RMSEP) of MSIF were: Rval = 0.8618 and RMSEP = 3.910 for TVB-N content, Rval = 0.9379 and RMSEP = 0.1046 for pH value. The research demonstrated that NIR combined with MSIF has the potential for rapid and nondestructive determination of pork freshness, and so hopefully to provide a promising tool for monitoring meat quality and enriching the extracted information from food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood industry 3afreshness 3ameat quality 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3apH 3apork 3aprediction 3aselection methods 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 0aNear infrared spectroscopy 0aPork freshness 0aVariable selection 0aMulti-index 0aInformation fusion 0aTotal volatile basic-nitrogen1 aRen, Dong1 aHe, Yong1 aNie, Pengcheng1 aLin, Lei1 aCai, Chengyong1 aDong, Tao0 tMeat science.g2018 Dec., v. 146 p.59-67dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02686naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245011400175300001400289520131100303592002801614650002701642650001501669650002501684650001501709650001501724650001601739650002301755650002001778650003801798650001201836650001101848650000701859650001301866650002001879653002501899653002501924653001901949653001001968653000801978700002501986700002102011773009302032856008202125852000902207655001202216IND60553443520221119201347.0170607e20150515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055344352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.06.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVashist, Sandeep Kumar10aRapid sandwich ELISA-based in vitro diagnostic procedure for the highly-sensitive detection of human fetuin A  ap. 73-78.  aA rapid sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based in vitro diagnostic (IVD) procedure has been developed for human fetuin A (HFA), an important disease biomarker for inflammatory diseases as well as malignancies. In this simplified and cost-effective procedure, the EDC-activated anti-HFA antibody (Ab) was admixed with 1% (v/v) 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) in 1:1 (v/v) and dispensed in a KOH-pretreated microtiter plate (MTP). APTES formed a stable complex with the capture antibody that was in turn covalently bonded on the KOH-treated surface in 30min. The resulting immunoassay (IA) format detects HFA with a dynamic range of 0.1–243ngmL−1, and a limit of detection (LOD) and analytical sensitivity of 0.3ngmL−1 and 1.0ngmL−1, respectively. For the determination of HFA spiked in diluted human whole blood and serum, and HFA in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-plasma of patients, the obtained analytical precision is similar to that of the conventional sandwich ELISA. The anti-HFA Ab-bound MTPs, stored at 4°C in 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4, retained its biological activity for 8 weeks, thereby demonstrating excellent storage stability. This generic sandwich ELISA procedure can be extended for rapid, simplified and cost-effective detection of other disease biomarkers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aantibodies 3abioactive properties 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3acost effectiveness 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afetuins 3ahumans 3apH 3apatients 3astorage quality 0aRapid sandwich ELISA 0aIn vitro diagnostics 0aHuman fetuin A 0aAPTES 0aEDC1 aSchneider, E.

The study of technologies for CFA recycling has been of major concern, while the harm caused by CFA is only partially understood, limiting its reuse. In this review, the basic physico-chemical properties of CFA are introduced, followed by a systematic summary and discussion of the leachability of CFA via different leaching methods and the chemical speciation of some typical metal elements in CFA, which is related to its harmful effects. The specific harm that CFA causes to humans, wild animals, and plants and the study status of magnetic property of CFA are presented. Because of the pervasive concerns of many people, the utilisation of CFA in the USA and Europe and an economic and environmental analysis of its disposal is provided and discussed. Finally, some possible directions for future research involving CFA are proposed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3achemical speciation 3acoal fly ash 3aenvironmental assessment 3aleaching 3amagnetic properties 3arecycling 3asolid wastes 0aCoal fly ash 0aEnvironmental pollution 0aLeachability 0aRadiation 0aMetal/metalloid elements1 aSun, Xiyu1 aZhao, Qiang1 aYang, Ying1 aWang, Peng0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2020 Sept. 05, v. 396 p.122725-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1227253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03198naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015800157520148100315592002801796650002201824650001201846650001701858650002401875650001501899650001801914650001801932650001201950650001501962650003101977650001002008650002402018650001502042650001502057650001402072650001802086650001402104650004302118650005202161650002602213650002002239650001902259650001802278700001802296700002302314700002702337700002502364700002202389700002402411773012602435856007402561852000902635655001202644IND60707873920221118035802.0200821e20200727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070787392DNAL7 a10.3390/md180803922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsai, Sneha 13aDe Novo Transcriptome Assembly and Gene Expression Profiling of the Copepod Calanus helgolandicus Feeding on the PUA-Producing Diatom Skeletonema marinoi  aDiatoms are the dominant component of the marine phytoplankton. Several diatoms produce secondary metabolites, namely oxylipins, with teratogenic effects on their main predators, crustacean copepods. Our study reports the de novo assembled transcriptome of the calanoid copepod Calanus helgolandicus feeding on the oxylipin-producing diatom Skeletonema marinoi. Differential expression analysis was also performed between copepod females exposed to the diatom and the control flagellate Prorocentrum minimum, which does not produce oxylipins. Our results showed that transcripts involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, folate and methionine metabolism, embryogenesis, and response to stimulus were differentially expressed in the two conditions. Expression of 27 selected genes belonging to these functional categories was also analyzed by RT-qPCR in C. helgolandicus females exposed to a mixed solution of the oxylipins heptadienal and octadienal at the concentration of 10 µM, 15 µM, and 20 µM. The results confirmed differential expression analysis, with up-regulation of genes involved in stress response and down-regulation of genes associated with folate and methionine metabolism, embryogenesis, and signaling. Overall, we offer new insights on the mechanism of action of oxylipins on maternally-induced embryo abnormality. Our results may also help identify biomarker genes associated with diatom-related reproductive failure in the natural copepod population at sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillariophyceae 3aCalanus 3aProrocentrum 3aSkeletonema marinoi 3abiomarkers 3acarbohydrates 3aembryogenesis 3afemales 3afolic acid 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3amechanism of action 3ametabolism 3amethionine 3aoxylipins 3aphytoplankton 3apredators 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asecondary metabolites 3astress response 3ateratogenicity 3atranscriptome1 aSanges, Remo 1 aLauritano, Chiara 1 aLindeque, Penelope  K.1 aEsposito, Francesco 1 aIanora, Adrianna 1 aCarotenuto, Ylenia 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 July 27, v. 18, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180803923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245008500151300001800236520117200254592002801426650001201454650001701466650002101483650000901504650001001513650002801523650001101551650001801562650001201580653003901592653003901631653002301670653003001693653001701723700001701740700001801757700001801775700001301793773012401806856007501930852000902005655001202014IND60527513020221118223755.0160715e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751302DNAL7 a10.1021/am40307742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ke10aFluorescent Films Based on Molecular-Gel Networks and Their Sensing Performances  ap. 9830-9836.  aA pyrene-capped terthiophene of cholesteryl derivative (CholG-3T-Py) was designed, synthesized, and utilized for the fabrication of a fluorescent film. Unlike the commonly adopted direct-coating method, the film was fabricated by the physical immobilization of the fluorophore, CholG-3T-Py, onto a glass plate surface via preformed low-molecular-mass gelator (LMMGs)-based molecular-gel networks. The photophysical behavior of the film as prepared and its sensing performances to nitrobenzene (NB) were conducted after activation with toluene. It was found that the film as prepared and activated is sensitive to the presence of NB, and the sensing process is fully reversible. Furthermore, the effects of commonly found interferents, including structural analogues, raw materials, which are commonly used for the production of NB, and other nitroaromatics (NACs), on the sensing process were also tested. It was shown that only aniline and phenol possess slight interference. The present work not only extends the applications of LMMGs-based molecular gels but also provids a new approach for preparation of micro- and nano-structure-based fluorescent sensing films.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaniline 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3agels 3aglass 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aphenol 3araw materials 3atoluene 0apyrene-capped terthiophene (Py-3T) 0alow-molecular-mass gelator (LMMGs) 0afluorescence films 0amicro- and nanostructures 0anitrobenzene1 aLiu, Taihong1 aChen, Xiangli1 aSun, Xiaohuan1 aFang, Yu0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2013 Oct. 09, v. 5, no. 19 p.9830-9836dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam40307743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245010900159300001800268520184900286592002802135650001502163650001502178650002202193650002302215650001102238650001502249650001502264650001202279650001902291650000902310650001102319650001902330650000702349650001502356650002302371650000902394653003102403653001002434653001502444653001902459653002002478700002202498700001802520773012702538856007302665852000902738655001202747IND60527513120221118223356.0160715e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751312DNAL7 a10.1021/am403079n2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Jun-Qing10aZeolitic Imidazolate Framework-8 for Fast Adsorption and Removal of Benzotriazoles from Aqueous Solution  ap. 9837-9842.  a1H-benzotriazole (BTri) and 5-tolyltriazole (5-TTri) are emerging pollutants; the development of novel materials for their efficient adsorption and removal is thus of great significance in environmental sciences. Here, we report the application of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) as a novel adsorbent for fast removal of BTri and 5-TTri in aqueous solution in view of adsorption isotherms, kinetics and thermodynamics, desorption, and adsorbent regeneration. The adsorption of BTri and 5-TTri on ZIF-8 was very fast, and most of BTri and 5-TTri were adsorbed in the first 2 min. The adsorption for BTri and 5-TTri follows a pseudo-second-order kinetics and fits the Langmuir adsorption model with the adsorption capacity of 298.5 and 396.8 mg g–¹ for BTri and 5-TTri at 30 °C, respectively. The adsorption was a spontaneous and endothermic process controlled by positive entropy change. No remarkable effects of pH, ionic strength, and dissolved organic matter on the adsorption of BTri and 5-TTri on ZIF-8 were observed. The used ZIF-8 could be regenerated effectively and recycled at least three times without significant loss of adsorption capacity. In addition, ZIF-8 provided much larger adsorption capacity and faster adsorption kinetics than activated carbon and ZIF-7. The hydrophobic and π–π interaction between the aromatic rings of the BTri and 5-TTri and the aromatic imizole rings of the ZIF-8, and the coordination of the nitrogen atoms in BTri and 5-TTri molecules to the Zn²⁺ ions in the ZIF-8 framework was responsible for the efficient adsorption. The fast adsorption kinetics, large adsorption capacity, excellent reusability as well as the pH, ionic strength, and dissolved organic matter insensitive adsorption create potential for ZIF-8 to be effective at removing benzotriazoles from aqueous solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3adesorption 3aendothermy 3aentropy 3aionic strength 3aions 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3apH 3apollutants 3asorption isotherms 3azinc 0ametal−organic frameworks 0aZIF-8 0aadsorption 0abenzotriazoles 0awater treatment1 aYang, Cheng-Xiong1 aYan, Xiu-Ping0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Oct. 09, v. 5, no. 19 p.9837-9842dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am403079n3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02528naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245010000189300001400289520120400303592002801507650001001535650000901545650000901554650004201563650001001605650002201615650002701637650003001664650000901694650001101703650001101714650000901725650004401734650001801778650001601796700002001812700002001832700001701852773008301869856008601952990002302038852000902061655001202070IND60091717620221120085952.0141103e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009171762DNAL7 a211723122pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEimer, Martin14aThe N170 component and its links to configural face processing: A rapid neural adaptation study  ap. 76-87.  aA neural adaptation paradigm where adaptor and test stimuli were presented in rapid succession was employed to investigate links between the face-sensitive N170 component and configural face processing. In Experiment 1, schematic adaptor stimuli preceded naturalistic images of upright faces, inverted faces, or isolated eyes. Relative to a baseline condition with schematic house adaptors, upright and inverted schematic faces adapted the N170 to subsequent naturalistic faces, demonstrating that this component is associated with neural processes involved in the analysis of first-order relational face configuration. In Experiment 2, two-tone Mooney faces adapted the N170 to naturalistic faces relative to a baseline condition with Mooney houses, suggesting links between the N170 and holistic face processing. Results demonstrate that the N170 component does not exclusively reflect the detection and analysis of individual face parts, but also the processing of first-order configural and global gestalt features of faces. They also show that neural adaptation procedures can be used to identify the neural mechanisms that are responsible for category-specific ERP components such as the N170.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3aeyes 3aface 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aAdult 2aBrainxphysiology 2aElectroencephalography 2aEvoked Potentials, Visual 2aFace 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aPattern Recognition, Visualxphysiology 2aReaction Time 2aYoung Adult1 aGosling, Angela1 aNicholas, Susan1 aKiss, Monika0 tBrain research.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 1376 p.76-87dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.12.0463Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02170naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245012700165300001600292520066000308592002800968650002100996650002801017650002001045650001901065650002401084650002601108650001201134650001901146650001401165650002501179650001301204650001401217651001001231651001301241653002201254653002301276653001801299653002401317700001701341700001901358700001401377700002001391700001801411700001801429773012301447856008501570852000901655655001201664IND60730367820221120074422.0210309e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073036782DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16107552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiras, A.10aAntifungal activity of essential oil from Mentha spicata L. and Mentha pulegium L. growing wild in Sardinia island (Italy)  ap. 993-999.  aThis study aims to evaluate the antifungal activity of Mentha spicata L. and Mentha pulegium L. from Sardinia and to assess their efficacy on virulence factors for Candida albicans, particularly on the inhibition of the germ tube formation.

No studies have investigated autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation due to SSBs in children. Our aim was to investigate the associations between SSBs intake, BP and ANS activation in children.Cross-sectional data collected in 2008–2010 at age 5/6 (n = 2519) and in 2015–2016 at age 11/12 (n = 769) years in the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development-study were analyzed in 2017. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), as well as pre-ejection period (PEP; sympathetic activation) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA; parasympathetic activation) were measured during supine position. SSBs intake was self-reported.After adjustments for covariates, including weight status, no associations between SSBs intake, BP and ANS measures were found at age 5/6. At age 11/12, one serving/day increase in SSBs was associated with 0.8 mmHg increase in SBP (95%CI:0.4; 1.2), 0.3 mmHg increase in DBP (0.0; 0.5) and 0.9 msec decrease in PEP (−1.5;-0.2). Children in the highest SSBs tertile had an increase of 2.3 mmHg in SBP (0.7; 4.0) and a decrease of 3.6 msec in PEP (−6.7;-0.6) compared to children in the lowest tertile.In children aged 11/12, high intake of SSBs was associated with increased BP, which might be due to increased sympathetic nervous system activation. Importantly, these associations were independent of weight status.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aarrhythmia 3achildren 3adata collection 3adiastolic blood pressure 3asugar sweetened beverages 3asympathetic nervous system 3asystolic blood pressure 0aChildhood 0aBlood pressure 0aAutonomic nervous system activation 0aSugar-sweetened beverages 0aANS 0aBMI 0aCI 0aDBP 0aHR 0aPEP 0aPNS 0aRSA 0aSBP 0aSNS 0aSSBs1 ade Rooij, Susanne R.1 aOlthof, Margreet R.1 aVrijkotte, Tanja G.M.0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2018 Dec., v. 28 p.232-235dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2018.08.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02384naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245007400171300001200245520094500257592002801202650002201230650001601252650001701268650001301285650002201298650002501320650001101345650002201356650001301378650001401391650002601405650002301431650001401454650000901468650002101477650001301498653001201511653001501523653001401538653001601552653001501568653001601583700001801599700002201617700001501639773011501654856008801769852000901857655001201866IND60556803820221119224825.0190516e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055680382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Xianlai10aInnovating e-waste management: From macroscopic to microscopic scales  ap. 1-5.  aWaste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE or e-waste) has become a global problem, due to its potential environmental pollution and human health risk, and its containing valuable resources (e.g., metals, plastics). Recycling for e-waste will be a necessity, not only to address the shortage of mineral resources for electronics industry, but also to decline environmental pollution and human health risk. To systematically solve the e-waste problem, more attention of e-waste management should transfer from macroscopic to microscopic scales. E-waste processing technology should be significantly improved to diminish and even avoid toxic substance entering into downstream of material. The regulation or policy related to new production of hazardous substances in recycled materials should also be carried out on the agenda. All the findings can hopefully improve WEEE legislation for regulated countries and non-regulated countries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectronic wastes 3aelectronics 3ahuman health 3aindustry 3aissues and policy 3alaws and regulations 3ametals 3amineral resources 3aplastics 3apollution 3aprocessing technology 3arecycled materials 3arecycling 3arisk 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aE-waste 0aManagement 0aRecycling 0aMacroscopic 0aMesoscopic 0aMicroscopic1 aYang, Congren1 aChiang, Joseph F.1 aLi, Jinhui0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 575 p.1-5dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02701naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245015100190300001800341520124900359592002801608650002301636650001301659650001101672650001901683650002001702650003801722650001701760650003201777650000901809650002601818650001401844650001201858653003101870653002401901653001901925653001601944653002001960700003201980700002002012773012102032856008102153852000902234655001202243IND60655074820221123033137.0190730e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065507482DNAL7 a273125222pmid7 a10.1017/S00311820160011042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aANURACPREEDA, PANAT10aImmunodiagnostic monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISA of fasciolosis by detection of Fasciola gigantica circulating fatty acid binding protein  ap. 1369-1381.  aUp to now, parasitological diagnosis of fasciolosis is often unreliable and possesses low sensitivity. Hence, the detection of circulating parasite antigens is thought to be a better alternative for diagnosis of fasciolosis, as it reflects the real parasite burden. In the present study, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) against recombinant Fasciola gigantica fatty acid binding protein (rFgFABP) has been produced. As well, a reliable sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (sandwich ELISA) has been developed for the detection of circulating FABP in the sera of mice experimentally and cattle naturally infected with F. gigantica. MoAb 3A3 and biotinylated rabbit anti-recombinant FABP antibody were selected due to their high reactivities and specificities. The lower detection limit of sandwich ELISA was 5 pg mL⁻¹, and no cross-reaction with other parasite antigens was observed. This assay could detect F. gigantica infection from day 1 post infection. In experimental mice, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of this assay were 93·3, 100 and 98·2%, while in natural cattle they were 96·7, 100 and 99·1%. Hence, this sandwich ELISA method showed high efficiencies and precisions for diagnosis of fasciolosis by F. gigantica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola gigantica 3aantigens 3acattle 3across reaction 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afascioliasis 3afatty acid-binding proteins 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aparasites 3arabbits 0afatty acid binding protein 0amonoclonal antibody 0asandwich ELISA 0aSeroantigen 0aimmunodiagnosis1 aCHAWENGKIRTTIKUL, RUNGLAWAN1 aSOBHON, PRASERT0 tParasitology.g2016 Sept., v. 143, no. 11 p.1369-1381dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820160011043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03512naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245012100174300001600295520084200311536059901153592002801752596007901780596005901859596007001918596012001988596012602108596010502234650002502339650002202364650002602386650001702412650001002429650002102439650001602460650001302476653002902489653003702518653001302555700001702568700001702585700001802602700001702620700001602637700002002653700001802673700001802691700001802709700001402727773012302741856008502864852000902949655001202958IND60730368020221120085646.0210309e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073036802DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16107572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalendra, Limbadri10aCytotoxicity of polyketides and steroids isolated from the sponge-associated fungus Penicillium citrinum SCSIO 41017  ap. 900-908.  aTwo new polyketides, xerucitrinin A (1) and coniochaetone M (8), and one new steroid, 16α-methylpregna-17α,19-dihydroxy-(9,11)-epoxy-4-ene-3,18-dione-20-acetoxy (13), together with eleven known analogues were isolated from fungus Penicillium citrinum SCSIO 41017 associated with the sponge Callyspongia sp.

Each group had 5 replicates with 8 pigs, half males and half females. Feeding PGZ increased intramuscular fat and VE supplementation decreased cooking loss (P < 0.05). Feeding VE increased total polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), C18:2n-6 and C18:3n-3 (P < 0.05). For 18:3n-3, the increase in C18:3n-3 due to VE was accentuated when combined with PGZ (P < 0.001). Additionally, VE tended to increase superoxide dismutase (P = 0.079) and glutathione peroxidase activity (P = 0.054). In summary, PGZ and VE had positive effects on pork quality by decreasing cooking loss and increasing intramuscular fat and antioxidant capacity, and may prove useful in improving the healthfulness of fatty acid profiles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aLarge White 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acooking quality 3aenzyme activity 3afatty acid composition 3afemales 3afinishing 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aintramuscular fat 3alandraces 3amales 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3apork quality 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswine 3avitamin E 0aPioglitazone hydrochloride 0aVitamin E 0aIntramuscular fat 0aPUFA 0aAntioxidant ability 0aFinishing pigs1 aGao, Chun-qi1 aWang, Qiang1 aZhang, Zong-ming1 aXu, Yin-long1 aLi, Haizhang,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9784-64801 aYan, Hui-chao1 aWang, Xiu-qi0 tMeat science.g2018 Nov., v. 145 p.340-346dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.07.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02656naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245008900189300001800278520134600296592002801642650003201670650002301702650001101725650000901736650001001745650001301755650003001768650001801798650001701816650001101833651001201844653001901856653000801875653000801883700001801891700002001909700002101929700001801950700002001968773012001988856008102108852000902189655001202198IND60655075020221123033136.0190730e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065507502DNAL7 a274176812pmid7 a10.1017/S003118201600113X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRJEIBI, MOHAMED R.10aMolecular prevalence and genetic characterization of piroplasms in dogs from Tunisia  ap. 1622-1628.  aIn this study, the prevalence of piroplasms in dogs was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify Babesia and Theileria species in 200 dogs from Northern and Central Tunisia between spring and autumn 2014. The overall molecular prevalence for piroplasms was 14·5% ± 0·05 (29/200); PCR detected 2 species, namely Babesia vogeli and Theileria annulata with an overall prevalence of 12·5 ± 0·04 and 2% ± 0·02, respectively. No differences in the molecular prevalences of B. vogeli were revealed for age and sex (P > 0·05). The molecular prevalence of B. vogeli was significantly higher in central Tunisia (26·5% ± 0·01) compared with the North (9·6% ± 0·04) (P < 0·05). More working and companion dogs were infected by B. vogeli (25·8 ± 0·15 and 21·1% ± 0·13, respectively) in comparison with guarding dogs (1·8% ± 0·03) (P < 0·05). Concerning T. annulata, no significant variation was observed for all studied risk factors (P > 0·05). Comparison of the partial sequences of 18S rRNA and Tams 1 genes confirmed the presence of 2 novel B. vogeli and T. annulata genotypes. This is the first molecular detection of T. annulata and genetic characterization of dogs’ piroplasms in Tunisia. Further studies are needed to better assess the epidemiological feature of piroplasms infection in North Africa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBabesia canis subsp. vogeli 3aTheileria annulata 3aautumn 3adogs 3agenes 3agenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3arisk factors 3aspring 3aTunisia 0aBabesia vogeli 0aDog 0aPCR1 aAMAIRIA, SAFA1 aROUATBI, MARIEM1 aBEN SALEM, FATMA1 aMABROUK, MOEZ1 aGHARBI, MOHAMED0 tParasitology.g2016 Oct., v. 143, no. 12 p.1622-1628dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S003118201600113X3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03460naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245013900160300001800299520204400317592002802361650002302389650001402412650001602426650002002442650001602462650001602478650002002494650001102514650001802525650002502543650001102568653001702579653001502596653001002611653001502621653003802636700001402674700001502688700001902703700001302722700001402735700001702749773012302766856008002889852000902969655001202978IND60563572620221120125512.0170301e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056357262DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b145712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jian10aGreen in Situ Synthesis of Clean 3D Chestnutlike Ag/WO3–x Nanostructures for Highly Efficient, Recyclable and Sensitive SERS Sensing  ap. 7436-7446.  aSurface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has proven to be an effective technique for identifying and providing fingerprint structural information on various analytes in low concentration. However, this analytical technique has been plagued by the ubiquitous presence of organic contaminants on roughened SERS substrate surfaces, which not only often result in poorer detection sensitivity but also significantly affect the reproducibility and accuracy of SERS analysis. Herein, we developed a clean, stable, and recyclable three-dimensional (3D) chestnutlike Ag/WO₃–ₓ (0 < x < 0.28) SERS substrate by simple hydrothermal reaction and subsequent green in situ decoration of silver nanoparticles. None of the organic additives were used in synthesis, which ensures the substrate surfaces are completely clean and free of interferences from impurities. The innovative design combines the SERS enhancement effect and self-cleaning property, making it a multifunctional and reusable SERS platform for highly sensitive SERS detection. Using malachite green as a model target, the as-prepared SERS substrates exhibited good reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 7.5%) and pushed the detection limit down to 0.29 pM. The enhancement factor was found to be as high as 1.4 × 10⁷ based on the analysis of 4-aminothiophenol. The excellent regeneration performance indicated that the 3D biomimetic SERS substrates can be reused many times. In addition, the fabricated substrate was successfully employed for detecting thiram in water with a detection limit of 0.32 nM, and a good linear relationship was obtained between the logarithmic intensities and the logarithmic concentrations of thiram ranging from 1 nM to 1 μM. More importantly, the resultant SERS-active colloid can be used for accurate and reliable determination of thiram in real fruit peels. These results predict that the proposed SERS system have great potential toward rapid, reliable, and on-site analysis, especially for food safety and environmental supervision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadditives 3abiomimetics 3adetection limit 3afood safety 3afruit peels 3amalachite green 3amodels 3ananomaterials 3astatistical analysis 3athiram 0achestnutlike 0aAg/WO3−x 0agreen 0arecyclable 0asurface-enhanced Raman scattering1 aMa, Dayan1 aChen, Feng1 aChen, Dongzhen1 aBai, Min1 aXu, Kewei1 aZhao, Yongxi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 9, no. 8 p.7436-7446dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b145713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03286naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005600153245016100209300001800370520176100388592002802149650001802177650001302195650002302208650001402231650001302245650002102258650001102279650001502290650002102305650002402326650002202350650002302372651001002395653003002405653002402435653002502459653000802484653001802492700001502510700001802525700001802543700001702561700001402578773010402592856008702696852000902783655001202792IND60556804120221119223913.0170713e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055680412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordioli, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1458-947210aCombining land use regression models and fixed site monitoring to reconstruct spatiotemporal variability of NO2 concentrations over a wide geographical area  ap. 1075-1084.  aThe epidemiological research benefits from an accurate characterization of both spatial and temporal variability of exposure to air pollution. This work aims at proposing a method to combine the high spatial resolution of Land Use Regression (LUR) models with the high temporal resolution of fixed site monitoring data, to model spatiotemporal variability of NO2 over a wide geographical area in Northern Italy. We developed seasonal LUR models to reconstruct the spatial distribution of a scaling factor that relates local concentrations to those measured at two reference central sites, one for the northern flat area and one for the southern mountain area. We calculated the daily average concentrations at 19 locations spread over the study areas as the product of the local scaling factor and the reference central site concentrations. We evaluated model performance comparing modeled and measured NO2 data. LUR model's R2 ranges from 0.76 to 0.92. The main predictors refers substantially to traffic, industrial land use, buildings volume and altitude a.s.l. The model's performance in reproducing measured concentrations was satisfactory. The temporal variability of concentrations was well captured: Spearman correlation between model and measures was >0.7 for almost all sites. Model's average absolute errors were in the order of 10μgm−3. The model for the southern area tends to overestimate measured concentrations. Our modeling framework was able to reproduce spatiotemporal differences in NO2 concentrations. This kind of model is less data-intensive than usual regional atmospheric models and it may be very helpful to assess population exposure within studies in which individual relevant exposure occurs along periods of days or months.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aaltitude 3aat-risk population 3abuildings 3aland use 3amodel validation 3amodels 3amonitoring 3anitrogen dioxide 3aregression analysis 3aspatial variation 3atemporal variation 3aItaly 0aLand use regression model 0aExposure assessment 0aSpatiotemporal model 0aGIS 0aAir pollution1 aPironi, C.1 aDe Munari, E.1 aMarmiroli, N.1 aLauriola, P.1 aRanzi, A.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 574 p.1075-1084dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015700177300001800334520205500352592002802407650002002435650002702455650001402482650001302496650001402509650001302523650001202536650003302548650001202581650001602593650001302609651002202622653001402644653001602658653002302674653001302697653001002710700002302720700001802743700002202761700001902783700002202802700001702824700002002841700002002861773009902881856008602980852000903066655001203075IND60534986920221122225740.0190319e20140707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053498692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlyth, Christopher C.14aThe impact of pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza and vaccine-associated adverse events on parental attitudes and influenza vaccine uptake in young children  ap. 4075-4081.  aParental attitudes towards vaccination significantly influence vaccine uptake. The A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza pandemic was followed in 2010 by an unprecedented increase in febrile reactions in children receiving trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine manufactured by bioCSL. Uptake of TIV in children <5 years in Western Australia (WA) decreased in 2010 and has remained low. The impact of pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 and adverse-events on parental attitudes towards vaccination is uncertain.A parental attitudes survey towards influenza illness and vaccination was conducted as part of the West Australian Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness study. Vaccination status was assessed by parental interview and confirmed by the national register and/or vaccine providers. Parental attitudes from vaccinated and unvaccinated children and attitudes in 2008–2009 and 2010–2012 were compared. Principal Component Analysis was conducted to determine core attitudes that influenced vaccine uptake.Vaccination history and parental attitude surveys were available from 2576 children. Parents of fully vaccinated children less frequently stated that influenza was a mild disease, more frequently stated that influenza vaccine was safe and were less frequently worried about vaccine side effects.Uptake of influenza vaccine decreased significantly from 2010 onwards. From 2010, parents were less concerned about severe influenza, but more concerned about vaccine side effects and safety. Despite this significant shift in attitudes towards influenza vaccine, parental acceptance of vaccines on the national immunisation program did not change. Principal Component Analysis revealed that attitudes around vaccine safety and efficacy were the most important attitudes impacting on vaccine uptake.Parental attitudes to influenza vaccine changed from 2010. Confidence in the WA preschool influenza vaccination program remains low yet appeared unchanged for other vaccines. Restoring public confidence in childhood influenza vaccination is needed before uptake can be improved.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aattitudes and opinions 3achildhood 3achildren 3ainfluenza 3apandemic 3aparents 3aprincipal component analysis 3asurveys 3avaccination 3avaccines 3aWestern Australia 0aInfluenza 0aVaccination 0aParental attitudes 0aChildren 0aWAIVE1 aRichmond, Peter C.1 aJacoby, Peter1 aThornton, Patrick1 aRegan, Annette1 aRobins, Christine1 aKelly, Heath1 aSmith, David W.1 aEffler, Paul V.0 tVaccine.g2014 July 07, v. 32, no. 32 p.4075-4081dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.05.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03848naa a2200721 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245007900180300001800259520196300277592002802240650002002268650002102288650001602309650001602325650001402341650001102355650002002366650001402386650002302400650002202423650001602445650001302461650003002474650001402504650001302518650001802531650001602549650002102565650001002586653001102596653000802607653001102615653000802626653000902634653000802643653000702651653000702658653000802665653000802673653000802681653000702689653000702696653000802703653000802711653000802719653002002727653002402747653002002771653003302791653002202824700002502846700002002871700002302891773010402914856008703018852000903105655001203114IND60556804220221119224419.0170713e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055680422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoechitram, Shalini D.10aPolychlorinated biphenyl exposure and deiodinase activity in young infants  ap. 1117-1124.  aSeveral studies have shown effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on serum thyroid hormone levels in pregnant woman and their infants, while other studies did not find such effects. How PCBs might affect thyroid hormone metabolism, is still unclear. Potential mechanisms are direct influence on the thyroid gland, binding to thyroid binding proteins, increased excretion or metabolism of thyroid hormones by deiodinases or sulfatases. It is also not well known whether the effect on thyroid hormone levels is caused by PCBs themselves, or by their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PCBs).To determine the effects of perinatal exposure to PCBs and OH-PCBs on thyroid hormone levels in cord blood and in serum of newborn infants.In a Dutch cohort of 100 mother-infant pairs, exposed to background PCB levels, correlations were assessed between 10 PCBs and 6 OH-PCBs in maternal blood during pregnancy and serum thyroxine (T4), T4 sulfate (T4S), triiodothyronine (T3), reverse T3 (rT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) levels in cord blood and in serum of three- and 18-month-old infants. We corrected for age of the mother, gestational age, gender and type of feeding.After correction, prenatal levels of three of 10 measured PCBs showed a positive correlation with cord serum T3, and four PCBs showed a negative correlation with cord serum rT3. After correction, two PCBs and the sum of the 10 measured PCBs were positively correlated with the cord serum T3/rT3 ratio, an indicator of deiodinase 3 activity. No correlations were found between PCBs and T4, TSH and TBG in cord blood. 4-OH-PCB-107 was correlated with T4 at 3months and T4, T4S and T3 at 18months.Our results suggest that PCBs have a negative effect on deiodinase type 3 activity, as reflected by a positive correlation with the T3/rT3 ratio. We identified a potential mechanism by which PCBs may affect thyroid hormone metabolism during human development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abinding proteins 3ablood serum 3acorrelation 3aexcretion 3agender 3agestational age 3aglobulins 3ahormone metabolism 3ahuman development 3ametabolites 3aneonates 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3apregnancy 3asulfates 3athyroid gland 3athyrotropin 3atriiodothyronine 3awomen 0aD1,2,3 0afT4 0aOH-PCB 0aPCB 0aPOPs 0arT3 0aT3 0aT4 0aT4S 0aTBG 0aTEQ 0aT4 0aTH 0aTSH 0aTTR 0aPCB 0aThyroid hormone 0aDeiodinase activity 0aModes of action 0aPersistent organic pollutant 0aPrenatal exposure1 aBerghuis, Sietske A.1 aVisser, Theo J.1 aSauer, Pieter J.J.0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 574 p.1117-1124dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245011700162300001800279500001500297520106700312592002801379650002201407650001201429650002301441650001101464650001501475653001501490653001801505653003301523653001901556653001401575653002001589700001701609700001701626700001401643700001701657700001501674773012301689856008001812852000901892655001201901IND60563572720221120190240.0170301e20170301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056357272DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b146142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Weishang10aPretreatment of Lithium Surface by Using Iodic Acid (HIO3) To Improve Its Anode Performance in Lithium Batteries  ap. 7068-7074.  a2019-12-06  aIodic acid (HIO₃) was exploited as the effective source to build an artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the surface of Li anode. On one hand, HIO₃ is a weak solid-state acid and can be easily handled to remove most ion-insulating residues like Li₂CO₃ and/or LiOH from the pristine Li surface; on the other hand, both the products of LiI and LiIO₃ resulted from the chemical reactions between Li metal and HIO₃ are reported to be the ion-conductive components. As a result, the lower voltage polarization and impedance, longer cycling lifetime and higher Coulombic efficiency have been successfully achieved in the HIO₃-treated Li–Li and Li–Cu cells. By further using the HIO₃-treated Li anode into practical Li–S batteries, the impressive results also have been obtained, with average discharge capacities of 719 mAh g–¹ for 200 cycles (0.2 C) and 506 mAh g–¹ for 500 cycles (0.5 C), which were better than the Li–S batteries using the pristine Li anode (552 and 401 mAh g–¹, respectively) under the same conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3alithium batteries 3alithium 3achemical reactions 3aanodes 3ainterphase 0aiodic acid 0alithium anode 0asolid-electrolyte interphase 0aLi−S battery 0aimpedance 0alithium battery1 aWang, Qingji1 aYang, Jingyi1 aFan, Cong1 aWang, Liping1 aLi, Jingze0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 Mar. 01, v. 9, no. 8 p.7068-7074dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b146143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245009600164300001600260520106300276592002801339650001401367650000901381650002501390650001201415650001301427650001001440650001501450650001701465650001301482650001201495650001301507650001701520650001501537650000901552650001601561650001301577650003001590650001601620650002701636653002601663653001501689653001501704653001701719653001401736653001701750653000901767653000801776653001001784653000701794653000801801653000801809653000801817653000801825653000901833653000801842653000801850653000901858653000801867700002601875700005901901700001901960773009501979856008602074852000902160655001202169IND60610959220221119182926.0190712e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061095922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.04.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Rui10aContribution of nitric oxide and protein S-nitrosylation to variation in fresh meat quality  ap. 135-148.  aAs a primary source of reactive nitrogen species, nitric oxide (NO) is a signaling molecule playing multiple roles in physiological processes. NO exerts these pleiotropic effects mainly through the covalent attachment to the sulfhydryl group of protein cysteines to form S-nitrosothiol (protein S-nitrosylation). It has been two decades since NO was first investigated for its role in meat tenderization. Progress has been made, including studies by manipulating the NO levels in muscle cells, suggesting possible effects in the pre-slaughter and post-slaughter environment. NO has potential effects on the meat quality of beef, lamb, chicken and pork muscles. However, it has been difficult to determine the exact mechanism(s) of NO action as it has variable effects on meat quality including tenderness, water holding capacity and color. It is speculated that NO and protein S-nitrosylation may be involved in muscle to meat conversion through the regulation of postmortem biochemical pathways including glycolysis, Ca2+ release, proteolysis and apoptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abeef 3abiochemical pathways 3acalcium 3achickens 3acolor 3aglycolysis 3ameat quality 3amoieties 3amuscles 3amyocytes 3anitric oxide 3apleiotropy 3apork 3aproteolysis 3araw meat 3areactive nitrogen species 3atenderizing 3awater holding capacity 0aNitric oxide synthase 0aGlycolysis 0aμ-calpain 0aCa2+ release 0aApoptosis 0aMeat quality 0aALDO 0aENO 0aGAPDH 0aGP 0aGPI 0aLDH 0aPKM 0aPFK 0aPGAM 0aPGM 0aPGK 0aPYGM 0aTPI1 aWarner, Robyn Dorothy1 aZhou, Guanghong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8960-21411 aZhang, Wangang0 tMeat science.g2018 Oct., v. 144 p.135-148dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8541x0309-17407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2018.04.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245009300157300001800250520095800268592002801226650000801254650002401262650002501286650002201311650001301333650001901346650001601365653001301381653001901394653001101413653004301424700001401467700001701481700001801498700001701516700001401533700001701547773012701564856007301691852000901764655001201773IND60527513620221122225541.0160715e20131009xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052751362DNAL7 a10.1021/am403186r2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Pengzhan10aSmall Temperature Coefficient of Resistivity of Graphene/Graphene Oxide Hybrid Membranes  ap. 9563-9571.  aMaterials with low temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR) are of great importance in some areas, for example, highly accurate electronic measurement instruments and microelectronic integrated circuits. In this work, we demonstrated the ultrathin graphene–graphene oxide (GO) hybrid films prepared by layer-by-layer assembly with very small TCR (30–100 °C) in the air. Electrical response of the hybrid films to temperature variation was investigated along with the progressive reduction of GO sheets. The mechanism of electrical response to temperature variation of the hybrid film was discussed, which revealed that the interaction between graphene and GO and the chemical doping effect were responsible for the tunable control of its electrical response to temperature variation. The unique properties of graphene–GO hybrid film made it a promising candidate in many areas, such as high-end film electronic device and sensor applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aelectronic circuits 3aelectronic equipment 3afilms (materials) 3agraphene 3agraphene oxide 3atemperature 0agraphene 0agraphene oxide 0ahybrid 0atemperature coefficient of resistivity1 aZhu, Miao1 aWang, Kunlin1 aZhong, Minlin1 aWei, Jinquan1 aWu, Dehai1 aZhu, Hongwei0 tACS applied materials .g2013 Oct. 09, v. 5, no. 19 p.9563-9571dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am403186r3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02957naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245014900176500001900325520163700344592002801981650001402009650001602023650001802039650001802057650002302075650001102098650001202109650001702121650001502138650001202153653002102165653002002186653002102206653001902227700002202246700001702268700001702285700001502302773011202317856008502429852000902514655001202523IND60732857220221122223654.0210428e20210701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073285722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1193032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdha, Rusnang Syamsul13aAn improved perm-selectivity prediction of forward osmosis membrane by incorporating the effect of the surface charge on the solute partitioning  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPerm-selectivity consisting of water flux Jw and solute flux Jₛ or in form of Jₛ/Jw ratio is an important parameter of designing Forward Osmosis (FO) membrane as it indicates the membrane performance and how much solute replenishment over the extracted pure water from the feed solution. Parameter Jₛ/Jw ratio is dependent on hydrodynamic condition i.e cross-flow velocity (CFV), solute type i.e. diffusivity, trans-membrane surface potential. This study employed Cellulose Triacetate (CTA) membrane for representing low-charge membrane and Polyamide-Thin Film Composite (PA-TFC) for the membrane of highly negative surface charge. Six (6) different models were used to quantify the effect of external mass transfer, the ideal solution, non-ideal solution, trans-membrane surface potential on the transport of solute across the membrane. Our new model was proven to improve the prediction of perm-selectivity. The improvement was attributed to the application of trans-membrane potential-dependent solute partitioning for solute permeability correction and the application of experimentally obtained mass transfer coefficient. By the incorporation of the Donnan effect in determining the transmembrane potential, it was found that in the low charge membrane namely CTA, the dominant transport mechanism was diffusion, while in a highly negative surface charged membrane namely TFC, the partition of solute to be the dominant mechanism. Operation at a low CFV posed less impact of the membrane charge. The newly developed model provided a good foundation for FO process design under different CFVs and modified surface charges.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3adiffusivity 3ahydrodynamics 3amass transfer 3amembrane potential 3amodels 3aosmosis 3apermeability 3aprediction 3asolutes 0aPerm-selectivity 0aForward osmosis 0aDonnan potential 0aSurface charge1 aNguyen, Thanh-Tin1 aLee, Chulmin1 aJang, Jaewon1 aKim, In S.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 July 01, v. 629 p.119303-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1193033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02145naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245010600165300001800271520066200289536012900951592002801080596007901108650001401187650003101201650001801232650001201250650001801262650001901280650001301299653002601312653001801338653000701356653001101363653000901374700001401383700001201397700001301409700001701422700001701439700001201456773012501468856008501593852000901678655001201687IND60730368320221120095539.0210309e20210319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073036832DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2019.16109622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Long12aA new polyacetylene and other constituents with anti-inflammatory activity from Artemisia halodendron  ap. 1010-1013.  aA new polyacetylene, (3 R,8S)-heptadeca-1,16-dien-4,6-diyne-3,8-diol (1), together with 10 known compounds (2–11) were isolated from an ethanol extract of Artemisia halodendron Turcz. ex Bess.

Compounds 1–11 significantly inhibited the levels of NO, TNF-α and IL-6 in LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, with IC₅₀ values ranging from 15.12 to 66.97 µM.  aThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 81760627, 81660699 and 81660579].  aPublisher supplied data  a81760627a81660699a81660579cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aArtemisia 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3adose response 3aethanol 3ainterleukin-6 3apolyacetylenes 3aresearch 0aArtemisia halodendron 0apolyacetylene 0aNO 0aTNF-α 0aIL-61 aZhou, Wei1 aLi, Ren1 aJin, Mei1 aJin, Chunshi1 aSun, Jinfeng1 aLi, Gao0 tNatural product research.g2021 Mar. 19, v. 35, no. 6 p.1010-1013dTaylor & FranciswJournal:J000000126x1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2019.16109623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03478naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245015200166300001800318520170600336592002802042650002102070650001702091650004102108650004302149650001602192650001002208650001602218650001302234650002302247650002602270650001902296650000702315650001202322650001502334650001302349650000902362650001402371650002002385650001602405651001002421653002602431653001502457653003402472653002802506653004002534653003702574653002702611700001602638700002402654700002202678773010402700856008702804852000902891655001202900IND60556804320221119224532.0170713e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055680432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Ye10a3,4-Dichloroaniline revisited: A study on the fate of the priority pollutant in a sediment-water system derived from a rice growing region in Italy  ap. 1012-1020.  aAs ultimate sink for xenobiotics released into the environment, sediments play an important role concerning the evaluation of the fate of foreign compounds. 3,4-Dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) is a degradation product of herbicide propanil and some urea herbicides. Propanil was extensively used worldwide in rice cultivation. The aim of the study was to examine the fate of 14C-labeled 3,4-DCA in a sediment-water system; the sediment was derived from a rice field in Northern Italy. After application of 14C-3,4-DCA, a time-course study was performed using incubation periods from 4h to 56days. Fractions obtained from assays were water phase, sediment phase including methanol and Soxhlet extract as well as non-extractable residues (NER), and mineralized portion (14CO2). Soluble fractions were examined by TLC, HPLC and GC–MS. NER found in sediment phases were further fractionated in non-humics, humic acids, fulvic acids and humin. Stability of systems was checked by microbial activity, dissolved oxygen and pH. After 56days of incubation, 23.1% of applied 14C was mineralized, only 1.30% remained in the water phase, whereas 60.8% was found in the sediment phase, 53.3% of which were NER. Minor metabolites identified were 3,4-dichloroacetanilide (3,4-DCAA) and 3,3′,4,4′-tetrachloroazobenzene (TCAB; 2.63% after 56days). According to pH, dissolved oxygen and microbial activity, systems appeared to be stable and not influenced by applied 3,4-DCA. Most striking result was the high mineralization rate as compared to previously published data. This finding suggested an adaptation of the microbial community in the sediment possibly due to decade-long treatment of rice fields with propanil.  aPublisher supplied data 3adissolved oxygen 3afulvic acids 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumic acids 3ahumin 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3apH 3apaddies 3apollutants 3apropanil 3arice 3asediments 3aurea herbicides 3axenobiotics 3aItaly 0aSediment-water system 0aRice field 0a3,4-Dichloroaniline (3,4-DCA) 0a3,4-Dichloroacetanilide 0a3,3′,4,4′-Tetrachloroazobenzene 0a3,4-DCA non-extractable residues 0a3,4-DCA mineralization1 aZhang, Peng1 aSchäffer, Andreas,1 aSchmidt, Burkhard0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 574 p.1012-1020dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.0993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03282naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147072000900156072000900165100002200174245019500196300001800391500002400409520146500433650003001898650002201928650003001950650001601980650002001996650000902016650002602025650001502051650003202066650002402098650001402122650002502136650002302161650001402184650002202198650002202220650002202242650001002264650002302274653001402297653002102311700002102332773011902353852000902472856007702481856008702558930003302645945002502678946001302703655001202716IND4362480320221120175433.0040512e200312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436248032DNAL7 a10.1603/0046-225X-32.6.12902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL0011 aBianchi, F.J.J.A.14aThe effect of the area and configuration of hibernation sites on the control of aphids by Coccinella septempunctata (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in agricultural landscapes: a simulation study  ap. 1290-1304.  aIncludes references  aThe lady beetle Coccinella septempunctata L. is an important predator of aphids in arable crops, but depends on noncrop landscape elements, such as hedgerows, for hibernation. We studied the effect of the shape, area, and fragmentation of noncrop landscape elements on the control of aphids by C. septempunctata using a spatially explicit simulation model. The model is based on a description of the phenology and population dynamics of aphids and C. septempunctata, as well as the predation dynamics and dispersal characteristics of C. septempunctata. The study compares biocontrol in 12 landscapes consisting of field crops and hedgerows that differ in the shape, proportion (1, 4, 9, and 16%), and fragmentation of the hedgerow elements (hedgerow area divided into 1, 4, or 16 elements) in the landscape. Linear hedgerow elements provided better control than square elements in 3 of the 12 simulated landscapes and resulted in similar levels of control in the other nine landscapes. The total area of hedgerow habitat was the key factor for the control of aphid populations. Landscapes with 9% and 16% noncrop habitat had large enough local populations of C. septempunctata to control aphid infestations, whereas landscapes with only 1% or 4% of hibernation area had no potential for improved aphid control. In landscapes with sufficient noncrop habitat, the best control was achieved when small hedgerow elements were evenly distributed over the landscape. 3aCoccinella septempunctata 3apredatory insects 3abiological control agents 3ahibernation 3arefuge habitats 3aarea 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aAphidoidea 3apredator-prey relationships 3apopulation dynamics 3aphenology 3aspatial distribution 3adispersal behavior 3apredation 3asimulation models 3alandscape ecology 3aTriticum aestivum 3awheat 3abiological control 0ahedgerows 0anoncrop habitats1 aWerf, W. van der0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2003 Dec., v. 32, no. 6 p.1290-1304dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.entsoc.org/pubs/periodicals/ee/index.htm3electronic resource40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X-32.6.12903Available from publisher's Web site  a20050410b20050501c00000000  aINDdNZMe2004/05/20  aOther US 7aarticle03496naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245020200163520156600365592002801931650001401959650001701973650001401990650001402004650002602018650003302044650002202077650003802099650001402137650001202151650002302163650001902186650001002205650002102215650001302236650001902249650001302268650002702281650002202308650001302330650002002343650001702363650001302380650001302393700002002406700001802426700002102444700001902465700001902484700001702503700001702520700002302537700002202560700001902582700002802601700002002629773012602649856007402775852000902849655001202858IND60707874720221118035801.0200821e20200729xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070787472DNAL7 a10.3390/md180803992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Chien-Huang 10aOmega-3 Fatty Acid-Enriched Fish Oil and Selenium Combination Modulates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Response Elements and Reverses Acquired Gefitinib Resistance in HCC827 Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells  aNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-carrying specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations can be effectively treated by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor such as gefitinib. However, the inevitable development of acquired resistance leads to the eventual failure of therapy. In this study, we show the combination effect of omega-3 fatty acid-enriched fish oil (FO) and selenium (Se) on reversing the acquired gefitinib-resistance of HCC827 NSCLC cells. The gefitinib-resistant subline HCC827GR possesses lowered proapoptotic CHOP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein) and elevated cytoprotective GRP78 (glucose regulated protein of a 78 kDa molecular weight) endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response elements, and it has elevated β-catenin and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels. Combining FO and Se counteracts the above features of HCC827GR cells, accompanied by the suppression of their raised epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem markers, such as vimentin, AXL, N-cadherin, CD133, CD44, and ABCG2. Accordingly, an FO and Se combination augments the gefitinib-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis of HCC827GR cells, along with the enhanced activation of caspase -3, -9, and ER stress-related caspase-4. Intriguingly, gefitinib further increases the elevated ABCG2 and cancer stem-like side population in HCC827GR cells, which can also be diminished by the FO and Se combination. The results suggest the potential of combining FO and Se in relieving the acquired resistance of NSCLC patients to targeted therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abeta catenin 3acadherins 3acaspase-4 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aepidermal growth factor receptors 3afish oils 3aglucose 3agrowth retardation 3alung neoplasms 3alungs 3amolecular weight 3amutation 3aneoplasm cells 3apatients 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aresponse elements 3aselenium 3astress response 3atherapeutics 3atyrosine 3avimentin1 aTzeng, Yu-Tien 1 aLai, Gi-Ming 1 aChang, Chia-Lun 1 aHu, Ming-Hung 1 aTsai, Wei-Lun 1 aLiu, Yun-Ru 1 aHsia, Simon 1 aChuang, Shuang-En 1 aChiou, Tzeon-Jye 1 aWang, Le-Ming 1 aWhang-Peng, Jacqueline 1 aYao, Chih-Jung 0 tMarine drugs.g2020 July 29, v. 18, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md180803993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01757naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002900151245005700180300001600237520054200253592002800795650002300823650002200846650002000868650001500888650001100903653000800914653000800922653000800930653002100938653003200959653003500991653002101026653002501047653002301072700002001095700002501115773011201140856008601252852000901338655001201347IND60689055920221120150009.0201118e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068905592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManeesoonthorn, Worapree10aHigh-frequency jump tests: Which test should we use?  ap. 478-487.  aWe conduct an extensive evaluation of price jump tests based on high-frequency financial data.

They were claimed to outperform traditional response methods, such as category rating and magnitude estimation, because they allegedly generated ratio-level data, enabled valid comparison of individual and group differences, and were not susceptible to ceiling effects (e.g., Green, Shaffer, & Gilmore, 1993; Lim, Wood, & Green, 2009). However, none of these claims seems to be well-founded. Although responses on the LMS are highly similar to those obtained through magnitude estimation, it is questionable whether any of these methods yields ratio-level data. In addition, comparing LMS data between individuals and groups may be invalid, because LMS data vary with manipulation of experimental context. Furthermore, restricting the LMS at the upper end of the scale possibly makes it susceptible to ceiling effects. Therefore, none of the original claims seems to hold. Moreover, the LMS holds a disadvantage compared to more traditional scaling methods, in that no simple cognitive algebraic model seems to underlie its responses, which makes it unclear what LMS responses exactly signify.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3amodels 3awood0 tFood quality and preference.g2012 Dec., v. 26, no. 2 p.151-158dElsevier Ltdx0950-32937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2012.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03795naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100002000171245008400191300001400275520152100289592002801810650001101838650002301849650001301872650001901885650000901904650001401913650001201927650001901939650002001958650001501978650001201993650005202005650003702057650006002094650003402154650005002188650006602238650005902304650002502363650003302388650004702421650004602468650000902514650000902523650002302532650003802555650001102593650005902604650004402663650002002707650005702727650005202784700002102836700001802857700002102875700002402896773008302920856008603003990002303089852000903112655001203121IND60091718420221120105128.0141103e20110228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009171842DNAL7 a210811182pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2010.11.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGampe, Kristine10aEGF induces CREB and ERK activation at the wall of the mouse lateral ventricles  ap. 31-41.  aThe subependymal zone at the lateral ventricular wall represents a major neurogenic niche of the adult mammalian brain and continuously provides new neurons for the olfactory bulb. A mosaic of stem and progenitor cells in this niche has the potential to respond to multiple signals including growth factors such as EGF. Recent studies using long-term ventricular infusion of EGF demonstrate intense cell proliferation around the ventricular wall, implicating the presence of EGF-reactive cells also outside the classical neurogenic lateral niche. Here we show that intraventricular injection of EGF induces within minutes CREB and ERK phosphorylation in astrocyte-like progenitor cells (type B cells) and EGF receptor-expressing transit-amplifying progenitor cells—both in the striatal and septal ventricular walls. EGF infusion for 6days induced continued CREB and ERK activation in nestin+ cells paralleled by intense periventricular cell proliferation. In addition, the ependyma became EGF receptor-immunoreactive, revealed intense CREB phosphorylation and underwent partial de-differentiation. Our results demonstrate that intraventricular application of EGF induces CREB and ERK phosphorylation along the entire ventricular walls and thus permits a direct identification of EGF-responsive cell types. They further support the notion that not only the striatal ventricular wall where the SEZ is located but also the septal ventricular wall carries latent potential for the formation of neurons and glial cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acell proliferation 3aependyma 3agrowth factors 3amice 3aneuroglia 3aneurons 3aolfactory bulb 3aphosphorylation 3astem cells 2aAnimals 2aAstrocytesxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Proteinxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Activationxphysiology 2aEpendymaxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aEpidermal Growth Factorxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aExtracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinasesxmetabolism 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInjections, Intraventricular 2aIntermediate Filament Proteinsxmetabolism 2aLateral Ventriclesxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxmetabolism 2aNestin 2aNeural Stem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aNeurogenesisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPhosphorylation 2aStem Cell Nichexcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aStem Cellsxcytologyxdrug effectsxmetabolism.1 aBrill, Monika S.1 aMomma, Stefan1 aGötz, Magdalena1 aZimmermann, Herbert0 tBrain research.g2011 Feb. 28, v. 1376 p.31-41dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.11.0403Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245017700185300001800362520174400380592002802124650001602152650002002168650001802188650001702206650001202223650001102235650001902246650001202265650001102277650001602288650001302304650001102317650002102328653001202349653001602361653002102377653003202398700002802430700001602458700001702474700002202491773012902513856008202642852000902724655001202733IND60517475120221117160820.0190803e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051747512DNAL7 a255914462pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800140029852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKocken, Paul L10aStudents’ beliefs and behaviour regarding low-calorie beverages, sweets or snacks: are they affected by lessons on healthy food and by changes to school vending machines?  ap. 1545-1553.  aTo study the effects of school lessons about healthy food on adolescents’ self-reported beliefs and behaviour regarding the purchase and consumption of soft drinks, water and extra foods, including sweets and snacks. The lessons were combined with the introduction of lower-calorie foods, food labelling and price reductions in school vending machines. A cluster-randomized controlled design was used to allocate schools to an experimental group (i.e. lessons and changes to school vending machines) and a control group (i.e. ‘care as usual’). Questionnaires were used pre-test and post-test to assess students’ self-reported purchase of extra products and their knowledge and beliefs regarding the consumption of low-calorie products. Secondary schools in the Netherlands. Twelve schools participated in the experimental group (303 students) and fourteen in the control group (311 students). The students’ mean age was 13·6 years, 71·5 % were of native Dutch origin and mean BMI was 18·9 kg/m². At post-test, the experimental group knew significantly more about healthy food than the control group. Fewer students in the experimental group (43 %) than in the control group (56 %) reported bringing soft drinks from home. There was no significant effect on attitude, social norm, perceived behavioural control and intention regarding the consumption of low-calorie extra products. The intervention had limited effects on students’ knowledge and self-reported behaviour, and no effect on their beliefs regarding low-calorie beverages, sweets or snacks. We recommend a combined educational and environmental intervention of longer duration and engaging parents. More research into the effects of such interventions is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3afood labeling 3ahealthy diet 3aparents 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3aschools 3asnacks 3asoft drinks 3astudents 3asweets 3avending machines 0aObesity 0aEnvironment 0aHealth promotion 0aTheory of planned behaviour1 avan Kesteren, Nicole MC1 aBuijs, Goof1 aSnel, Jeltje1 aDusseldorp, Elise0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 June, v. 18, no. 9 p.1545-1553dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800140029853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011700161300002000278520130200298592002801600650001701628650001401645650002001659650001001679650001901689650001001708650001301718650001501731650001701746650001701763650001401780650001401794650001301808650000901821650001601830650002001846653001701866653001701883653004501900653002301945653001801968700001401986700001602000700001802016700001402034700001302048700001902061773012602080856008002206852000902286655001202295IND60570078920221122065803.0170708e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057007892DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b053462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Yingjuan10aImage-Guided Hydrogen Gas Delivery for Protection from Myocardial Ischemia–Reperfusion Injury via Microbubbles  ap. 21190-21199.  aCardiomyocyte death induced by ischemia–reperfusion is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Hydrogen (H₂), as an antioxidant, has been shown to have great potential in preventive and therapeutic applications against lethal injury that occurs from ischemia–reperfusion. However, H₂ is sparingly soluble in water, resulting in its poor bioavailability in blood and damaged tissues. Here, we have developed an ultrasound–visible H₂ delivery system by loading H₂ inside microbubbles (H₂-MBs) to prevent myocardial ischemia–reperfusion injury. Using this system, the concentration of H₂ in unit volume can be greatly improved under normal temperature and pressure conditions. H₂-MBs can be visually tracked with ultrasound imaging systems and can effectively release their therapeutic gas. In vivo systemic delivery of H₂-MBs in myocardial ischemic rats at the start of reperfusion resulted in a significant reduction of infarct size and pathological remodeling. Further analysis showed that this approach markedly inhibited cardiomyocyte apoptosis and reduced myocardial inflammation and oxidant damage in myocardial ischemia–reperfusion rats. These results indicate that H₂-MBs are a promising visual delivery system for H₂-based therapeutic applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3aapoptosis 3abioavailability 3ablood 3acardiomyocytes 3adeath 3ahydrogen 3ainfarction 3ainflammation 3amicrobubbles 3amorbidity 3amortality 3aoxidants 3arats 3atemperature 3aultrasonography 0aHydrogen gas 0amicrobubbles 0amyocardial ischemia−reperfusion injury 0aultrasound imaging 0adrug delivery1 aZhang, Bo1 aChen, Yihan1 aJin, Qiaofeng1 aWu, Junru1 aYan, Fei1 aZheng, Hairong0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 June 28, v. 9, no. 25 p.21190-21199dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b053463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012200167300001600289520138300305592002801688650001001716650001601726650002501742650001201767650001701779650000901796650001901805650002001824653000901844653003901853653002001892653002301912700001601935700001401951700001801965700001701983700001802000773009502018856008402113852000902197655001202206IND60568731920221119062128.0190416e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056873192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Weiwei10aFouling of extracellular algal organic matter during ultrafiltration: The influence of iron and the fouling mechanism  ap. 252-262.  aIn this study, membrane fouling and the mechanism of algal extracellular organic matter (EOM) due to various trace heavy metals (iron) during ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated in detail. In both early and late exponential growth phases, the results indicated that the membrane fouling caused by EOM at low iron concentrations in this study was more severe than that at high and normal iron concentrations. Low iron concentrations produced the highest total (R) and reversible fouling resistance (Rre), of which Rre was higher, followed by membrane resistance (Rm), and irreversible fouling resistance (Rir). The analysis of EOM characteristics indicated that low iron in this study stimulated the growth of algae beyond high and normal iron concentrations, including increases in chlorophyll a; protein (tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like organic matter) content; and macro, medium and small molecular organic matters. Humic-like organics were more synthesized under high iron concentrations. Analyses of membrane fouling behavior illustrated that cake formation was the major fouling mechanism for the three iron concentrations, and it accounted for a greater proportion of fouling in the low iron concentration than in the other two iron concentrations; cake resistance played a more critical role in the late exponential growth phase than in the primary exponential phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3achlorophyll 3adevelopmental stages 3afouling 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aorganic matter 3aultrafiltration 0aIron 0aAlgal extracellular organic matter 0aUltrafiltration 0aFouling resistance1 aHu, Mengliu1 aQin, Xiao1 aZhou, Wenzong1 aLv, Weiguang1 aDong, Bingzhi0 tAlgal research.g2017 July, v. 25 p.252-262dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12360x2211-92647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.algal.2017.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03207naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014300185300001800328520162300346592002801969650001501997650002802012650001802040650002302058650001702081650001702098650001502115650002202130650001002152650001302162650002002175650001902195650002402214650002502238650001902263650001302282651001102295653002802306653003502334653001902369700001902388700002202407700002102429700001902450773012902469856008202598852000902680655001202689IND60517475220221117160805.0190803e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051747522DNAL7 a255918052pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800140031392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorin, Pascale10aDo schools in Quebec foster healthy eating? An overview of associations between school food environment and socio-economic characteristics  ap. 1635-1646.  aA school environment that encourages students to opt for food with sound nutritional value is both essential and formative in ensuring that young people adopt healthy eating habits. The present study explored the associations between the socio-economic characteristics of the school environment and the school food environment. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2008–2009. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed on data from public primary and secondary schools. Quebec, Canada. The school food offering was observed directly and systematically by trained research assistants. Interviews were conducted to fully describe food offerings in the schools and schools’ child-care services. A two-stage stratified sampling was used to build a representative sample of 143 French-speaking public schools. The response rate was 66·2 %. The primary and secondary schools in low-density areas were more likely to be located near diners (primary: P=0·018; secondary: P=0·007). The secondary schools in deprived areas were less likely to have a regular food committee (P=0·004), to seek student input on menu choices (P=0·001) or to have a long lunch period (P=0·010). The primary schools in deprived areas were less likely to have a food service (P=0·025) and their meal periods were shorter (P=0·033). The schools in areas with lower socio-economic status provided an environment less favourable for a healthy diet. From a public health perspective, the results of this analysis could assist policy makers and managers to identify actions to support the creation of favourable school environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3achild care 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3aelementary schools 3afood service 3ahealthy diet 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3alunch 3amanagers 3anutritive value 3apublic schools 3asecondary education 3asocioeconomic status 3asocioeconomics 3astudents 3aQuebec 0aSchool food environment 0aSocio-economic characteristics 0aHealthy eating1 aDemers, Karine1 aRobitaille, Eric,1 aLebel, Alexandre1 aBisset, Sherri0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 June, v. 18, no. 9 p.1635-1646dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800140031393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300002000274520145500294592002801749650001201777650001201789650001301801650001101814650001901825650002501844650001501869650001701884650000901901650001201910650001501922650001101937650001401948650000901962650001401971650002301985650000902008651001002017700001202027700001502039700001202054700001602066773017002082856008202252852000902334655001202343IND60579837820221121032101.0180619e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057983782DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9874-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xingjuan10aHeavy metal pollution in sediments of the largest reservoir (Three Gorges Reservoir) in China: a review  ap. 20844-20858.  aThe Three Gorges Dam in China is the world’s largest dam. Upon its completion in 2003, the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) became the largest reservoir in China and plays an important role in economic development and national drinking water safety. However, as a sink and source of heavy metals, there is a lack of continuous and comparative data on heavy metal pollution in sediments. This study reviewed all available literatures published on heavy metals in TGR sediments and further provided a comprehensive assessment of the pollution tendency of these heavy metals. The results showed that heavy metal concentrations in TGR sediments varied spatially and temporally. Temporal variations indicated that Hg in tributaries, as well as As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn in the mainstream, exhibited a higher probability to exceed background values after the impoundment of TGR. Pollution assessments by contamination factor, geoaccumulation index, and potential ecological risk were similar. High Cd and Hg concentrations in both the mainstream and tributaries are a cause for much concern. However, sediment quality guidelines produced different results, as most previous studies adopted different sampling and measurement strategies. The data inconsistencies and lack of continuity regarding the reservoir confirm the need for a continuous monitoring network and the development of quality criteria relevant to the sediments of the TGR in the future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3achromium 3acopper 3adrinking water 3aeconomic development 3aguidelines 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amercury 3amonitoring 3anickel 3apollution 3arisk 3asediments 3atemporal variation 3azinc 3aChina1 aGao, Bo1 aXu, Dongyu1 aGao, Li1 aYin, Shuhua0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 26 p.20844-20858dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9874-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03033naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005600111040001800167100001700185245010600202300001800308500002000326500001500346520163900361592002802000650002402028650001102052650002802063650001402091650002202105650002202127650002402149650001702173650003702190650002302227650001402250650002402264653001502288653002202303700002502325700002402350773009802374852000902472856010602481655001202587IND4386667320221121005905.0170626e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438666732DNAL7 a168694122pmid7 a10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1378:TCERTF]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, Graham14aThe comparative evidence relating to functional and neutral interpretations of biological communities  ap. 1378-1386.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a2019-12-04  aNeutral and functional theories provide rival interpretations of community patterns involving distribution, abundance, and diversity. One group of patterns describes the overall properties of species or sites, and derives principally from the frequency distribution of abundance among species. According to neutral theory, these patterns are determined by the number of individuals of novel type appearing each generation in the community, whereas functional theory relates them to the distribution of the extent of niches. A second group of patterns describes the spatial attributes of communities, and derives principally from the decay of similarity in species composition with distance. Neutral theory interprets these patterns as consequences of local dispersal alone, whereas the functional interpretation is that more distant sites are likely to be ecologically different. Neutral theory often provides good predictions of community patterns, yet is at variance with a wide range of experimental results involving the manipulation of environments or communities. One explanation for this discrepancy is that spatially explicit models where selection is generally weak, or where selection acts strongly on only a few species at each site, have essentially the same output as neutral models with respect to the distribution of abundance and the decay of similarity. Detecting a non‐neutral signal in survey data requires careful spatial or phylogenetic analysis; we emphasize the potential utility of incorporating phylogenetic information in order to detect functional processes that lead to ecological variation among clades.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3aniches 3apopulation distribution 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3aspatial variation 3aecological function 2aBiodiversity 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aModels, Biological 2aPhylogeny 2aPopulation Dynamics 0aspeciation 0acommunity ecology1 aLechowicz, Martin J.1 aWaterway, Marcia J.0 tEcology.g2006 June, v. 87, no. 6 p.1378-1386dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87%5B1378:TCERTF%5D2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02657naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016100165300002000326520134300346592002801689650002601717650001001743650002301753650002101776650001501797650001201812650004301824650002401867650000901891700001701900700001401917700001401931700001401945700002001959700001901979773017001998856008202168852000902250655001202259IND60579838220221116191040.0180619e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057983822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9623-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mianzhi10aFate of antimicrobial resistance genes in response to application of poultry and swine manure in simulated manure-soil microcosms and manure-pond microcosms  ap. 20949-20958.  aThis study aimed to determine the occurrence, abundance, and fate of nine important antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) (sul1, sul2, tetB, tetM, ermB, ermF, fexA, cfr, and Intl1) in the simulated soil and pond microcosms following poultry and swine manure application. Absolute quantitative PCR method was used to determine the gene copies. The results were modeled as a logarithmic regression (N = mlnt + b) to explore the fate of target genes. Genes sul1, Intl1, sul2, and tetM had the highest abundance following the application of the two manure types. The logarithmic regression model fitted the results well (R ² values up to 0.99). The reduction rate of all genes (except for the genes fexA and cfr) in manure-pond microcosms was faster than those in manure-soil microcosms. Importantly, sul1, intl1, sul2, and tetM had the lowest reduction rates in all the samples and the low reduction rates of tetM was the first time to be reported. These results indicated that ARG management should focus on using technologies for the ARG elimination before the manure applications rather than waiting for subsequent attenuation in soil or water, particularly the ARGs (such as sul1, intl1, sul2, and tetM investigated in this study) that had high abundance and low reduction rate in the soil and water after application of manure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3agenes 3agenetic resistance 3amanure spreading 3apig manure 3apoultry 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aregression analysis 3asoil1 aSun, Yongxue1 aLiu, Peng1 aSun, Jing1 aZhou, Qin1 aXiong, Wenguang1 aZeng, Zhenling0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 26 p.20949-20958dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9623-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03918naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100005100158245013100209300001600340520181500356592002802171650002102199650001902220650002302239650002602262650002302288650002902311650002102340650001902361650000902380650001202389650002102401650001102422650001802433650000902451650002302460650001302483650001302496650002102509650001502530650001102545650002702556650001602583653001902599653002702618653001602645653002102661700005602682700005502738700005802793700005602851700005402907700005402961773020003015856009203215852000903307655001203316IND60648615220221120210211.0190701e20190408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064861522DNAL7 a10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2019.02.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShu, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3872-554410aModelling Soil Greenhouse Gas Fluxes from a Broad-Leaved Korean Pine Forest in Changbai Mountain: Forest-DNDC Model Validation  ap. 127-136.  aFluctuations in soil greenhouse gas (GHG) are an important part of the terrestrial ecosystem carbon-nitrogen cycle, but uncertainties remain about the dynamic change and budget assessment of soil GHG flux. Using high frequency and consecutive soil GHG fluxes measured with an automatic dynamic chamber system, we tested the applicability of the current Forest-DNDC model in simulating soil CH₄, CO₂ and N₂O fluxes in a temperate broad-leaved Korean pine forest at Changbai Mountain. The results showed that the Forest-DNDC model reproduced general patterns of environmental variables, however, simulated seasonal variation in soil temperature, snow melt processes and soil moisture partly deviated from measured variables, especially during the non-growing season. The modeled CH₄ flux was close to the field measurement and co-varied mainly with soil temperature and snowpack. The modeled soil CO₂ flux had the same seasonal trend to that of the observation along with variation in temperature, however, simulated CO₂ flux in the growing season was underestimated. The modeled N₂O flux attained a peak in summer due to the influence of temperature, which was apparently different from the observed peak of N₂O flux in the freeze-thaw period. Meanwhile, both modeled CO₂ flux and N₂O flux were dampened by rainfall events. Apart from consistent estimation of annual soil CH₄ flux, the annual accumulation of CO₂ and N₂O was underestimated. It is still necessary to further optimize model parameters and processes using long-term high-frequency observation data, especially transference of heat and water in soil and GHG producing mechanism. Continues work will improve modeling, ecosystem carbon-nitrogen budget assessment and estimation of soil GHGs flux from the site to the region.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus koraiensis 3acarbon dioxide 3aconiferous forests 3aenvironmental factors 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agrowing season 3aheat 3amethane 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anitrous oxide 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3asoil temperature 3asoil water 3asummer 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3auncertainty 0asoil GHGs flux 0adynamic chamber method 0aforest-DNDC 0atemperate forest1 aChuying, Guo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3223-14581 aJiayin, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8474-39491 aLeiming, Zhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6002-88521 aGuanhua, Dai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8861-217X1 aXuefa, Wen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2340-48951 aGuirui, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1859-89660 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2019 Apr. 8, v. 10, no. 2 p.127-136dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of ScienceswJournal:2202x1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2019.02.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245005900173300001600232520080800248592002801056650002901084650001801113650002001131650002101151650002601172650001701198650002101215650001301236650001201249650001201261650001101273650001001284650001301294650001701307651001301324653001101337653002301348653002301371653002201394653001301416700001701429700002501446773011601471856005101587852000901638655001201647IND50088688420221119202410.0140414e20110901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008868842DNAL7 a10.1080/10549811.2011.5487612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatkhuu, Nyam-Osor10aForest and Forestry Research and Education in Mongolia  ap. 600-617.  aSince 1990, after the dramatic change in Mongolia's political and economic system, human impact on forest resources highly increased and became continuously degraded due to improper exploitation, forest fire, mining, pest and disease, uncontrolled grazing, and inadequate management which negatively affect its environmental conditions causing severe deforestation, desertification, and ecological stress in some regions of the country.

To investigate whether seed osmopriming could develop tolerance to drought stress during post-germinative stages of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we primed the seeds of a drought-sensitive cultivar (Yangmai 16) by following a pre-standardized protocol of −0.9MPa PEG at 18°C for 30h, and then dried at room temperature. The plants from unprimed and primed seeds were simultaneously exposed to a severe drought stress during tillering (Feekes 2 stage) and jointing (Feekes 6 stage), respectively, and we investigated the changes in leaf water relations, photosynthetic processes, lipid peroxidation, antioxidative defense, and relative growth rate during drought. Moreover, grain yield traits were recorded at maturity. Drought stress caused a reduction in leaf water potential, relative water content, net photosynthesis, quantum yield, and contents of chlorophylls and carotenoids; however, the decrease in these traits was less in primed-seed plants as compared to unprimed-seed plants. During drought stress, primed-seed plants showed lower reactive oxygen species formation and lipid peroxidation, and higher activities of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and glutathione reductase than unprimed-seed plants. Seed osmopriming treatment allowed wheat plants to maintain a greater relative growth rate during the drought period, resulting in higher dry matter and grain yield production relative to non-priming treatments. It was concluded that seed osmopriming resulted in long-lasting stress memory, which stabilized plant growth and productivity by altering physiological and biochemical responses to post-germinative drought stress in wheat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aambient temperature 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acarotenoids 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3agermination 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3agrain yield 3aleaf water potential 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aosmotic treatment 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant growth 3areactive oxygen species 3aseed priming 3aseeds 3atillering 3awater content 3awater stress 3awheat 0aPEG seed-priming 0aDrought stress 0aVegetative stages 0aRelative growth rate 0aLeaf water relations 0aStress tolerance1 aHakeem, Abdul1 aShao, Yuhang1 aLiu, Yang1 aZahoor, Rizwan1 aFan, Yonghui1 aSuyu, Jiang1 aAta-Ul-Karim, Syed Tahir1 aTian, Zhongwei1 aJiang, Dong1 aSnider, J.

The purpose of this research was to determine the occurrence, genetic characteristics, and zoonotic potential of Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia duodenalis in captive mammals at the Bangladesh National Zoo. A total of 200 fresh fecal samples from 32 mammalian species were collected and examined for Cryptosporidium spp. using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene and G. duodenalis targeting the β-giardin (bg), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), and triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) genes. The overall infection rates of Cryptosporidium and G. duodenalis among captive mammals in the zoo were 3.5% (7/200) and 5.5% (11/200), respectively. Five species/genotypes of Cryptosporidium (C. hominis, C. andersoni, C. muris, C. felis, and Cryptosporidium deer genotype) were identified. C. hominis was subtyped as IbA12G3 by sequence analysis of the glycoprotein 60 (gp60) gene. Multilocus genotyping of G. duodenalis revealed assemblages A, B, and D. Mixed infections of assemblages B and D and A and B were found in an Asiatic jackal and a Nilgiri langur, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the occurrence and genetic identity of the two parasites among zoo animals in Bangladesh. The results suggest that zoonotic Cryptosporidium spp. and G. duodenalis are maintained in and transmitted between captive mammals. Therefore, washing, cleaning, and disinfection measures should be implemented to reduce the spread of Cryptosporidium and G. duodenalis infections.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGiardia lamblia 3adeer 3adisinfection 3agastrointestinal diseases 3agenes 3agenotype 3agenotyping 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglycoproteins 3ajackals 3aparasitology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 3atriose-phosphate isomerase 3azoonoses 3azoos 3aBangladesh 0aCryptosporidium 0aGiardia duodenalis 0aMultilocus genotyping 0aZoo animals1 aLi, Junqiang1 aRume, Farzana Islam1 aSumon, Sm.

Still, the impact of these factors has been hardly studied in a quantitative manner. This study aims to analyze the differential effects of ecosystem type and valuation method on the values estimated for ecosystem services, as well as the potential impact of these effects on aggregated values for ecosystem services. Drylands pose a highly relevant case to investigate these impacts, because they are particularly diverse in ecosystem types, the provided ecosystem services and, hence, are also expected to be estimated with various methods. Our analysis is based on a quantitative analysis of monetary estimates for ecosystem services (expressed in Int$/ha/yr) that were compiled in a comprehensive database containing 512 observations from 57 studies located in drylands worldwide. Our results reveal that the estimated values for dryland ecosystem services depended on the type of ecosystem and method under consideration. Several of these differential effects had a significant impact on the aggregated mean values for dryland ecosystem services. Cultivated lands had high mean values for provisioning services, in particular for food provision, but low values for regulating services. In dry forests, biodiversity-related services were estimated high, in contrast to semi-deserts and arid wetlands. Compared with other methods, market pricing estimated low values for climate regulation and high values for biological regulation. When values were aggregated for ecosystem services, market pricing was found to impact the mean value for climate and biological regulation significantly. Our results highlight the importance of explicit consideration of methods and ecosystem types in monetary valuation, which could lead to more accurate approximation of ecosystem service values.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3adatabases 3adry environmental conditions 3adry forests 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aquantitative analysis 3awetlands 0aDryland 0aEcosystem service 0aMonetary valuation 0aDifferential effect 0aValuation method 0aEcosystem type1 aVermaat, Jan E.1 avan Bodegom, Peter M.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2018 Dec., v. 159 p.11-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2017.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002700139245016600166520143100332592002801763650001201791650000801803650001801811650001401829650002701843650001001870650001401880650001301894650001201907650001501919650001201934651002201946700002101968700002301989700002902012700001802041773012202059856007302181852000902254655001202263IND60742509220221119024702.0210624e20210521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074250922DNAL7 a10.3390/d130602202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoya Cañas, Patricia,10aUnravelling the Symbiotic Microalgal Diversity in Buellia zoharyi (Lichenized Ascomycota) from the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands Using DNA Metabarcoding  aBuellia zoharyi is a crustose placodioid lichen, usually occurring on biocrusts of semiarid ecosystems in circum-Mediterranean/Macaronesian areas. In previous work, we found that this lichenized fungus was flexible in its phycobiont choice in the Canary Islands. Here we test whether geography and habitat influence phycobiont diversity in populations of this lichen from the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands using Sanger and high throughput sequencing (HTS). Additionally, three thallus section categories (central, middle and periphery) were analyzed to explore diversity of microalgal communities in each part. We found that B. zoharyi populations hosted at least three different Trebouxia spp., and this lichen can associate with distinct phycobiont strains in different habitats and geographic regions. This study also revealed that the Trebouxia composition of this lichen showed significant differences when comparing the Iberian Peninsula with the Balearics thalli. No support for differences in microalgal communities was found among thallus sections; however, several thalli showed different predominant Trebouxia spp. at each section. This result corroborate that thallus parts selected for DNA extraction in metabarcoding analyses are key to not bias the total phycobiont diversity detected. This study highlights that inclusion of HTS analysis is crucial to understand lichen symbiotic microalgal diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBuellia 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aTrebouxia 3abiological soil crusts 3afungi 3ageography 3ahabitats 3alichens 3amicroalgae 3athallus 3aIberian Peninsula1 aChiva, Salvador 1 aMolins, Arantzazu 1 aGarrido-Benavent, Isaac 1 aBarreno, Eva 0 tDiversity.g2021 May 21, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130602203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02972naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245013400169300001600303520165700319592002801976650002502004650002302029650002202052650002102074650001202095650002202107650002102129650002302150650001102173651001002184653002202194653002902216653001102245653002302256653002402279700001402303700001502317700001302332773009902345856008502444852000902529655001202538IND60568732320221119062456.0190416e201708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056873232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSheng, Wenping10aDetermining eco-compensation standards based on the ecosystem services value of the mountain ecological forests in Beijing, China  ap. 422-430.  aEcological forests play a key role in the maintenance of urban ecological security in Beijing, and 91% of these ecosystems are located in mountain areas. To better address the issues that are related to ecological conservation and the environmental, eco-compensation programs that target mountain ecological forests have been implemented by the local government since 2004. However, these eco-compensation programs that are currently conducted in Beijing now are still confronted with issues regarding payment standards. In this study, three eco-compensation standards for the mountain ecological forests in Beijing are presented based on the ecosystem services value and location diversity indicators that include major function oriented zoning, population density, and ecological importance and ecological fragility. The average payment in Beijing varies from 1607RMB/ha/a to 2051RMB/ha/a and is approximately from 0.7 to 1.2 times higher than the current standard. The increase from the current payment standard to the recommended ones is consistent with recent social and economic development in Beijing. The recommended eco-compensation standards also reflect the relative importance of forest ecosystem services that consider geographical location. These recommended standards also have the potential for use in the establishment of differentiated compensation standards based on the different protection results of mountain ecological forests. This study will help policy and decision makers to design eco-compensation initiatives with a high success rate and contribute to the conservation and sustainability of the forest resources in Beijing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aecosystem services 3aforest ecosystems 3aforest resources 3aforests 3aissues and policy 3alocal government 3apopulation density 3azoning 3aChina 0aEcological forest 0aEcosystem services value 0aSublot 0aLocation diversity 0aAdjusting indicator1 aZhen, Lin1 aXie, Gaodi1 aXiao, Yu0 tEcosystem services.g2017 Aug., v. 26 p.422-430dElsevier B.V.wJournal:21609x2212-04167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2017.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02649naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245009800160300002000258520100900278592002801287650002601315650002101341650001801362650001001380650001601390650001701406650001901423650001401442650001501456650001701471650002801488650001301516653002901529653001601558653003001574653003001604653002201634700001701656700001701673700001601690700001301706700001501719700001601734700001301750700001701763700001401780700001601794700001401810700001801824700001401842773012601856856008001982852000902062655001202071IND60570079620221122093915.0170708e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057007962DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b056622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Yuping10aReal-Time Imaging of Endocytosis and Intracellular Trafficking of Semiconducting Polymer Dots  ap. 21200-21208.  aSemiconducting polymer dots (Pdots) have shown great promise in biomedical applications, including biosensing, drug delivery, and live imaging of cells and biomolecules. Insight into the mechanism and regulation of cellular uptake and intracellular metabolism of Pdots is important for the development of superior Pdots-based theranostic nanoconjugates. Herein, we performed real-time imaging of endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of a type of fluorescent Pdots that showed excellent biocompatibility in various types of cells. The endocytic routes and kinetics of Pdots were differently regulated in distinct cell types. Following endocytosis, Pdots were transported in vesicles along microtubule and destined for lysosomes. Furthermore, our results revealed exosome-mediated extracellular release of Pdots and have tracked the dynamic process at the single particle level. These results provide new insight into the design of more effective and selective imaging probes as well as drug carriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical compounds 3abiocompatibility 3adrug carriers 3adrugs 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3aimage analysis 3alysosomes 3ametabolism 3amicrotubules 3aphysiological transport 3apolymers 0afluorescent polymer dots 0aendocytosis 0aintracellular trafficking 0atheranostic nanoparticles 0alive cell imaging1 aLi, Xiaoming1 aChen, Haobin1 aHu, Xingjie1 aLuo, Yao1 aWang, Ting1 aWang, Zejun1 aLi, Qian1 aFan, Chunhai1 aShi, Jiye1 aWang, Lihua1 aZhao, Yun1 aWu, Changfeng1 aChen, Nan0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 June 28, v. 9, no. 25 p.21200-21208dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b056623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02329naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245009900159300001300258520104500271592002801316650004401344650001501388650001301403650001101416650002601427650001101453650001101464650001901475650001501494650001101509650001601520650001301536650001201549650001101561700001401572700001301586700002101599700002001620700001301640700002001653773010801673856008101781852000901862655001201871IND60121401920221120234818.0150408e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012140192DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-014-2006-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, C.10aNew Insights into the Role of Chemical Components on Metal Ions Sorption by Grape Stalks Waste  ap. 2006.  aIn this work, metal sorption onto grape stalks waste structural compounds and extractives has been studied for determining their role in Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Ni(II) metal sorption. For this purpose, a sequential extraction of extractives and other compounds from the lignocellulosic material has been carried out. The resulting solid samples obtained in the different extraction processes were used as sorbents of Cr(VI), Cu(II) and Ni(II). Sorption results were discussed taking into account the elemental composition and polarity of the solid extracts. Results indicated that tannins and polyphenols are involved in chromium reduction and sorption. Lignin and celluloses are involved in chromium, Cu(II) and Ni(II) sorption. FTIR analysis confirmed the involvement of lignin moieties in the studied metal ions sorption by grape stalks waste. This study presents a new approach on metal sorption field as the knowledge of the role of the sorbent chemical compounds is essential to determine the key sorbent compounds in the sorption process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3achromium 3acopper 3aelemental composition 3agrapes 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3ametal ions 3anickel 3apolyphenols 3asorption 3atannins 3awastes1 aPujol, D.1 aFiol, N.1 aOlivella, M.

Aquatic products were extracted with acetonitrile and primarily purified by dispersive solid-phase extraction with graphitized carbon black as absorbent. The pretreated acetonitrile extract was detected by UHPLC-MS/MS. UHPLC was carried out on Dikma Endeavorsil C₁₈ (30 mm × 2.1 mm, 1.8 μm) column eluted by methanol and water (80:20 v/v) at a rate of 0.30 mL min⁻¹. Tandem mass spectrometry was performed by electrospray ionization in negative ion mode to identify and quantify eugenol during multiple reaction monitoring. Under optimized analytical conditions, the matrix-matched spiked calibration sample demonstrates good linearity between 5.0 and 500.0 μg kg⁻¹ with a linear regression coefficient of 0.9996. The average recovery of eugenol from aquatic products is 95.3–103.4% at spiked levels between 5 and 50 μg kg⁻¹ with a relative standard deviation (n = 6) less than 5.4%. The limits of detection and quantification for eugenol were calculated to be 1.47 and 4.91 μg kg⁻¹, respectively. In comparison with those reported, the proposed method has advantages in low detection limit, high recovery, and short analysis time, meeting the requirements for the determination of trace eugenol residue in aquatic products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aacetonitrile 3acarp 3acrabs 3adetection limit 3aeugenol 3aionization 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3aregression analysis 3ashrimp 3asolid phase extraction 3asoot 3atandem mass spectrometry 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aGao, Yuling1 aLian, Yongfu0 tFood analytical methods.g2017 Oct., v. 10, no. 10 p.3217-3224dSpringer USx1936-97517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-017-0882-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03260naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245020700173520171200380592002802092650001902120650002002139650001202159650001202171650001602183650001302199650001702212650001602229650002002245650001802265650001002283650003502293650002802328650001402356650001202370650001702382650002202399651001202421653001302433653001502446653001302461653002102474700002002495700002002515700001802535773010702553856008502660852000902745655001202754IND60743960320221119213428.0210918e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074396032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.parint.2021.1024182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakeuchi-Storm, N.10aSystematic examination of the cardiopulmonary, urogenital, muscular and gastrointestinal parasites of the Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) in Denmark, a protected species recovering from a dramatic decline  aThe Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) is a protected species in Denmark and at present, the population is recovering due to conservation efforts. The Danish otters are mainly found in the continental part of Denmark (Jutland), but establishment in the main islands (Fyn and Zealand) has been observed. While there is a lack of systematic studies on the parasite fauna of otters in Denmark, this study aims to screen otters for their parasite fauna, especially those of zoonotic and/or veterinary importance. Thirty-three otter carcasses, road-killed (n = 30), found dead (n = 2) and shot (n = 1), were collected between June 2013 and May 2014 and examined for cardiopulmonary, urogenital, gastrointestinal, and muscle helminths by post mortem examination. Faecal samples were analysed by modified concentration McMaster technique and direct immunofluorescence test for Giardia and Cryptosporidium. At least one parasite was found in 75.8% of animals. The parasite fauna included 13 species, consisting of five nematodes: Molineus patens (30.3%), Aonchotheca putorii (27.3%), Strongyloides sp. (24.2%), Physaloptera sp. (12.1%), Eucoleus aerophilus (10.0%); one cestode: Schistocephalus solidius (6.1%); four trematodes: Metorchis bilis (33.3%), Isthimiophora melis (15.2%), Cryptocotyle sp. (3.0%), Plagiorchis sp. (3.0%); one acanthocephalan: Acanthocephalus ranae (18.2%); and two protozoans: Giardia spp. (3.1%), and Eimeria spp. (3.1%). The study showed that otters carry parasites of zoonotic and veterinary importance. Many of these parasites can also infect native carnivores and birds, and the distribution of these parasites may be affected if the otter population continue to increase in Denmark.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcanthocephala 3aCryptosporidium 3aEimeria 3aGiardia 3aLutra lutra 3aMolineus 3aPhysaloptera 3aPlagiorchis 3aSchistocephalus 3aStrongyloides 3afauna 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminths 3amuscles 3aparasitology 3aprotected species 3aDenmark 0aZoonotic 0aVeterinary 0aWildlife 0aBiliary parasite1 aAl-Sabi, M.N.S.1 aChriel, Mariann1 aEnemark, H.L.0 tParasitology international.g2021 Oct., v. 84 p.102418-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12048x1383-57697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.parint.2021.1024183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245007200177300001800249500001500267520092300282592002801205650001201233650002201245650002601267650001101293650001501304650001201319650001101331650001701342650002101359650003801380650001001418650002401428650001001452650001201462650002101474653001601495653002001511700001701531700001901548700002201567700001901589773009501608856008501703852000901788655001201797IND60113963820221118205647.0141112e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011396382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2011.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoseph, Narcisse M.S.10aProduction of long helical capsid of Nipah virus by Pichia pastoris  ap. 1871-1874.  a2019-12-04  aThe nucleocapsid (N) protein of Nipah virus (NiV) produced in a recombinant host can replace the use of inactivated virus as a diagnostic reagent because it is safer and affordable. The aim of this study was to express the N protein in Pichia pastoris. The N gene of NiV was cloned into the yeast expression vector, pPICZ B and expressed in P. pastoris. The recombinant N protein of NiV was purified using sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation and was confirmed with Western blotting using rabbit anti-N antibody. The P. pastoris expressed N protein self-assembled into helical structures as large as 1.5μm as shown in an electron micrograph. ELISA analysis performed with the swine sera obtained during the viral outbreak proved that the recombinant N protein to be highly antigenic. The NiV N protein produced in P. pastoris serves as an alternative to the recombinant N protein produced in Escherichia coli.  aPublisher supplied data 3arabbits 3aNipah henipavirus 3aKomagataella pastoris 3acapsid 3aantibodies 3asucrose 3ayeasts 3anucleocapsid 3aWestern blotting 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aswine 3aultracentrifugation 3agenes 3aviruses 3aEscherichia coli 0aNipah virus 0aPichia pastoris1 aTey, Beng Ti1 aTan, Chon Seng1 aShafee, Norazizah1 aTan, Wen Siang0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Sept., v. 46, no. 9 p.1871-1874dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03599naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009700164300001800261520178400279592002802063596006202091596006702153596006702220596008402287596001902371650001202390650002002402650003202422650001402454650001702468650001002485650002102495650001902516650002002535650001302555650001302568650001802581650001102599650001602610650002102626650001902647700001602666700001602682700001702698700001902715700001802734700001902752700001702771700001402788773013902802856008302941852000903024655001203033IND60792872720221118052130.0220910e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079287272DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-022-03234-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiong10aSimulated warming and low O2 promote N2O and N2 emissions in subtropical montane forest soil  ap. 2706-2719.  aPURPOSE: The montane subtropical forest soils contain huge nitrogen stocks, and climate warming might drive its volatilization due to the promotion of gaseous losses of nitrous oxide (N₂O) and dinitrogen (N₂), contributing a positive feedback to promote further warming. However, it is unclear how temperature increase in subtropical forests affects the loss of gaseous N and the mediated microbial mechanisms. METHODS: In this study, we employed the acetylene inhibition technique and molecular method to quantify N₂O and N₂ emissions as well as its microbial pathways under simulated warming and oxygen (O₂) conditions in a subtropical forest (> 300 years old) soil. RESULTS: During the aerobic incubation, short-term increase of temperature of 2 ℃ caused an increase in N₂O emission by a factor of 4.8, while under anaerobic conditions, N₂O and N₂ emissions increased 18- and 1.9-fold, respectively, thus leading to a significant increase of the ratio of N₂O/(N₂O + N₂). Structural equation modeling showed that the increased potential of N₂O loss under simulated warming could be explained by the reduction of nosZ-I gene abundance and thus the less N₂O reduction to N₂, as well as the promotion on SOC mineralization by the temperature increase, which provides more substrate DOC and nitrate for denitrification. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest the nitrate substrate concentration and availability, together with the abundance variation of denitrifiers to produce and emit N₂O, resulted the consequence of the increased N₂O in response to the temperature increasing. Results contribute to the accurately establish models of N₂O and N₂ emissions in the subtropical montane forest soils and the budgets of global greenhouse gas.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018BC007cYunnan Science and Technology Planning Project  a202201AT070165cYunnan Science and Technology Planning Project  a202101AT070178cYunnan Science and Technology Planning Project  a202101BC070002cthe Major Program for Basic Research Project of Yunnan Province  a21107109cNSFC 3aclimate 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aequations 3aforest soils 3agenes 3agreenhouse gases 3amineralization 3amontane forests 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3atemperature 3atropical forests 3avolatilization1 aZhu, Yingmo1 aXu, Yunjian1 aLi, Xiangnan1 aZhang, Shuting1 aQian, Qindong1 aWang, Lingling1 aWu, Jianping1 aChen, Zhe0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2022 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.2706-2719dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03234-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005300146245007400199300001800273520102000291592002801311596006501339596018601404650002001590650001001610650001201620650001101632650003101643650001701674650001901691653000901710653004101719653002801760653001601788700001601804700005501820700005801875700001601933700002001949700001101969773012301980856008002103852000902183655001202192IND60662471920221120200220.0190904e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066247192DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175188119412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7731-020812aA potential brain zone perceiving a comfortable fabric pressure touch  ap. 3499-3505.  aThe present study was carried out with a new approach to evaluating the comfort of fabric contact pressure. Functional magnetic resonance imaging technology was conducted to monitor brain response when a comfortable fabric contact pressure, according to the subjective evaluation, was applied to the skin surface of the lower human chest. After a strict method of calibration with a family-wise error check analysis, the study we performed revealed the right secondary somatosensory cortex appeared prominently positively activated under a comfortable fabric pressure state. This suggested the secondary somatosensory cortex brain region, particularly the right secondary somatosensory cortex, was probably the characteristic brain region for fabric comfort perception. A reasonable explanation was that proper contact pressure facilitated the serial information flow from the primary somatosensory cortex to the secondary somatosensory cortex, and comfortable touch stimulated the firing of A-beta afferent nerves.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2017BEM041cShandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation  a2016YFC0802800cExemplary Projects of the Research on Mechanism of Body Injury in the Disaster Environment and Research and Development of Rescue Protection Technology and Equipment 3acerebral cortex 3achest 3afabrics 3ahumans 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3anerve tissue 3atextile fibers 0afMRI 0aright secondary somatosensory cortex 0afabric contact pressure 0acomfortable1 aYu, Weidong1 aWang, Qicai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0337-54841 aXu, Changliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7953-01081 aChen, Kemin1 aZhang, Zhongwei1 aLi, Yi0 tTextile research journal.g2019 Sept., v. 89, no. 17 p.3499-3505dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175188119413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014900172300001600321520132100337592002801658650001301686650001101699650002701710650001001737651001901747651001701766651001301783653001601796653001401812653002501826653001901851653002301870700001601893700005201909700001501961700001401976700001401990773010902004856008802113852000902201655001202210IND60584140620221120022056.0190318e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058414062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrimsditch, G.10aVariation in size frequency distribution of coral populations under different fishing pressures in two contrasting locations in the Indian Ocean  ap. 146-155.  aThis study aimed to assess how the size-frequency distributions of coral genera varied between reefs under different fishing pressures in two contrasting Indian Ocean locations (the Maldives and East Africa). Using generalized linear mixed models, we were able to demonstrate that complex interactions occurred between coral genera, coral size class and fishing pressure. In both locations, we found Acropora coral species to be more abundant in non-fished compared to fished sites (a pattern which was consistent for nearly all the assessed size classes). Coral genera classified as ‘stress tolerant’ showed a contrasting pattern i.e. were higher in abundance in fished compared to non-fished sites. Site specific variations were also observed. For example, Maldivian reefs exhibited a significantly higher abundance in all size classes of ‘competitive’ corals compared to East Africa. This possibly indicates that East African reefs have already been subjected to higher levels of stress and are therefore less suitable environments for ‘competitive’ corals. This study also highlights the potential structure and composition of reefs under future degradation scenarios, for example with a loss of Acropora corals and an increase in dominance of ‘stress tolerant’ and ‘generalist’ coral genera.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcropora 3acorals 3afrequency distribution 3areefs 3aEastern Africa 3aIndian Ocean 3aMaldives 0aCoral reefs 0aFisheries 0aEcosystem management 0aCoastal waters 0aEffects-population1 aPisapia, C.1 aHuck, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7740-39031 aKarisa, J.1 aObura, D.1 aSweet, M.0 tMarine environmental research.g2017 Oct., v. 131 p.146-155dElsevier LtdwJournal:1982x0141-11367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marenvres.2017.09.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245012400157520141200281592002801693650001501721650000801736650001801744650001901762650002001781650003001801650001101831650001401842650002201856650002701878651001301905700003401918700002101952700002801973773012202001856007302123852000902196655001202205IND60742509620221119024506.0210624e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074250962DNAL7 a10.3390/d130602322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHasan, Ariba 10aDNA Barcoding of Mullets (Family Mugilidae) from Pakistan Reveals Surprisingly High Number of Unknown Candidate Species  aThe mullets are a widespread group of ecologically and economically important fishes of disputed taxonomy due to their uniform external morphology. Barcoding and phylogenetic studies from various locations around the world largely highlighted the species diversity underestimation using morphological criteria used to establish the taxonomy of the family. Here, we investigated the mullet species diversity from Pakistan, a biogeographic area where nearly no mullet species were genetically characterized. Morphological examination of 40 mullets reveals 6 known species (Planiliza macrolepis, P. klunzingeri, P. subviridis, Crenimugil seheli, Ellochelon vaigiensis, and Mugil cephalus). Using a references DNA barcode library, the DNA barcode-based species identification flagged eight molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) belonging to five genera (Crenimugil, Ellochelon, Mugil, Osteomugil, and Planiliza). Among these MOTUs, only one was already present in Barcode of Life Data system, all other representing new Barcode Index Numbers (BIN). These results emphasize the importance of the recognition of cryptic species and the necessity to re-evaluate the overall diversity by the genetic characterization of different species of this family. DNA barcoding is an effective tool to reveal cryptic species that need to be considered in conservation and management measures of fisheries in Pakistan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrenimugil 3aDNA 3aDNA barcoding 3aMugil cephalus 3acryptic species 3ageographical distribution 3amullet 3aphylogeny 3aspecies diversity 3aspecies identification 3aPakistan1 aSiddiqui, Pirzada Jamal Ahmed1 aAmir, Shabir Ali1 aDurand, Jean-Dominique 0 tDiversity.g2021 May 26, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130602323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002400151245020400175520116600379592002801545650002301573650003301596650002801629650001301657650001701670650001401687650001401701650001801715650001901733650002001752650001601772650001701788650001901805650001501824650001801839653002001857653002201877653002401899653001801923653001801941653000901959700001901968773011101987856008602098852000902184655001202193IND60793695320221118113632.0220929e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079369532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1119422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMary, Priyanka Rose10aCo-culture fermentations suggest cross-feeding among Bacteroides ovatus DSMZ 1896, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 and Bifidobacterium adolescentis DSMZ 20083 for utilizing dietary galactomannans  aGalactomannans from sources like guar, fenugreek, locust bean, and copra form an important part of human diet. In this study, we have attempted to understand the cross-feeding and resource sharing between a generalist degrader and probiotic utilizers for utilizing dietary galactomannans. In mono-cultures, Bacteroides ovatus DSMZ 1896 grew maximally on substituted galactomannans and produced high amount of succinate. Polysaccharide break down products [β-manno-oligosaccharides; degree of polymerization (DP) 2–4] left after the growth of B. ovatus DSMZ 1896 in galactomannan supplemented media supported the growth of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1 (DP2 and DP3) and Bifidobacterium adolescentis DSMZ 20083 (majorly DP3) and led to the production of lactate and acetate, respectively as the major end products. Co-cultures (bi- and tri-cultures) studies demonstrated cross-feeding being used as a strategy for resource sharing among B. ovatus DSMZ 1896, L. plantarum WCFS1 and B. adolescentis DSMZ 20083 while foraging galactomannans. Structure and DP of galactomannan substrates altered the SCFA and organic acid production patterns in co-cultures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides ovatus 3aBifidobacterium adolescentis 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aacetates 3acoconut meal 3acoculture 3afenugreek 3afood research 3agalactomannans 3ahuman nutrition 3alactic acid 3alocust beans 3apolymerization 3aprobiotics 3asuccinic acid 0aBacteroides sp. 0aLactobacillus sp. 0aBifidobacterium sp. 0aCross-feeding 0aGalactomannan 0aSCFA1 aKapoor, Mukesh0 tFood research international.g2022 Dec., v. 162 p.111942-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1119423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245010000160300002000260520161700280592002801897650002301925650001601948650002201964650002801986650002202014650001902036650001602055650002202071650001102093650001402104650001302118650002102131653001902152653001302171653002802184653002602212653001902238700001302257700001502270700001602285773012602301856008002427852000902507655001202516IND60570079920221122065904.0170708e20170628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057007992DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.7b059512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, Jiahao10aSelenium-Functionalized Graphene Oxide That Can Modulate the Balance of Reactive Oxygen Species  ap. 21413-21421.  aGraphene oxide (GO) is an important two-dimensional material since it is water-soluble and can be functionalized to adapt to different applications. However, the current covalent functionalization methods usually require hash conditions, long duration, and sometimes even multiple steps, while noncovalent functionalization is inevitably unstable, especially under a physiological environment where competing species exist. Diselenide bond is a dynamic covalent bond and can respond to both redox conditions and visible light irradiation in a sensitive manner. Thus, in this work by combining the stimuli response of diselenide bond and the oxidative/radical attackable nature of GO, we achieved the in situ covalent functionalization of GO simply by stirring GO with diselenide-containing molecules in aqueous solution. The covalent functionalization was proved by Fourier transform infrared, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and so forth, and the functionalization mechanism was deduced to involve both redox reaction and radical addition reaction according to the X-ray photoelectron spectrscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, we modified GO with a biocompatible diselenide-containing polymer (mPEGSe)₂ and found selenium-functionalized GO could modulate the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). GOSe could decrease ROS level by accelerating the reduction of peroxides when the ROS concentration is high while boosting the ROS level by in situ generating ROS when its concentration is relatively low.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aaqueous solutions 3aatomic force microscopy 3achemical elements 3agraphene oxide 3airradiation 3amass spectrometry 3amixing 3aperoxides 3apolymers 3athermogravimetry 0agraphene oxide 0aselenium 0areactive oxygen species 0adynamic covalent bond 0aredox reaction1 aLi, Feng1 aJi, Shaobo1 aXu, Huaping0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2017 June 28, v. 9, no. 25 p.21413-21421dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b059513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04081naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245014900210300001800359520266800377592002803045650001503073650002003088650001403108650003103122650001703153650001503170650002103185650000903206650001503215650002403230650001203254650002203266650001203288650001303300650001403313651001203327700002503339700002003364700002003384773013903404856008303543852000903626655001203635IND60792872920221118052056.0220910e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079287292DNAL7 a10.1007/s11368-022-03252-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Nhung Thi Ha1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5256-055810aAccumulation patterns and health risk assessment of potentially toxic elements in the topsoil of two sloping vineyards (Tokaj-Hegyalja, Hungary)  ap. 2671-2689.  aPURPOSE: In agricultural soils, accumulation and bioavailability patterns of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) are key ecological and health risk issues, especially in metal-based crop protection systems such as those applied in vineyards. However, PTE levels in the topsoils of historical wine-growing regions of Hungary have been scarcely studied so far. The specific goals of this research were to assess the accumulation tendencies and bioavailability of PTEs complemented with human health risk assessment in two sloping vineyards with pH-contrasted soils in Tokaj-Hegyalja, Hungary, and under different farming practices. METHODS: Composite topsoil (< 20 cm) and borehole samples were collected from two vineyards and local forests. The total and bioavailable PTE contents (Zn, Pb, Co, Ni, Cr, Cu) were analyzed following digestion in aqua regia and extraction with a strong chelating agent (0.05 M Na₂-EDTA). Enrichment factors (EFs) were calculated based on Fe as a reference element and the local uncultivated soil. The hazard indexes (HIs) for outdoor workers, children, and adults living in residential areas near the vineyards were calculated to assess the health risks associated with the target PTEs. RESULTS: Higher PTE contents were observed in the organic vineyard (near Tokaj) compared to the conventional one (near Tállya), except for Cu and Pb. The EFs confirmed that the duration of Cu-fungicide applications mainly determines the soil-bound Cu levels, with an average of 2.6 in the 28-year-old organic vineyard and 9.6 in the more than 100-year-old conventional vineyard. The PTEs predominantly accumulated at the top of the hillslope in Tállya, while in Tokaj, a general trend of downslope accumulation of PTEs can be noticed. Bioavailable Cu reached a maximum of 50% of total Cu at the top of the hillslope (Tállya) and positively correlated with soil organic matter content. Iron/Mn oxides, total Ca content, and soil pH show a significant correlation with the PTE total contents (other than Cu); meanwhile, their bioavailability is mainly influenced by Mn oxides. The calculated HIs are less than 1, indicating no elevated health risk. Total Cr is the major contributor to the HI in both vineyards, reaching 79.0% (Tokaj) and 49.7% (Tállya). CONCLUSION: Overall, the accumulated Cu contents mainly depended on the vineyard age, while farming practices and terrain morphology play a minor role in its spatial distribution. The further accumulation of PTEs, especially in high-metal hotspots within the vineyards, may ultimately cause toxicity to re-planted grapevines, soil biota, and, in the longer term, farmers and residents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqua regia 3abioavailability 3adigestion 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman health 3alandscapes 3aplant protection 3arisk 3asoil biota 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3atopographic slope 3atopsoil 3atoxicity 3avineyards 3aHungary1 aBabcsányi, Izabella1 aBalling, Péter1 aFarsang, Andrea0 tJournal of soils and sediments.g2022 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.2671-2689dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3949862x1439-01087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11368-022-03252-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02911naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245014100164520179700305592002802102650001702130650003002147650001502177650001802192650001902210650001802229650001402247650001102261651001102272700002402283700002702307700002302334773012202357856007302479852000902552655001202561IND60742509720221119024438.0210624e20210526xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074250972DNAL7 a10.3390/d130602332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoutsikos, Nicholas 10aPatterns of Spatial Overlap between Non-Indigenous and Critically Endangered Freshwater Fishes from a Mediterranean Biodiversity Hotspot  aNon-indigenous fish species (NIFS) can cause severe ecological impacts on the invaded ecosystems and are considered as one of the leading factors of freshwater biodiversity loss. Unraveling the spatial overlap between NIFS and critically endangered (CR) fish species can contribute to targeted conservation actions to minimize the potential negative effects. In this study, we applied geostatistical analyses to investigate the spatial overlap of NIFS against fish species that are designated under the CR status according to the IUCN and the Hellenic Zoological Society (HZS) Red Lists. Distributional data (presence–absence) from 800 records of 52 NIFS were compiled for both lentic and lotic ecosystems of Greece. Our results indicate that freshwater ecosystems under high NIFS richness were located mainly in lowland areas and often near large cities and ecosystems with well-developed commercial and recreational fisheries. On the contrary, low NIFS richness was observed in mountainous regions and in relatively small river basins. Overlapping areas of CR species with moderate to high NIFS richness (1.5–4.3 NIFS per 1 km²) were relatively high (~50%). A quarter of the overlapping areas (24.8%) fall within NATURA 2000 network, where legal management bodies could implement specialized programs to minimize the negative impacts. However, the majority of CR fish species’ distribution remains in unprotected areas indicating that protected areas should be re-designed to include areas containing freshwater species under the highest threatened category. Our findings demonstrate that whole assemblages of fishes are rapidly changing as NIFS spread into Greece and many freshwater ecosystems of outstanding biodiversity conservation value are under significant invasion pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3afreshwater 3ageostatistics 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3amountains 3arivers 3aGreece1 aVardakas, Leonidas 1 aKalantzi, Olga-Ioanna 1 aZogaris, Stamatis 0 tDiversity.g2021 May 26, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130602333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03817naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245013400173300001600307520212400323592002802447650002502475650001002500650001902510650001202529650002202541650001402563650002002577650001902597650000902616650002002625650002102645650001202666650001002678650001402688650002002702650000902722650002002731650001302751650001402764650001202778650001002790653000802800653000902808653001202817653001402829653002102843653001902864700002002883700001902903700001802922700001902940700006102959773010103020856008503121852000903206655001203215IND60619784520221120044816.0190415e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061978452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2018.10.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtaollahi, Forough10aEffect of calcium and magnesium supplementation on minerals profile, immune responses, and energy profile of ewes and their lambs  ap. 167-173.  aThe effect of maternal supplementation of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) during late gestation and early lactation on immune function of offspring are unknown. The vital role of Ca and Mg on immune function is well known. This study investigated the effect of Ca and Mg supplementation to ewes through late gestation and early lactation on the plasma mineral concentration, immune response and energy profile of ewes, and their offspring.Forty eight ewes were allocated between four treatment groups, namely: Ca, Mg, Ca + Mg and control. Ewes in Ca, Mg and Ca + Mg treatments were supplemented with 50 g calcium carbonate (lime), 50 g magnesium oxide (Causmag) and 25 g calcium carbonate + 25 g magnesium oxide, respectively, from 12 ± 4 days before gestation to one month after lambing. Blood and urine samples were collected from ewes at 2 weeks prior to the commencement of lambing (−2 weeks), 12 h post lambing (+12 h), 2 weeks post lambing (+2 weeks) and 4 weeks post lambing (+4 weeks). Colostrum/milk samples from ewes and blood samples from lambs were collected at +12 h, +2 weeks, and +4 weeks.Lambs born out of ewes in the Ca and Ca + Mg treatments had higher oxidative burst response and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) compared to the Mg and control groups. Oxidative burst response and IgG production in lambs improved from birth to at 4 weeks of age, while the TAC was highest at 2 weeks of age. Ewes supplemented with Ca, Mg and Ca + Mg regulated energy balance more efficiently at lambing compared to the control group. Supplementation of ewes with Mg supplements increased milk Ca level at 4 weeks post lambing and supplementation of ewes with Mg supplements increased plasma Mg concentration in the Mg group over time.Overall, these results indicate that supplementation of ewes with Ca and Ca + Mg during late gestation and early lactation improved immune response in their lambs at least in part via changes in oxidative burst response and antioxidant capacity. Mineral supplementation had a beneficial effect on energy balance regulation in ewes at lambing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3acalcium 3acalcium carbonate 3acolostrum 3aearly lactation 3aenergy balance 3aewes 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alambing 3alambs 3amagnesium 3amagnesium oxide 3amilk 3amineral content 3aminerals 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 3aurine 0aEwe 0aLamb 0aCalcium 0aMagnesium 0aImmune responses 0aEnergy balance1 aFriend, Michael1 aMcGrath, Shawn1 aDutton, Geoff1 aPeters, Andrew1 aBhanugopan, Marie1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7667-98630 tLivestock science.g2018 Nov., v. 217 p.167-173dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2018.10.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02589naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009100170520119300261592002801454650001301482650001401495650001501509650002401524650001801548650001801566650001701584650002001601650002401621650002101645650002201666650001501688650002501703653001401728653002301742653000901765653001501774700001601789700001901805700001801824700002001842700002001862700001901882773011101901856008602012852000902098655001202107IND60793695420221118113558.0220921e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079369542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1119432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yue-Hang10aN-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids protect esophageal epithelial cells from acid exposure  aOur previous study showed that n-3 PUFAs inhibited inflammation in rats with esophagitis. This study aimed to observe the protective effect of n-3 PUFAs against acid damage to esophageal epithelial cells (Het-1A cells) and to explore its mechanism. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased by acid exposure, while that of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was decreased. In groups with different ratios of n-6/n-3 PUFAs, the expression levels of nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and SOD were increased with increasing proportions of n-3 PUFAs and were highest in the 1:1 group. Compared with those in the 9:1 group, the expression of NOD like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and caspase-1 and the pyroptosis rate in the 1:1 group were decreased. Intervention with an Nrf2 agonist increased the expression of Nrf2 and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 and the pyroptosis rate. However, inhibiting Nrf2 expression led to the opposite result. In conclusion, n-3 PUFAs protected esophageal epithelial cells from acid damage by upregulating Nrf2 expression, which disrupted oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inhibited pyroptosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagonists 3acaspase-1 3aepithelium 3aesophageal diseases 3afood research 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3amalondialdehyde 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3apyroptosis 3asuperoxide dismutase 0aN-3 PUFAs 0aReflux esophagitis 0aNrf2 0aPyroptosis1 aJiang, Ying1 aWei, Jing-Jing1 aLi, Xiao-Dong1 aZhang, Pei-Hong1 aLian, Ting-Ting1 aZhuang, Ze-Hao0 tFood research international.g2022 Dec., v. 162 p.111943-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2022.1119433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03617naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136072000900154072000900163072000900172100002000181245015100201300001800352500002400370500001500394520172600409650001902135650001502154650002002169650001902189650001902208650001602227650001402243650001202257650001502269650002002284650002202304650001302326650002602339650001102365650001402376650001902390650001202409650004402421650001002465650001102475650002102486650000902507650001702516650001002533650002402543650001702567651001002584651001002594653001802604653002402622653001102646773011902657852000902776856007502785930003302860945002502893946001302918655001202931IND4443345620151108000000.0101012e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444334562DNAL7 a225464522pmid7 a10.1603/EN100972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aF3001 aSasakawa, Kôji10aField Observations of Climbing Behavior and Seed Predation by Adult Ground Beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in a Lowland Area of the Temperate Zone  ap. 1554-1560.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGranivory is a specialized food habit in the predominantly carnivorous beetle family Carabidae.

I conducted field observations of climbing behavior and seed predation by adult carabids in a lowland area of eastern Japan, from early October to late November in 2008. This is the first systematic field observation of the feeding ecology of granivorous carabids in the temperate zone. In total, 176 carabid individuals of 11 species were observed, with 108 individuals feeding on plant seeds/flowers. Each carabid species was primarily observed feeding on a particular plant species. Frequently observed combinations were: Amara gigantea Motschulsky on Humulus scandens (Loureiro) Merrill (Moraceae) seed, Amara lucens Baliani on Artemisia indica Willdenow (Asteraceae) flower, and Amara macronota (Solsky) and Harpalus (Pseudoophonus) spp. on Digitaria ciliaris (Retzius) Koeler (Poaceae) seed. In all but one species, the sex ratio of individuals observed feeding was female-biased. In Am. gigantea and Am. macronota, a larger proportion of females than males ate seeds. In the three Amara species, copulations on plants, with the female feeding on its seeds/flowers, were often observed. These observations may indicate that, whereas females climb onto plants to feed on seeds, males climb to seek females for copulation rather than forage. Because granivorous carabids play important roles as weed-control agents in temperate agro-ecosystems, the present results would provide valuable basic information for future studies on this subject. 3aagroecosystems 3ahost range 3ainsect behavior 3aseed predation 3ainsect surveys 3ahost plants 3asex ratio 3aflowers 3acopulation 3atemperate zones 3aspecies diversity 3aforaging 3afield experimentation 3aimagos 3aCarabidae 2aMagnoliopsida. 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxclassificationxphysiology. 2aBiota 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aMale 2aReproduction 2aSeeds 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWeed Control 3aJapan 0aJapan 0aadult insects 0aweedy field borders 0aplants0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2010 Oct., v. 39, no. 5 p.1554-1560dEntomological Society of America.x0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN100973Available from publisher's Web site  a20101217b20110101c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/11/03  aOther US 7aarticle03050naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002300166245016400189300001800353520166300371592002802034650001502062650001702077650002202094650001402116650002802130650001702158650002302175650002102198650001502219650001202234650002302246650001702269650001202286650001602298653001902314653001402333653001202347653002402359773013002383856008202513852000902595655001202604IND60517476020221117160851.0190803e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051747602DNAL7 a253358222pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800140022492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenderson, Emily J10aAcceptability of delivery of dietary advice in the dentistry setting to address obesity in pre-school children: a case study of the Common Risk Factor Approach  ap. 1801-1806.  aThe Common Risk Factor Approach proposes that public health efforts can be improved by multiple agencies working together on a shared risk factor. The present study aimed to assess the acceptability to parents, dental practice staff and commissioners of the delivery of dietary advice in the dentistry setting in order to address obesity. Semi-structured focus groups with dental practice staff and one-to-one interviews with parents of pre-school children and public health commissioners involved in an oral health promotion initiative delivering dietary advice in dental surgeries. Data were analysed using the Framework Approach. General dental practice surgeries and pre-schools in areas of high deprivation in north-east England. Parents (n 4), dental practice staff (n 23) and one commissioner. All participants found acceptable the concept of delivering public health messages in non-conventional settings. Dental practice staff were concerned about the potential for conflicting messages and deprioritisation of oral health advice, and they identified practical barriers to delivery, such as lack of training. Parents were very apprehensive about the potential of such approaches to stigmatise overweight children, including bullying. Uncertainty over the causes of obesity led to confusion about its solutions and the roles of public health and health care. Major concerns about the implementation of the Common Risk Factor Approach were raised by parents and dental practice staff. Specific dietary guidance for both oral health and healthy weight, as well as further research into issues of suitability, feasibility and stigmatisation, are needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaggression 3acase studies 3achildhood obesity 3adentistry 3adietary recommendations 3afocus groups 3ahealth information 3ahealth promotion 3ainterviews 3aparents 3apreschool children 3arisk factors 3asurgery 3auncertainty 0aDietary advice 0aDentistry 0aObesity 0aPre-school children0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 July, v. 18, no. 10 p.1801-1806dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800140022493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02263naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015000163300001400313520131900327592002801646650001901674650001001693650002101703650001501724700001301739700001801752700001701770700001801787773008701805856004801892852000901940655001201949IND50065946520221118033312.0130426e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006594652DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-013-1465-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Enfeng14aThe spatio-temporal variations of sedimentary phosphorus in Taihu Lake and the implications for internal loading change and recent eutrophication  ap. 87-98.  aInternal phosphorus loading is particularly concerned for the shallow lakes due to the frequent sediment disturbance, which may play a vital role in changing nutrient level in overlying water. A historical perspective on internal phosphorus loading may contribute to understanding its contribution to recent eutrophication. In this work, a study on the changes in internal phosphorus loading and release potential in Taihu Lake, a shallow eutrophic lake in China, was performed based on the analysis of spatio-temporal variations of sedimentary total phosphorus and three operationally defined fractions (NaOH-P, HCl-P and OP). The influencing factors for changing internal loading were discussed. The results showed that internal phosphorus loading was elevated compared to pre-eutrophication periods and the increase has occurred since approximately the late 1970s to early 1980s. Changes in internal phosphorus loading were primarily attributed to the NaOH-P and OP fractions, relating to anthropogenic inputs and enhanced productivity, respectively. The internal phosphorus release potential may be enhanced by up to 22% currently relative to the pre-eutrophication period; however, it should play a secondary role to external input in enhancing nutrient levels and sustaining the eutrophication in Taihu Lake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeutrophication 3alakes 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus1 aShen, Ji1 aYuan, Hezhong1 aZhang, Enlou1 aDu, Chenchang0 tHydrobiologia.g2013 July, v. 711, no. 1 p.87-98dSpringer-Verlagx0018-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-013-1465-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100005600158245012800214300001600342520156800358592002801926650001101954650002101965650002201986650001202008650002002020650000902040650002402049650002402073650002002097650001602117653002102133653001802154653001302172653001002185653002402195653001302219700005502232700005002287700005302337700005602390773020002446856009202646852000902738655001202747IND60648616020221120210028.0190701e20190408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064861602DNAL7 a10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2019.02.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYingqiu, Cao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6534-850810aTemperature Affects new Carbon Input Utilization By Soil Microbes: Evidence Based on a Rapid δ¹³C Measurement Technology  ap. 202-212.  aStrong and rapid responses of soil microbial respiration to pulses, such as those from available soil organic matter (SOM) or water input from precipitation (especially in arid areas), are common. However, how soil microbes utilize new SOM inputs and the effects that temperature may have on their activities are unclear owing to the limitation in the application of traditional isotopic techniques at minute scales. In the present study, we developed a system of measuring ¹²CO₂ and δ¹³C minutely and synchronously under controlled incubation temperatures, i.e., for 48 h at 7, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C, to explore the carbon utilization strategies of soil microbes. We measured the respiration rates of soil microbes in response to different carbon sources, i.e., added glucose (Rg) and initial SOM (Rs), as well as the total respiration rate (Rt). All responses were rapid and characterized by unimodal curves. Furthermore, the characteristic values of these curves, such as the maximum of rate (R-max), the time required to achieve R-max, and the ratio of the duration of R-max to that of 1/2 R-max, were all dependent on incubation temperature. Interestingly, temperature greatly influenced the strategy that microorganisms employed to utilize different carbon sources. The effects of temperature on the intensity of the microbial respiratory response and the ratio of Rg/Rs are important for evaluating the effect of land-use changes or variations in seasonal temperature on SOM turnover and should be considered in ecological models in future studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acell respiration 3aecological models 3aglucose 3aland use change 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3astable isotopes 3atemperature 0asoil respiration 0adecomposition 0aisotopic 0apulse 0asoil organic matter 0aturnover1 aZhen, Zhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8205-41541 aLi, Xu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5665-48611 aZhi, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1315-217X1 aNianpeng, He1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0458-59530 tJournal of resources and ecology.g2019 Apr. 8, v. 10, no. 2 p.202-212dInstitute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of ScienceswJournal:2202x1674-764X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2019.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02485naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245014600160520140000306592002801706650001101734650001701745650001701762650001601779650001801795650001501813650001301828650001501841650001201856651001801868700002201886700002301908773012201931856007302053852000902126655001202135IND60742509920221119024700.0210624e20210528xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074250992DNAL7 a10.3390/d130602352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCanty, Sean T.10aNear-Term Changes to Reach Scale Habitat Features Following Headwater Stream Restoration in a Southeastern Massachusetts Former Cranberry Bog  aLand use changes remain one of the leading global change drivers leading to biodiversity loss in terrestrial and aquatic systems. Restoration aims to counteract the development of “natural” (i.e., forested, grassland, or wetland) spaces that alter and fragment the landscape and reduce local biodiversity through direct impacts to the water column and indirect impacts which inhibit adult dispersal of aquatic insects. This case study seeks to determine if a large-scale restoration of a former cranberry bog in Plymouth, MA has resulted in near-term measurable changes to the composition, structure, and function of local-scale in-stream habitat diversity. A three-year observational field study beginning one year prior to reconstruction was conducted at the restored cranberry bog and at two control treatment sites: an active cranberry bog reference and a least impacted reference (i.e., has never been used for modern agriculture). Seasonal inventories of in-stream habitat features including depth, substrate, macrohabitat, and in-stream cover were taken from 2015 to 2017. We found that 2 years post-restoration, there was no significant evidence of compositional or functional change, while there was a significant increase in structural diversity. There is reason to suspect the system is still in flux and longer-term monitoring may detect future habitat heterogeneity alterations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abiodiversity 3acase studies 3acranberries 3aglobal change 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3astreams 3aMassachusetts1 aDimino, Thomas F.1 aChristian, Alan D.0 tDiversity.g2021 May 28, v. 13, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21675x1424-28187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d130602353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02507naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245017000164300001800334500001500352520119700367592002801564650001301592650002001605650001601625650001501641650002001656650001301676650002101689650001601710650002301726650002401749650001401773653001401787700001801801700001401819700001701833700001701850700001901867773009701886856008101983852000902064655001202073IND60579839020221116190542.0170901e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057983902DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-017-0886-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaoyu10aReduced Graphene Oxide-Modified Screen-Printed Carbon (rGO-SPCE)-Based Disposable Electrochemical Sensor for Sensitive and Selective Determination of Ethyl Carbamate  ap. 3329-3337.  a2019-12-06  aEthyl carbamate (EC), a multi-site genotoxic carcinogen, exists in fermented food and beverages. However, the existing analytical methods need precise instrument, complex sample pretreatment, time-consuming, and high cost. Therefore, a disposable electrochemical biomimetic sensor was developed for fast and selective detection of EC based on reduced graphene oxide/screen-printed carbon composite electrode (rGO/SPCE). Firstly, the SPCE is modified with rGO by electrodeposition process that increased current signal and decreased the impedance of contact interface. Secondly, the OAP/rGO/SPCE biomimetic sensor was synthesized through electropolymerization by cyclic voltammograms in mixed solution of template of EC and monomer of O-aminophenol (OAP). The sensor specifically bound to EC quickly without sample pretreatment. A linear range was from 100 to 1300 nM, and a detection limit of 37 nM was achieved. The detection time is less than 5 min. The sensor possesses advantages include good chemical and mechanical stability, simplicity, low cost of preparation, and sensitive and label-free determination.

Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy revealed hierarchical microstructures and nanostructures of the TiO₂ coatings, which were primarily responsible for the increase of the water contact angle from approximately 0 to 120° after the ALD process. A high mean square surface roughness of 76.325 nm also accounted for this improved water contact angle. Furthermore, TiO₂-coated SFs modified with low surface energy PVSs exhibited enhanced hydrophobic properties. More importantly, both the UV-blocking and yellowing-resistance of the SFs were improved without any significant change to the luster of the SFs.

This strain enhanced ASI production approximately fourfold when cultures were supplemented with 5g/L of crude astragalosides. ASI was purified from the fermentation culture by a macroporous resin with a chromatographic purity of 97.2% and recovery of 63.7%. Astragaloside I, isoastragaloside I, astragaloside II and isoastragaloside II were identified as the biotransformation precursors of ASI, and their biotransformation time course profiles differed. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the production of ASI by microbial transformation and the investigation on its biotransformation precursors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbsidia corymbifera 3abiotransformation 3achromatography 3afermentation1 aLiu, Xiao-Hui1 aZhou, Wei1 aFeng, Mei-Qing1 aShi, Xun-Long1 aLi, Ji-Yang1 aChen, Dao-Feng1 aZhou, Pei0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Sept., v. 46, no. 9 p.1724-1730dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.05.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03548naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245006800188300001800256520164400274592002801918650001601946650001401962650001401976650001001990650001002000650001402010650002102024650001402045650001402059650001802073650002302091650001202114650001102126650002102137650001402158650001002172650000902182650001202191650002202203650001902225650000902244650001502253650001502268653001402283653002202297653001902319653002102338653002502359700002002384700002002404700002402424700002302448700002002471700002402491700002802515700002402543700002202567700001902589700002102608773013002629856008202759852000902841655001202850IND60517476120221123034649.0190803e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051747612DNAL7 a253584722pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800140022742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamrani, Abdeslam10aPhysical activity and dietary habits among Moroccan adolescents  ap. 1793-1800.  aThe study aimed to detail the lifestyle (physical activity and dietary habits) of Moroccan adolescents. Cross-sectional study undertaken in the framework of the ATLS (Arab Teens Lifestyle Study). Physical activity and dietary habits were determined using a validated questionnaire in public secondary schools. A total of 669 adolescents aged 15·0–19·9 years were randomly recruited from Kenitra, Morocco. Physical activity patterns and intensity differed between genders. As anticipated, male adolescents were more active than female adolescents across a typical week and engaged in more vigorous-intensity physical activity than female adolescents, who spent more time than male adolescents in moderate-intensity physical activity. Of particular concern was that one in five of the adolescents surveyed was inactive, with almost 45 % of the sample reporting television viewing for more than 2 h/d and 38 % engaged in computer use for a similar period. From a dietary perspective, most adolescents reported that they do not take breakfast or consume milk and dairy products, fruits and vegetables on a daily basis. In contrast, most reported consumption of doughnuts, cakes, candy and chocolate more than three times per week and approximately 50 % consumed sugary drinks more than three times per week. Based on a continuation of the self-reported lifestyle behaviours, adolescents in the present study are at risk of developing chronic diseases. Education programmes are urgently needed to assist in the promotion of a healthy lifestyle and reduce the likelihood of overweight and obesity and related health risks among young people.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadolescents 3abeverages 3abreakfast 3acakes 3acandy 3achocolate 3achronic diseases 3acomputers 3adoughnuts 3aeating habits 3aeducation programs 3afemales 3afruits 3ahealth promotion 3alifestyle 3amales 3amilk 3aobesity 3aphysical activity 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3atelevision 3avegetables 0aLifestyle 0aPhysical activity 0aDietary habits 0aHealth promotion 0aMoroccan adolescents1 aMehdad, Slimane1 aEl Kari, Khalid1 aEl Hamdouchi, Asmaa1 aEl Menchawy, Imane1 aBelghiti, Hakim1 aEl Mzibri, Mohammed1 aMusaiger, Abdulrahman O1 aAl-Hazzaa, Hazzaa M1 aHills, Andrew P.,1 aMokhtar, Najat1 aAguenaou, Hassan0 tPublic health nutrition.g2015 July, v. 18, no. 10 p.1793-1800dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800140022743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001700147245008400164300001600248520116800264592002801432650002701460650002501487650002501512650001801537650001701555650002101572650001601593650001001609650001001619651001201629700002101641700001801662700001701680700002401697773008001721856008301801852000901884655001201893IND4470755320221118033400.0150812e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447075532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTu, Viet Phu10aFor me the taste of soy is not a barrier to its consumption.

Expressed beliefs and attitudes of soy foods resulting from discussions in focus groups, conducted in both countries, were collected and used to derive a questionnaire. French participants differ mainly from Vietnamese participants in questions associated to taste and price of soy foods. Both groups reported positive attitudes towards health benefits of soy foods. With a change in cultural environment, French participants showed a notable change in attitudes related to taste and price of soy foods and in soy consumption habit whereas almost no change was observed in Vietnamese participants. The asymmetry in magnitude of change and cultural differences in components of beliefs and attitudes are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3acultural differences 3acultural environment 3aeating habits 3afocus groups 3afood consumption 3afood prices 3afoods 3ataste 3aVietnam1 aHusson, Florence1 aSutan, Angela1 aHa, Duyen Tu1 aValentin, Dominique0 tAppetite.g2012 June, v. 58, no. 3 p.914-921dElsevier Ltdx0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2012.01.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03268naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002200136245008000158300001800238520177900256592002802035650002202063650000802085650001302093650001002106650002202116650001002138650002302148650002402171650001602195650002402211651002702235651001702262653001602279653001302295653001902308653001302327653001702340653001702357653002702374653001702401653001402418653001702432700002702449700002602476700001502502700002602517773011202543856007402655852000902729655001202738IND4413276420221120124247.0151127e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441327642DNAL7 a10.2193/2007-5132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevries, James H.10aWaterfowl Nesting in Fall-Seeded and Spring-Seeded Cropland in Saskatchewan  ap. 1790-1797.  aWaterfowl nesting in annual croplands has remained a little-known aspect of waterfowl nesting ecology because of the inability of many studies to systematically search this habitat through the nesting season. Where searches have been conducted, they are generally restricted to the period prior to seeding, and many nests found are destroyed by the seeding operation. Consequently, fall-seeded crops have been promoted as an alternative cropping practice that could increase nest survival of waterfowl nesting in croplands. During 1996––1999, we conducted 3––4 complete nest searches on 4,274 ha of cropland, including spring-seeded wheat and barley, winter wheat, and fall rye in southern Saskatchewan, Canada. Using suites of predictive models, we tested hypotheses regarding relative nest abundance and nest survival among crop types and tested the influence of several landscape-scale covariates on these metrics. Apparent nest densities were higher in fall-seeded crops (winter wheat: 0.39 nests/ha, fall rye: 0.25 nests/ha) than in spring-seeded crops (0.03 nests/ha), and nest density in spring-seeded croplands increased with percent cropland and percent wetland habitat in the surrounding landscape. Nest survival was higher in winter wheat (38%%) than in either fall rye (18%%) or spring-seeded crops (12%%), and nest survival in spring-seeded crops increased with relative nest initiation date. Nest survival was unaffected by surrounding landscape characteristics but tended to be higher in years of average wetness. Based on our findings, winter wheat and fall rye have the potential to provide productive nesting habitat for ≥≥7 species of upland nesting ducks and fall-seeded crops are a conservation tool well suited to highly cropped landscapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3arye 3awetlands 3aducks 3awildlife habitats 3anests 3apopulation density 3ahabitat preferences 3asowing date 3awildlife management 3aPrairie Pothole region 3aSaskatchewan 0aagriculture 0acropland 0adabbling ducks 0afall rye 0anest density 0anest success 0aPrairie Pothole Region 0aSaskatchewan 0awaterfowl 0awinter wheat1 aArmstrong, Llwellyn M.1 aMacFarlane, Robert J.1 aMoats, Lee1 aThoroughgood, Paul T.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2008 Nov., v. 72, no. 8 p.1790-1797dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F2007-5133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02439naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245019300171300001800364520092600382592002801308650003401336650002101370650001601391650002501407650001301432650001301445650001301458650002101471650001001492650001701502650002801519650002701547650003201574650000701606650001301613650002501626650001901651700001901670700001901689700002501708700001701733700001801750773009501768856008501863852000901948655001201957IND60113964320221118204846.0141112e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011396432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.procbio.2011.05.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFakhfakh, Nahed10aTotal solubilisation of the chicken feathers by fermentation with a keratinolytic bacterium, Bacillus pumilus A1, and the production of protein hydrolysate with high antioxidative activity  ap. 1731-1737.  aA feather protein hydrolysate was effectively produced using the keratinolytic bacterium Bacillus pumilus strain A1. In fact, complete feather degradation was achieved in medium containing up to 50g/l of raw feathers. Cultivation of 50g/l of feathers for two days, at 45°C and at initial pH of 10.0, resulted in maximum production of amino acids and peptides (42.4g/l). The feather protein hydrolysate (FPH) presents a very high in vitro digestibility (98%) compared with that of the untreated feathers (2%). Furthermore, the antioxidant activities of FPH were evaluated using in vitro antioxidant assays, such as 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity and reducing power. Interestingly, FPH presents an important antioxidant potential with an IC₅₀ value of 0.3±0.01mg/ml. These results indicate that FPH may be useful as supplementary protein and antioxidants in animal feed formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBacillus pumilus 3aamino acids 3aantioxidant activity 3abacteria 3achickens 3afeathers 3afeed formulation 3afeeds 3afermentation 3afree radical scavengers 3ain vitro digestibility 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3apH 3apeptides 3aprotein hydrolysates 3asolubilization1 aKtari, Naourez1 aHaddar, Anissa1 aMnif, Ibtissem Hamza1 aDahmen, Ines1 aNasri, Moncef0 tProcess biochemistry.g2011 Sept., v. 46, no. 9 p.1731-1737dElsevier Ltdx1359-51137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2011.05.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001800148245014800166300001400314520203000328592002802358650003202386650001602418650002002434650001802454650002102472650001002493700002202503700001602525700002002541700002102561700002002582700001802602700001702620773009902637856008402736852000902820655001202829IND4465006420221120195029.0141111e20120706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446500642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlome, Sandra10aComparative evaluation of live marker vaccine candidates “CP7_E2alf” and “flc11” along with C-strain “Riems” after oral vaccination  ap. 42-59.  aDue to the tremendous socio-economic impact of classical swine fever (CSF) outbreaks, emergency vaccination scenarios are continuously under discussion. Unfortunately, all currently available vaccines show restrictions either in terms of marker capacities or immunogenicity. Recent research efforts were therefore directed at the design of new modified live marker vaccines. Among the most promising candidates the chimeric pestiviruses “CP7_E2alf” and “flc11” were identified. Within an international research project, these candidates were comparatively tested in challenge experiments after a single oral vaccination. Challenge infection was carried out with highly virulent CSF virus strain “Koslov”, 14 or 21 days post vaccination (dpv), respectively. Safety, efficacy, and marker potential were addressed. All assessments were done in comparison with the conventional “gold standard” C-strain “Riems” vaccine. In addition to the challenge trials, multiple vaccinations with both candidates were performed to further assess their marker vaccine potential. All vaccines were safe and yielded full protection upon challenge 21 days post vaccination. Neither serological nor virological investigations showed major differences among the three vaccines. Whereas CP7_E2alf also provided clinical protection upon challenge at 14 days post vaccination, only 50% of animals vaccinated with flc11, and 83% vaccinated with C-strain “Riems” survived challenge at this time point. No marked differences were seen in protected animals. Despite the fact that all multiple-vaccinated animals stayed sero-negative in the accompanying marker test, the discriminatory assay remains a weak point due to delayed or inexistent detection of some of the vaccinated and subsequently infected animals. Nevertheless, the potential as live marker vaccines could be confirmed for both vaccine candidates. Future efforts will therefore be directed at the licensing of “Cp7_E2alf” as the first live marker vaccine for CSF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aClassical swine fever virus 3ahog cholera 3aimmune response 3alive vaccines 3aoral vaccination 3aswine1 aAebischer, Andrea1 aLange, Elke1 aHofmann, Martin1 aLeifer, Immanuel1 aLoeffen, Willie1 aKoenen, Frank1 aBeer, Martin0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2012 July 6, v. 158, no. 1-2 p.42-59dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03121naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154100003000172245013300202300001600335520112000351592002801471650002801499650001101527650003801538650001901576650001001595650002601605650003001631650001801661650002501679650001301704650003401717650001401751650001201765650003801777650004501815650004701860650003101907650004701938650000901985650002401994650003002018650002602048650003202074650005402106700002202160700002502182700002602207700003502233700002102268700002502289773011902314856008902433852000902522655001202531IND4449722020221118033311.0141111e20110131xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444972202DNAL7 a212766282pmid7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.12.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ballamoole Krishna10aDevelopment of monoclonal antibody based sandwich ELISA for the rapid detection of pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus in seafood  ap. 244-249.  aThermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) and TDH-related hemolysin (TRH) are considered important virulence factors of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and strains producing either of these or both are considered pathogenic. In this study, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against purified TRH recombinant protein of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) using the hybridoma clone 4B10 showed higher sensitivity of detection compared to other clones. Using mAb 4B10 based sandwich ELISA, we could detect pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in 41.18% (14 out of 34) of the seafood samples analyzed. PCR targeting the toxR gene showed the presence of V. parahaemolyticus in 64.7% (22 out of 34) seafood samples. Further, PCR targeting the virulence genes showed that 6 seafood samples harboured the tdh gene while 9 harboured the trh gene indicating the presence of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. Our results show that mAb 4B10 sandwich ELISA developed in this study could be used as a rapid method for screening seafood samples for the presence of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aclones 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agene targeting 3agenes 3amonoclonal antibodies 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arapid methods 3arecombinant proteins 3aseafoods 3athyrotropin-releasing hormone 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxchemistry 2aBacterial Toxinsxchemistryximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aFood Microbiologyxmethods 2aHemolysin Proteinsxchemistryximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aSeafoodxmicrobiology 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aVibrio parahaemolyticusxisolation & purification1 aRaghunath, Pendru1 aDevegowda, Devananda1 aDeekshit, Vijay Kumar1 aVenugopal, Moleyur Nagarajappa1 aKarunasagar, I.,1 aKarunasagar, Indrani0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2011 Jan. 31, v. 145, no. 1 p.244-249dElsevier B.V.x0168-16057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.12.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008700164300001300251520126100264592002801525650002101553650001201574650001701586650001901603650001601622650001001638650001501648650001801663650001401681650001301695650002001708700001901728773010801747856008101855852000901936655001201945IND60121402620221121052302.0150408e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012140262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-015-2299-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKollu, Kerim10aMonitoring Simulated Bioflocculation: Application of Micro-Flow Imaging Technology  ap. 2299.  aBioflocculation occurs in both engineered and natural systems and plays an important role in several water treatment processes as well as in pathogen transport and survival. In this study, bioflocculation was simulated in the laboratory to allow for well-controlled experiments. Escherichia coli and latex particles of varying sizes (3.2, 11 and 25 μm) were spiked into a buffer solution and were bioflocculated by adding alginate and varying amounts of calcium (0, 5, 10 and 15 mM). The extent of flocculation was determined by the calcium concentration, and the floc structure was modified by varying the particle size. The bioflocculation process was monitored with a dynamic particle analyzer, and the flocs formed were analyzed with respect to size, shape and porosity parameters. Larger flocs were observed to have a more heterogeneous structure with higher variation in shape and porosity compared to smaller flocs. Circularity and porosity parameters were shown to be strongly correlated with the calcium concentration. In addition, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation experiments were performed on flocculated and non-flocculated samples, and the inactivation data were assessed in light of floc characteristics determined with the particle analyzer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3acalcium 3aflocculation 3aimage analysis 3airradiation 3alatex 3amonitoring 3aparticle size 3apathogens 3aporosity 3awater treatment1 aÖrmeci, Banu,0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2015 Mar., v. 226, no. 3 p.2299-2299dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-015-2299-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01678naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245014900172300001600321520049600337592002800833650001500861650002000876650001000896650001100906650002000917650002800937650002300965651001300988653001501001653001701016653001701033653001701050700002101067773012501088856008201213852000901295655001201304IND60648244520221117230013.0190627e20190325xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064824452DNAL7 a10.1649/0010-065X-73.1.1422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShepard, William D.10aAquatic Larvae Of Eulichadidae and Ptilodactylidae (Coleoptera: Byrrhoidea) from Thailand, with Description of the Larva of?

Mechanisms that have the potential to promote tree species coexistence in the context of repeated disturbance include life history trade‐offs in colonization and competitive ability or in species' ability to survive at low resource conditions and exploit the temporary resource‐rich conditions often generated in the wake of disturbance (successional niche). Quantifying these trade‐offs requires long‐term forest monitoring and modeling. We developed a hierarchical Bayes model to investigate the strategies tree species employ to withstand and recover from hurricane disturbance and the life history trade‐offs that may facilitate species coexistence in forests subject to repeated hurricane disturbance. Unlike previous approaches, our model accommodates temporal variation in process error and observations from multiple sources. We parameterized the model using growth and mortality data from four censuses of a 16‐ha plot taken every five years (1990–2005), together with damage data collected after two hurricanes and annual seed production data (1992–2005). Species' susceptibilities to hurricane damage as reflected by changes in diameter growth and fecundity immediately following a storm were weak, highly variable, and unpredictable using traditional life history groupings. The lower crowding conditions (e.g., high light) generated in the wake of storms, however, led to greater gains in growth and fecundity for pioneer and secondary‐forest species than for shade‐tolerant species, in accordance with expectation of life history. We found moderate trade‐offs between survival in high crowding conditions, a metric of competitive ability, and long‐distance colonization. We also uncovered a strong trade‐off between mean species fecundity in low crowding conditions, a metric of recovery potential, and competitive ability. Trade‐offs in competitive and colonization ability, in addition to successional niche processes, are likely to contribute to species persistence in these hurricane‐impacted forests. The strategies species employ to cope with hurricane damage depend on the degree to which species rely on sprouting, repair of adult damage, changes in demographic rates in response to enhanced resource availability after storms, or long‐distance dispersal as recovery mechanisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3acolonizing ability 3afecundity 3aforests 3ahurricanes 3alife history 3amodels 3amonitoring 3amortality 3ashade tolerance 3aspecies diversity 3asprouting 3astorm damage 3atemporal variation 3atrees1 aClark, James S.1 aZimmerman, Jess K.1 aComita, Liza S.1 aForero-Montaña, Jimena1 aThompson, Jill0 tEcology.g2012 Jan., v. 93, no. 1 p.191-205dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-2422.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01135naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245007200164300001800236520022700254592002800481650002700509650002300536650001100559650001200570700002400582700002300606773013300629856007400762852000900836655001200845IND60659696020221118060224.0190823e20130103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065969602DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36356a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichaelides, Adonis10a2D and 3D photoreactive lanthanide MOFs of trans,trans-muconic acid  ap. 1008-1010.  aThree 2D and 3D photoreactive MOFs of trans,trans-muconic acid with Er³⁺ and their corresponding isomorphous Y³⁺ phases were synthesized and their photoreactivity was studied as a function of the crystal environment.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemical reactions 3aerbium 3ayttrium1 aSkoulika, Stavroula1 aSiskos, Michael G.0 tChemical communications.g2013 Jan. 3, v. 49, no. 10 p.1008-1010dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2cc36356a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008500158300002000243520099200263592002801255650004401283650001301327650001401340650001701354650002801371650001301399650001901412650001001431700001701441700001201458700001501470773012401485856007401609852000901683655001201692IND60640437020221122091040.0190504e20160317xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064043702DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02215d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Changlu10aEnhanced corrosion resistance of polybenzoxazine coatings by epoxy incorporation  ap. 28428-28434.  aPolybenzoxazine/epoxy composite coating has been developed on mild steel (MS) substrates by a thermal curing method.

The resulted composite coated samples exhibit significant enhancement on the corrosion resistance of MS with the corrosion current reduced by more than one order of magnitude, and the enhancement is improved with an increase in the epoxy content, which benefits from the dual crosslinking network of the composite coating through the incorporation of epoxy.

Transmission electron microscopy exhibited the platelets of LDH–CMC with a lateral size of 30–60nm and the thickness of 5–10nm. X-ray diffraction showed that the presence of CMC decreased the thickness of LDH. The chemical formulas of LDH was [Zn₀.₆₄·Al₀.₃₆·(OH)₂]Cl₀.₃₆·nH₂O, and the content of CMC was about 37.5wt%. LDH–CMC possessed the good stability in water because of hydrophilic CMC components and the smaller size of each LDH stack. A low loading of LDH–CMC (below 6wt%) could obviously improve mechanical properties and water vapor barrier of the nanocomposites, because LDH–CMC could form the good interaction with GPS matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaqueous solutions 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3aglycerol 3ahydrophilicity 3amechanical properties 3ananocomposites 3astarch 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awater vapor1 aChang, Peter R.1 aMa, Xiaofei0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 86, no. 2 p.877-882dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.05.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245014500171300001600316520109100332592002801423650001401451650001401465650002501479650001801504650001501522650001701537650001601554650001601570650001501586650001401601650003101615650001801646650001301664650001001677653003101687653004201718653003101760653003601791653003701827653003401864653003501898653004001933653003701973653004302010653001402053653001702067653001202084653002802096653002502124700001602149700001902165700001602184700001502200700001702215700001902232700005802251700001702309700001802326700002202344700002102366773010002387856008702487852000902574655001202583IND60568064020221118065002.0190402e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056806402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.1542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Yu Kyung10aProcess specific differential metabolomes for industrial gochujang types (pepper paste) manufactured using white rice, brown rice, and wheat  ap. 416-424.  aThe metabolic perplexes for gochujang (GCJ) fermentative bioprocess, a traditional Korean pepper paste, has largely remain equivocal for preparative conditions and raw material (RM) additives exacerbating its commercial standardization. Herein, we outlined a differential non-targeted metabolite profiling for three GCJ (white rice-WR; brown rice-BR; wheat-WT) under varying processing steps (P1 – fermentation; P2 – meju addition; P3 – ripening; and P4 – red pepper addition). We correlated the process specific metabolomes with corresponding physicochemical factors, enzymatic phenotypes, and bioactivities for GCJ-types. The P1 was characterized by a uniform increase in the levels of RM-derived lysoPCs. In contrast, P2 was observed with proportionally higher levels of meju-released isoflavones and soyasaponins in WR-GCJ, followed by BR and WT-GCJ. The P3 involved a cumulative increase in primary metabolites in all GCJ samples except lower organic acid contents in WT-GCJ. The pepper derived flavonoids and alkaloids were selectively increased while P4 in all GCJ-types.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aalkaloids 3abioactive properties 3abioprocessing 3abrown rice 3afermentation 3aisoflavones 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3aphenotype 3aphysicochemical properties 3araw materials 3aripening 3awheat 0aValine (PubChem CID: 6287) 0aLysoPC (18:2) (PubChem CID: 11005824) 0aSerine (PubChem CID: 5951) 0amyo-Inositol (PubChem CID: 892) 0aGenistein (PubChem CID: 5280961) 0aDaidzin (PubChem CID: 107971) 0aIsoleucine (PubChem CID: 6306) 0aSoyasaponin I (PubChem CID: 122097) 0aCapsaicin (PubChem CID: 1548943) 0aDihydrocapsaicin (PubChem CID: 107982) 0aGochujang 0aMetabolomics 0aEnzymes 0aPhysicochemical factors 0aProduction processes1 aShin, Gi Ru1 aJung, Eun Sung1 aLee, Sunmin1 aLee, Sarah1 aSingh, Digar1 aJang, Eun Seok1 aShin, Dong Joo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2784-18811 aKim, Hye-jin1 aShin, Hye Won1 aMoon, Byoung Seok1 aLee, Choong Hwan0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 234 p.416-424dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.1543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02099naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013900157300002000296520099600316592002801312650002201340650003401362650002101396650001501417650000901432650001401441650001501455700001901470700001901489700001901508700001501527773012401542856007401666852000901740655001201749IND60640437120221122064643.0190504e20160421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064043712DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02217k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xue-Jing10aElectrochemical performance in alkaline and neutral electrolytes of a manganese phosphate material possessing a broad potential window  ap. 40077-40085.  aAn underlying electrode material of manganese phosphate has been designed and synthesized, possessing wide potential windows (−0.9–0.7 V in neutral and −0.5–0.6 V in alkaline electrolyte), satisfying specific capacitances (203 F g⁻¹ in neutral and 194 F g⁻¹ in alkaline electrolyte), outstanding rate capabilities and excellent cycling stabilities.

K. marxianus LF permeate was fractionated by semipreparative high performance liquid chromatography and 35 peptides contained in the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory fractions were identified by using an ion trap mass spectrometer. On the basis of peptide abundance and common structural features, six peptides were chemically synthesized. Four of them (DPYKLRP, PYKLRP, YKLRP, and GILRP) exerted in vitro inhibitory effects on ACE activity and effectively decreased systolic blood pressure after oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Stability against gastrointestinal enzymes suggested that the sequence LRP could contribute to the in vivo effects of parental peptides. Finally, there were reductions in circulating ACE activity and angiotensin II level in SHRs after either DPYKLRP or LRP intake, thus confirming ACE inhibition as the in vivo mechanism for their antihypertensive effect. 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aangiotensin II 3aanimal disease models 3aantihypertensive effect 3agastrointestinal system 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahypertension 3alactoferrin 3aoral administration 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arats 3aspectrometers 3asystolic blood pressure1 aSanchez-Rivera, Laura1 aCastello-Ruiz, Maria1 aRecio, Isidra1 aSalom, Juan B.1 aManzanares, Paloma0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 62, no. 7 p.1609-1616dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf4053868  aDNAL 7aarticle01960naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015500168300001600323520076700339592002801106650002001134650001301154650001201167650001401179650001201193650000901205653001301214653001001227653001101237653001201248653003201260700002001292700002101312700001901333700001801352773009901370856008401469852000901553655001201562IND60122196620221119161346.0150325e20140504xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012219662DNAL7 a10.1080/03670244.2013.8138482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKain, Juliana10aAssociation between Socioeconomic Vulnerability and Height with Obesity in Low-Income Chilean Children in the Transition from Preschool to First Grade  ap. 241-255.  aThis study determined the percentage of obesity among lower-income Chilean children 4–6 years of age, by socioeconomic vulnerability (family score assessing the children’s risk of becoming poor) and height.

Sixteen sows were randomly allotted at breeding to two treatments containing low‐ and high‐RS contents from normal and high‐amylose corn varieties, respectively, and each treatment had eight replicates (sows). Individual piglet body weight (BW) and litter size were recorded at birth and weaning. Milk samples were obtained on day 10 after farrowing for composition analysis. On day 2 before weaning, blood and faecal samples were collected to determine serum metabolite and hormone concentrations and faecal microbial populations, respectively. Litter size at birth and weaning were not influenced (p > 0.05) by the sow dietary treatments. Although feeding the RS‐rich diet to sows reduced (p = 0.004) offspring birth BW, there was no difference in piglet BW at weaning (p > 0.05). High‐RS diet increased (p < 0.05) serum triacylglycerol and nonesterified fatty acid concentrations and milk total solid content, and tended (p = 0.09) to increase milk fat content in lactating sows. Feeding the RS‐rich diet to sows increased (p < 0.01) faecal bacterial population diversity. These results indicate that high‐RS diets induce fatty acid mobilization and a greater intestinal bacterial richness in lactating sows, as well as a greater nutrient density in maternal milk, without affecting offspring performance at weaning.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3abreeding 3acorn 3adiet 3afarrowing 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3afeces 3afree fatty acids 3alactating females 3alactation 3alipid content 3alitter size 3amilk 3amilk fat 3anutrient density 3apiglets 3aprogeny 3aresistant starch 3asows 3atriacylglycerols 3aweaning1 aLu, H.1 aAlmeida, V.

In situ soil moisture data are uneven and sparse in time and space. This highlights the need to utilize other soil moisture sources to fill this spatiotemporal gap. The goal of this study is to validate one satellite-based and two model-based soil moisture datasets with in situ data across the United States. Soil moisture information from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) enhanced level 3 (L3) (SMAP L3) and modeled level 4 (L4) (SMAP L4) data at 9-km resolution and Short-term Prediction Research and Transition-Land Information System (SPoRT-LIS) modeled at 3-km resolution were selected for evaluation. SPoRT-LIS is a near real-time, high resolution operational land analysis data. Ground-based data were obtained from the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD) for 362 stations. Seven statistical indicators including anomaly, Spearman, and Pearson correlation coefficients, the systematic error (Bias), root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), and normalized standard deviation (SDV) were used to evaluate the satellite- and model-derived soil moisture data. In addition, the triple collocation (TC) error model was used to measure the error among SMAP L4, SPoRT-LIS and ground-based data. This study assesses which satellite or modeled dataset is most appropriate for specific times and locations to use as a surrogate for in situ observations. Temporal and spatial analysis demonstrated that, overall, SMAP L4 performed better than SMAP L3 and SPoRT-LIS. Strong agreement was observed between SMAP L4 and in situ observations (ρ = 0.53, Bias = −0.006) in all seasons and most regions with various land covers, especially in winter and in the central regions of the United States. For croplands, SMAP L4 presented the best agreement with in situ data, analyzing all period (ρ = 0.60) and non-winter period (ρ = 0.61) separately.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acropland 3adata collection 3adatabases 3adrought 3aheat 3ainformation systems 3amodels 3aprediction 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3asoil water 3astandard deviation 3awinter 3aUnited States 0aRemote sensing 0aSoil moisture retrieval 0aStatistics 0aLand use 0aNASA SMAP enhanced level 3 0aSMAP level 4 0aNorth American soil moisture database 0aLand cover 0aIn situ 0aSeasonal 0aTriple collocation 0aAnomaly correlation coefficient 0aEcoregion 0aSPoRT-LIS1 aRahmani, Vahid1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0583-25381 aQuiring, Steven M.1 aKumar, Sujay V.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2019 Aug., v. 229 p.234-246dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:11735x0034-42577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2019.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092024002200119024001900141040001800160100002000178245021900198300001800417506007600435520107600511506003701587650002101624650002801645650002601673650002801699650002601727650001201753650001301765650001401778650002401792650001001816650001201826650001801838650001501856650000701871650001301878650001301891700002201904700002701926773016101953856004002114852000902154655001202163IND4534854320221207085103.0150828e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453485432DNAL7 a10.1021/jf404785m2doi7 aPMC39314082pmcid7 a244439732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaudigl, Petra10al-Arabinose Isomerase and d-Xylose Isomerase from Lactobacillus reuteri: Characterization, Coexpression in the Food Grade Host Lactobacillus plantarum, and Application in the Conversion of d-Galactose and d-Glucose  ap. 1617-1624.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe l-arabinose isomerase (l-AI) and the d-xylose isomerase (d-XI) encoding genes from Lactobacillus reuteri (DSMZ 17509) were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The proteins were purified to homogeneity by one-step affinity chromatography and characterized biochemically. l-AI displayed maximum activity at 65 Â°C and pH 6.0, whereas d-XI showed maximum activity at 65 Â°C and pH 5.0. Both enzymes require divalent metal ions. The genes were also ligated into the inducible lactobacillal expression vectors pSIP409 and pSIP609, the latter containing a food grade auxotrophy marker instead of an antibiotic resistance marker, and the l-AI- and d-XI-encoding sequences/genes were coexpressed in the food grade host Lactobacillus plantarum. The recombinant enzymes were tested for applications in carbohydrate conversion reactions of industrial relevance. The purified l-AI converted d-galactose to d-tagatose with a maximum conversion rate of 35%, and the d-XI isomerized d-glucose to d-fructose with a maximum conversion rate of 48% at 60 Â°C.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus reuteri 3aaffinity chromatography 3aantibiotic resistance 3aenzymes 3afructose 3agalactose 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglucose 3aisomerization 3ametal ions 3apH 3aproteins 3atagatose1 aHaltrich, Dietmar1 aPeterbauer, Clemens K.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 62, no. 7 p.1617-1624dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf404785m  aDNAL 7aarticle01402naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002300154245010200177300001600279520054500295592002800840650001800868650001600886651001700902651001200919700002100931773010800952856005501060852000901115655001201124IND50068331820221119171919.0130803e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006833182DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1756-1051.2012.00039.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, Fernando B.10aElaphoglossum clathratum sp. nov.

The yields of the seven fractions together accounted for 80.1% of total available hemicellulosic polysaccharides. Sugar composition studies showed that the water-soluble polysaccharides consisted mainly of glucose units, while xylose, arabinose and glucuronic acid were the major sugars in alkali-soluble hemicelluloses. Moreover, the molecular weights of these polymers varied between 3760 and 36,000g/mol as revealed by GPC. Furthermore, the structure of the hemicellulosic fraction extracted with 3% NaOH was determined by ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectroscopy along with 2D HSQC. It was found that the bamboo hemicelluloses were O-acetyl-(4-O-methylglucurono)-arabinoxylans, and the structural element could be identified as below: 1,4-β-D-[2-O-Ac][2,3-di-O-Ac][4-O-Me-α-D-GlcpA-(1→2)][α-L-Araf-(1→2)(1→3)]-xylp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhyllostachys incarnata 3aarabinose 3abamboos 3acarbon 3aethanol 3aglucose 3aglucuronic acid 3ahemicellulose 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3asodium hydroxide 3astable isotopes 3axylose 3ayields1 aPeng, Feng1 aBian, Jing1 aXu, Feng1 aSun, Runcang,1 aKennedy, John F.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 86, no. 2 p.883-890dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02606naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245012500210300001100335500001100346506007600357520100200433592002801435506003701463650002501500650002201525650002201547650001601569650001801585650001501603650002301618650002001641650002001661650002401681650001901705650001301724650001601737650002201753650002401775700002401799700006101823700002601884773011101910856008202021852000902103655001202112IND60606744020221207092253.0190919e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060674402DNAL7 a300607582pmid7 aPMC60669422pmcid7 a10.1186/s13567-018-0558-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijk, Albert van,14aThe potential for immunoglobulins and host defense peptides (HDPs) to reduce the use of antibiotics in animal production  ap. 68.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInnate defense mechanisms are aimed at quickly containing and removing infectious microorganisms and involve local stromal and immune cell activation, neutrophil recruitment and activation and the induction of host defense peptides (defensins and cathelicidins), acute phase proteins and complement activation. As an alternative to antibiotics, innate immune mechanisms are highly relevant as they offer rapid general ways to, at least partially, protect against infections and enable the build-up of a sufficient adaptive immune response. This review describes two classes of promising alternatives to antibiotics based on components of the innate host defense. First we describe immunoglobulins applied to mimic the way in which they work in the newborn as locally acting broadly active defense molecules enforcing innate immunity barriers. Secondly, the potential of host defense peptides with different modes of action, used directly, induced in situ or used as vaccine adjuvants is described.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacute phase proteins 3aadaptive immunity 3aanimal production 3aantibiotics 3acathelicidins 3acomplement 3adefense mechanisms 3aimmunoglobulins 3ainnate immunity 3amechanism of action 3amicroorganisms 3aneonates 3aneutrophils 3avaccine adjuvants 3aveterinary medicine1 aHedegaard, Chris J.1 aHaagsman, Henk P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4931-52011 aHeegaard, Peter M.

As these environments proliferate and mature, a set of topics is emerging as common ground between them. This paper abstracts common characteristics from leading integrated modelling technologies and derives a generic framework, characterised as a Model MAP – Metadata (including documentation and licence), Adaptors (to common standards) and Portability (of model components). The idea is to form a gateway concept consisting of a checklist of elements which must be in place before a numerical model is offered for interoperability in a structured environment and at a level of abstraction suitable to support environmental model interoperability in general. Following comparison to the Component-Based Water Resource Model Ontology, the Model MAP is applied to DRIHM, an hydro-meteorological research infrastructure, as the initial use case and more generic aspects are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aenvironmental models 3ahydrometeorology 3ainfrastructure 3amathematical models 0aEnvironmental modeling 0aHydro-meteorology 0aModel integration 0aMetadata 0aStandards 0aCF 0aCUAHSI-HIS 0aCSDMS 0aDRIHM 0aDRIHM2US 0aHPC 0aICT 0aNetCDF 0aOGC 0aOpenMI 0aRIBS 0aSDK 0aWaterML 0aWRF-ARW 0aXML0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2015 Nov., v. 73 p.260-271dElsevier Ltdx1364-81527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2015.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03247naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006900156300001200225500001100237520202900248592002802277650001402305650001102319650001502330650001002345650001402355650001002369650001702379650000902396650000902405650001002414650001702424650001002441650001102451650001602462650001702478650001302495650001102508650001102519700001902530700001802549773012802567856007302695852000902768655001202777IND60572055520221119053515.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057205552DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.125072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, M. P.10aDigestive sensitivity varies according to size of dogs: a review  ap. 1-9.  aREVIEW  aField observations on food tolerance have repeatedly shown that when fed an identical diet, large breed (>25 kg) dogs present softer and moister faeces than small breed ones (<15 kg). The purpose of this review is to highlight the findings of four PhD theses, carried out between 1998 and 2013, whose objectives were to investigate the anatomical and physiological peculiarities that would explain, at least in part, this observation, as well as their nutritional implication. This work showed that large breed dogs, in contrast with smaller breeds, present a highly developed caecum and colon, which could explain the relatively longer colonic transit time. A prolonged colonic transit time could explain higher colonic fermentative activity, as supported by higher faecal concentrations of fermentative by‐products. This effect would be reinforced by increased intestinal permeability and reduced sodium net‐absorption. Taken together, these elements could be a possible cause of higher digestive sensitivity in large breed dogs. When prescribing a diet to a small or large breed dog, several aspects of the formulation must be taken into account. For a large breed dog, the general goal is to limit any ingredient that could increase the level of fermentable undigested residues and, in fine, exacerbate colonic fermentation. Highly digestible sources of proteins and starches are therefore strongly recommended to maintain an optimal digestive tolerance. Fermentable fibre sources (i.e. beet pulp and FOS) must also be used in limited quantity in their diet. Conversely, the incorporation of non‐fermentable fibre (i.e. cellulose) appears useful to increase their stool quality. For a small breed dog, the general objective is to minimize any ingredient that could excessively limit colonic fermentation and induce in fine constipation. Purified starches and cellulose are therefore not really suitable for them.

The initial objective of our study was to fine-tune an experimental model of infection of the goat mammary gland with two strains of S. aureus and two lines of goats (low and high somatic cell score lines). Following the challenge, the 10 infected goats divided in two clear-cut severity groups, independently of the S. aureus strain and the goat line. Five goats developed very severe mastitis (of which four were gangrenous) characterized by uncontrolled infection (UI group), whereas the other five kept the infection under control (CI group). The outcome of the infection was determined by 18 h post-infection (hpi), as heralded by the bacterial milk concentration at 18 hpi: more than 10⁷/mL in the UI group, about 10⁶/mL in the CI group. Leukocyte recruitment and composition did not differ between the groups, but the phagocytic killing at 18 hpi efficiency did. Contributing factors involved milk concentrations of α-toxin and LukMF′ leukotoxin, but not early expression of the genes encoding the pentraxin PTX3, the cytokines IL-1α and IL-1β, and the chemokines IL-8 and CCL5. Concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-17A, and IL-22 rose sharply in the milk of UI goats when infection was out of control. The results indicate that defenses mobilized by the mammary gland at an early stage of infection were essential to prevent staphylococci from reaching critical concentrations. Staphylococcal exotoxin production appeared to be a consequent event inducing the evolution to gangrenous mastitis.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013 00082862cRégion Centre, France0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3achemokine CCL5 3aclearcutting 3adairy goats 3aexotoxins 3agenes 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-1alpha 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-8 3aleukocytes 3aleukotoxins 3amammary glands 3amastitis 3amilk 3amodels 3asomatic cells 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aveterinary medicine1 aGitton, Christophe1 aChaumeil, Thierry1 aFassier, Thierry1 aHuau, Christophe1 aRiou, Mickael1 aTosser-Klopp, Gwenola1 aKrupova, Zuzana1 aChaize, Anne1 aGilbert, Florence B.1 aRupp, Rachel1 aMartin, Patrice0 tVeterinary research.g2018 Dec., v. 49, no. 1 p.72-72dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4142873x1297-97167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13567-018-0564-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02094naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100006000159245010800219500001900327520086800346592002801214650002201242650002001264650001601284650001301300650002101313650001301334653002501347653005901372700001901431700005601450700002101506773011401527856009401641852000901735655001201744IND60718505220221123011619.0210212e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071850522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.1094372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaszonyiová, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7071-263114aThe effect of long-term natural aging on the iPB-1 structure and the II – I phase transformation rate  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe long-term natural aging of isotactic polybutene-1 samples of different molecular weight has shown that the transformation rate from the initial phase II to the stable phase I significantly decreased after natural aging, ranging from 0 to 17 years. It was found that the total crystallinity decreased with aging time and a small amount of phase II remained untransformed for at least 17 years. The transformation rate of a lower molecular weight sample, DP 0400, was higher than the PB 0110 sample, even after repeated polymer melting of aged samples and their new melt crystallization. The major phenomenon of the iPB-1 aging is the change in a ratio of methyl/methylene functional groups; possibly because of a side chain splitting that reduces the geometric regularity of the molecular chain and consecutively slows down the proceeding phase transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adegradation 3ageometry 3amolecular weight 3apolymers 0aIsotactic polybutene 0a1, phase transformation types, long-term natural aging1 aRybnikář, F.1 aLapčík, L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9917-73101 aVilčáková, J.0 tPolymer degradation and stability.g2021 Jan., v. 183 p.109437-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12486x0141-39107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.polymdegradstab.2020.1094373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245011100158300002000269520142700289592002801716650001501744650001101759650001701770650001401787650001301801650003401814650001701848650001801865650002501883650001101908650001301919650001101932700001801943700001801961700002001979773012401999856007402123852000902197655001202206IND60640437620221122051909.0190504e20160223xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064043762DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02234k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Vikash10aFabrication of laminated and coated Nafion 117 membranes for reduced mass transfer in microbial fuel cells  ap. 21526-21534.  aSulfonation of polyvinylidinefluoride (PVdF) with chlorosulfonic acid for 2 hours revealed a respective 33% degree of sulfonation (DS) in a SPVdF membrane. The resulting sulfonated PVdF resins were used for Nafion 117 modification as coat and laminating materials, where the modified Nafion 117 membranes (laminated and coated with SPVdF) were used as polymer electrolyte membranes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Coating/lamination exhibited reduced oxygen diffusion across membranes by a magnitude of less than two orders over a pristine Nafion 117 membrane. This resulted in higher open circuit voltages (OCVs) with increased coulombic efficiency (CE) in MFCs. With SPVdF coated and laminated Nafion 117 membranes, respective IEC values of 0.57 and 0.46 meq g⁻¹ and proton conductivities of 5.91 × 10⁻³ and 5.11 × 10⁻³ S cm⁻¹ were observed, indicating maximum power and current densities of 446.45 ± 21 mW m⁻² & 1721.78 ± 86 mA m⁻² and 413.79 ± 20 mW m⁻² & 1657.57 ± 82 mA m⁻² in MFCs using mixed Firmicutes as biocatalysts. The obtained coulombic efficiencies were higher (approx. 1–2%) than those of pristine Nafion 117, indicative of its reduced oxygen diffusion at the anode. In effect, the study enumerates the efficiency of modified Nafion 117 with sulfonated PVdF coated and laminated membranes as a separating barrier in single-chambered MFCs for microbial bio-energy conversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFirmicutes 3aanodes 3abiocatalysts 3abioenergy 3acoatings 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrolytes 3amass transfer 3amicrobial fuel cells 3aoxygen 3apolymers 3aresins1 aKumar, Piyush1 aNandy, Arpita1 aKundu, Patit P.0 tRSC advances.g2016 Feb. 23, v. 6, no. 26 p.21526-21534dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra02234k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245010100160300001600261500002000277520179400297592002802091650002502119650002502144650002702169650002102196650002002217650001502237650002102252650002002273650001002293650002702303650002502330650003602355650000902391650001602400650001602416650000902432650001702441650002602458650001102484650001302495650002102508700001802529700001802547700001902565700002202584700001702606700002502623773013202648856007302780852000902853655001202862IND60572055720221119053812.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057205572DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.124372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDel Vesco, A.

For this, meat quails of 42 days of age were fed a diet that either met [0.33 mg/kg, nutritional demand for selenium (SS)] or did not meet [0.11 mg/kg, selenium deficient (SD)] the nutritional demands for selenium during the 7 days of evaluation. In addition, the animals were kept at either a thermal comfort temperature (25 °C) or exposed to HS (38 °C for 24 h). Glutathione synthetase (GSS), glutathione reductase (GSR) and uncoupling protein (UCP) gene expression were influenced by the interaction between temperature and diet. Animals subjected to HS and fed the SS diet exhibited the highest GSS and GSR gene expression. In terms of UCP gene expression, the lowest values were observed in HS animals on the SD diet. Glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPX7) gene expression, body temperature (BT) and creatine kinase (CK) activity were influenced by both selenium supplementation and HS. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity and creatinine content all were influenced by the diet/environment interaction. The highest AST activity, ALT activity and creatinine levels were observed in animals that were both on the SD diet and exposed to HS. HS animals also exhibited an increased heterophil/lymphocyte ratio and lower triiodothyronine (T3) hormone levels than birds that remained at the comfortable temperature. Animals subjected to HS and fed with selenium supplemented diet showed better results regarding gene expression and, thus, better results for the activities of enzymes used as stress markers, which could be due to the higher antioxidant capacity provided by the action of the studied genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine transaminase 3aantioxidant activity 3aaspartate transaminase 3abody temperature 3acreatine kinase 3acreatinine 3afeed supplements 3agene expression 3agenes 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aglutathione synthase 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheterophils 3ameat 3ameat quality 3anutrient deficiencies 3aquails 3aselenium 3atriiodothyronine1 aGasparino, E.1 aZancanela, V.1 aGrieser, D.

On trees occupied by Atopomyrmex and Crematogaster, and on trees invaded by columns of workers after recruitment by scouts, the predatory activity begins when the fig wasps emerge. Then, the ants attack unripe figs (asynchronization in ripeness), destroying whole figs of certain trees. The male function of the trees through pollen dispersal by fig wasps is, therefore, severely reduced, while the female function (seed dispersal) is affected only on unripe figs before fig wasp emergence. We recorded 13 ant species on the 73 Ficus vallis-choudae of the Batchenga savanna (Cameroon) studied, but only the five previously cited species were able to occupy an entire fig tree. The three Myrmicinae which have a status of dominant (large colony size; strong territoriality vis-à-vis other dominant species; can tolerate non-dominant species) tended scale insects. Both Camponotus species (and the eight other ant species) are non-dominant (small colony size), but are able to occupy a whole tree under certain conditions (here, when they tend the tettigometrid Hilda undata) and to be territorial. Their status corresponds, therefore, to that of sub-dominant. Tests of aggressiveness showed that each ant species is aggressive towards alien conspecifics. C. brutus individuals were tolerated on fig trees occupied by Atopomyrmex mocquerisi or by Crematogaster clariventris, while workers of both latter species, who do not tolerate one another, were not tolerated on fig trees occupied by C. brutus. In this situation, the cost-benefit for the trees depends on the ant species that occupies their foliage; C. brutus, when tending tettigometrids, is advantageous. There is, therefore, an indirect influence of the tettigometrids on the production of fig pollinating wasps and seeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaonidae 3aCamponotus 3aCrematogaster 3aFicus 3aHomoptera 3aaggression 3adominant species 3afemales 3afigs 3aleaves 3amales 3apollen flow 3asavannas 3aseed dispersal 3aterritoriality 3aCameroon 0aant-tettigometrid trophobiosis 0aHymenoptera 0aant mosaic 0afig protection 0aseed dispersion1 aBourgoin, Thierry1 aGibernau, Marc0 tÉcoscience.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 4 p.446-453dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1997.116824223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01593naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001100181245010000192300002000292506007600312520036100388592002800749506003700777650001600814650002700830650002300857650002300880650002100903650001500924650001700939700002000956700002400976773013601000856007401136852000901210655001201219IND60659696720221207145058.0190823e20121029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065969672DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36366f2doi7 aPMC37381712pmcid7 a230760122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAn, Na10aModulation of the current signatures of DNA abasic site adducts in the α-hemolysin ion channel  ap. 11410-11412.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aElectrical current signatures of DNA adducts were investigated during immobilization of strands inside the membrane-bound α-hemolysin ion channel.

The feasibility and the fundamental characteristics of the proposed PE-ORC were experimentally evaluated by establishing an ORC loop with two parallel expanders and testing the performance of the system in different operating modes and in dynamic tests. The PE-ORC was found to be capable of achieving a higher efficiency and a higher total power output than was achieved using a basic ORC configuration when conditions changed from those for which the basic ORC was designed, but the PE-ORC operating mode was changed to suit the new conditions. The proposed PE-ORC could therefore be a better design than is currently available for ORCs that are subject to large variations in the amounts of waste heat produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3aheat 3ainternal combustion engines 3awastes 0aOrganic Rankine cycle 0aMultiple expanders in parallel 0aOff-design 0aWaste heat variation 0aInternal Combustion Engine (ICE)1 aKim, To-gyun,1 aYoon, Sang Youl1 aKim, Kyung Chun0 tApplied energy.g2015 May 01, v. 145 p.246-254dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2015.02.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245015600170300001800326520176600344592002802110650001502138650001102153650002402164650000902188650001002197650002802207650001902235650000702254650001502261650001202276650004002288650002002328650001102348650002602359650001302385700001902398700001802417700001702435700002102452700002402473700002102497700001902518773012502537856007502662852000902737655001202746IND60534716120170606000000.0160803e20130618xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053471612DNAL7 a10.1021/es400373s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández-Gómez, Cristal10aTowards Universal Wavelength-Specific Photodegradation Rate Constants for Methyl Mercury in Humic Waters, Exemplified by a Boreal Lake-Wetland Gradient  ap. 6279-6287.  aWe report experimentally determined first-order rate constants of MeHg photolysis in three waters along a Boreal lake-wetland gradient covering a range of pH (3.8–6.6), concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC 17.5–81 mg L–¹), total Fe (0.8–2.1 mg L–¹), specific UV₂₅₄ ₙₘ absorption (3.3–4.2 L mg–¹ m–¹) and TOC/TON ratios (24–67 g g–¹). Rate constants determined as a function of incident sunlight (measured as cumulative photon flux of photosynthetically active radiation, PAR) decreased in the order dystrophic lake > dystrophic lake/wetland > riparian wetland. After correction for light attenuation by dissolved natural organic matter (DOM), wavelength-specific (PAR: 400–700 nm, UVA: 320–400 nm and UVB: 280–320 nm) first-order photodegradation rate constants (kₚd) determined at the three sites were indistinguishable, with average values (±SE) of 0.0023 ± 0.0002, 0.10 ± 0.024 and 7.2 ± 1.3 m² E–¹ for kₚdPAR, kₚdUVA, and kₚdUVB, respectively. The relative ratio of kₚdPAR, kₚdUVA, and kₚdUVB was 1:43:3100. Experiments conducted at varying MeHg/TOC ratios confirm previous suggestions that complex formation with organic thiol groups enhances the rate of MeHg photodegradation, as compared to when O and N functional groups are involved in the speciation of MeHg. We suggest that if the photon fluxes of PAR, UVA, and UVB radiation are separately determined and the wavelength-specific light attenuation is corrected for, the first-order rate constants kₚdPAR, kₚdUVA, and kₚdUVB will be universal to waters in which DOM (possibly in concert with Fe) controls the formation of ROS, and the chemical speciation of MeHg is controlled by the complexation with DOM associated thiols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon 3achemical speciation 3airon 3alakes 3amethylmercury compounds 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphotolysis 3aphotons 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3asolar radiation 3athiols 3aultraviolet radiation 3awetlands1 aDrott, Andreas1 aBjørn, Erik,1 aDíez, Sergi1 aBayona, Josep M.1 aTesfalidet, Solomon1 aLindfors, Anders1 aSkyllberg, Ulf0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 June 18, v. 47, no. 12 p.6279-6287dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes400373s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01590naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100008800140245006200228300002000290520037000310592002800680650002700708650002300735650001700758650001800775650001400793700001800807700002000825700002500845700002000870700001700890700002200907700001600929700001900945700002100964773013600985856007401121852000901195655001201204IND60659696920221118060224.0190823e20121017xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065969692DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36370d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŠepelákOn leave from the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Košice, Slovakia., Vladimir10aMechanosynthesis of nanocrystalline fayalite, Fe₂SiO₄  ap. 11121-11123.  aNanostructured fayalite (α-Fe₂SiO₄) with a large volume fraction of interfaces is synthesized for the first time via single-step mechanosynthesis, starting from a 2α-Fe₂O₃ + 2Fe + 3SiO₂ mixture.

A 2 × 2 factorial design was used to test the effect of 2 dietary treatments (adding 0 or 1000 mg/kg AAE) and 2 immune stress treatments (injecting saline or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). A total of 96 one‐day‐old Arbor Acres (AA) broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups with six replicates, four birds in each replicate. Broilers in Treatment groups 1 and 2 were fed with the basal diet, and those in Treatment groups 3 and 4 were fed with the experimental diet supplemented with 1000 mg/kg AAE. On days 14, 16, 18 and 20, broilers in both Treatments 1 and 3 were injected intra‐abdominally with LPS solution at the dose of 500 μg LPS per kg BW with the LPS dissolved in sterile saline at a concentration of 100 μg/ml, and those in Treatments 2 and 4 were injected intra‐abdominally with equal amount of sterile 0.9% saline. Blood samples were collected on days 21 and 28. The results showed that dietary supplementation of AAE prevented reductions in average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed intake (ADFI) of broilers caused by LPS on d 15–21. On day 21, the injection of LPS increased serum adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone (CORT); meanwhile, feeding AAE reduced the rise of CORT caused by LPS. Immune parameters such as interleukin‐1 (IL‐1), interleukin‐2 (IL‐2), interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) were also improved by LPS, but the content of IL‐2 and IgG in broilers fed with AAE diet was significantly lower than that of broilers fed with control diet. All the data suggested that diets supplemented with AAE could relieve the immune stress response of broilers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia argyi 3aaverage daily gain 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3abroiler chickens 3acorticosterone 3acorticotropin 3adietary supplements 3aexperimental diets 3afeed intake 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-2 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3astress response1 aShi, B.

Two neighboring spaces were defined: (i) the Neighborhood is a space enclosed by a sphere of radius DN whose center is located at a focal nest; (ii) the Surrounding is a space enclosed by a sphere of radius DS (DS > DN) that excludes the Neighborhood. DN and DS were set at several different values. The number of nests in the Neighborhood had a significant negative effect on reproductive success when DN = 0.5 m for E. garzetta and when DN =1.5 m for A. cinerea. The number of nests within the Surrounding had a significant positive effect on the reproductive success of A. cinerea when DN = 1.5 m and DS = 3 m or DS = 4.5 m. These results suggest that to examine individual differences in reproductive success within colonies, we should choose the appropriate Neighborhood and Surrounding to detect the effects of interactions among neighboring individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArdea cinerea 3aEgretta garzetta 3anests 3areproductive success 0adensity-dependent 0ascale 0aegret 0aheron 0aneighborhood1 aKawata, Masakado0 tÉcoscience.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 4 p.465-469dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1997.116824253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02092naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245009800170300001600268520091800284592002801202650004401230650002201274650002301296650001101319650001401330650001201344650001901356650001201375650001801387650002201405700002201427700002001449700002301469700002401492773009601516856008501612852000901697655001201706IND60087861120221123022435.0141102e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008786112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.05.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSultan, Misbah10aImprovement of performance behavior of cellulosic fiber with polyurethane acrylate copolymers  ap. 928-935.  aPolyurethane acrylate (PUA) copolymers were synthesized following three step synthesis using toluene-2,4-diisocyanate, poly (2-methyl-1,3-propylene glutarate) diol terminated, 2-hydroxyethylacrylate (HEA) and butyl acrylate (BuA) via emulsion polymerization technique.

Initially, CuO-NiO was prepared and applied for the catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP). The results showed that CuO-NiO demonstrate high catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4-NP to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) with a rate constant of 2.97 × 10⁻² s⁻¹. Further, CuO-NiO were well-dispersed in the polymeric matrix of carboxymethyl cellulose to prepare CMC/CuO-NiO beads. CMC/CuO-NiO nanocomposite beads were also applied to catalyze the reduction of potassium ferrocyanide (K₃Fe (CN)₆), 4-NP, Congo red (CR) and Eosin yellow (EY) in the presence of sodium borohydride. Experimental data indicated that CMC/CuO-NiO nanocomposite has higher catalytic activity and high rate constant compared to CuO-NiO. The rate constant found to be 6.88 × 10⁻², 6.27 × 10⁻², 1.89 × 10⁻² and 2.43 × 10⁻² for K₃Fe(CN)₆, 4-NP, CR and EY, respectively, using 5 mg CMC/CuO-NiO beads. FE-SEM, EDX, FTER, XRD and XPS were used to characterize the nanocomposites. CMC/CuO-NiO beads catalytically reduced up to 95–99% of K₃Fe(CN)₆, 4-NP, CR and EY within 40, 60, 120 and 120 s. CMC/CuO-NiO beads were found more selective for the reduction of 4-NP. The catalytic reduction performance of CMC/CuO-NiO beads was optimized by studying the influence of different parameters on the catalytic reduction of 4-NP. Hence, the effective and super catalytic performance toward the reduction of different organic and inorganic pollutants makes CMC/CuO-NiO beads a smart material and suitable for numerous scientific and industrial applications and may be used as an alternative to high-cost commercial catalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaminophenols 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aeosin 3ananocomposites 3ap-nitrophenol 3apolymers 3apotassium 3asmart materials 3asodium borohydride 3asustainable technology 0aCuO-NiO 0aCMC 0aNanocomposite beads 0aNanocatalyst 0aOrganic pollutants 0aInorganic pollutants1 aKhan, Sher Bahadar1 aDanish, Ekram Y.1 aBakhsh, Esraa M.1 aZakeeruddin, Shaik M.1 aAsiri, Abdullah M.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2021 Jan. 15, v. 167 p.101-116dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.11.0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02347naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002000137245017700157300001800334520105500352650004801407650003101455650001201486650002701498650001301525650001701538650001001555650002501565650000901590650001001599650001601609650002301625650001201648650001401660650001101674700002401685700001801709773016101727856004001888852000901928655001201937IND4534854820221120180257.0150828e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453485482DNAL7 a10.1021/jf404567e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaneko, Daisuke10aReduction of the Off-Flavor Volatile Generated by the Yogurt Starter Culture Including Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in Soymilk  ap. 1658-1663.  aStreptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus establish a symbiotic relationship in milk; however, S. thermophilus predominantly grows in soymilk. This study determined that excess diacetyl was notably generated mainly by S. thermophilus in soymilk, and this flavor compound created an unpleasant odor in fermented soymilk. The addition of l-valine to soymilk reduced the amount of diacetyl and increased the levels of acetoin during fermentation by S. thermophilus. In addition, it was found that the expression of the ilvC gene was repressed and that of the als and aldB genes was stimulated in S. thermophilus by l-valine. Sensory evaluations with the triangle difference test and a preference test showed that the soymilk fermented with l-valine was significantly preferred compared with that without l-valine. In this study, we successfully controlled the metabolic flux of S. thermophilus in soymilk and produced more favorable fermented soymilk without the use of genetically modified lactic acid bacteria strains. 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aacetoin 3acultured milk starters 3adiacetyl 3afermentation 3agenes 3alactic acid bacteria 3amilk 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3asensory evaluation 3asoymilk 3asymbiosis 3avaline1 aIgarashi, Toshinori1 aAoyama, Kenji0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 62, no. 7 p.1658-1663dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf404567e  aDNAL 7aarticle04171naa a2200865 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011400171520198900285592002802274650002502302650001902327650001502346650001802361650001502379650001502394650001402409650002302423650001202446650001902458650003802477650001702515650001202532650001402544650002602558650001002584650001202594650001302606650002602619653000802645653000802653653000802661653000702669653000702676653000702683653000702690653000802697653000702705653001402712653000702726653001802733653001002751653000902761653000802770653000902778653000802787653000902795653000902804653001102813653000702824653000702831653000702838653001602845653000802861653000802869653001802877653002302895653002402918653002302942653001402965700001802979700001602997700001303013700001903026700001803045700001203063773012103075856008803196852000903284655001203293IND60689804520221120200129.0200607e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068980452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yating10aUVA radiation promotes tomato growth through morphological adaptation leading to increased light interception  aUVA radiation (315−400 nm) is the main component of solar UV radiation. Although it shares photoreceptors (i.e. cryptochromes and phototropins) with blue light (400−500 nm), its function in plant biology is unclear to a large extent. This study aimed at exploring how UVA radiation affects plant morphology and physiology, and at distinguishing to what extent these effects differ from those of blue light. Tomato plants were grown under monochromatic red (R), dichromatic red and blue (R/B = 7:1), as well as red and two different levels of UVA radiation (R/UVA = 7:1 and 15:1, respectively), with identical photon flux density (250 μmol⋅m⁻²⋅s⁻¹). Peak intensities of UVA, B and R were 370, 450 and 660 nm, respectively. We showed that replacing blue by UVA (in a background of red light) induced plant morphological modifications, as reflected by larger leaf area, steeper leaf angles, flatter leaves and longer stems. UVA had reduced effects on leaf secondary metabolism compared to blue light, resulting in significantly lower total phenolics and flavonoid contents, as well as concentrations of UV-absorbing compounds. In addition, UVA had a similar function as blue light in shaping the development of the photosynthetic apparatus, as both wavebands alleviated the ‘red light syndrome’ (i.e. low photosynthetic capacity, reduced photosynthetic electron transport, and unresponsive stomata). We conclude that: 1) UVA promotes tomato growth through morphological adaptation leading to increased light interception; 2) UVA affects leaf secondary metabolite accumulation less strongly than blue light; 3) UVA functions similarly to blue light in maintaining leaf photosynthetic functioning. Thus, unlike previously suggested, UVA cannot be unequivocally considered as an abiotic stress factor. This research adds to the understanding of plant processes in response to UVA radiation and provides a basis for future recipes for growing plants with artificial light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aabiotic stress 3ablue light 3acryptochromes 3aflavonoids 3aleaf angle 3aleaf area 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotons 3aphotoreceptors 3aphotosynthetic electron transport 3aphototropins 3arecipes 3ared light 3asecondary metabolites 3astems 3astomata 3atomatoes 3aultraviolet radiation 0aSAS 0aSLA 0aIAA 0aBR 0aAb 0aRf 0aTr 0aChl 0ags 0aFm and Fo 0aFs 0aFm´ and Fo´ 0aFv/Fm 0aLEDs 0aNPQ 0aAmax 0aPFD 0aPPFD 0aPSII 0aФPSII 0aqP 0aRd 0aα 0aVPDleaf-air 0aRUE 0aGAE 0aUVA radiation 0aPhotomorphogenesis 0aLeaf photosynthesis 0aRed light syndrome 0aPhenolics1 aKaiser, Elias1 aZhang, Yuqi1 aZou, Jie1 aBian, Zhonghua1 aYang, Qichang1 aLi, Tao0 tEnvironmental and experimental botany.g2020 Aug., v. 176 p.104073-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl7512x0098-84727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.1040733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245009400167300001600261520106200277592002801339650002101367650002601388650002901414650001301443650001801456650001501474650003301489650001101522650001101533650001201544700002001556700002501576700001801601700002301619700001901642773009601661856008501757852000901842655001201851IND60087861220221123022443.0141102e20110815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008786122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebeish, A.10aHighly effective antibacterial textiles containing green synthesized silver nanoparticles  ap. 936-940.  aNano-sized silver particles (AgNPs) (6–8nm) at concentration of 500ppm were synthesized using hydroxypropyl starch (HPS) as both reducing and stabilizing agent.

According to the phalanx efficiency and guerilla efficiency hypotheses, the removal of shoot apices disrupts apical dominance and increases branching, which in turn, increases shoot interference within the plant and/or reduces foraging efficiency. Hence, we predicted that shoot apex removal would result in an undercompensation growth response rather than the compensation or overcompensation commonly reported for upright species. Plant architecture was represented by patterns of allocation of meristems to three possible developmental fates: growth, reproduction, and inactivity. Clipping had no effect on architecture or fitness estimates (biomass, total number of meristems, and ramet production) in T. repens or G. hederacea. Fitness estimates were reduced by clipping in P. anserina, but branching intensity was unaffected. Foraging was compromised since clipped plants were unable to resume horizontal extension. In E. polygonifolia, clipping also reduced fitness estimates but without any effect on branching intensity. Since this species is naturally highly branched (i.e., with weak apical dominance), there may be little opportunity to increase branching intensity by removing apical meristems. In P. aviculare and F. virginiana, the removal of shoot apices resulted in reduced apical dominance and increased branching intensity and this was accompanied by reduced fitness estimates. These results suggest that apical dominance plays an important role in determining the adaptive architectural strategy of these latter two species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuphorbia 3aFragaria virginiana 3aGlechoma hederacea 3aPolygonum aviculare 3aPotentilla anserina 3aTrifolium repens 3aapical dominance 3aapical meristems 3abiomass 3aclones 3aplant architecture 3areproduction 0abranching 0aclonal plants 0aforaging 0aguerilla 0ameristem allocation 0aphalanx 0areproductive effort 0astrategy1 aBonser , Stephen P.1 aAarssen, Lonnie W.0 tÉcoscience.g1997 Jan. 1, v. 4, no. 4 p.490-500dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19715x2376-76267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1997.116824283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02228naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245012000154300002000274520101500294592002801309650001501337650001801352650001901370650001901389650000901408650000701417650001401424650001901438650001601457650001501473650001601488700001401504700001701518700001601535700001701551700001501568700001601583773012401599856007401723852000901797655001201806IND60640438320221120074436.0190504e20160302xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064043832DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02252a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, J.

Recently developed technologies for oil/water separation have been based mainly on materials with special wettability. In this work, a self-cleaning system with smart-control and reusable functions for oil/water separation has been built on cotton fabric via surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 2-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). The fabric showed high pH- and thermo-responsibility, which was strongly dependent on the pDMAEMA grafting ratio. And by modulating pH or temperature, the fabric switched from superhydrophilic (WCA ∼ 0°) to highly hydrophobic (WCA ∼ 130°), and therefore, were suitable both for the separation of water-rich or oil-rich oil/water mixtures as a type of adsorbent material. The fabric could adsorb oil over 4 times its own weight, and reversibly release it in acidic water, making the fabric easily recyclable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3acotton fabric 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3apolymerization 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awettability1 aZhang, C.1 aJiang, D.

A systematic study of the isothermal crystallization kinetics of TPS/PLA composites was performed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at different crystallization temperatures (Tc). The analysis based on the Avrami theory, which was applied to describe the process of isothermal crystallization, indicated that the spherulite growth rate, overall crystallization rate, and activation energy (ΔEₐ) of TPS/PLA composites were remarkably affected by the incorporation of TPS. TPS acts as a nucleating agent, improving the crystallinity of PLA in the composites. Furthermore, according to Lauritzen–Hoffman kinetic theory, the fold surface free energy (σₑ) of PLA blends is found to be higher than that of neat PLA, leading to a higher work of chain folding (q) and is ascribed to a general constraint of the PLA chain mobility in the composite melt due to the presence of TPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acrystal structure 3acrystallization 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenergy 3aglycerol 3amelting 3amixing 3apolylactic acid 3astarch 3atemperature 3athermoplastics1 aLiu, Miao1 aWang, Li1 aYao, Kunhua1 aLi, Sha1 aXiong, Hanguo0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2011 Aug. 15, v. 86, no. 2 p.941-947dElsevier Ltdx0144-86177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2011.05.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01617naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245015600170300002000326520051900346592002800865650004400893650002800937650001400965650001800979650001300997650002101010650001401031700001801045700002101063773012401084856007401208852000901282655001201291IND60640438420221120055328.0190504e20160309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064043842DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02255c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaghanezhad, Seyyed Jafar10aCucurbit[6]uril-OSO₃H: a novel acidic nanocatalyst for the one-pot preparation of 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes and 1,8-dioxo-octahydro-xanthenes  ap. 25525-25530.  aCucurbit[6]uril-OSO₃H (CB[6]-OSO₃H) has been prepared and used as an efficient acidic nanocatalyst for the one-pot preparation of 14-aryl-14H-dibenzo[a,j]xanthenes and 1,8-dioxo-octahydro-xanthenes.

Structurally similar to thyroid hormones (THs), they are retained in blood, transported through selective barriers, and the cause of endocrine and neuronal POP effects. This study presents a meta-analysis of HPC burdens in human and wildlife tissues, including OH-PCBs, OH-PBDEs, Pentachlorophenol, and polybromophenols. HPC blood plasma levels were also compared to known in vitro and in vivo toxicological effect concentrations. Blood, highly perfused, and fetal tissues contained the highest levels of HPCs. Plasma concentrations of analyzed OH-PCBs/PBDEs ranged from 0.1 to 100 nM in humans and up to 240, 454, 800, and 7650 nM for birds, fish, cetaceans, and other mammals, respectively. These concentrations fully fall within the in vitro effect concentrations reported in literature for HPCs of 0.05–10000 nM. We strongly advise further study of HPC blood levels in the general population, children, and fetal tissue to establish background levels and the risk at sensitive development stages. As not all HPCs are, or can be, chemically analyzed, the application of additional bioanalysis might reveal an even greater toxicological relevance of HPCs. In addition, metabolic activation should always be included within in vitro hazard assessment of POPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCetacea 3abirds 3ablood plasma 3achildren 3afish 3ahazard characterization 3ahumans 3ameta-analysis 3ametabolites 3aneurons 3apentachlorophenol 3apersistent organic pollutants 3aphenolic compounds 3arisk 3athyroid hormones 3atissues 3atoxicity 3awildlife1 aGutleb, Arno C.1 aMurk, AlberTinka J.0 tEnvironmental Science & Technology.g2013 June 18, v. 47, no. 12 p.6071-6081dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fes400478k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245010200168300001600270520133600286592002801622650003501650650001101685650001401696650001101710650001301721650002701734650001101761650001401772651001101786651001601797700003101813773011201844856004801956852000902004655001202013IND50068333820221119171850.0130805e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006833382DNAL7 a10.1007/s00334-012-0376-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLister, Diane L.10aIs naked barley an eastern or a western crop? The combined evidence of archaeobotany and genetics  ap. 439-446.  aForms of Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare (barley) that possess a naked caryopsis are an important human staple and are mainly found today in eastern Asia. However, naked barley has not always been an eastern crop: archaeobotanical data show that it was prevalent in Europe and the Near East during various periods in prehistory. In this review we have collated data on the incidence of hulled and naked barley at archaeological sites in Europe and the Near East from two sources: archaeobotanical literature reviews and an archaeobotanical database, both assembled by Helmut Kroll. We have also examined the incidence of hulled and naked barleys in extant germplasm collections. Our compilation of this archaeobotanical data has enabled us to elucidate long-term changes in the ratio of hulled to naked barley under cultivation in these regions; specifically, these records show that naked barley begins to disappear from the archaeobotanical record from the Chalcolithic/Bronze Age onwards in the Near East, and from the Iron Age/Roman periods onwards in Europe. We discuss the possible causes of this decline in naked barley cultivation in these regions, along with the present-day prevalence of naked barley landraces in eastern Asia, particularly in relation to genetic evidence, which shows that naked barley has a single origin.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare 3abarley 3adatabases 3afruits 3agenetics 3agermplasm conservation 3ahumans 3alandraces 3aEurope 3aMiddle East1 aJones, M.

An accurate IRD correction is essential for generating operational ocean colour products, but it remains a challenging task because of its dynamic variation irrespective of sensor’s optical mechanism. The IRD is caused due to the variation in time, location, viewing geometry, and electrical sensitivity of the sensor, which result in a radiometric discontinuity in the radiance distribution between the slot images observed at the top of atmosphere (TOA). Atmospheric correction of erroneous TOA radiance (Lₜ, Level-1 product) leads to noisy and degraded remote-sensing reflectance (Rᵣₛ, Level-2 product) products that limit ocean colour work. To improve the quality of Level-2 products (such as Rᵣₛ and chlorophyll), radiometric bias caused due to the IRD error in Level-1 product level needs to be removed. In the present study, a practical method for correcting the IRD effects is developed and tested on several GOCI radiometric products. The method is applied to TOA radiance data from all the slots based on a variable gain factor (). The gain factors for every slot are calculated with linear statistical and Lagrangian interpolation methods and applied consistently across the slot images provided by the GOCI sensor. In the absence of in situ data for these chosen images, GOCI results are compared with the corresponding MODIS-Aqua data. The proposed method is found to be effective in terms of reducing the radiance discontinuity for different slot pairs of the GOCI image, with mean relative differences of less than 0.1% and 2% for the Level-1 and Level-2 products, respectively. Despite its successful application to GOCI data, this method can be extended to similar sensors which rely on the slot-wise reception of ocean colour information over a large area.  aThis work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology [OEC1617130DSTXPSHA].  aPublisher supplied data  aOEC1617130DSTXPSHAcDepartment of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technologydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001409 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3ageometry 3aradiometry 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3atemporal variation1 aSingh, Rakesh Kumar1 aShanmugam, Palanisamy1 aAhn, Yu-Hwan0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2018 July 3, v. 39, no. 13 p.4499-4512dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl45620x1366-59017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2017.13756193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02938naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245014300153300001600296500002000312520176400332592002802096650002202124650002102146650001802167650002302185650001202208650000902220650001902229700001702248700001502265700001402280700003102294700002502325773013202350856007302482852000902555655001202564IND60572056420221119053215.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057205642DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.125522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilal, M.10aSignificant effect of NSP‐ase enzyme supplementation in sunflower meal‐based diet on the growth and nutrient digestibility in broilers  ap. 222-228.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe response of broiler chickens to 3 levels of sunflower meal and 2 levels of NSP‐ase enzyme combination (with and without) was investigated in 3 × 2 factorial arrangement under complete randomized design (CRD). A total of 240 Hubbard broiler chicks were fed on practical mash diets having 2950 kcal of ME and 21% CP from 1 to 42 days of age. The BW gain was not significantly reduced when 25% SFM was added in the diets during 1 to 42 days of age. Supplementation of NSP‐ase in broiler diets (day 1–42 overall) demonstrated non‐significant differences (p < 0.05) across the treatments in terms of FI and BWG. The difference in feed:gain at 15% or 20% SFM was observed to be non‐significant. Replacement of SBM with SFM or inclusion of SFM at higher level (25%) increased/deteriorated FCR. The addition of exogenous NSP‐ase showed a significant improvement (p < 0.01) in feed:gain. The improvement was clearly demonstrated when SFM was added to the experimental diet at 15% or even 20%. Supplementation of NSP‐ase at the 25% inclusion level could not, however, sustain the beneficial effect, which was possibly due to excessively high dietary CF. No difference was noted across the treatments regarding carcass response. Relative gizzard weight and intestinal weight were observed to be improved in birds consuming higher levels of SFM (p = 0.00). The digestibility of CF was observed to improve when SFM was used at 20% and 25% in the diets. No improvement in the digestibility of CF was observed with NSP‐ase supplementation, which meant other factors were clearly involved. Supplementation of NSP‐ase improved FCR up to 20% SFM.

While fungal and oomycete pathogens are known to affect seed viability and emergence, relatively little is known about which fungi and oomycetes are associated with seeds in the soil or how these species affect seeds and seedlings. We characterized the fungi and oomycetes associated with overwintering seeds in wetlands and determined their potential to influence seed germination and subsequent seedling mortality. Fungi and oomycetes did not affect seed germination, despite the isolation of high frequencies of known seed and seedling pathogens in the fungal genera Alternaria, Peyronellaea, Epicoccum, and Fusarium. However, many of the most frequently isolated fungal species from overwintering seeds were highly virulent to seedlings. While both native and nonnative plant species were tested, we did not observe consistent differences in either seed germination or seedling susceptibility based on the invasive status of plants tested, contrary to what we expected given several established hypotheses for invasive success. The high seedling virulence of fungi from overwintering seeds coupled with the differential abundance of some of the more pathogenic fungi among seeds of different plant species, led us to the conclusion that the fungal pathogens that colonize seeds in the seed bank over winter are likely to strongly impact subsequent seedling establishment in wetlands the following spring despite not reducing overwintering seed germination in the seed bank or differently effecting invasive plant species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria 3aEpicoccum 3aFusarium 3aOomycetes 3afungi 3aintroduced plants 3ainvasive species 3amortality 3aoverwintering 3apathogens 3aplant establishment 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asoil 3aspring 3aviability 3avirulence 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3awinter1 aLanzafane, Justin J.1 aKarp, Mary Ann1 aNelson, Eric B.1 aLangley, J.

The prepared crude bioflocculant was purified and fractionally precipitated to attain four purified sludge bioflocculant defined as PSB1–4. The PSB-2 has higher flocculating rate for kaolin suspension than others. When the pH of the flocculation system ranged from 4.0 to 11.0 the flocculating rates of PSB-2 were over 96.0%.X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra showed that amino and hydroxyl groups were present in the bioflocculant molecules. More amine group existed in the bioflocculant PSB-2 relatively. The amino group was believed to play an important role in flocculation. The experiment of zeta potential measuring indicated that the charge neutralization contributed to flocculation process. Flocculating mechanism investigation reveals that the sludge bioflocculant caused kaolin suspension instability by means of charge neutralization firstly and then promoted the aggregation of suspension particles by adsorption and bridge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aflocculation 3ahydrochloric acid 3akaolin 3aneutralization 3apH 3asludge 2aAdsorption 2aFlocculation 2aHydrochloric Acidxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKaolinxchemistry 2aPhotoelectron Spectroscopy 2aSewagexchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aStatic Electricity 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 0aExcess biological sludge 0aRecycling 0aBioflocculant 0aAcid disintegrating1 aSun, Jie1 aLiu, Xiuxiu1 aZhou, Jiti0 tBioresource technology.g2013 Oct., v. 146 p.51-56dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2013.07.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02526naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245008600156300001800242520122800260650002101488650002701509650002701536650003001563650002801593650001901621650001701640650001301657650002101670650002401691700003001715700002501745700002801770700001601798700002001814700002001834700001901854700002101873773016101894856004002055852000902095655001202104IND4534855220221120180058.0150828e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453485522DNAL7 a10.1021/jf405155p2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerde, Melanie10aDry-Heating of Lysozyme Increases Its Activity against Escherichia coli Membranes  ap. 1692-1700.  aFor food as well as for medical applications, there is a growing interest in novel and natural antimicrobial molecules. Lysozyme is a promising candidate for the development of such molecules. This protein is largely studied and known for its muramidase activity against Gram-positive bacteria, but it also shows antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, especially when previously modified. In this study, the activity of dry-heated lysozyme (DH-L) against Escherichia coli has been investigated and compared to that of native lysozyme (N-L). Whereas N-L only delays bacterial growth, DH-L causes an early-stage population decrease. The accompanying membrane permeabilization suggests that DH-L induces either larger pores or more pores in the outer membrane as compared to N-L, as well as more ion channels in the inner membrane. The strong morphological modifications observed by optical microscopy and atomic force microscopy when E. coli cells are treated with DH-L are consistent with the suggested disturbances of membrane integrity. The higher hydrophobicity, surface activity, and positive charge induced by dry-heating could be responsible for the increased activity of DH-L on the E. coli membranes. 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aanti-infective properties 3aatomic force microscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3aion channels 3alysozyme 3amicrobial growth 3apopulation dynamics1 aGuerin-Dubiard, Catherine1 aLechevalier, Valerie1 aCochet, Marie-Francoise1 aJan, Sophie1 aBaron, Florence1 aGautier, Michel1 aVie, Veronique1 aNau, Françoise,0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 62, no. 7 p.1692-1700dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf405155p  aDNAL 7aarticle03504naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245010200168300001600270520190500286592002802191650002002219650001902239650001302258650002202271650001002293650001302303650001202316650001102328650001202339650001002351650002202361650001402383650002402397653001502421653001902436653001602455653003002471653001202501653001702513653002402530653001402554653001602568653001302584653002002597700002802617700002502645700001902670700002302689700002402712773011402736856007902850852000902929655001202938IND60519221520221119100419.0160526e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051922152DNAL7 a10.1650/CONDOR-15-109.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSedinger, James S.10aPredation and reduced grazing interact to reduce recruitment and population growth in Black Brant  ap. 433-444.  aDynamics of avian populations may be governed by a complex interaction between immediate effects of predation and longer-term trophic feedbacks between individuals and their foods. We used a long-term study of uniquely marked Black Brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans) to estimate recruitment into the breeding population. We related recruitment to nest success, which directly affects recruitment 2 to 3 years later. We also assessed similarly time-lagged relationships between recruitment and number of nests in the colony, a measure of local density, and pre-fledging and first-year survival, the latter of which is strongly influenced by growth conditions and food availability for young of the year. We assessed relationships between number of recruits and explanatory variables in 2 sets of models, which either included or excluded a linear trend across years in numbers of recruits. The best-performing models in each model set explained a substantial proportion of the variation in numbers of recruits 2 to 3 years later (85 and 78% in the 2 model sets, respectively). First-year survival was an important predictor of number of recruits in both sets of models, whereas nest success was important only in models lacking a trend across years. Number of nests in the colony had a relatively weak negative association with number of recruits. First-year survival reflects a lagged response to earlier nest-predation events. Reduced grazing during predation events can result in loss of grazing lawns and thus reduced growth rates of future cohorts of goslings, which are regulated by food abundance and density of broods. Our finding that recruitment is insufficient to maintain the breeding population results from both direct effect of predation on nests, primarily by Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), and longer-term indirect effects of such predation on first-year survival of Black Brant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBranta bernicla 3aVulpes lagopus 3abreeding 3afood availability 3afoods 3agoslings 3agrazing 3amodels 3anesting 3anests 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3aspecies recruitment 0aArctic fox 0aAlopex lagopus 0aBlack Brant 0aBranta bernicla nigricans 0agrazing 0anest success 0apopulation dynamics 0apredation 0arecruitment 0asurvival 0atrophic cascade1 aNicolai, Christopher A.1 aVanDellen, Amanda W.1 aLeach, Alan G.1 aWilson, Heather M.1 aAnthony, R.

Spray-drying of nisin-low methoxyl pectin or nisin-alginate electrostatic complexes has led to the microencapsulation of the peptide in different networks that were highly influenced by the polysaccharide type. Turbidity and particle size measurements indicated that while spray-drying promoted the aggregation of nisin-pectin complexes, it favored the dissociation of nisin-alginate aggregates to form individual complexes. Structural changes of nisin induced by complexation with pectin or alginate and spray-drying were studied by using UV–Vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that complexation with pectin or alginate preserved nisin structure as well as its antimicrobial activity during spray-drying.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalginates 3aantimicrobial properties 3abiopolymers 3adissociation 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3amicroencapsulation 3anisin 3aparticle size 3apectins 3aspray drying 3aturbidity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 0aNisin 0aPectin 0aAlginate 0aComplexation 0aSpray-drying 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aKim, Lanhee1 aOulahal, Nadia1 aDegraeve, Pascal1 aGharsallaoui, Adem0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Dec. 01, v. 236 p.32-40dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.1683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245005400162300002000216520104200236592002801278650001801306650001001324650001901334650001501353650002201368650001601390650002601406650001501432700001701447700002001464773012401484856007401608852000901682655001201691IND60640438920221120074549.0190504e20160406xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064043892DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra02269c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadam, Shekhar U.10aMass spectrometry based chemical imaging of foods  ap. 33537-33546.  aChemical imaging based on mass spectrometry is an emerging technology which has opened opportunities for fundamental research in food science. The ability to quantitatively determine the spatial distribution of several chemical entities simultaneously makes it a method of choice for chemical characterization of plant materials and foods. In this review, an overview of the ionization methods is presented, followed by a discussion of the current state of the art in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) of relevance to practices in food research. The known applications, analytical challenges, and future research potential are highlighted. MSI has been successfully utilized to a variable degree for obtaining information about spatial distribution of a variety of molecules and metabolites in foods. It allows visualizing the spatial molecular maps without extraction, purification, separation, or labelling of foods. The method is likely to find wider adoption with developments in ionization sources and inter-laboratory collaborations.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood research 3afoods 3aimage analysis 3aionization 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 3aquantitative analysis 3atechnology1 aMisra, N.

Cells make major decisions in response to this mechanosensation, including decisions regarding cell migration, proliferation, survival, and differentiation. The vast majority of these studies have focused on the cellular mechanoresponse to changing substrate stiffness (or elastic modulus) and have been conducted on purely elastic substrates. In contrast, most soft tissues in the human body exhibit viscoelastic behavior; that is, they generate responsive force proportional to both the magnitude and rate of strain. While several recent studies have demonstrated that viscous effects of an underlying substrate affect cellular mechanoresponse, there is not a straightforward experimental method to probe this, particularly for investigators with little background in biomaterial fabrication. In the current work, we demonstrate that polymers comprised of differing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) formulations can be generated that allow for control over both the strain-dependent storage modulus and the strain rate-dependent loss modulus. These substrates requires no background in biomaterial fabrication to fabricate, are shelf-stable, and exhibit repeatable mechanical properties. Here we demonstrate that these substrates are biocompatible and exhibit similar protein adsorption characteristics regardless of mechanical properties. Finally, we develop a set of empirical equations that predicts the storage and loss modulus for a given blend of PDMS formulations, allowing users to tailor substrate mechanical properties to their specific needs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiocompatible materials 3acell movement 3ahumans 3aloss modulus 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3astorage modulus 3aviscoelasticity1 aDeal, Halston E.1 aZhao, Hanhsen S.1 aHe, Amanda Y.1 aTang, Christina1 aLemmon, Christopher A.0 tRSC advances.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 11, no. 57 p.35910-35917dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra03548g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015400154300001600308500002000324520176300344592002802107650003002135650001702165650001102182650001602193650001802209650000902227650001402236650001202250650002302262650001002285650001502295650001702310650001002327700001702337700001602354700001602370700001502386700001602401700001502417700001402432700001302446700001702459773013202476856007302608852000902681655001202690IND60572056720221119053125.0170712e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057205672DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.124532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRen, Z.

A total of 780 duck breeder females and 156 males were randomly allotted to two diets with or without the addition of the mixture of CX and 25‐OH‐D₃ (CX+25‐OH‐D₃) for 32 weeks. Ducklings (males and females separately) hatched from eggs laid at 24 weeks of the duck breeder trial were fed with a NRC vitamin regimen, and ducklings (males and females separately) hatched from eggs laid at 32 weeks of the duck breeder trial were fed with a HIGH vitamin regimen (had higher levels of all vitamins except biotin than NRC vitamin regimen), for 14 days. The results showed that, maternal CX+25‐OH‐D₃ supplementation increased the shank pigmentation for 7‐days post hatch in ducklings under a NRC vitamin regimen, and for 14‐days post hatch in ducklings under a HIGH vitamin regimen. Growth performance, antioxidant status and serum phosphorus of ducklings under a NRC vitamin regimen were increased by maternal CX+25‐OH‐D₃ supplementation; however, these positive effects were not observed in ducklings under a HIGH vitamin regimen. Males revealed increased growth performance in ducklings under both NRC and HIGH vitamin regimens. Sexual differences in shank pigmentation, antioxidant status, tibia strength and serum phosphorus were not consistent as they were dependent on maternal CX+25‐OH‐D₃ status or dietary vitamin regimens. Data suggest that maternal CX+25‐OH‐D₃ supplementation is important for starter ducklings under a NRC vitamin regimen, but not HIGH vitamin regimen.  aPublisher supplied data 3a25-hydroxycholecalciferol 3aantioxidants 3abiotin 3ablood serum 3acanthaxanthin 3adiet 3aducklings 3afemales 3agrowth performance 3amales 3aphosphorus 3apigmentation 3atibia1 aJiang, S.

This implies that as a species declines in abundance so does the number of sites it occupies. Conversely, when there is an increase in a species' range size, it is usually followed by an increase in population size (Gaston et al.). This ecological phenomenon, also known as the abundance–occupancy relationship (AOR), is well documented in several species of animals and plants (Gaston et al.) but has been little investigated in parasites. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Drovetski et al. () investigated the AOR in avian haemosporidians (vector‐borne blood parasites) using data from four well‐sampled bird communities. In support of the AOR, the research group found that the abundance of parasite cytochrome b lineages (a commonly used proxy for species identification within this group of parasites) was positively linked with the abundance of susceptible avian host species and that the most abundant haemospordian lineages were those with larger ranges. Drovetski et al. () also found evidence for both hypotheses proposed to explain the AOR in parasites: the trade‐off hypothesis (TOH) and the niche‐breadth hypothesis (NBH). Interestingly, the main predictor of the AOR was the number of susceptible hosts (i.e. number of infected birds) and not the number of host species the parasites were able to exploit.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogeography 3abirds 3ablood 3acytochrome b 3ahosts 3aparasites 3apopulation growth 3apopulation size 3aspecies identification 2aAnimals 2aBirdsxparasitology 2aEcosystem 2aHaemosporidaxgenetics1 aBensch, Staffan0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 July, v. 23, no. 13 p.3130-3132dBlackwell Scientific Publicationsx0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.128093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02696naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003700152245011000189520130600299592002801605650002301633650002501656650001501681650001401696650001501710650001901725650001901744650001601763650001101779650002001790650001401810650001601824651001101840653001701851653001901868653001301887653002201900700001701922700002901939700003901968700002302007773011202030856008702142852000902229655001202238IND60689805120221121121609.0200516e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068980512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.1041772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez Noyola, Francisco Javier,10aEffect of induced warming on survival and growth of Tillandsia recurvata seedlings: A two-year experiment  aGlobal warming may increase the danger of local extinction for plant species with low tolerance to high temperatures. Tillandsia recurvata is a bromeliad epiphyte native to semiarid ecosystems of America. In North-Central Mexico, Prosopis laevigata (mesquite) is the main phorophyte of T. recurvata. Climate change models indicate that temperature will rise between 1 and 2 °C by the end of 2030, and this could increase vulnerability of T. recurvata populations. This study aims to experimentally determine the effects of warming on the survival and growth of T. recurvata seedlings, introducing a new design of chambers to simulate warming for epiphytes in the field. Warming chambers were built with transparent acrylic sheets and installed on branches of mesquites on December 2016 and T. recurvata seedlings were sowed in and outside of them. Survival was assessed every 14 days until November 2018 and seedling length was measured at the beginning and at the end of the experiment. After two years, seedling survival was 4.16% within the warming chambers and 42.85% outside, leaf length growth was 0.004 mm/day within warming chambers and 0.009 mm/day in controls. In a potential warming scenario, T. recurvata populations could decrease because of low seedling growth and seedling survival.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProsopis laevigata 3aTillandsia recurvata 3aecosystems 3aepiphytes 3aextinction 3aglobal warming 3aheat tolerance 3aleaf length 3amodels 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3atemperature 3aMexico 0aBromeliaceae 0aHeating stress 0aMesquite 0aSeedling survival1 aFlores, Joel1 aYáñez Espinosa, Laura,1 aBautista-Redonda, Francisco Elihú1 aBadano, Ernesto I.0 tJournal of arid environments.g2020 Aug., v. 179 p.104177-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl11719x0140-19637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaridenv.2020.1041773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011800166300002200284520106800306592002801374650001201402650002501414650002201439650001601461650001501477650002001492650001601512650001101528650001501539650001401554650001801568650001501586650002901601653000901630653001701639653003301656653001301689653002801702653002001730653001301750653001401763653002501777700003001802700001901832700001901851700002001870700002401890700002001914700002301934700002101957700002501978700001802003700002302021700005802044700005802102700002202160700006202182700007202244700001702316700002402333700006502357773010302422856004902525852000902574655001202583IND60779749520221119134111.0220614e20220609xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077974952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichart, Laia10aXIST loss impairs mammary stem cell differentiation and increases tumorigenicity through Mediator hyperactivation  ap. 2164-2183.e25.  aX inactivation (XCI) is triggered by upregulation of XIST, which coats the chromosome in cis, promoting formation of a heterochromatic domain (Xi). XIST role beyond initiation of XCI is only beginning to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that XIST loss impairs differentiation of human mammary stem cells (MaSCs) and promotes emergence of highly tumorigenic and metastatic carcinomas. On the Xi, XIST deficiency triggers epigenetic changes and reactivation of genes overlapping Polycomb domains, including Mediator subunit MED14. MED14 overdosage results in increased Mediator levels and hyperactivation of the MaSC enhancer landscape and transcriptional program, making differentiation less favorable. We further demonstrate that loss of XIST and Xi transcriptional instability is common among human breast tumors of poor prognosis. We conclude that XIST is a gatekeeper of human mammary epithelium homeostasis, thus unveiling a paradigm in the control of somatic cell identity with potential consequences for our understanding of gender-specific malignancies.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3acell differentiation 3aenhancer elements 3aepigenetics 3aepithelium 3aheterochromatin 3ahomeostasis 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3aprognosis 3asomatic cells 3astem cells 3atranscription (genetics) 0aXIST 0aX chromosome 0atranscriptional reactivation 0apolycomb 0ahuman mammary stem cell 0adifferentiation 0aMediator 0aenhancers 0abreast tumorigenesis1 aPicod-Chedotel, Mary-Loup1 aWassef, Michel1 aMacario, Manon1 aAflaki, Setareh1 aSalvador, Marion A.1 aHéry, Tiphaine1 aDauphin, Aurélien1 aWicinski, Julien1 aChevrier, Véronique1 aPastor, Sonia1 aGuittard, Geoffrey1 aLe Cam, Samuel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7172-62261 aKamhawi, Hanya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4252-92041 aCastellano, Rémy1 aGuasch, Géraldine1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7362-93181 aCharafe-Jauffret, Emmanuelle1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0286-12991 aHeard, Edith1 aMargueron, Raphael,1 aGinestier, Christophe1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7477-38370 tCell.g2022 June 09, v. 185, no. 12 p.2164-2183.e25dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.04.034  aDNAL 7aarticle03262naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245009600169300001600265500039200281520182300673592002802496650001502524650001102539650001502550650001302565650001702578650001602595650002302611650002202634700002202656700001602678773012102694852000902815856008802824655001202912IND2256338520221120103858.0181002e200009  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225633852DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-200009000-000032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubbin, W.

It is one of the most heavily applied pesticides in the US, with an annual use greater than 12 million kg. When added to soil glyphosate is readily sorbed, losing both its efficacy as an herbicide and its potential for translocation. Despite such tenacious binding to soil colloids, the adsorbent surface offers little protection from biodegradation because the glyphosate decomposes so rapidly, with a half-life as short as several days. Attempts to elucidate the sorption mechanism of glyphosate, thereby providing a mechanistic explanation for this biolability, have thus far been unsuccessful. Therefore, the goal of this research was to derive the architecture of an important model system, the Cu-glyphosate-gibbsite surface complex, in which Cu serves as a probe of the local bonding environment and gibbsite serves as a representative soil mineral adsorbent. Copper K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of Cu-glyphosate complexes in aqueous solution at pH 5.5 revealed Cu complexation by the phosphonate moiety. Introduction of microcrystalline gibbsite resulted in the loss of P from the coordination sphere of Cu and the formation of a ternary complex through chemisorption of the phosphonate group to the oxide surface. The EXAFS spectra of Cu in the Cu-glyphosate-gibbsite surface complex matched spectra for Cu-glycine and Cu-methylglycine complexes in aqueous solution, thereby providing evidence for Cu complexation by the carboxyl O and amine N. Despite the chemisorption of glyphosate to oxide surfaces via the phosphonate group, the distal end of the glyphosate molecule extends into aqueous solution where it may be biodegraded rapidly.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglyphosate 3acopper 3aadsorption 3agibbsite 3aspectroscopy 3aX-radiation 3aherbicide residues 3aspectral analysis1 aSposito, Garrison1 aZavarin, M.0 tSoil science.g2000 Sept., v. 165, no. 9 p.699-707dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-200009000-000033Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02224naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245008200209300001800291520093200309592002801241653000801269653001201277653001301289653002201302653001001324653002101334653001701355653000901372653000901381653000801390653001101398700002101409700002001430700001801450700002801468700001301496700002201509700002301531700002401554773008301578856008401661852000901745655001201754IND60527980620221118010345.0160715e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052798062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.0372doi7 aPMC49266452pmcid7 a269470672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKung, Che-Pei14aThe P72R Polymorphism of p53 Predisposes to Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction  ap. 2413-2425.  ap53 is well known for its tumor suppressor role, but this protein also has a poorly understood role in the regulation of metabolism. Human studies have implicated a common polymorphism at codon 72 of p53 in diabetic and pre-diabetic phenotypes. To understand this role, we utilized a humanized mouse model of the p53 codon 72 variants and monitored these mice following challenge with a high-fat diet (HFD). Mice with the arginine 72 (R72) variant of p53 developed more-severe obesity and glucose intolerance on a HFD, compared to mice with the proline 72 variant (P72). R72 mice developed insulin resistance, islet hypertrophy, increased infiltration of immune cells, and fatty liver disease. Gene expression analyses and studies with small-molecule inhibitors indicate that the p53 target genes Tnf and Npc1l1 underlie this phenotype. These results shed light on the role of p53 in obesity, metabolism, and inflammation.  aPublisher supplied data 0ap53 0aobesity 0adiabetes 0aislet hypertrophy 0aNAFLD 0alipid metabolism 0ainflammation 0aPck1 0aCcl2 0aTnf 0aNpc1l11 aLeu, Julia I-Ju1 aBasu, Subhasree1 aKhaku, Sakina1 aAnokye-Danso, Frederick1 aLiu, Qin1 aGeorge, Donna L.1 aAhima, Rexford S.,1 aMurphy, Maureen E.0 tCell Reports.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 14 p.2413-2425dElsevier Inc.x2211-12477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.0373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02148naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100003000152245009700182300001400279520110600293592002801399650001301427650001901440650001001459650001401469650001201483653001901495653001601514653002501530700002201555700002801577773010901605856008701714852000901801655001201810IND60541498520221119094046.0190318e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054149852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoyner (Melito), Helen S.10aBeyond surface selection: The impact of different methodologies on tribological measurements  ap. 45-58.  aEmerging links between food friction and sensory texture have prompted an increase in food tribology studies. Soft tribological surfaces (e.g. elastomers) are used in these studies to mimic conditions in the oral cavity. However, measurement protocols and tribological surfaces vary among food tribological studies. Because the majority of these studies use empirical measurements, it is difficult to quantitatively compare their results. Although the effects of surface hydrophobicity, roughness, and modulus on friction coefficient measurements have been examined, there has been little study of variability due to differences in measurement parameters. Therefore, this study examined the effect of different measurement parameters on friction coefficient magnitude and variation. Tribological data were affected by multiple measurement parameters. A measurement protocol that yielded repeatable measurements with low variation was proposed based on these results. It is suggested that a standard protocol for food tribological measurements be adopted to enable proper data comparison among studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3ahydrophobicity 3amouth 3aroughness 3atexture 0aSoft tribology 0aMeasurement 0aFriction coefficient1 aPernell, Chris W.1 aDaubert, Christopher R.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2014 Aug., v. 134 p.45-58dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2014.03.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02251naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245013000157300001800287500001900305520115500324592002801479650001501507650001501522650001601537650001301553650001401566650003101580650001901611650003201630650001101662700001701673773012801690856007401818852000901892655001201901IND60716575420221121233356.0201106e20201105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071657542DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ay01481h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Ji Yoon10aSensitive detection of microRNA using QCM biosensors: sandwich hybridization and signal amplification by TiO₂ nanoparticles  ap. 5103-5109.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is known to act as an important biomarker for cancer, in that its up-regulation is closely related to several types of malignant tumor. Sensitive and accurate detection of miR-21 using a biosensor is highly challenging. In this study, sensitive and selective detection technology for miR-21 molecules using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor was developed. Sandwich hybridization between miR-21 and specially designed probes and a subsequent TiO₂ photocatalytic silver enhancement reaction were the driving forces for sensitive detection with high selectivity for miR-21. Using this strategic approach under optimal conditions, the novel QCM biosensor can detect miR-21 with a LOD of 0.87 pM over the entire linear range from 0.1 pM to 10 μM, with a correlation coefficient of 0.988. In addition, the developed QCM biosensor was very effective in the quantification of miR-21 in serum samples, so the proposed miRNA detection method offers great potential for the diagnosis of early disease, such as cancer and vascular diseases, and could be an excellent alternative for biological research and clinical diagnosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomarkers 3abiosensors 3ablood serum 3amicroRNA 3aneoplasms 3anucleic acid hybridization 3aphotocatalysis 3aquartz crystal microbalance 3asilver1 aLee, Soo Suk0 tAnalytical methods.g2020 Nov. 5, v. 12, no. 42 p.5103-5109dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ay01481h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245011000172300001800282520104500300592002801345653001001373653000801383653000801391653000801399653001401407653001301421700002601434700002401460700003001484700002201514773008301536856008401619852000901703655001201712IND60527980820221118010349.0160715e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052798082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrabow, Stephanie10aLoss of a Single Mcl-1 Allele Inhibits MYC-Driven Lymphomagenesis by Sensitizing Pro-B Cells to Apoptosis  ap. 2337-2347.  aMCL-1 is critical for progenitor cell survival during emergency hematopoiesis, but its role in sustaining cells undergoing transformation and in lymphomagenesis is only poorly understood. We investigated the importance of MCL-1 in the survival of B lymphoid progenitors undergoing MYC-driven transformation and its functional interactions with pro-apoptotic BIM and PUMA and the tumor suppressor p53 in lymphoma development. Loss of one Mcl-1 allele almost abrogated MYC-driven-lymphoma development owing to a reduction in lymphoma initiating pre-B cells. Although loss of the p53 target PUMA had minor impact, loss of one p53 allele substantially accelerated lymphoma development when MCL-1 was limiting, most likely because p53 loss also causes defects in non-apoptotic tumor suppressive processes. Remarkably, loss of BIM restored the survival of lymphoma initiating cells and rate of tumor development. Thus, MCL-1 has a major role in lymphoma initiating pro-B cells to oppose BIM, which is upregulated in response to oncogenic stress.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMCL-1 0aMYC 0ap53 0aBIM 0aapoptosis 0alymphoma1 aDelbridge, Alex R.D.1 aAubrey, Brandon J.1 aVandenberg, Cassandra J.1 aStrasser, Andreas0 tCell Reports.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 14 p.2337-2347dElsevier Inc.x2211-12477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.0393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02623naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011900166300001600285520141300301592002801714650002101742650002101763650001201784650001101796650001701807650001201824650001401836653002101850653001701871653003201888653001201920653004501932700001301977700001601990700002002006700001302026773008102039856008402120852000902204655001202213IND60545161720221116162949.0160901e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054516172DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.02.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Haisong14aThe influence of multivalent cations on the flocculation of activated sludge with different sludge retention times  ap. 225-232.  aThe mechanism governing the flocculation of activated sludge (AS) with different sludge retention times (SRTs) was studied in this paper. AS samples were cultivated in 8 lab-scale reactors with SRTs of 5 d, 7.5 d, 10 d, 12.5 d, 15 d, 20 d, 30 d, and 40 d. The bulk solution, loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS), tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS), and pellet were extracted for all 8 AS samples. There was a clear trend that the effluent turbidity decreased as the SRT increased, and we deduced that this is because AS samples with longer SRTs have lower interaction energy barriers and lower LB-EPS content. Furthermore, the concentrations of multivalent cations (especially trivalent cations) in the pellets were found to be closely correlated to the AS flocculability, total interaction energy (Wtot), and LB-EPS content. The multivalent (especially trivalent) cations possess greater binding ability, and this ability to bind tightly to AS in large quantities is responsible for the superior flocculability of AS samples with longer SRTs. Hence, the concentrations of multivalent cations in the pellets are an important indicator of AS flocculability. We deduced that variations in the quantities of multivalent cations that tightly bind with the AS rather than remaining in the influent are the core reason behind observed fluctuations in the AS flocculability with different SRTs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3abinding capacity 3acations 3aenergy 3aflocculation 3apellets 3aturbidity 0aActivated sludge 0aFlocculation 0aSludge retention time (SRT) 0aCations 0aExtracellular polymeric substances (EPS)1 aWen, Yue1 aCao, Asheng1 aHuang, Jingshui1 aZhou, Qi0 tWater research.g2014 May 15, v. 55 p.225-232dElsevier Ltdx0043-13547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2014.02.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01740naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245013200168300001800300520069900318592002801017650001601045650002301061650002901084650002301113650001301136650001201149700001701161700001701178700001901195773010601214856008501320852000901405655001201414IND60585127620221117071519.0171103e20171103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058512762DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b027532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWen, Zhen-Kang10aAcid Promoted Direct Cross-Coupling of Methyl Ketones with Dimethyl Sulfoxide: Access to Ketoallyl Methylsulfides and -sulfones  ap. 5798-5801.  aA new strategy to prepare β-acyl allylic methylsulfides and -sulfones through acid promoted direct cross-coupling of methyl ketones with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is reported. The reaction proceeded through the nucleophilic attack of enamine intermidiates derived from ketones to in situ generated thionium ion species, followed by elimination of methanthiol to give ketoallylic methylsulfides. With the prolonged reaction time, such products could be further reacted with a methyl sulfonyl radical, which might be generated from a methylthiosulfonate species, to afford ketoallylic methylsulfones in high yields.

Increased spread of infectious disease is often cited as a potential negative effect of habitat corridors used in conservation, but the impacts of corridors on pathogen movement have never been tested empirically. Using sweet corn (Zea mays) and southern corn leaf blight (Cochliobolus heterostrophus) as a model plant–pathogen system, we tested the impacts of connectivity and habitat fragmentation on pathogen movement and disease development at the Savannah River Site, South Carolina, USA. Over time, less edgy patches had higher proportions of diseased plants, and distance of host plants to habitat edges was the greatest determinant of disease development. Variation in average daytime temperatures provided a possible mechanism for these disease patterns. Our results show that worries over the potentially harmful effects of conservation corridors on disease dynamics are misplaced, and that, in a conservation context, many diseases can be better managed by mitigating edge effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBipolaris maydis 3aZea mays 3aadverse effects 3acorn 3aedge effects 3afungi 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ainfectious diseases 3aleaf blight 3aplant pathogens 3asweetcorn 3atemperature 3aSavannah River 3aSouth Carolina1 aHaddad, Nick M.0 tEcology.g2011 Aug., v. 92, no. 8 p.1551-1558dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1072.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012500171300001800296520097900314592002801293653001101321653001601332653000801348653000901356653001701365653001601382653002701398700002501425773008301450856008401533852000901617655001201626IND60527981020221118010412.0160715e20160315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052798102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCairo, Lucas V.14aThe Nuclear Transport Factor Kap121 Is Required for Stability of the Dam1 Complex and Mitotic Kinetochore Bi-orientation  ap. 2440-2450.  aThe karyopherin (Kap) family of nuclear transport factors facilitates macromolecular transport through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The binding of Kaps to their cargos can also regulate, both temporally and spatially, the interactions of the cargo protein with interacting partners. Here, we show that the essential yeast Kap, Kap121, binds Dam1 and Duo1, components of the microtubule (MT)-associated Dam1 complex required for linking dynamic MT ends with kinetochores (KTs). Like mutations in the Dam1 complex, loss of Kap121 function compromises the formation of normal KT-MT attachments during mitosis. We show that the stability of the Dam1 complex in vivo is dependent on its association with Kap121. Furthermore, we show that the Kap121/Duo1 complex is maintained in the presence of RanGTP but Kap121 is released by the cooperative actions of RanGTP and tubulin. We propose that Kap121 stabilizes the Dam1 complex and participates in escorting it to spindle MTs.  aPublisher supplied data 0aKap121 0akaryopherin 0aRan 0aDuo1 0aDam1 complex 0akinetochore 0achromosome segregation1 aWozniak, Richard W.0 tCell Reports.g2016 Mar. 15, v. 14 p.2440-2450dElsevier Inc.x2211-12477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2016.02.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010000171500002200271520097000293592002801263650002701291650000901318650001501327650002401342650002001366650002101386650001901407650001901426650002001445653002701465653002901492653001401521653002801535653002701563700002501590700002001615700002101635700001801656773009801674856008701772852000901859655001201868IND60656103120221120131337.0190809e20190805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065610312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1096892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMondal, Sourav10aPermeate flux hysteresis with transmembrane pressure in the gel controlling membrane filtration  aPre-press version  aThe formation of the gel layer occurs during the clarification of any plant extract in membrane filtration processes. This study was aimed at investigate the impact of the increasing and decreasing transmembrane pressure cycle on the permeate flux of ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF) membranes when a clarified extract of olive mill solid wastes (OMSWs) is used as feed mixture. A hysteresis effect was observed for the selected membranes with molecular weight cut-off in the range 150–3500 Da. This phenomenon was studied by using a combination of the classical filtration theories in the context of two component filtration. Further, the mathematical theory was categorised depending on the cut-off of the membrane, having separate physical scenarios. The proposed model can track both the flux and the permeate concentration profile within a reasonable accuracy, explaining the underlying physics of gel formation as well as the system behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood processing wastes 3agels 3ahysteresis 3amathematical theory 3amicrofiltration 3amolecular weight 3ananofiltration 3aplant extracts 3aultrafiltration 0aTransmembrane pressure 0aPermeate flux hysteresis 0aGel layer 0aOlive mill solid wastes 0aRadial cross flow cell1 aEgea-Corbacho, Agata1 aConidi, Carmela1 aCassano, Alfredo1 aDe, Sirshendu0 tJournal of food engineering.g2019 Aug. 05, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl34294x0260-87747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2019.1096893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006400171300001600235500030900251520149500560592002802055650002102083650001102104650001302115650001802128650002002146650000902166650001502175650001202190700001802202773012102220852000902341856008902350655001202439IND2256349220221121232540.0181002e200010  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND225634922DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-200010000-000042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Qiaoyun10aInhibition of free and immobilized acid phosphatase by zinc  ap. 793-802.  aAffiliations: 1Dept. of Resource, Environment and Agrochemistry, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070 China.

Both free and immobilized enzymes were inhibited significantly in the presence of 0.1 to 4 mM Zn (as ZnCl2), and the inhibition increased with an increase of pH from 5.0 to 6.0. The enzymes immobilized on the Latosol clay and kaolin mineral were as sensitive as free (i.e. soluble) enzymes to Zn toxicity. The inhibitory effect of Zn was reduced when acid phosphatase was immobilized on goethite. Various inhibition patterns by Zn were observed for free and immobilized acid phosphatase at different pH values. Zinc showed uncompetitive inhibition for the goethite-enzyme complex at pH 5.0, 5.5 and 6.0. The inhibition of free enzyme and Latosol clay-enzyme complex by Zn changed from an uncompetitive type at pH 5.0 and 5.5 to a mixed type at pH 6.0. However, the inhibition model of the kaolin-enzyme complex was mixed type at the three pH levels. Variation of inhibition model seems to be related to the degree of deactivation of the enzyme by the Zn. Zinc addition also increased the affinity of free and immobilized enzymes for the substrate (i.e. reduced Km values). The high affinity of goethite-enzyme complex for the substrate induced a substrate inhibition at pH 5.0, which was enhanced by the presence of Zn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid phosphatase 3akaolin 3agoethite 3aclay fraction 3aenzyme activity 3azinc 3ametal ions 3asoil pH1 aShindo, Haruo0 tSoil science.g2000 Oct., v. 165, no. 10 p.793-802dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-200010000-000043Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02990naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002000191245005900211300001300270506007600283520140000359592002801759506003701787650002101824650001501845650001301860650001701873650002401890650001001914650001301924650001301937650001601950650001401966650002101980650003702001650001402038653003102052653002402083653001702107653000802124653000802132653001002140653001402150700002402164700002402188700002502212773011802237856008402355852000902439655001202448IND60122884320221207103433.0150325e20150130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012288432DNAL7 a10.1080/07924259.2014.9255162doi7 aPMC43104712pmcid7 a256420192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnell, Terry W.10aRotifers as experimental tools for investigating aging  ap. 5-10.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aComparative biogerontology has much to contribute to the study of aging. A broad range of aging rates have evolved to meet environmental challenges, and understanding these adaptations can produce valuable insights into aging. The supra Phylum Lophotrochozoa is particularly understudied and has several groups that have intriguing patterns of aging. Members of the Lophotrochozoan phylum Rotifera are particularly useful for aging studies because cohort life tables can be conducted with them easily, and biochemical and genomic tools are available for examining aging mechanisms. This paper reviews a variety of caloric restriction (CR) regimens, small molecule inhibitors, and dietary supplements that extend rotifer lifespan, as well as important interactions between CR and genotype, antioxidant supplements, and TOR and jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways, and the use of RNAi to identify key genes involved in modulating the aging response. Examples of how rapamycin and JNK inhibitor exposure keeps mortality rates low during the reproductive phase of the life cycle are presented, and the ease of conducting life table experiments to screen natural products from red algae for life extending effects is illustrated. Finally, experimental evolution to produce longer-lived rotifer individuals is demonstrated, and future directions to determine the genetic basis of aging are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA interference 3aRhodophyta 3aRotifera 3aantioxidants 3adietary supplements 3agenes 3agenomics 3agenotype 3alife tables 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amortality 0acomparative biogerontology 0acaloric restriction 0aantioxidants 0aTOR 0aJNK 0aaging 0aevolution1 aJohnston, Rachel K.1 aGribble, Kristin E.1 aMark Welch, David B.0 tInvertebrate reproduction & development.g2015 Jan. 30, v. 59, no. sup1 p.5-10dTaylor & Francisx2157-02727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07924259.2014.9255163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010300158520173400261592002801995650001902023650002002042650002002062650001502082650002102097650001502118650001002133650001502143651001802158700002402176700002102200700002602221773012002247856007402367852000902441655001202450IND60756208220221118024059.0211111e20211104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075620822DNAL7 a10.3390/w132131122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTroin, Magali 10aCatchment Scale Evaluation of Multiple Global Hydrological Models from ISIMIP2a over North America  aA satisfactory performance of hydrological models under historical climate conditions is considered a prerequisite step in any hydrological climate change impact study. Despite the significant interest in global hydrological modeling, few systematic evaluations of global hydrological models (gHMs) at the catchment scale have been carried out. This study investigates the performance of 4 gHMs driven by 4 global observation-based meteorological inputs at simulating weekly discharges over 198 large-sized North American catchments for the 1971–2010 period. The 16 discharge simulations serve as the basis for evaluating gHM accuracy at the catchment scale within the second phase of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP2a). The simulated discharges by the four gHMs are compared against observed and simulated weekly discharge values by two regional hydrological models (rHMs) driven by a global meteorological dataset for the same period. We discuss the implications of both modeling approaches as well as the influence of catchment characteristics and global meteorological forcing in terms of model performance through statistical criteria and visual hydrograph comparison for catchment-scale hydrological studies. Overall, the gHM discharge statistics exhibit poor agreement with observations at the catchment scale and manifest considerable bias and errors in seasonal flow simulations. We confirm that the gHM approach, as experimentally implemented through the ISIMIP2a, must be used with caution for regional studies. We find the rHM approach to be more trustworthy and recommend using it for hydrological studies, especially if findings are intended to support operational decision-making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3adecision making 3ahydrograph 3amodel validation 3astatistics 3awater 3awatersheds 3aNorth America1 aArsenault, Richard 1 aFournier, Elyse 1 aBrissette, François 0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 04, v. 13, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132131123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02098naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011800154520101000272592002801282650001601310650002201326650002901348650000901377650001001386650001601396650001201412650001601424700001901440700001901459700001601478700001301494700001901507773012601526856007501652852000901727655001201736IND60791018720221120204345.0220826e20220818xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079101872DNAL7 a10.3390/md200805292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qi 10aAromatic Polyketides from the Deep-Sea Cold-Seep Mussel Associated Endozoic Fungus Talaromyces minioluteus CS-138  aFive new aromatic polyketides, including a unique benzofuran derivative, talarominine A (1), and four chromone analogs talamins A–D (2–5), along with one known related metabolite, 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2,3-dimethylchromone (6), were isolated and identified from the Talaromyces minioluteus CS-138, an endozoic fungus obtained from the deep-sea cold seep mussel Gigantidas platifrons.

Sea urchins grow indeterminately, regenerate damaged appendages, and reproduce throughout their lifespan. Some species show no increase in mortality rate at advanced ages. Nevertheless, different species of sea urchins have very different reported lifespans ranging from 4 to more than 100 years, thus providing a unique model to investigate the molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms underlying both lifespan determination and negligible senescence. Studies to date have demonstrated maintenance of telomeres, maintenance of antioxidant and proteasome enzyme activities, and little accumulation of oxidative cellular damage with age in tissues of sea urchin species with different lifespans. Gene expression studies indicate that key cellular pathways involved in energy metabolism, protein homeostasis, and tissue regeneration are maintained with age. Taken together, these studies suggest that long-term maintenance of mechanisms that sustain tissue homeostasis and regenerative capacity is essential for indeterminate growth and negligible senescence, and a better understanding of these processes may suggest effective strategies to mitigate the degenerative decline in human tissues with age.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEchinoidea 3aantioxidants 3aappendages 3aenergy metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3ahomeostasis 3aindeterminate growth 3alife history 3alongevity 3amodels 3amortality 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3atelomeres 3atissue repair 0aechinoderm 0aaging 0atelomeres 0aoxidative stress 0atissue homeostasis 0aregeneration0 tInvertebrate reproduction & development.g2015 Jan. 30, v. 59, no. sup1 p.23-27dTaylor & Francisx2157-02727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07924259.2014.9381953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02793naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245013100206300001600337506007600353520118900429592002801618506003701646650001501683650002801698650001201726650002001738650001801758650001401776650001301790653001501803653002801818653002801846653003301874653003701907653000801944653000901952653000901961653000801970653000801978653001001986700001901996700001802015700001802033700002502051773009702076856008102173852000902254655001202263IND60551162120221207063927.0161017e20150130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055116212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2014.11.0112doi7 aPMC42975762pmcid7 a254634402pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yongqi14aThe Activity and Stability of the Intrinsically Disordered Cip/Kip Protein Family AreRegulated by Non-Receptor TyrosineKinases  ap. 371-386.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Cip/Kip family of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitors includes p21Cip1, p27Kip1 and p57Kip2. Their kinase inhibitory activities are mediated by a homologous N-terminal kinaseinhibitory domain. The Cdk inhibitory activity and stability of p27 have been shown to be regulated by a two-step phosphorylation mechanism involving a tyrosine residue within the kinase inhibitory domain and a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus. We show that these residues are conserved in p21 and p57, suggesting that a similar phosphorylation cascade regulates these Cdk inhibitors. However, the presence of a cyclin binding motif within its C-terminus alters the regulatory interplay between p21 and Cdk2/cyclin A, as well as its responses to tyrosine phosphorylation and altered p21:Cdk2/cyclin A stoichiometry. We also show that the Cip/Kip proteins can be phosphorylated in vitro by representatives of many non-receptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) sub-families, suggesting that NRTKs may generally regulate the activity and stability of these Cdk inhibitors. Our results further suggest that the Cip/Kip proteins integrate signals from various NRTK pathways and cell cycle regulation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3aphosphorylation 3astoichiometry 3athreonine 3atyrosine 0acell cycle 0aprotein phosphorylation 0acyclin-dependent kinase 0anon-receptor tyrosine kinase 0aintrinsically disordered protein 0aCdk 0aPCNA 0aNRTK 0aKID 0aCTD 0aTROSY1 aYoon, Mi-Kyung1 aOtieno, Steve1 aLelli, Moreno1 aKriwacki, Richard W.0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2015 Jan. 30, v. 427 p.371-386dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.11.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245012300169300001400292520223200306592002802538650001202566650001502578650001602593650002202609650001302631650002102644650001302665650001102678650001302689650001102702650002502713650001602738650002302754650000902777650001402786650001102800650000702811650000902818650001302827650001902840650001302859650001102872650001802883650000902901651001402910653001802924653001902942653002402961653002402985653003003009653002003039700002303059700002203082700001703104700003103121700002303152773007903175856008403254852000903338655001203347IND60545162220221116163021.0160901e20140515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054516222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2014.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiermann, Vera10aApplicability of passive compost bioreactors for treatment of extremely acidic and saline waters in semi-arid climates  ap. 83-94.  aExtremely acidic and saline groundwater occurs naturally in south-western Australia. Discharge of this water to surface waters has increased following extensive clearing of native vegetation for agriculture and is likely to have negative environmental impacts. The use of passive treatment systems to manage the acidic discharge and its impacts is complicated by the region's semi-arid climate with hot dry summers and resulting periods of no flow. This study evaluates the performance of a pilot-scale compost bioreactor treating extremely acidic and saline drainage under semi-arid climatic conditions over a period of 2.5 years. The bioreactor's substrate consisted of municipal waste organics (MWO) mixed with 10 wt% recycled limestone. After the start-up phase the compost bioreactor raised the pH from ≤3.7 to ≥7 and produced net alkaline outflow for 126 days. The bioreactor removed up to 28 g/m2/d CaCO3 equivalent of acidity and acidity removal was found to be load dependent during the first and third year. Extended drying over summer combined with high salinity caused the formation of a salt-clay surface layer on top of the substrate, which was both beneficial and detrimental for bioreactor performance. The surface layer prevented the dehydration of the substrate and ensured it remained waterlogged when the water level in the bioreactor fell below the substrate surface in summer. However, when flow resumed the salt-clay layer acted as a barrier between the water and substrate decreasing performance efficiency. Performance increased again when the surface layer was broken up indicating that the negative climatic impacts can be managed. Based on substrate analysis after 1.5 years of operation, limestone dissolution was found to be the dominant acidity removal process contributing up to 78–91% of alkalinity generation, while bacterial sulfate reduction produced at least 9–22% of the total alkalinity. The substrate might last up to five years before the limestone is exhausted and would need to be replenished. The MWO substrate was found to release metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Ni and Cr) and cannot be recommended for use in passive treatment systems unless the risk of metal release is addressed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3abioreactors 3acalcium carbonate 3achromium 3aclimatic factors 3acomposts 3acopper 3adrainage 3adrying 3aenvironmental impact 3agroundwater 3aindigenous species 3alead 3alimestone 3anickel 3apH 3arisk 3asalinity 3asemiarid zones 3asulfates 3asummer 3asurface water 3azinc 3aAustralia 0aAcid drainage 0aBioremediation 0aConstructed wetland 0aSemi-arid landscape 0aSulfate reducing bacteria 0aWater treatment1 aLillicrap, Adam M.1 aMagaña, Claudia,1 aPrice, Barry1 aBell, R.

Since Conus toxins were discovered in the 1960s, their biological activity has been thought to have high pharmaceutical potential that could be explored beyond the limits of academic laboratories. We reviewed 224 patent documents related to conotoxins and conopeptides globally to determine the course that innovation and development has taken over the years, their primary applications, the technological trends over the last six years, and the leaders in the field, since the only previous patent review was performed in 2015 and focused in USA valid patents. In addition, we explored which countries/territories protect their inventions and patents and the most relevant collaborations among assignees. We also evaluated whether academia or pharmaceutical companies are the future of conotoxin research. We concluded that the 224 conotoxin patents reviewed in this study have more academic value than industrial value, which was noted by the number of active patents that have not yet been licensed and the contributions to medical research, especially as tools to study neuropathic pain, inflammation, immunology, drug design, receptor binding sites, cancer, neurotransmission, epilepsy, peptide biosynthesis, and depression. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of conotoxin patents, their main applications, and success based on the number of licensing and products in the market.  aPublisher supplied data 3aConus 3abioactive properties 3abiomedical research 3abiosynthesis 3aconotoxins 3adrug design 3aepilepsy 3aimmunology 3aindustry 3ainflammation 3amarkets 3apain 3apeptides 3asynaptic transmission1 aBernaldez-Sarabia, Johanna 1 aLicea-Navarro, Alexei F.0 tMarine drugs.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 20, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21403x1660-33977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/md200805313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01685naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012000165300001800285520059000303592002800893650001100921650001400932650002300946650002300969650002300992650001101015700001801026700001501044700001401059700001901073700001401092700001701106773010601123856008501229852000901314655001201323IND60585128220221117062927.0171103e20171103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058512822DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b027722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qian10aAsymmetric Formal [3 + 2]-Cycloaddition of Azomethine Imines with Azlactones To Synthesize Bicyclic Pyrazolidinones  ap. 5826-5829.  aAn efficient enantioselective formal [3 + 2]-cycloaddition of azomethine imines with azlactones has been realized by using a chiral bifunctional bisguanidinium hemisalt as the catalyst.

Meaningful comparative studies are hampered by the fact that morphological structures of adults typically used for assessing relationships within Tenebrionidae cannot be used successfully in this group because they are either absent or extremely reduced. The pupal stage of twelve species in eight genera of Phrenapatinae is presented here. A description (or redescription) is given for each species. An identification key to the known Phrenapatinae pupae of the world is included. The usefulness of pupal characters to test generic and tribal limits within the subfamily is assessed. Preliminary results based on an assessment of pupal structures indicate that the current tribal classification needs to be reassessed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTenebrionidae 3aadults 3acomparative study 3apupae 3aredescriptions 3ataxonomic keys 0aBeetle 0aArchaeoglenini 0aPenetini 0aPhrenapatini 0aimmature stage 0apupa 0aidentification key0 tAnnales zoologici.g2019 Mar. 31, v. 69, no. 1 p.173-189dMuseum and Institute of Zoology, Polish Academy of ScienceswJournal:19709x0003-45417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3161/00034541ANZ2019.69.1.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012600158520111200284592002801396650001301424650001901437650002101456650001201477650001201489650001301501650000701514650002901521650001401550650001101564650001001575651002101585700001901606700002001625700002201645700001801667700002101685700002001706773012001726856007401846852000901920655001201929IND60756208620221118024127.0211111e20211104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075620862DNAL7 a10.3390/w132131162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, Seo Yeol10aEffects of Hypoxia on the Distribution of Calanoid Copepod Eggs in the Seabed Sediments of the Eutrophic Masan Bay, Korea  aIn this study, we investigate the distribution of calanoid copepod eggs in the sediments of Masan Bay (South Sea, Korea), in which hypoxic conditions occur every summer. In August (2011), hypoxia was observed at all stations, while normoxia was observed in April (2012). The pH and hydrogen sulphide concentration at the sediment-water interface in the inner bay during August were 7.7 and >20 mol L⁻¹, respectively, and there was no significant difference between the stations in April. The abundance of eggs in the sediment ranged from 0.69 to 1.49 × 10⁶ eggs m⁻² in August, and from 0.59 to 1.08 × 10⁶ eggs m⁻² in April. Notably, the proportion of abnormal eggs was high (a maximum of 77.1%) in August, and a uniform distribution of normal eggs (>80%) was observed in April. A generation of abnormal eggs hatched with deformed nauplii in Masan Bay during the summer, and a failure to hatch was likely due to the high H₂S concentration and low pH caused by hypoxia. In this paper, we discuss the effects of hypoxia and seabed environments on the hatching success of calanoid copepod eggs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCopepoda 3aeutrophication 3ahydrogen sulfide 3ahypoxia 3anauplii 3anormoxia 3apH 3asediment-water interface 3asediments 3asummer 3awater 3aKorean Peninsula1 aHyun, Bonggil 1 aJang, Pung-Guk 1 aShin, Kyoungsoon 1 aSoh, Ho Young1 aKang, Jung-Hoon 1 aJang, Min-Chul 0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 04, v. 13, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132131163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02815naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245011100215300001400326506007600340520134500416592002801761506003701789650002501826650001401851650001401865650001101879650001301890650001101903650001401914650001201928650001101940650002401951650001501975653001501990653001602005653001002021653002502031653001702056653002402073700002402097773011902121856008402240852000902324655001202333IND60122884920221207124926.0150325e20150130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012288492DNAL7 a10.1080/07924259.2014.9446732doi7 aPMC44640962pmcid7 a261366182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoskoboynik, Ayelet10aBotryllus schlosseri, an emerging model for the study of aging, stem cells, and mechanisms of regeneration  ap. 33-38.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe decline of tissue regenerative potential with the loss of stem cell function is a hallmark of mammalian aging. We study Botryllus schlosseri, a colonial chordate which exhibits robust stem cell-mediated regeneration capacities throughout life. Larvae, derived by sexual reproduction and chordate development, metamorphose to clonal founders that undergo weekly formation of new individuals by budding from stem cells. Individuals are transient structures which die through massive apoptosis, and successive buds mature to replicate an entire new body. As a result, their stem cells, which are the only self-renewing cells in a tissue, are the only cells which remain through the entire life of the genotype and retain the effects of time. During aging, a significant decrease in the colonies’ regenerative potential is observed and both sexual and asexual reproductions will eventually halt. When a parent colony is experimentally separated into a number of clonal replicates, they frequently undergo senescence simultaneously, suggesting a heritable factor that determines lifespan in these colonies. The availability of the recently published B. schlosseri genome coupled with its unique life cycle features promotes the use of this model organism for the study of the evolution of aging, stem cells, and mechanisms of regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBotryllus schlosseri 3aapoptosis 3aevolution 3agenome 3agenotype 3alarvae 3alongevity 3amammals 3amodels 3asexual reproduction 3astem cells 0astem cells 0aurochordate 0aaging 0aBotryllus schlosseri 0aregeneration 0aasexual development1 aWeissman, Irving L.0 tInvertebrate reproduction & development.g2015 Jan. 30, v. 59, no. sup1 p.33-38dTaylor & Francisx2157-02727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07924259.2014.9446733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03024naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245007600172300001600248520185000264592002802114650001502142650001502157650001902172650002902191650001002220650002002230650002902250650001202279650001702291650001402308650002102322650001102343653002502354653001502379653001402394700001902408773009702427856008102524852000902605655001202614IND60551162420221116171906.0161017e20150213xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055116242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2014.11.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemaître, Charlène10aDSB (Im)mobility and DNA Repair Compartmentalization in Mammalian Cells  ap. 652-658.  aChromosomal translocations are considered as causal in approximately 20% of cancers. Therefore, understanding their mechanisms of formation is crucial in the prevention of carcinogenesis. The first step of translocation formation is the concomitant occurrence of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) in two different chromosomes. DSBs can be repaired by different repair mechanisms, including error-free homologous recombination (HR), potentially error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and the highly mutagenic alternative end joining (alt-EJ) pathways. Regulation of DNA repair pathway choice is crucial to avoid genomic instability. In yeast, DSBs are mobile and can scan the entire nucleus to be repaired in specialized DNA repair centers or if they are persistent, in order to associate with the nuclear pores or the nuclear envelope where they can be repaired by specialized repair pathways. DSB mobility is limited in mammals; therefore, raising the question of whether the position at which a DSB occurs influences its repair. Here, we review the recent literature addressing this question. We first present the reports describing the extent of DSB mobility in mammalian cells. In a second part, we discuss the consequences of non-random gene positioning on chromosomal translocations formation. In the third part, we discuss the mobility of heterochromatic DSBs in light of our recent data on DSB repair at the nuclear lamina, and finally, we show that DSB repair compartmentalization at the nuclear periphery is conserved from yeast to mammals, further pointing to a role for gene positioning in the outcome of DSB repair. When regarded as a whole, the different studies reviewed here demonstrate the importance of nuclear architecture on DSB repair and reveal gene positioning as an important parameter in the study of tumorigenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3acarcinogenesis 3achromosome translocation 3agenes 3aheterochromatin 3ahomologous recombination 3amammals 3amutagenicity 3aneoplasms 3anuclear membrane 3ayeasts 0anuclear organization 0aDNA damage 0achromatin1 aSoutoglou, Evi0 tJournal of Molecular Biology.g2015 Feb. 13, v. 427 p.652-658dElsevier Ltdx0022-28367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2014.11.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03107naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012400161300001800285500002000303520184100323592002802164650001202192650001302204650001502217650001502232650002102247650001002268650001102278650002602289650001302315650001502328650001202343650002002355650002302375650001402398651001302412651001102425700002002436700002402456773009902480856007302579852000902652655001202661IND60523616120221122092923.0160623e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052361612DNAL7 a10.1890/10-1994.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTempleton, Alan R14aThe transition from isolated patches to a metapopulation in the eastern collared lizard in response to prescribed fires  ap. 1736-1747.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHabitat fragmentation often arises from human‐induced alterations to the matrix that reduce or eliminate dispersal between habitat patches. Elimination of dispersal increases local extinction and decreases recolonization. These phenomena were observed in the eastern collared lizard (Crotaphytus collaris collaris), which lives in the mid‐continental highland region of the Ozarks (Missouri, USA) on glades: habitats of exposed bedrock that form desert‐like habitats imbedded in a woodland matrix. With the onset of woodland fire suppression, glade habitats degenerated and the woodland matrix was altered to create a strong barrier to dispersal. By 1980, lizard populations in the Ozarks were rapidly going extinct. In response to this decline, some glades were restored by clearing and burning. Starting in 1984, collared lizard populations were translocated onto these restored habitats. The translocated populations persisted but did not colonize nearby glades or disperse among one another. In 1994 prescribed woodland fires were initiated, which unleashed much dispersal and colonizing behavior. Dispersal was highly nonrandom by both intrinsic variables (age, gender) and extrinsic variables (overall demography, glade population sizes, glade areas, landscape features), resulting in different classes of lizards being dominant in creating demographic cohesiveness among glades, colonizing new glades on a mountain, and colonizing new mountain systems. A dramatic transition was documented from isolated fragments, to a nonequilibrium colonizing metapopulation, and finally to a stable metapopulation. This transition is characterized by the convergence of rates of extinction and recolonization and a major alteration of dispersal probabilities and pattern in going from the nonequilibrium to stable metapopulation states.  aPublisher supplied data 3abedrock 3acohesion 3ademography 3aextinction 3afire suppression 3afires 3agender 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alizards 3apopulation size 3aprescribed burning 3awoodlands 3aMissouri 3aOzarks1 aBrazeal, Hilary1 aNeuwald, Jennifer L0 tEcology.g2011 Sept., v. 92, no. 9 p.1736-1747dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-1994.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03443naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245016500164300001800329520197000347592002802317650001102345650002802356650001502384650001602399650001002415650001302425650001402438650002402452650002302476650002302499653001102522653002302533653002802556653002402584653002402608700001802632700002002650700001802670700001802688700001802706700001602724700001702740773011202757856008302869852000902952655001202961IND60656103920221120131326.0200601e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065610392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnu.2019.07.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, Inwon10aAssessment of body water distribution in patients with sepsis during fluid resuscitation using multi-frequency direct segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis  ap. 1826-1831.  aAlthough initial fluid resuscitation in sepsis is critical for the treatment of tissue hypoperfusion, little evidence supports the distribution of infused fluid in patients with sepsis. This study was designed to assess the body water distribution in patients with sepsis using bioelectrical impedance analysis and correlate the trend in body water distribution during fluid treatment with the prognosis of patients with sepsis.A prospective study in a single emergency department was performed, and adult patients suspected of having sepsis were enrolled. Multi-frequency direct segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (InBody S10, InBody) measuring total body water (TBW), intracellular water (ICW), and extracellular water (ECW) was applied to patients with sepsis at three periods: before, immediately after, and 1 hour after the fluid treatment. Survival data at 28 days after the fluid treatment were obtained.Forty-two patients were enrolled in this study. Overall, the ratios of TBW, ICW, and ECW to body weight increased throughout the fluid treatment except the ratio of ICW to body weight at 1 hour in non-survivors. While the ratio of ECW to TBW (ECW/TBW) and the ratio of ICW to TBW (ICW/TBW) in survivors remained stable over the period, the trend of ECW/TBW increased with corresponding decline of ICW/TBW in non-survivors (p = 0.0085 and p = 0.0034 between times and groups, respectively) such that ECW/TBW and ICW/TBW were significantly different at 1 hour after the fluid loading period (p = 0.0120 and p = 0.0085, respectively). This contrast pattern was equivalent with the trend of ECW/TBW in trunk but not that of the other extremities.During fluid resuscitation, the trend in ECW/TBW significantly increased with corresponding decrease of ICW/TBW in non-survivors compared with that in survivors, which suggests fluid resuscitation results intracellular dehydration and extracellular edema in non-survivors of patients with sepsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody water 3abody weight 3aedema 3apatients 3aprognosis 3aprospective studies 3asepsis (infection) 3awater distribution 0aSepsis 0aElectric impedance 0aBody fluid compartments 0aExtracellular fluid 0aIntracellular fluid1 aLee, Jae Hyuk1 aJang, Dong-Hyun1 aKim, Joonghee1 aHwang, Bo Rah1 aKim, Seoyoung1 aLee, Ji Eun1 aJo, You Hwan0 tClinical nutrition.g2020 June, v. 39, no. 6 p.1826-1831dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000059x0261-56147nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2019.07.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001600143245006000159300001600219520066800235592002800903650001300931650001400944650002300958650001300981650002200994650001201016650000901028700001601037700001601053700001201069773013101081856007701212852000901289655001201298IND60537171420221119165827.0160807e199802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053717142DNAL7 a10.1007/s0021600507302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartelt, G.10aDetermination of chlorine and pentachlorophenol in wood  ap. 433-434.  aChlorine in wood was determined in connection with the development of a reference material (RM) of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in wood.

The Cape D’Aguilar Marine Reserve (CAMR), the only marine reserve in Hong Kong is close to urbanized areas, thus the resident marine organisms are inevitably influenced by partially treated wastewater from adjacent sewage treatment plants (STPs). Elevated levels of NPs and BPA were detected in all seawater, sediment and biota samples collected from the CAMR. Estrogenic activities of seawater from the CAMR, and sludge and sewage from a nearby STP were assessed using yeast estrogen screen assay. We found aromatase, estrogen receptor and vitellogenin genes in the marine medaka fish Oryzias melastigma were significantly up-regulated after exposure to the reserve’s seawater. According to a tissue-residue-based probabilistic risk assessment, the marine species living in the CAMR are having 35% and 21% of chance to be at risk due to exposure to NPs and BPA, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryzias melastigma 3aaromatase 3abisphenol A 3acoastal water 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3aenvironmental fate 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogenic properties 3afish 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aprobabilistic risk assessment 3arisk 3aseawater 3asediments 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3aurban areas 3avitellogenin 3awastewater 3awater pollution 3ayeasts 3aChina 0aEndocrine disrupting chemicals 0aYeast estrogen screen assay 0amRNA assay 0aMarine reserve 0aEcological risk assessment1 aMorton, Brian1 aLee, Joseph H.W.1 aLeung, Kenneth M.Y.0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2015 Feb. 15, v. 91, no. 1 p.128-138dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03401naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245012200210300001600332506007600348520170300424592002802127506003702155650000802192650001602200650000902216650001702225650001602242650002802258650001902286650003102305650001002336650001402346650002202360650000902382650002602391650001502417650001502432650001402447700002302461700003102484700002102515700002102536700001802557700002302575700002702598700002102625773011102646856008102757852000902838655001202847IND60438912220221207063723.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043891222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2111-12doi7 aPMC45300612pmcid7 a256938942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeiler, Kristen M10aTissue underlying the intestinal epithelium elicits proliferation of intestinal stem cells following cytotoxic damage  ap. 427-438.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe goals of this study were to document the proliferative response of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during regeneration after damage from doxorubicin (DXR), and to characterize the signals responsible for ISC activation. To this end, jejuni from DXR-treated mice were harvested for histology, assessment of ISC numbers and proliferation by flow cytometry, crypt culture, and RNA analyses. Histology showed that crypt depth and width were increased 4 days after DXR. At this time point, flow cytometry on tissue collected 1 h after EdU administration revealed increased numbers of CD24ˡᵒUEA⁻ ISCs and increased percentage of ISCs cycling. In culture, crypts harvested from DXR-treated mice were equally proliferative as those of control mice. Addition of subepithelial intestinal tissue (SET) collected 4 days after DXR elicited increased budding (1.4 ± 0.3 vs. 5.1 ± 1.0 buds per enteroid). Microarray analysis of SET collected 4 days after DXR revealed 1030 differentially expressed transcripts. Cross-comparison of Gene Ontology terms considered relevant to ISC activation pointed to 10 candidate genes. Of these, the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family member amphiregulin and the BMP antagonist chordin-like 2 were chosen for further study. In crypt culture, amphiregulin alone did not elicit significant budding, but amphiregulin in combination with BMP antagonism showed marked synergism (yielding 6.3 ± 0.5 buds per enteroid). These data suggest a critical role for underlying tissue in regulating ISC behavior after damage, and point to synergism between amphiregulin and chordin-like 2 as factors which may account for activation of ISCs in the regenerative phase.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aantagonists 3abuds 3acytotoxicity 3adoxorubicin 3aepidermal growth factor 3aflow cytometry 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahistology 3aintestinal mucosa 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3aobjectives 3astem cells 3asynergism1 aSchenhals, Erica L1 avon Furstenberg, Richard J1 aAllena, Bhavya K1 aSmith, Brian J.,1 aScaria, Denny1 aBresler, Michele N1 aDekaney, Christopher M1 aHenning, Susan J0 tCell and tissue research.g2015 Aug., v. 361, no. 2 p.427-438dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-015-2111-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03349naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245008600157520200600243592002802249650001002277650002202287650001702309650002102326650001902347650001602366650001102382650002002393650001102413650002502424650002102449650001002470650001902480650002302499650002002522650002202542651001002564700002002574700002702594700001602621700001902637700002002656773012002676856007402796852000902870655001202879IND60756208820221118024156.0211111e20211105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075620882DNAL7 a10.3390/w132131182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Hanjie 12aA Fuzzy Logic Model for Early Warning of Algal Blooms in a Tidal-Influenced River  aAlgal blooms are one of the most serious threats to water resources, and their early detection remains a challenge in eutrophication management worldwide. In recent years, with more widely available real-time auto-monitoring data and the advancement of computational capabilities, fuzzy logic has become a robust tool to establish early warning systems. In this study, a framework for an early warning system was constructed, aiming to accurately predict algae blooms in a river containing several water conservation areas and in which the operation of two tidal sluices has altered the tidal currents. Statistical analysis of sampled data was first conducted and suggested the utilization of dissolved oxygen, velocity, ammonia nitrogen, total phosphorus, and water temperature as inputs into the fuzzy logic model. The fuzzy logic model, which was driven by biochemical data sampled by two auto-monitoring sites and numerically simulated velocity, successfully reproduced algae bloom events over the past several years (i.e., 2011, 2012, 2013, 2017, and 2019). Considering the demands of management, several key parameters, such as onset threshold and prolongation time and subsequent threshold, were additionally applied in the warning system, which achieved a critical success index and positive hit rate values of 0.5 and 0.9, respectively. The differences in the early warning index between the two auto-monitoring sites were further illustrated in terms of tidal influence, sluice operation, and the influence of the contaminated water mass that returned from downstream during flood tides. It is highlighted that for typical tidal rivers in urban areas of South China with sufficient nutrient supply and warm temperature, dissolved oxygen and velocity are key factors for driving early warning systems. The study also suggests that some additional common pollutants should be sampled and utilized for further analysis of water mass extents and data quality control of auto-monitoring sampling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aammonium nitrogen 3adata quality 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3afuzzy logic 3aoxygen 3aquality control 3arivers 3astatistical analysis 3atotal phosphorus 3awater 3awater analysis 3awater conservation 3awater pollution 3awater temperature 3aChina1 aChen, Zhaoting 1 aYip, Valerie Wang-Yan,1 aChen, Gang 1 aZeng, Fantang 1 aZhao, Changjin 0 tWater.g2021 Nov. 05, v. 13, no. 21dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w132131183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03237naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007900173300001600252500026000268500001500528520159300543592002802136650001502164650002102179650001902200650001302219650002602232650002102258650003102279650001102310650001902321650001702340650001202357650001502369650001302384650002002397651001502417653002202432653001902454700001902473700002102492700002302513773012102536852000902657856008902666655001202755IND2321298020221121234427.0181002e200011  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232129802DNAL7 a10.1097/00010694-200011000-000062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Virginia L.10aP retention in tropical pre-montane soils across forest-pasture interfaces  ap. 881-889.  aAffiliations: 12502 Miller Plant Sciences, Department of Botany, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602-7271.

As part of a larger study of forest regeneration in abandoned premontane tropical pastures in southern Costa Rica, we studied soil phosphorus characteristics and other soil chemical properties in pastures and adjacent forests to determine if conversion to pasture had measurable effects. We sampled soil at 30 points across five sites in ridge and slope topographic positions and at 25 m into the forest, the forest-pasture edge, and 50 m into the pasture. We quantified plant-available phosphorus, soil phosphorus retention capacity, P fixation rates, water pH, NaF pH, organic carbon, organic nitrogen, and effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC). Although anion resin strips were used to determine plant-available phosphorus, P levels extracted from the resins were below instrumental detection limits. There was a trend of increasing pH and P retention capacity with change from forest to pasture cover, but there were no significant differences between topographic positions or between forest and pasture for any measured soil properties. No differences in soil chemical characteristics across forest-pasture interfaces indicate that fundamental soil properties in the upper 15 cm of pasture soils have not changed since conversion from forest and, therefore, that the soil chemical properties we measured do not hinder recruitment and survival of forest species in abandoned pastures.  aPublisher supplied data 3atopography 3anutrient content 3atropical soils 3apastures 3anutrient availability 3atropical forests 3aorganic nitrogen compounds 3acarbon 3asoil fertility 3aforest soils 3asoil pH 3aphosphorus 3aland use 3agrassland soils 3aCosta Rica 0aorganic compounds 0asoil chemistry1 aWest, Larry T.1 aHaines, Bruce L.1 aPeterson, Chris J.0 tSoil science.g2000 Nov., v. 165, no. 11 p.881-889dLippincott Williams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1097/00010694-200011000-000063Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01326naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002000154245007100174300001600245520041000261592002800671650001300699651001000712651001100722700002100733700001800754700002200772700002400794700002200818773010800840856005500948852000901003655001201012IND50068331620221119171736.0130803e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006833162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1756-1051.2012.01695.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHsieh, Szu‐I.10aNervilia brevilobata sp. nov.

Two groups of post‐weaning pigs aged 35 days, eight animals per group, were challenged with 3.0 × 10¹⁰ colony forming units of ETEC K88, a third group given the vehicle. The unchallenged group and one challenged group were fed a basal nursery diet for 14 days while the remaining challenged group was fed the basal diet supplemented with 1.0 × 10⁷ plaque forming units of the phage per kg. Average daily gain (ADG), goblet cell density and villous height:crypt depth (VH:CD) ratio in the intestine were less in the challenged group than in the unchallenged group within the animals fed the basal diet (p < 0.05); the reverse was true for rectal temperature, faecal consistency score (FCS), E. coli adhesion score (EAS) in the intestine, serum interleukin‐8 (IL‐8) and tumour necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α) concentrations and digesta pH in the stomach, caecum and colon. The ETEC infection symptom within the challenged animals was alleviated by the dietary phage supplementation (p < 0.05) in ADG, FCS, EAS in the jejunum, serum TNF‐α concentration, digesta pH in the colon, goblet cell density in the ileum and colon and VH:CD ratio in the ileum. Moreover, the infection symptom tended to be alleviated (p < 0.10) by the phage supplementation in rectal temperature, EAS in the ileum and caecum, and VH:CD ratio in the duodenum and jejunum. However, EAS in the colon, digesta pH in the stomach and caecum, and goblet cell density in the jejunum did not change due to the dietary phage. Overall, results indicate that the phage therapy is effective for alleviation of acute ETEC K88 infection in post‐weaning pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaverage daily gain 3abacteriophages 3ablood serum 3acecum 3acolon 3adiet 3adigesta 3aduodenum 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aileum 3ainterleukin-8 3ajejunum 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3apH 3apathogens 3aphage therapy 3astomach 3aswine 3atemperature 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aKim, S.

Previously, the qualitative effects of some carbon and nitrogen sources from fermentative media and the physicochemical parameters for growth were established by Plackett–Burman analysis, and the main parameters that affect extracellular inulinase yield were identified. In this study, the quantitative effect of the carbon to nitrogen ratio in the fermentative medium and the growth temperature were studied and optimized using central composite design and response surface methodology. Methods and results: On the basis of optimization, the maximum extracellular inulinase activity was achieved when 2·5–6·5% buckwheat flour was used as a single carbon source and 4·6–5·0% yeast extract was used as nitrogen source, by submerged cultivation, after 48 h at an incubation temperature between 15 and 27·5°C. Conclusions: Under the fermentative conditions established in this study, a maximum extracellular inulinase yield of 1·8 UI ml−1 was achieved. Rhizoctonia ssp. strain can be used for extracellular inulinase production. Also, buckwheat flour proved to be an inexpensive and abundant substrate suitable for obtaining inulinase. Significance and impact of the study: Inulinases are versatile tools for biotechnology as they can be used for a wide range of applications, including production of bioethanol, fructose syrup and inulo‐oligosaccharides, lactic acid, citric acid and butanediol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagopyrum esculentum 3aRhizoctonia 3abuckwheat 3abuckwheat flour 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acitric acid 3aculture media 3aethanol production 3afructose 3ainulinase 3alactic acid 3anitrogen 3aphysicochemical properties 3aresponse surface methodology 3asyrups 3ayeast extract 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aFagopyrum 2aFermentation 2aFlour 2aGlycoside Hydrolasesxbiosynthesis 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aRhizoctoniaxenzymology 2aTemperature1 aConstantin, O.1 aBahrim, G.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2012 Sept., v. 55, no. 3 p.195-201dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03279.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011800156300001400274500002000288520150500308592002801813650002501841650002301866650000901889650001101898650001701909650000901926650001001935650001001945650001101955650001601966650000901982650002201991650001402013650003002027650002002057650000902077650001002086650001002096650001502106700002002121700001802141773013002159856007302289852000902362655001202371IND60572053720221119053459.0170712e201702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057205372DNAL7 a10.1111/jpn.125062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanakubo, K.10aDetermination of mammalian deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in commercial vegetarian and vegan diets for dogs and cats  ap. 70-74.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe determination of undeclared ingredients in pet food using different analytical methods has been reported in recent years, raising concerns regarding adequate quality control, dietary efficacy and the potential for purposeful adulteration. The objective of this study was to determine the presence or absence of mammalian DNA using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on diets marketed as vegetarian or vegan for dogs and cats. The diets were tested in duplicate; two samples were purchased approximately 3 to 4 months apart with different lot numbers. Multiplex PCR‐targeted mitochondrial DNA with two species‐specific primers was used to amplify and sequence two sections of the cytochrome b gene for each of the 11 mammalian species. Half of the diets assessed (7/14) were positive for one or more undeclared mammalian DNA source (bovine, porcine, or ovine), and the result was repeatable for one or more species in six diets. While most of the detected DNA was found at both time points, in some cases, the result was positive only at one time point, suggesting the presence may have been due to unintentional cross‐contact with animal‐sourced ingredients. DNA from feline, cervine, canine, caprine, equine, murine (mouse and rat) and leporine was not identified in any samples.

A sensitive period in porcine embryo development is the 4-cell stage when the embryo genome activation occurs. A mixed in vivo-in vitro system was implemented to test whether an altered milieu around this stage could affect embryo development and blastocyst quality in the porcine model. After in vitro maturation and fertilisation, presumptive zygotes were exposed for 24 h to plasma collected after ovulation from adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated, non-ACTH-treated sows; and, medium without plasma, supplemented with bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, embryo development and differences in gene expression were tested among treatments. Cleavage and blastocyst rates did not differ between treatments. Blastocyst quality by morphology assessment was similar when all the resulting blastocysts were included in the analysis. However, when only expanded blastocysts (and onwards) were included in the analysis, the blastocysts from the non-ACTH plasma group showed better quality score. Blastocyst quality by morphological assessment was not mirrored by the transcription levels of various important genes for embryo development whose gene expression profile did not significantly differ among groups. It is likely that the effect of the altered environment provided by plasma from ACTH-treated sows was too short to affect embryo development. Therefore, a brief exposure to an altered endocrine environment may not have harmful consequences for the embryo once fertilisation occurs.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablastocyst 3ablood plasma 3abovine serum albumin 3acorticotropin 3aembryogenesis 3agene expression 3aovulation 0aPig 0aqRT-PCR 0aIn vitro culture 0aCortisol 0aACTH1 aPericuesta, Eva1 aGutiérrez-Adán, Alfonso1 aSjunnesson, Ylva C.B.0 tTheriogenology.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 162 p.15-21dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02645naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002700155245019900182520101400381592002801395650001601423650001301439650001001452650001701462650001901479650001001498650001401508650001401522650001201536650001301548650002101561650000801582650002001590650001201610650000701622650001801629650001101647650001301658650001701671650001701688650001801705650002701723700001801750700001701768700001801785700002101803700001901824700002801843700002101871773010001892856009001992852000902082655001202091IND60689802020221120215929.0200601e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068980202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7353812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, Sherry Stephanie10aEffect of chilling technologies on water holding properties and other quality parameters throughout the whole value chain: From whole fish to cold-smoked fillets of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar)  aThe effect of different chilling technologies on water holding and quality parameters was investigated on Atlantic salmon throughout the entire value chain. Chilling technologies of whole fish before filleting, included superchilling(S) by refrigerated seawater (RSW) or ice (I), followed by chilling of fillets with liquid nitrogen (SS, IS) or ice (SI, II). Superchilling by shell-freezing with liquid nitrogen (IS and SS) caused increased drip loss throughout storage for both raw and smoked fillets. Whole salmon stored in RSW followed by ice storage (SI) had the least drip loss. Moreover, fish stored in RSW had lower H₂S producing bacteria for raw fillets, lower blood spot counts and gaping after smoking. Therefore, this method is likely more feasible than storing whole fish in ice or shell-freezing of fillets. Water content, muscle pH and colour parameters were higher for raw than smoked fillets, while breaking force, firmness and water holding capacity were higher for smoked than raw fillets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3abacteria 3ablood 3acold storage 3acold treatment 3acolor 3adrip loss 3afilleting 3afillets 3afirmness 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aice 3aliquid nitrogen 3amuscles 3apH 3arefrigeration 3asalmon 3aseawater 3asupercooling 3asupply chain 3awater content 3awater holding capacity1 aRoth, Björn,1 aSkare, Maren1 aHernar, Malin1 aJessen, Flemming1 aLøvdal, Trond1 aJakobsen, Anita Nordeng1 aLerfall, Jørgen0 tAquaculture.g2020 Sept. 15, v. 526 p.735381-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7353813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01456naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245007600160300001600236520038100252592002800633650001500661650002700676650002300703650002600726650001300752650001200765650002100777650001300798650001400811650001200825700002100837700002200858773013100880856007401011852000901085655001201094IND60659694620221118060052.0190823e20130103xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065969462DNAL7 a10.1039/c2cc36325a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Niraj K.10aMechanochemical synthesis of an yttrium based metal–organic framework  ap. 972-974.  aFor the first time a metal hydride has been used for the preparation of a metal–organic framework.

In existing methods, the computation overheads grow rapidly with data volumes, leading to the incapability of providing real-time visualization for large-scale spatial vector data, even with parallel acceleration technologies. To fill the gap, we present HiVision, a display-driven visualization model for large-scale spatial vector data. Different from traditional data-driven methods, the computing units in HiVision are pixels rather than spatial objects to achieve real-time performance, and efficient spatial-index-based strategies are introduced to estimate the topological relationships between pixels and spatial objects. HiVision can maintain exceedingly good performance regardless of the data volume due to the stable pixel number for display. In addition, an optimized parallel computing architecture is proposed in HiVision to ensure the ability of real-time visualization. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional methods in rendering speed and visual effects while dealing with large-scale spatial vector data, and can provide interactive visualization of datasets with billion-scale points/segments/edges in real-time with flexible rendering styles. The HiVision code is open-sourced at https://github.com/MemoryMmy/HiVision with an online demonstration.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3ainformation science 3amodels 3atopology 3avector data 0aVector data visualization 0aBig data 0aDisplay-driven computing 0aParallel computing 0aReal-time1 aWu, Ye1 aOuyang, Xue1 aChen, Luo1 aLi, Jun1 aJing, Ning0 tComputers & geosciences.g2021 Feb., v. 147 p.104665-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12438x0098-30047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2020.1046653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02401naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245011700156300001800273520112700291650002401418650002001442650001401462650002501476650001701501650001401518650001601532650002101548650001701569650001401586650001101600650002601611650001301637650002201650650001401672650001601686650001701702700002201719700001601741773016101757856004001918852000901958655001201967IND4534853020221120150214.0150828e20140219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453485302DNAL7 a10.1021/jf40452332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOszmianski, J.10aCharacterization of Phenolic Compounds and Antioxidant Activity of Solanum scabrum and Solanum burbankii Berries  ap. 1512-1519.  aThe purpose of this research was to quantify and characterize phenolic compounds and to measure the antioxidant activity of Solanum scabrum and Solanum burbankii berries. The antioxidant activity of Solanum berry extracts was assayed by electrochemical and spectrophotometric methods, whereas liquid chromatography (LC)/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry and ultra-performance LC-photodiode detector were used for identification and quantification of their polyphenols. Eighteen phenolic compounds were identified in these fruits. The presence of seven phenolic acid derivatives and two flavonols was reported for the first time. In both cultivars, the major compound was found to be anthocyanin petunidin-3-(p-coumaroyl-rutinoside)-5-O-glucoside. Additional anthocyanins in S. burbankii and S. scrabum berries were characterized as petunidin, delphinidin, and malvidin with the same glycosidic substitution pattern and acylation with p-coumaric and ferulic acids. S. scabrum was richer in phenolic compounds, especially anthocyanins, and was characterized by more powerful antioxidant activity than S. burbankii. 3aSolanum retroflexum 3aSolanum scabrum 3aacylation 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3acultivars 3adelphinidin 3aelectrochemistry 3aferulic acid 3aflavonols 3afruits 3aliquid chromatography 3amalvidin 3amass spectrometry 3apetunidin 3apolyphenols 3asmall fruits1 aKolniak-Ostek, J.1 aWojdylo, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Feb. 19, v. 62, no. 7 p.1512-1519dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf4045233  aDNAL 7aarticle03480naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094024002200117024001900139040001800158100001800176245011000194300001500304520167500319592002801994650001802022650002302040650001802063650001202081650001002093650001402103650002002117650002102137650001302158650001002171650001402181650002402195650001102219650001102230650001302241650001502254650002002269650002002289650002102309650003002330650000902360650000902369650001402378650001402392700001402406700001302420700001302433700001602446700001402462700001902476773015202495856007002647856010502717990002302822852000902845655001202854IND60608680520221120132010.0190510e20180804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060868052DNAL7 a10.3791/576752doi7 aPMC61266192pmcid7 a301246372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Mengyu14aThe plant infection test: spray and wound-mediated inoculation with the plant pathogen Magnaporthe Grisea  ap. e57675.  aPlants possess a powerful system to defend themselves against potential threats by pathogenic fungi. For agriculturally important plants, however, current measures to combat such pathogens have proved too conservative and, thus, not sufficiently effective, and they can potentially pose environmental risks. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to identify host-resistance factors to assist in controlling plant diseases naturally through the identification of resistant germplasm, the isolation and characterization of resistance genes, and the molecular breeding of resistant cultivars. In this regard, there is need to establish an accurate, rapid, and large-scale inoculation method to breed and develop plant resistance genes. The rice blast fungal pathogen Magnaporthe grisea causes severe disease symptoms and yield losses. Recently, M. grisea has emerged as a model organism for studying the mechanisms of plant-fungal pathogen interactions. Hence, we report the development of a plant virulence test method that is specific for M. grisea. This method provides for both spray inoculation with a conidial suspension and wounding inoculation with mycelium cubes or droplets of conidial suspension. The key step of the wounding inoculation method for detached rice leaves is to make wounds on plant leaves, which avoids any interference caused by host penetration resistance. This spray/wounding protocol contributes to the rapid, accurate, and large-scale screening of the pathotypes of M. grisea isolates. This integrated and systematic plant infection method will serve as an excellent starting point for gaining a broad perspective of issues in plant pathology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA shuffling 3aMagnaporthe grisea 3ablast disease 3aconidia 3acrops 3acultivars 3adisease control 3adisease severity 3adroplets 3afungi 3agermplasm 3ainoculation methods 3aleaves 3amodels 3amycelium 3apathotypes 3aplant pathogens 3aplant pathology 3aresistance genes 3aresistance to penetration 3arice 3arisk 3ascreening 3avirulence1 aSun, Xuan1 aCui, Lie1 aYin, Yue1 aZhao, Xinyu1 aPan, Song1 aWang, Weixiang0 tJournal of visualized experiments.g2018 Aug. 04, , no. 138 p.e57675-e57675dJournal of Visualized ExperimentswJournal:jnl4469330x1940-087X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3791/576753Available from publisher's site  uhttp://www.jove.com/video/57675/the-plant-infection-test-spray-wound-mediated-inoculation-with-plant  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle04739naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001700188245013200205300001200337506007600349520231500425592002802740596008102768596007502849596007502924596006402999596006103063506003703124650002103161650001803182650001403200650001603214650001903230650001603249650001403265650002203279650001403301650001703315650001703332650003503349650002903384650002003413650001203433650001503445650000903460650002103469650001403490650001703504650002503521650001703546700001503563700001403578700001303592700001203605700001503617700001703632700001803649700001803667700001403685700001703699700001303716700001803729700001203747700001803759773011303777856008203890852000903972655001203981IND60606742220221207080823.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060674222DNAL7 a300457762pmid7 aPMC60605182pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-3018-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiaying10aCharacterization of a novel secretory spherical body protein in Babesia orientalis and Babesia orientalis-infected erythrocytes  ap. 433.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The spherical body, a membrane bound organelle localized in the apical organelle complex, is unique to Babesia and Theileria spp. The spherical body proteins (SBPs) secreted by spherical bodies include SBP1, SBP2, SBP3 and SBP4. Up to now, only SBP3 has been characterized in Babesia orientalis. METHODS: The BoSBP4 gene was amplified from cDNA and gDNA and cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 vector by homologous recombination, sequenced and analyzed by bioinformatics tools. The amino acid (aa) sequence of BoSBP4 was compared with that of Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina as well as SBP3 of B. orientalis. The immunoreactivity was evaluated by incubating recombinant BoSBP4 (rBoSBP4) with the serum of B. orientalis-infected water buffalo. The native form of BoSBP4 was identified by incubating lysate of B. orientalis-infected water buffalo erythrocytes with the anti-rBoSBP4 mouse serum. The cellular localization of BoSBP4 was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: The full length of the BoSBP4 gene was estimated to be 945 bp without introns, encoding a 314 aa polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 37 kDa. The truncated recombinant protein was expressed from 70 to 945 bp as a GST fusion protein with a practical molecular weight of 70 kDa. BoSBP4 shared a 40% and 30% identity with B. bovis and B. bigemina, respectively. Furthermore, it was 31% identical to SBP3 of B. orientalis. BoSBP4 was identified in the lysate of B. orientalis-infected water buffalo erythrocytes with a molecular weight of 37 kDa, corresponding to the expected molecular mass of BoSBP4. The result of rBoSBP4 with positive serum revealed that BoSBP4 can elicit an immune response to B. orientalis-infected water buffalo. The cellular localization of BoSBP4 was detected to be adjacent to the merozoite nucleus in the intracellular phase, followed by the diffusion of the fluorescence of BoSBP4 into the cytoplasm of B. orientalis-infected erythrocytes as puncta-like specks and a gradual increase of the fluorescence. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, SBP4 in B. orientalis was characterized for the first time. It may play a key role in interaction with the host cell by being secreted into the cytoplasm of the B. orientalis-infected erythrocytes to facilitate parasite growth and reproduction.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015CB150300cNational Basic Science Research Program (973 program) of China  a2017YFD0501201cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017YFD0500402cNational Key Research and Development Program of China  a31772729cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (CN)  a2017CFA020cNatural Science Foundation of Hubei Province0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBabesia bigemina 3aBabesia bovis 3aTheileria 3aamino acids 3abioinformatics 3ablood serum 3abuffaloes 3acomplementary DNA 3acytoplasm 3aerythrocytes 3afluorescence 3afluorescent antibody technique 3ahomologous recombination 3aimmune response 3aintrons 3amerozoites 3amice 3amolecular weight 3aparasites 3apolypeptides 3arecombinant proteins 3areproduction1 aLi, Muxiao1 aSun, Yali1 aYu, Long1 aHe, Pei1 aNie, Zheng1 aZhan, Xueyan1 aZhao, Yangnan1 aLuo, Xiaoying1 aWang, Sen1 aAoyang, Siqi1 aLiu, Qin1 aHuang, Cuiqin1 aHe, Lan1 aZhao, Junlong0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.433-433dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-3018-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245008800166300001400254520109500268592002801363650002301391650002801414650001701442650003901459650001501498650002201513650001501535653002701550653002201577653001701599653000801616653003001624653002301654700001801677700003001695700001601725700001701741700001401758773009801772856008701870961001301957852000901970655001201979IND60568063120221118064959.0190402e20171101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056806312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.1492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Bei10aEffect of pulsed light on activity and structural changes of horseradish peroxidase  ap. 20-25.  aThe objective of this research was to investigate the effects of pulsed light on the activity and structure of horseradish peroxidase in buffer solution. Enzyme residual activities were measured. Surface topography, secondary, and tertiary structures of horseradish peroxidase were determined using atomic force microscopy (AFM), Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively. Results showed that a complete inactivation of horseradish peroxidase was achieved by application of 10 pulses of pulsed light treatment at an intensity of 500J/pulse. The AFM analysis revealed that the aggregation of enzyme protein increased and surface roughness decreased with the increase in the treatment time. Fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy analysis exhibited that pulsed light destroyed the tertiary and secondary protein structures. The β-sheet composition was decreased while β-turn and random coils were increased. Pulsed light could effectively inactivate horseradish peroxidase by destroying the secondary and tertiary structures of protein in the active center of the enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3afluorescence 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3aperoxidase 3asurface roughness 3atopography 0aHorseradish peroxidase 0aResidual activity 0aPulsed light 0aAFM 0aFluorescence spectroscopy 0aRaman spectroscopy1 aZhang, Yanyan1 aVenkitasamy, Chandrasekar1 aWu, Bengang1 aPan, Zhongli1 aMa, Haile0 tFood chemistry.g2017 Nov. 01, v. 234 p.20-25dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.04.1493Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03707naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245014000171300001700311500001500328520241800343592002802761650001302789650001502802650001602817650001002833650002202843650001402865650001002879650001902889650001302908650001502921650002202936650001902958653001602977700002302993700001903016700001903035700002503054773010603079856007903185852000903264655001203273IND50090578820221122100027.0150206e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5009057882DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2745.122502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeeuwen, Casper H. A.10aHydrology, shore morphology and species traits affect seed dispersal, germination and community assembly in shoreline plant communities  ap. 998-1007.  a2019-12-05  aSeed dispersal and germination are two primary processes influencing plant community assembly. On freshwater shores, water levels regulate both processes. However, it is still unclear how water levels, shore morphology and species traits interactively affect seed dispersal and germination, and how these interactions determine plant community assembly. We hypothesize that a drawdown water regime enhances seed establishment compared to a year‐round stable water level, that this increases species richness and diversity, and that this is modulated by species traits and shore morphology. Germination of 20 wetland plant species with different dispersal capacities (floating capacity expressed as seed floatation half‐time) and soil moisture preferences for germination (Ellenberg F) was tested on artificial shores in 24 outdoor ponds in two complementary experiments over 8 weeks. The ‘dispersal experiment’ tested the effect of water regime on recruitment of hydrochorously dispersing seeds. The ‘seed bank experiment’ tested the effect of water regime on germination from a sown seed bank, on steep and gradual shores. In the dispersal experiment, the drawdown regime increased recruitment and species richness. Longer floating species colonized a larger shoreline section. Soil moisture preference for germination did not determine colonization patterns. In the seed bank experiment, the drawdown regime increased the number of seedlings on gradual sloping shores, but not on steep shores. The number of germinating seedlings corresponded to the area subjected to the drawdown regime in both shore types. Species richness was not affected by water regime or shore morphology, and species traits did not determine shoreline colonization. Most seeds germinated in moist soil conditions for all species. Synthesis. A spring drawdown instead of stable water regime stimulates establishment of hydrochorously dispersing seeds in temperate wetlands, leading to higher species richness and diversity. Germination from the seed bank is more affected by water regime and shore surface than by the tested species traits. Species traits, water levels and shore morphology together determine wetland plant community assembly, with dispersal as the main driver of seedling community diversity. Water‐level regulations and shore morphology can be used to influence plant communities in wetland restoration.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetlands 3afreshwater 3agermination 3aseeds 3aplant communities 3aseedlings 3aponds 3awetland plants 3adrawdown 3asoil water 3aspecies diversity 3aseed dispersal 0arecruitment1 aSarneel, Judith M.1 aPaassen, José1 aRip, Winnie J.1 aBakker, Elisabeth S.0 tjournal of ecology.g2014 July, v. 102, no. 4 p.998-1007dBlackwell Scientific Publ.x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.122503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003200155245016600187520187200353592002802225650001802253650001702271650002302288650001902311650001202330650002302342650002802365650003002393650001502423650002002438650001802458650002202476653001802498653002302516653001702539653004302556653000702599653000802606653000902614700002002623700001802643700002402661700001902685700002502704700002102729700002002750700001802770773011502788856009002903852000902993655001203002IND60689802420221120215932.0200601e20200915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068980242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7354112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParker-Graham, Christine A.10aEffect of oxytetracycline treatment on the gastrointestinal microbiome of critically endangered white abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) treated for withering syndrome  aWhite abalone (Haliotis sorenseni) are critically endangered marine gastropods that are native to kelp forests in the northeastern Pacific. White abalone are highly susceptible to withering syndrome, a fatal bacterial disease caused by Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis (CaXc), an intracellular, order Rickettsiales prokaryote that is endemic throughout the white abalone's range in California and Mexico. Oxytetracycline (OTC) baths at a dose of 500 mg/L are successful in clearing CaXc infections from the gastrointestinal tract of infected abalone. The impact of OTC treatment on the diversity and stability of the gut microbiome in white abalone is unknown. The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) to characterize the gastrointestinal microbiome of clinically-normal white abalone and (2) to compare the gastrointestinal microbiomes of OTC-treated white abalone to those of control animals. Gastrointestinal tracts from five OTC-treated individuals and five untreated controls were sampled at each time point: day 0, one day after the 21-day OTC treatment (day 22), and at 203 days post-treatment. Gastrointestinal tract microbiomes were analyzed after amplification and sequence of the 16S rRNA. Gastrointestinal microbiomes of untreated animals were dominated by three core bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Reduced Shannon α-diversity and absence of various phyla in the microbiome of OTC-treated animals were observed in samples at day 22. Bacterial profiles were improved in terms of α-diversity at 203 days but some bacterial phyla, mainly Fusobacteria, remained absent. All animals remained clinically normal throughout the study period and there was no significant difference in a condition index between the two groups.

The recent finding that xanthoxal is the substrate of the molybdenum containing aldehyde oxidase in avocado fruit makes 2-cis-xanthoxic acid one of the last precursors on the biosynthetic pathway to ABA.

The rubber yield was increased about 3.2- and 4.7-fold by the addition of isopentenyl diphosphate (IDP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), respectively. The rubber formed on incubation in the presence of FDP showed a clearly bimodal molecular-weight distribution (MWD) with Mn of 9.6 X 10(4) and Mw of 1.0 X 10(6); which were about 1/4 of that of the endogenous rubber. This indicates that the formation of new rubber in BF uses FDP as a direct initiator. The presence of the dimethylallyl-group of the initiating species was observed in the new rubber formed on incubation of fresh BF with FDP, although it was not detected in in vivo rubber. The new rubber formed on incubation contained no long-chain fatty acid groups esterified to the rubber molecules, as is the case in in vivo Hevea rubber. These facts show the differences in the mechanism of initiation and termination between the in vitro and in vivo rubber formation reactions. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3ain vitro culture 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3alatex 3atransferases 3aenzyme activity 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3amolecular weight 0asubstrates 0aprecursors1 aTanaka, Y.1 aOgura, K.1 aKoyama, T.1 aWititsuwannakul, R.1 aChareonthiphakorn, N.0 tPhytochemistry.g1997 May, v. 45, no. 2 p.275-281x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19980101b19980107c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03302naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245014100169300001400310520159800324650001301922650002301935650001201958650003501970650001202005650001302017650001102030650001202041650001902053650001702072650001102089650000902100650000902109650001402118650001402132650001402146650002702160650001102187650002102198650001202219650001302231650002502244651001202269653001902281653001302300653001302313653003102326653002102357700002002378700001502398700001702413773013202430852000902562856008502571930003302656946001102689655001202700IND4407790220221116160034.0080712e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440779022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-9945-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgunfowokan, A. O. 10aHeavy metals pollution in a sewage treatment oxidation pond and the receiving stream of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Nigeria  ap. 25-41.  aThis work centered on a 1-year evaluation campaign of point source pollution from a sewage treatment oxidation pond and its receiving stream. Water samples were collected from the sewage treatment oxidation pond and the receiving stream during July 2002 and June 2003. Concentrations of heavy metals were determined using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) after a triple acid digestion of samples using open beaker method. Generally, the results showed high levels of toxic metals such as Cd, Pb, As, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, and Fe in the influent and effluent samples as well as in the receiving stream. The annual mean concentration of metals in the sewage samples ranged from 11.90 to 16.05, 64.96 to 88.27, 38.91 to 76.35, 17.46 to 24.45 μg/L for Cd, As, Pb, Co, and 4.31 to 8.77, 1.71 to 2.45, 0.46 to 0.74 and 13.82 to 20.47 mg/l for Al, Cr, Mn and Fe, respectively; while in the receiving stream, the concentrations were between 6.89 to 10.45, 35.50 to 59.26, 22.85 to 35.94, 11.33 to 18.83 μg/l for Cd, As, Pb, Co, and 1.99 to 3.49, 1.35 to 2.08, 0.21 to 0.48, and 8.93 to 14.15 mg/l for Al, Cr, Mn and Fe, respectively. The discharge of the effluent from the sewage pond into the receiving stream has therefore led to increase in the concentrations of some heavy metals downstream, thus impacting the receiving stream negatively and could pose a serious health hazard to aquatic ecosystems and humans particularly for rural dwellers and peasant farmers downstream that utilize the water from the receiving stream for various domestic and agricultural purposes untreated. 3aaluminum 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aarsenic 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acadmium 3achromium 3acobalt 3afarmers 3ahealth hazards 3aheavy metals 3ahumans 3airon 3alead 3amanganese 3aoxidation 3apeasantry 3apoint source pollution 3asewage 3asewage treatment 3astreams 3atoxicity 3awet digestion method 3aNigeria 0aOxidation pond 0aEffluent 0aInfluent 0aObafemi Awolowo University 0aReceiving stream1 aAdenuga, A.

Adding compound 5 to E. coli cell suspension caused cytochrome c reduction, which was completely inhibited by superoxide dismutase. The rate of cytochrome c reduction was in the order of 1 = 2 = 3 < 4 < 5, which correlates well with that of the reduction potentials of these benzofurazans. Adding glucose to the E. coli cell suspension-compound 5-cytochrome c system accelerated the rate of cytochrome c reduction. The formation of 4,7-dicyanobenzofurazan anion radical in the cell suspension-compound 5-glucose system in the absence of O2 was followed by ESR spectroscopy. The ESR signal of the anion radical disappeared when O2 was added. Compound 5 was shown to have an approximately 10-fold greater increasing effect on the flux of O2- by E. coli than paraquat (PQ) by the cytochrome c reduction method. The results were confirmed by the electrochemical method with an oxygen electrode. However, compound 5 had a bacteriostatic, but not lethal, effect, while PQ had both effects. The effect of compound 5 and PQ on lethality of E. coli showed a dramatic difference when E. coli was exposed to these two compounds and washed prior to testing the effects of that exposure. This difference probably arose because compound 5 readily leaked from the cells during dilution and plating. Also, the reduced form of compound 5 exits from the cells more readily than the reduced form of PQ and then generates O2- in the medium by autoxidation. This suggests the importance of the intracellular production of O2-, rather than the extracellular production of O2-, for lethal effect. 3aparaquat 3acytotoxicity 3aEscherichia coli 3acell suspension culture 3aoxygen 3acytochrome c 3asuperoxide dismutase 3acyanide-resistant respiration 3aredox reactions 2aBenzoxazolesxtoxicity 2aCytochrome c Groupxmetabolism 2aElectron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy 2aEscherichia colixdrug effectsxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aFree Radicals 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aParaquatxpharmacology 2aSuperoxidesxmetabolism 0arespiration 0acytotoxic compounds 0abenzofuranzan 0asuperoxide production1 aHasegawa, M.1 aNagano, T.1 aHirobe, M.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1992 Mar. 5, v. 267, no. 7 p.4613-4618x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01928naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100001900155245012400174300001600298500002400314520050800338650002400846650002300870650002000893650001800913650001900931650001000950650002500960650001500985650001501000650001001015650006201025650002901087650003301116650003501149650001101184650000901195650003601204700001901240700001901259700002901278773010301307852000901410856003901419655001201458IND4448941620221116155915.0110204e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444894162DNAL7 a206772112pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.32522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPurnak, Tugrul10aUpper Gastrointestinal Bleeding in a Patient With Defective Hemostasis Successfully Treated with Ankaferd Blood Stopper  ap. 312-313.  aIncludes references  aAcute gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is one of the most frequent causes for hospitalization and responsible for a major cause of morbidity and mortality among patients.

Glutamic acid, aspartic acid and leucine were the most abundant amino acids while the S-containing amino acids, methionine and cystine, had the lowest concentration (9.9-14.9 g/kg crude protein). There is no significant differences between the essential amino acids of the two defatted seed meals at p<0.05 confidence level and the levels of most essential amino acids could probably supply the required supplements for both livestock and human beings. The protein egg score of phenylalanine plus tyrosine and leucine compare favourably with those in egg while threonine is the limiting essential amino acid. 3arubber 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aseeds 3adefatted products 3aamino acid composition 3aproximate composition 3afeeds 3afeed composition1 aAkintayo, E.T.1 aOlaofe, O.0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2007 , v. 5, no. 3-4 p.115-118x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle03666naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001800137245010900155300001600264500002400280500001500304520224900319650002002568650001202588650002202600650001402622650003102636650002302667650001302690650001902703650003202722650002202754650002302776653002602799653001702825700001602842700001502858700002102873700001402894773009702908852000903005856008903014930003303103945002503136946001103161655001203172IND4402731920221116155821.0080313e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440273192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aF833 0aF2001 aOnitilo, M.O.10aPhysicochemical and functional properties of native starches from cassava varieties in Southwest Nigeria  ap. 108-114.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPre- and postharvest factors such as genetic factors, environmental conditions during the growth of the plant and the method of starch isolation have been found to have a profound effect on the properties of root and tuber starches.

Amylose and dry matter contents were 15.24-30.20% and 88.47- 96.41% respectively. The water absorption capacity ranged from 86.83 to 127.54%, while solubility and swelling power (at 85oC) were 1.03-2.10% and 9.04-16.90% respectively. Starch damage ranged between 0.39 and 2.10%, dispersibility was 81.5-89.5% and least gelation concentration 2.00-4.67%. The pH of the starches ranged from 4.06 to 9.22. The starches had peak viscosity between 261.17 and 593.17 RVU, peak time ranged from 3.36 to 4.25 minutes and pasting temperature ranged between 63.75 and 65.65oC. Set back viscosity ranged from 19.04 to 79.92 RVU and breakdown viscosity from 141.21 to 328.96 RVU. The final viscosity of the starches ranged between 141.21 and 244.84 RVU. The granule size as viewed under microscope ranged from 12.5 to 23.83 μm with round shapes. There were significant varietal differences in all the physicochemical properties of the starches except the amylose content. Significant varietal differences (p < 0.05) were also recorded in all the functional and pasting properties of the starches except the least gelation concentration. There were no significant varietal differences (p > 0.05) in the granule size of the starches. The study revealed that the significant varietal differences in the properties of the starches from the different CMD resistant varieties imply that the starches have potentials for a wide end use. 3astarch granules 3acassava 3agenetic variation 3avarieties 3aphysicochemical properties 3adisease resistance 3agelation 3acassava starch 3aCassava common mosaic virus 3aManihot esculenta 3apasting properties 0afunctional properties 0agranule size1 aSanni, L.O.1 aDaniel, I.1 aMaziya-Dixon, B.1 aDixon, A.0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2007 , v. 5, no. 3-4 p.108-114x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02960naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001400177245005600191300001600247500002400263500001500287520150200302650001801804650001801822650001201840650002201852650001301874650002301887650001201910650001901922650001801941650001201959650001101971650001801982650002402000650001902024650001802043650001002061653002702071700001402098700001302112700001402125773011102139852000902250856009002259930003302349945002502382946001102407655001202418IND4397057220221116155733.0071025e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439705722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2007.06.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ400 0aQ5001 aCui, Z.W.10aPreparation of dry honey by microwave-vacuum drying  ap. 582-590.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMicrowave-vacuum (MWV) drying was investigated as a potential method for obtaining high-quality dried honey. Liquid honey was heated and dehydrated in a MWV dryer to a moisture content less than 2.5% within about 10 min. The drying curves and the temperature changes of samples were tested during MWV drying at a different of microwave power, vacuum pressure levels and sample thicknesses. Fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose contents in the liquid and dry honey were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The volatiles in the liquid and dry honey were concentrated by solid-phase microextraction (SPME), separated and identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A sample thickness of less than 8 mm and a vacuum pressure of 30 mbar were identified as the better parameters for the MWV drying. The core temperatures of the sample were about the same as the surface temperatures, the temperature changes were from 30 to 50 °C with higher dehydration rates while no darkening of the honey took place during MWV drying. There were no significant changes on the contents of fructose, glucose, maltose and sucrose in the honey after MWV drying. The volatile acids, alcohols, aldehydes and esters made up the bulk of the identified aroma compounds of the used liquid honey and the content of alcohols and the esters changed slightly. The acids decreased markedly whereas the aldehydes and the ketones increased remarkably in the honey dehydrated by MWV drying. 3avacuum drying 3amass transfer 3aglucose 3asugar substitutes 3afructose 3adrying temperature 3asucrose 3adrying quality 3awater content 3amaltose 3aflavor 3aspecific heat 3amicrowave treatment 3awater activity 3aheat transfer 3ahoney 0ahoney and bee products1 aSun, L.J.1 aChen, W.1 aSun, D.W.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2008 Feb., v. 84, no. 4 p.582-590dElsevier Science Pub.

The rheological properties of chitosan solution, and mechanical properties and gas (oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen) permeability of the chitosan film were evaluated. The effect of chitosan (CH1, 1% w/w solution) glazing on the quality of skinless pink salmon fillets after eight months frozen storage was determined. The rheological study showed that CH1 exhibited pseudoplastic and viscoelastic characteristics. The glass transition temperature (T(g)) for the chitosan film was observed at 80.23 °C. The oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and water vapor permeabilities of the chitosan film were 5.34 x 10(-2) (cm(3)/m day atm), 0.17 (cm(3)/m day atm), 0.03 (cm(3)/m day atm), and 2.92 x 10(-10) (g water m/m(2) Pa s), respectively. Fillets glazed with CH1 solution exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher yield and thaw yield than the lactic acid-glazed (LA) and distilled water-glazed (DW) fillets, although these fillets all had similar moisture content after thawing. Chitosan, DW, and LA glazing delayed lipid oxidation in skinless pink salmon fillets after eight months frozen storage. 3aviscoelasticity 3afish processing 3alipid peroxidation 3afrozen fish 3aOncorhynchus gorbuscha 3awater vapor 3apermeability 3alactic acid 3acarbon dioxide 3afood storage 3aglass transition temperature 3afreezing quality 3aoxygen 3acoatings 3achitosan 3amechanical properties 3awater content 3afrozen storage 3anitrogen 3afish fillets 3athawing 0achitosan glaze 0apseudoplasticity 0alactic acid glaze 0adistilled water glaze 0arheological properties1 aLiu, Q.1 aHuang, J.1 aPrinyawiwatkul, W.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Dec., v. 83, no. 3 p.366-373dElsevier Science Pub.

Both storage (G') and loss (G") moduli for fresh and osmotically dehydrated tissues showed a weaker dependence with angular frequency. All samples had a viscoelastic solid behavior with G' dominating the viscoelastic response, but in general both moduli decreased with time of osmosis. For the time scale of the experiments, a generalized Kelvin model with six elements properly predicted the creep compliance response, with a correlation coefficient >0.999 for all samples. In general, initial (J(0)) and decay compliances (J(1) and J(2)) and steady-state fluidity (ηN) significantly increased as treatment proceeded. Between 40 and 90 or 120 min osmosis, many rheological parameters (G' at frequencies in the range 1-100 s(-1); loss tangent at 0.1 s(-1), J(1), retardation times (λ(1) and λ(2)), relative contribution of each type of compliance, η(N), plasticity, and overall compliance) showed a turning point, fluctuations or the greatest changes in the evolution along treatment. This behavior was related with shrinkage and posterior round shape recuperation and swelling of the cells, as seen in previous light and environmental scanning electron microscopy studies. 3aviscoelasticity 3aosmosis 3afood processing quality 3aapples 3aaqueous solutions 3astorage modulus 3aglucose 3aswelling (materials) 3aosmotic treatment 3adrying quality 3ashrinkage 3adried fruit 3aprediction 0aloss modulus 0asteady-state fluidity 0acreep compliance response 0adecay response 0aGranny Smith apples 0aparenchyma 0arheological properties 0aplasticity1 aNieto, A.B.1 aCastro, M.A.1 aSalvatori, D.1 aAlzamora, S.M.0 tJournal of food engineering.g2007 Dec., v. 83, no. 3 p.394-403dElsevier Science Pub.

The optimum sorption conditions were studied for each monometallic system. The optimum pH was 6 for the recovery of Cd, Ni and Zn, and less than 5 for Cu and Pb. The best results were obtained with the lowest biomass concentration used (0.5 g/L). Experimental data fitted a Langmuir model very well according to the following sequence of the sorption values: Pb > Cd >or= Cu > Zn > Ni. The brown algae achieved the lowest metal concentration levels in solution; the best results were obtained with Fucus spiralis. Finally, a software computer program was used to simulate the process by comparison of theoretical with experimental results and show minimum differences between both types of data. 3aChondrus crispus 3awater pollution 3aSpirogyra 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3azinc 3aalgae 3aheavy metals 3acopper 3abioremediation 3aCodium 3alead 3acadmium 3aFucus spiralis 3anickel 3aAsparagopsis 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiomass 2aEukaryotaxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFungixmetabolism 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMetals, Heavyxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxprevention & control 0aalgae and seaweeds 0aCodium vermilara 0aAsparagopsis armata 0aSpirogyra insignis1 aGonzález, F.1 aBallester, A.1 aBlázquez, M.L.1 aMuñoz, J.A.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Dec., v. 98, no. 17 p.3344-3353dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.09.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20080129b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle02250naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008500125300001600210520129900226650001601525650001801541650001901559650003201578650002901610650001201639650002501651650001701676653001601693700001801709700001501727700002001742773008501762852000901847939003301856946001101889655001201900IND9303293120221116160230.0930528e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930329312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahu, S.K.10aDegradation of soil-applied isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane by a Pseudomonas sp  ap. 387-391.  aA Pseudomonas sp., that readily degraded alpha-, beta- and gamma-isomers of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) in a mineral salts medium under aerobic conditions, was tested for its ability to degrade these isomers after their application to two soils under flooded or nonflooded conditions. Interestingly, the concentration of soil-applied alpha- and gamma-HCH decreased from the original concentration of 5 micrograms g-1 soil to undetectable amounts within 10-20 days in soils inoculated with Pseudomonas sp., and the loss of both isomers was more pronounced under nonflooded conditions than under flooded conditions. During the corresponding period, there was no appreciable loss of either isomer from uninoculated soils. The degradation of beta-HCH was not accelerated by bacterial inoculation of the soils under either water regime despite the ability of the bacterium to degrade this isomer when added to the mineral salts medium. The rapid degradation of alpha- and gamma-HCH, and not beta-HCH, in inoculated soils is attributed to the ability of the bacterium to utilize alpha- and gamma-HCH, and not beta-HCH, for growth. Addition of sodium acetate to the mineral salts medium enhanced the bacterial degradation of beta-HCH implicating cometabolism and retarded the degradation of gamma-HCH. 3aPseudomonas 3asoil bacteria 3abiodegradation 3acyclohexanecarboxylic acids 3achlorinated hydrocarbons 3aisomers 3asaturated conditions 3ainsecticides 0apersistence1 aPatnaik, K.K.1 aBhuyan, S.1 aSethunathan, N.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g1993 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.387-391x0038-07177nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01984naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010700126300001600233520115300249650002801402650001001430650002101440650002001461650002601481650002001507650001601527700001901543773006701562852000901629939003301638946001101671655001201682IND9303291420221116155948.0930528s1990    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930329142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApata, D.F.10aSome aspects of the biochemistry and nutritive value of African yambean seed (Sphenosytlis stenocarpa)  ap. 271-280.  aThe proximate and mineral compositions, amino acid profile and the quality of the protein of three varieties of African yambean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa) seed, in the raw, autoclaved and cooked forms, were assessed. The average crude protein, crude fibre and ash values of the rats, yam bean were 23.3%, 4.9% and 3.9%, respectively. Mineral concentrations, on dry weight basis, were: 3.3-4.2 g kg-1 for P; 0.70-0.80 g kg-1 for Ca; 1.3-1.7 g kg-1 for Mg; 9.7-12.0 g kg-1 for K; 0.04-0.06 g kg-1 for Na, 27.8-46.2 mg kg-1 for Mn; 38.2-44.0 mg kg-1 for Zn; 52.0-63.0 mg kg-1 for Fe and 8.1-11.8 mg kg-1 for Cu. The amino acid composition of the protein indicated lysine, 7.38-8.09 g/16 g N; tryptophan, 1.21-1.26 g/16 g N and methionine + cystine, 3.08-3.45 g/16 g N to be above, or close to, the values recommended by FAO/ WHO. Cooked yam bean seeds contained relatively, lower amounts of the nutrient components determined. Significant differences (P < 0.05) between raw, autoclaved and cooked seeds were found for the protein quality indices.

Four oil samples, designated A-D, were analysed, three of which were locally processed using the traditional methods while the fourth was processed mechanically. Although the techniques investigated are prevalent in Oshimill Local Government Area of Bendel State, they are also practised elsewhere in Nigeria. The mechanically-processed palm oil (sample A) had the lowest ffa content of 4.90% followed by 7.04, 9.98 and 12.24%, respectively for samples C, D and B. The peroxide values ranged from 2.70 meq kg-1 in sample B to 7.40 meq kg-1 in sample C. The mechanically, extracted oil had the highest residual moisture of 2.96% while sample D had the lowest value of 0.43%. Generally, the impurity levels were highest in the traditionally processed oils. Distinct variabilities were observed with respect to all the parameters estimated, due to differences in the processing methods. Some measures, which include sterilization of fruits soon after harvest and the use of more efficient filtering methods, are suggested to enhance the quality of the traditionally processed oils. 3apalm oils 3aextraction 3aNigeria 0aprocessing technology 0amechanical methods1 aIkhena, G.A.1 aEghareuba, V.0 tFood chemistry.g1990, v. 36, no. 4 p.311-317x0308-81467nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01897naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245003000125300001600155500002300171500001500194520101200209650001301221650001801234650002001252650001801272650001501290650002001305650001101325653002001336653001301356653002301369653001701392773007301409852000901482939003301491946001101524655001201535IND9303289620221116155811.0930528e199303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930328962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaas, E.V.10aSalinity and citriculture  ap. 195-216.  aLiterature review.  a2019-12-04  aSoil salinity significantly limits citrus production in many areas worldwide. Although data on fruit yields in response to salinity are limited, they indicate that grapefruit, lemons, and oranges are among the most sensitive of all agricultural crops. Fruit yields decrease about 13% for each 1.0 dS m-1 increase in electrical conductivity of the saturated-soil extract (EC(e)) once soil salinity exceeds a threshold EC(e) of 1.4 dS m-1. Accumulation of excess Cl- and Na+ can cause specific ion toxicities, but this problem can be minimized by selecting rootstocks that restrict the uptake of these ions. During the past two decades, numerous papers describing the agronomic and physiological responses of citrus to salinity have been published. This paper reviews these research reports and discusses differences in the response of citrus species to salt stress, the role of different rootstocks, the causes of salt injury, and the interactions of other environmental conditions or stresses with salinity. 3asalinity 3aphytotoxicity 3astress response 3aion transport 3acrop yield 3asodium chloride 3aCitrus 0acrop production 0ainjuries 0aliterature reviews 0ayield losses0 tTree physiology.g1993 Mar., v. 12, no. 2 p.195-216x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02589naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001700137245012600154300001800280520140300298650001701701650001301718650001601731650001601747650001401763650001601777650001101793650001401804650001401818650002401832650001801856700001801874700002001892700001901912773010301931852000902034856007702043930003302120945001302153946001302166655001202179IND2163669220221116155917.0980827e199710  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216366922DNAL7 a10.1021/jf97029592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoleas, G.J.10aRelative contributions of polyphenolic constituents to the antioxidant status of wines: development of a predictive model  ap. 3995-4003.  aThe concentrations of 17 phenolic constituents in red wine were analyzed by a number of multiple regression models for their contribution to total antioxidant status (TAS). The best model discovered involved a stepwise selection process starting by calculating Mallow's C(p) for each of the 17 subsequent individual models resulting from dropping a single term at a time. The model with the lowest Mallow's C(p) and in which no single step reduced Mallow's C(p) further was chosen as the new model. This model gave excellent correlation between observed and predicted values of TAS. Further analysis of this model with the addition of a nonlinear term, using the 8 predictors discovered from the stepwise selection model, increased the correlation coefficient to 0.961 from 0.930. The equation of this model can predict almost 100% of the TAS by the content of vanillic acid, trans-polydatin, catechin, m-coumaric acid, epicatechin, quercetin, cis-polydatin, and trans-resveratrol with a very high degree of confidence. Although syringic and gallic acids were significantly correlated with TAS in a univariate analysis, they do not contribute to a statistical description of this parameter to the extent of the eight constituents already identified. The remaining constituents do not seem to contribute significantly to TAS, nor do they show significant correlation with TAS on univariate analysis. 3aantioxidants 3acatechin 3acorrelation 3aepicatechin 3aequations 3agallic acid 3amodels 3aquercetin 3ared wines 3aregression analysis 3avanillic acid1 aTomlinson, G.1 aDiamandis, E.P.1 aDoldberg, D.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.3995-4003x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf97029593Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02170naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001100137245006900148300001800217520103600235650001001271650001601281650001001297650004301307650001201350650001801362650002201380650001401402650000901416700001601425700001601441700001601457700002101473700001801494773010301512852000901615856007701624930003301701945001301734946001301747655001201760IND2163672420221116155329.0980827e199710  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216367242DNAL7 a10.1021/jf97016502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, M.10aPolyurethane rigid foam derived from reduced sweet whey permeate  ap. 4156-4161.  aLow-pressure propoxylation of reduced whey permeate (RWP) with different water contents (12.7 and 33.4%) under alkaline conditions afforded polyether polyols (PEP) which have been characterized by their 1H-NMR, HPLC, hydroxyl number, viscosity, unsaturation content, and alpha color.

Tellina lutea, Mactromeris polynyma, Serripes groenlandicus, Macoma spp., Liocyma fluctuosum, and Siliqua alta occurred most often in the samples. The assessment of growth in 18 bivalve species revealed common patterns of age variations that were irrespective of their way of life, maximum body size, and maximum age. The greatest annual increment in shell length was observed in the first 4 years of life, and the asymptotic size of the mollusks was reached with a 10-fold decrease in the annual growth rate. The life span of the mollusks varied from 2 up to 41 years and sometimes significantly differed from that of the studied species in other areas of their range, clearly displaying the ecological conditionality of this parameter. Species with maximum ages of less than 10 years were the most numerous in the bivalve community of the region. The results of the research are discussed in relation to the nature of the environment at the northeast coast of Sakhalin Island. 3aBivalvia 3alongevity 0alinear growth 0aspecies and age structure of fauna 0aSea of Okhotsk0 tRussian journal of marine biology.g2010 July, v. 36, no. 4 p.258-269dDordrecht : SP MAIK Nauka/Interperiodicax1063-07407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10630740100400483Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02236naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001600137245008900153300001800242520072400260650002900984650002501013650002301038650002001061650002201081650002501103650001801128650002201146650001501168650001201183650001201195650001001207650001601217650001401233650001701247650002101264650001001285650002101295650001201316700001901328700002101347700001601368700002201384700001901406700002101425773010301446852000901549856007701558930003301635945001301668946001301681655001201694IND2163671520221116155345.0980827e199710  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216367152DNAL7 a10.1021/jf960942g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, V.M.10aVicilin storage proteins from Vigna unguiculata (legume) seeds inhibit fungal growth  ap. 4110-4115.  aVicilin storage proteins (7S globulins) isolated from Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) seeds were shown to interfere with the germination of spores or conidia of the fungi Fusarium solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum musae, Phytophthora capsici, Neurospora crassa, and Ustilago maydis sporidia.

The molecular mass of SaMDH is about 35 kDa determined by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant SaMDH has a maximum activity at pH 8.0. The enzyme shows the optimal temperature around 42°C and displays a half-life (t ₁/₂) of 160 min at 50°C which is more thermostable than reported MDHs from most bacteria and fungi. The k cat value of SaMDH is about 240-fold of that for malate oxidation. In addition, the k cat/K m ratio shows that SaMDH has about 1,246-fold preference for oxaloacetate (OAA) reduction over l-malate oxidation. The recombinant SaMDH may also use NADPH as a cofactor although it is a highly NAD(H)-specific enzyme. There was no activity detected when malate and NADP⁺ were used as substrates. Substrate inhibition studies show that SaMDH activity is strongly inhibited by excess OAA with NADH, but is not sensitive to excess l-malate. Enzymatic activity is enhanced by the addition of Na⁺, NH₄ ⁺, Ca²⁺, Cu²⁺ and Mg²⁺ and inhibited by addition of Hg²⁺ and Zn²⁺. MDH is widely used in coenzyme regeneration, antigen immunoassays and bioreactors. The enzymatic analysis could provide the important basic knowledge for its utilizations. 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aStreptomyces avermitilis 3aammonium compounds 3aantigens 3abacteria 3abioreactors 3acalcium 3acopper 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3ahalf life 3aimmunoassays 3amagnesium 3amalate dehydrogenase 3amalates 3amercury 3amolecular weight 3aoxidation 3apH 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprokaryotic cells 3asodium 3atemperature 3athermal stability 3azinc 0aStreptomyces avermitilis MA-4680 0aEnzymatic characterization 0aCoenzyme specificity1 aWang, Bao-Juan 1 aGe, Ya-Dong 1 aPan, Wei 1 aWang, Jie 1 aXu, Lei 1 aLiu, Aimin.1 aZhu, Guo-Ping 0 tMolecular biology reports.g2011 Mar., v. 38, no. 3 p.1629-1636dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-010-0273-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20110205b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02427naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001500137245008100152300001800233520139700251650002401648650001401672650001501686650003201701650001301733650002101746650000901767650001001776650001501786700001601801773010301817852000901920856007701929930003302006945001302039946001302052655001202065IND2163664320221116155615.0980827e199710  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216366432DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970107e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLandry, J.10aTryptophan contents of pea and broad seeds as a function of nitrogen content  ap. 3855-3858.  aThe tryptophan contents of pea and broad bean seeds were determined for samples originating from commercial and experimental cultivars, using a procedure that ensured the true quantity of this amino acid to be evaluated. For both species a relationship was found indicating a strict proportionality between the levels of tryptophan (Trp) and nitrogen (N) of the seed. The values available in the literature for tryptophan (159 for pea and 53 for broad bean) were compared with those predicted from the nitrogen of samples through the relationship between Trp and N. They ranged from 68 to 153% with a weighted mean of 100% for pea and from 98 to 114% with a mean of 101% for broad bean when they were expressed as percentage of predicted value. The lowest percentages were related to underestimation owing to degradation of tryptophan by alkali or its incomplete release by enzyme during hydrolysis preparatory to analysis, and the highest to overestimation attributed to lysinoalanine generated during alkaline hydrolysis and coeluted with tryptophan when ion exchange chromatography is used for analysis. Some linear relationships previously reported appeared to be close from those determined in the present study, suggesting the absence of tryptophan degradation with some hydrolytic conditions and limited influence of genetic factors upon tryptophan content of pea and broad bean seeds. 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3acultivars 3afaba beans 3aion exchange chromatography 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apeas 3aseeds 3atryptophan1 aDelhaye, S.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.3855-3858x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970107e3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02289naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110100002000119245005700139300001500196500002400211520100900235650001001244650001401254650001601268650002501284650002701309650001901336650001701355650001501372650000701387650001301394650002001407651001201427653001001439653001301449653001801462700001901480700001401499700001501513700001601528773009601544852000901640856008901649930003301738945002501771946001101796655001201807IND4402730820221116155621.0080313e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440273082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aKilmartin, P.A.10aPolyphenol content and browning of Canadian icewines  ap. 52-257.  aIncludes references  aThe polyphenol composition of a range of Ontario icewines and late harvest wines was quantified. For 1999-2000 experimental wines, the FAUX icewines (harvested above -8°C and before 18 December) had high concentrations of hydroxycinnamates (10 to 37 mg/L in Riesling; 53 to 82 mg/ L in Vidal) which dropped to concentrations below 10 mg/L for the REAL icewines (harvested at temperatures -8°C or below and after 28 December). However, in 2002 experimental icewines, high concentrations of hydroxycinnamates were seen in both REAL and FAUX wines (40 to 84 mg/L in Riesling; 106 to 129 mg/L in Vidal), but all of the grapes were harvested before 11 December. Low to moderate concentrations of total hydroxycinnamates were observed in commercial icewines (10 to 40 mg/L) and late harvest wines (5 to 60 mg/L). Freeze concentration during icewine making appears to have substantial impact upon polyphenol composition and concentration, but time of harvest and growing season appear to be equally important. 3awines 3aoxidation 3apolyphenols 3achemical composition 3achemical concentration 3acoumaric acids 3aharvest date 3aabsorbance 3apH 3afreezing 3aair temperature 3aOntario 0aVidal 0aRiesling 0aharvest wines1 aReynolds, A.G.1 aPagay, V.1 aNurgel, C.1 aJohnson, R.0 tJournal of food, agriculture & environment.g2007 , v. 5, no. 3-4 p.52-257x1459-02557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.world-food.net/scientificjournal.php3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080428b20080502c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/04/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02941naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245012800185300001600313520121900329650001401548650001901562650001401581650002601595650002201621650001201643650001001655650002701665650001401692650002001706650001101726650001201737650001801749650001101767650001401778650002201792650002501814650001401839650002201853650000901875650002701884650002001911650001301931650002701944651001401971651002001985653002502005653001402030653002202044700001402066773011402080852000902194856009202203930003302295946001102328655001202339IND4432893820221116155605.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443289382DNAL7 a201490872pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04539.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubey, S.10aRestricted dispersal and genetic diversity in populations of an endangered montane lizard (Eulamprus leuraensis, Scincidae)  ap. 886-897.  aMany alpine species are under threat from global climate change, as their geographic ranges become increasingly fragmented and unsuitable. Understanding rates and determinants of gene flow among such fragmented populations, over historical as well as recent timescales, can help to identify populations under threat. It is also important to clarify the degree to which loss of local populations reduces overall genetic diversity within the taxon. The endangered Blue Mountains Water Skink (Eulamprus leuraensis) is restricted to <40 small swamps in montane south-eastern Australia. Our analyses of seven microsatellite loci of 241 animals from 13 populations show strong geographic structure, with major genetic divergence even between populations separated by <0.5 km. Dispersal between populations is scarce, and appears to involve mostly males. Our analyses suggest potential recent bottleneck events in all the identified populations, and lower genetic diversity and population size parameter at lower-elevation sites than at higher-elevation sites. Management of this endangered taxon thus needs to treat most populations separately, because of their genetic distinctiveness and low rates of genetic exchange. 3aScincidae 3aclimate change 3agene flow 3agenetic recombination 3agenetic variation 3alizards 3amales 3amicrosatellite repeats 3amountains 3apopulation size 3aswamps 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aFemale 2aGene Flow 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aLizardsxgenetics 2aMale 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutation 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 3aAustralia 0aSouth Australia 0aaltitudinal gradient 0adispersal 0aspatial structure1 aShine, R.0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 19, no. 5 p.886-897dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04539.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20120107b20120203c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03779naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245012700188300001600315500001500331520171300346650000902059650002202068650001502090650001002105650002502115650001902140650001802159650001502177650001202192650001102204650002402215650002102239650001302260650001402273650001102287650001202298650002002310650001502330650001502345650002002360650001202380650002102392650004502413650001302458650001902471650004302490650003902533650002002572650003002592650001402622651001102636651001102647653004302658653002302701653002702724700002102751700003502772700001902807773010502826852000902931856008502940930003303025946001103058655001203069IND4437815620221116155609.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443781562DNAL7 a199212842pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-009-0284-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarliński, Leszek 10aRelationship between genotype and soil environment during colonization of poplar roots by mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi  ap. 315-324.  a2019-12-04  aPoplars are among the few tree genera that can develop both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular (AM) associations; however, variable ratios of ECM/AM in dual mycorrhizal colonizations were observed in the roots of a variety of poplar species and hybrids. The objective of our study was to analyze the effect of internal and external factors on growth and dual AM and ECM colonization of poplar roots in three 12-15-year-old common gardens in Poland. We also analyzed the abundance of nonmycorrhizal fungal endophytes in the poplar roots. The Populus clones comprised black poplars (Populus deltoides and P. deltoides × Populus nigra), balsam poplars (Populus maximowiczii × Populus trichocarpa), and a hybrid of black and balsam poplars (P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa). Of the three sites that we studied, one was located in the vicinity of a copper smelter, where soil was contaminated with copper and lead. Poplar root tip abundance, mycorrhizal colonization, and soil fungi biomass were lower at this heavily polluted site. The total mycorrhizal colonization and the ratio of ECM and AM colonization differed among the study sites and according to soil depth. The influence of Populus genotype was significantly pronounced only within the individual study sites. The contribution of nonmycorrhizal fungal endophytes differed among the poplar clones and was higher at the polluted site than at the sites free of pollution. Our results indicate that poplar fine root abundance and AM and ECM symbiosis are influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies of different site conditions are required to characterize the utility of poplars for purposes such as the phytoremediation of polluted sites. 3alead 3aPopulus deltoides 3asoil depth 3atrees 3aPopulus maximowiczii 3apolluted soils 3aPopulus nigra 3aendophytes 3ahybrids 3aclones 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aphytoremediation 3agenotype 3apollution 3acopper 3abiomass 3aectomycorrhizae 3asoil fungi 3afine roots 3aedaphic factors 2aBiomass 2aCopperxanalysis 2aFungixgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aGenotype 2aLeadxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPopulusxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aSymbiosis 3aPoland 0aPoland 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa 0aDepth distribution 0aFine-root colonization1 aRudawska, Maria 1 aKieliszewska-Rokicka, Barbara 1 aLeski, Tomasz 0 tMycorrhiza.g2010 June, v. 20, no. 5 p.315-324dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-009-0284-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03330naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245012800167300001800295520177400313650001502087650002102102650001602123650003102139650001402170650001802184650002402202650001102226650002602237650000702263650002102270650001402291650001402305650001302319653002402332653005102356653005602407653003002463653002002493653002702513700003102540700003602571773013602607852000902743856008502752946001102837655001202848IND4439501420221116155602.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443950142DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-010-3624-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsopelas, Fotios 10aBiomimetic chromatographic analysis of selenium species: Application for the estimation of their pharmacokinetic properties  ap. 2171-2180.  aThe retention behavior of selenites, selenates, seleno-dl-methionine, selenocystine, selenocystamine, selenourea, dimethyl selenide, and dimethyl diselenide was investigated by means of biomimetic liquid chromatography. For this purpose, two immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) columns, namely, IAM.PC.DD2 and IAM.PC.MG, and two immobilized plasma protein columns, human serum albumin (HSA) and α₁-acid glycoprotein (AGP) columns, were employed using different mobile phase conditions in respect to pH and buffer composition. In general, satisfactory interrelations between retention factors obtained with the two IAM stationary phases and HSA/AGP columns were obtained. Large differences were observed between biomimetic retention factors and octanol-water logD values, since the latter fail to describe electrostatic interactions. In contrast, despite the column diversity, the net retention outcome on all four biomimetic columns was quite similar, especially in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline, which by its effective shielding alleviates the differences between the stationary phases. Of the two IAM columns, IAM.PC.DD2 showed better performance when compared with HSA and AGP columns as well as to octanol-water partitioning. Biomimetic chromatographic indices were further used to estimate the percentage of human oral absorption and plasma protein binding of the eight selenium species investigated, according to equations previously reported in the literature. The estimated values of human oral absorption imply moderate absorption only for dimethyl diselenide, which also may exhibit considerable plasma protein binding. Moderate affinity for plasma proteins should also be expected for dimethyl selenide and selenocystamine.

Identified methylation sites are predominantly restricted to the coding sequence of genes at CpG sites. We identify twelve methylated genes, including genes that interact with juvenile hormone, a key endocrine signal in insects.

The generally accepted principle of the disease is that the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP(c)) into the disease associated isoform PrP(Sc) leads to spongiform degeneration of the brain and amyloid plaque formation. Until now no therapy leading to potential alleviation or even cure of the disease exists. It is therefore important to develop therapeutic approaches for the treatment of TSEs since these infections are inevitably fatal and, especially in the case of vCJD, they affect youngsters. Besides current conventional therapeutic strategies, this review summarizes new therapeutic tools targeting the prion receptor LRP/LR. 3ahuman diseases 3aprotein synthesis 3aantisense RNA 3apolysaccharides 3adisease prevention 3aantibodies 3atherapeutics 3aPrPSc proteins 3aprotein synthesis inhibitors 3amutants 3aprion diseases 3alaminin 3areceptors 3aanimal diseases 0apolysulphated glycans 0aliterature reviews 0adisease control 0aRNA1 aLudewigs, H.1 aWeiss, S.0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2007 Aug. 31, v. 123, no. 4 p.387-393dElsevierx0378-11357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.04.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20120928b20121009c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/01/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02689naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001900166245008400185300001600269500002400285500001500309520111800324650002801442650002401470650002201494650001601516650001001532650001701542650001401559650001501573650001901588650002001607650002701627650002001654650002201674650001701696650001401713650002001727650002501747653002401772653002801796653002301824700001901847773011501866852000901981856008801990930003302078945002502111946001102136655001202147IND4397539120221116155359.0071105e20071015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439753912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.05.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL8321 aLawrence, P.K.10aCD11b of Ovis canadensis and Ovis aries: Molecular cloning and characterization  ap. 287-298.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aLeukotoxin (Lkt) is the primary virulence factor secreted by Mannheimia haemolytica which causes pneumonia in ruminants. Previously, we have shown that CD18, the β subunit of β(2) integrins, mediates Lkt-induced cytolysis of ruminant leukocytes. CD18 associates with four distinct α subunits giving rise to four β(2) integrins, CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), CD11c/CD18 (CR4), and CD11d/CD18. It is not known whether all the β(2) integrins serve as a receptor for Lkt. Since PMNs are the leukocyte subset that is most susceptible to Lkt, and Mac-1 expression on PMNs exceeds that of other β2 integrins, it is of interest to determine whether Mac-1 serves as a receptor for Lkt which necessitates the cloning of CD11b and CD18. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the cDNA encoding CD11b of Ovis canadensis (bighorn sheep) and Ovis aries (domestic sheep). CD11b cDNA is 3455 nucleotides long encoding a polypeptide of 1152 amino acids. CD11b polypeptides from these two species exhibit 99% identity with each other, and 92% with that of cattle, and 70-80% with that of the non-ruminants analyzed. 3ainterspecific variation 3abacterial pneumonia 3acomplementary DNA 3aleukotoxins 3asheep 3acytotoxicity 3areceptors 3aleukocytes 3asheep diseases 3agene expression 3aMannheimia haemolytica 3aimmune response 3amolecular cloning 3apathogenesis 3aintegrins 3aOvis canadensis 3anucleotide sequences 0aspecies differences 0amolecular sequence data 0amolecular genetics1 aSrikumaran, S.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Oct. 15, v. 119, no. 3-4 p.287-298dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.05.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02248naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245018000170300001400350520121900364653002301583653001501606653001501621653001401636653001301650700002001663700002501683773008801708852000901796856008501805930003301890946001101923655001201934IND4430118720221116155730.0091218e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443011872DNAL7 a10.1007/s10329-009-0159-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeca, Jean-Baptiste 14aThe first case of dental flossing by a Japanese macaque (Macaca fuscata): implications for the determinants of behavioral innovation and the constraints on social transmission  ap. 13-22.  aWe report the first case of dental flossing behavior by a Japanese macaque. We used cross-sectional data to assess the presence of this novel tool-use behavior at the group-level. Although this behavior was performed frequently by a central middle-ranking middle-aged female during her grooming interactions, and appeared at least four years ago, it remained idiosyncratic to its innovator, and until now has not spread to other group members. We examined the factors that may have favored this innovation, including the environmental context, the individual characteristics of the innovator, and the structural and functional aspects of the behavior. Group size, kinship, and dominance are socio-demographic factors that are likely to limit the opportunities for any group member to observe the innovator, and thus constrain the diffusion of this potential candidate as a new behavioral tradition. This is one of the rare studies to document the spontaneous appearance of tool-use behavior in primates under natural conditions. Identifying the determinants of innovations and the constraints on their diffusion within social groups of non-human primates is of special interest to understanding cultural evolution. 0aBehavioral variant 0aConstraint 0aInnovation 0aTradition 0aTool-use1 aGunst, Noëlle 1 aHuffman, Michael A. 0 tPrimates.g2010 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.13-22dJapan : Springer Japanx0032-83327nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10329-009-0159-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20091218b20100101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03022naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001900157245019600176300001600372500002400388500001500412520128700427650002201714650001201736650001901748650001401767650002901781650001501810650001701825650001001842650001601852650002001868650001701888650001401905650002501919653003401944653002001978653002001998653003002018653002202048653001802070653001802088700001702106700001702123700001902140700001602159773011502175852000902290856008802299930003302387945002502420946001102445655001202456IND4397539320221116155831.0071105e20071015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439753932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8001 aClapperton, M.14aThe association between plasma levels of acute phase proteins, haptoglobin, alpha-(1) acid glycoprotein (AGP), Pig-MAP, transthyretin and serum amyloid A (SAA) in Large White and Meishan pigs  ap. 303-309.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDuring infection, the acute phase response triggers the release of acute phase proteins (APP), alpha-(1) acid glycoprotein (AGP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and Pig-MAP into the circulation, accompanied by a decrease in plasma levels of transthyretin. We quantified the association between these APP in 26 apparently healthy pigs from two breeds, 13 Large White and 13 Meishan (16 male; 10 female). There was a significant correlation between plasma levels of haptoglobin and Pig-MAP (r = 0.57; p < 0.05), but no significant associations between any of the other APP tested. We also measured the relationship between PigMAP, transthyretin and SAA, and the proportions of peripheral blood mononuclear sub-sets, CD8(+) cells, CD4(+) cells, CD11R1(+) cells, MHC DQ(+) cells, and monocytes. There were correlations between both plasma levels of Pig-MAP and the proportion of monocytes (r = 0.55; p < 0.05) and plasma levels of transthyretin and the proportion of MHC DQ+ cells (r = 0.40; p < 0.01). Breed and sex influenced plasma levels of Pig-MAP but not plasma levels of transthyretin. Overall, these results suggest closer links between the mechanisms that regulate the release haptoglobin, Pig-MAP and monocytes compared to those that regulate the release of AGP, SAA and transthyretin. 3abreed differences 3aMeishan 3aimmunogenetics 3amonocytes 3aphysiological regulation 3aprealbumin 3ainflammation 3aswine 3aLarge White 3aimmune response 3ahaptoglobins 3ainfection 3aacute phase proteins 0apig major acute phase protein 0ablood chemistry 0aserum amyloid A 0aalpha-1 acid glycoprotein 0aanimal physiology 0aimmune system 0aglycoproteins1 aBishop, S.C.1 aPiñeiro, M.1 aCampbell, F.M.1 aGlass, E.J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Oct. 15, v. 119, no. 3-4 p.303-309dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.05.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/01/13  aNon-US 7aarticle02970naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012800186300001800314520146300332650002901795650001701824650001201841650001101853650001401864650001501878650002401893650001201917650003001929650005101959650005102010650002802061650001402089650003202103650004502135650002302180653002902203700002302232773011902255852000902374856008502383930003302468946001102501655001202512IND4439750820221116155320.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443975082DNAL7 a197798462pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-009-9839-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedberg, Felix 10aSingle and multiple CH (calponin homology) domain containing multidomain proteins in Dictyostelium discoideum: an inventory  ap. 2853-2862.  aWe present an inventory of single or multiple calponin homology (CH) domain containing proteins of Dictyostelium discoideum. A multiple alignment and a phylogenetic tree of all 60 CH domains found in 36 proteins showed that most CH domains can be assigned to one of 6 types. We have then distributed the proteins into several classes according to the type and arrangement of the CH domains. Most proteins belong to the class of ABD (actin-binding domain)-forming CH tandems (CH1-CH2) of the α-actinin and fimbrin families or to the class of CH3 domain-bearing proteins. There are a few examples of proteins with a single CH1 or CH2 domain, one with a CH1-CH1 doublet and a single representative of the CHe class of microtubule-binding proteins. A comparison with CH domain proteins in Homo sapiens suggests that while the individual domains are available in both species, the existence of identical multidomain proteins in toto is rare. Fimbrin 1, α-actinin and EB1 appear as perfect orthologs in both species, whereas filamin and interaptin may represent ancestral forms of human filamin and nesprins. In four more cases (NAV/Unc-53-, smoothelin-, transgelin- and Gas2-related proteins) functional data are needed in order to establish a potential relationship with a human counterpart. Although extensive data exist for a few of the D. discoideum CH proteins, most remain to be characterized and our analysis may help predicting some of their properties. 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3aHomo sapiens 3afilamin 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3aprediction 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aDictyosteliumxmetabolism 2aMembrane Glycoproteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMicrofilament Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aProtein Structure, Tertiary 2aProtozoan Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSequence Alignment 0aCalponin homology domain1 aRivero, Francisco 0 tMolecular biology reports.g2010 July, v. 37, no. 6 p.2853-2862dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-009-9839-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20100709b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02630naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245012200181300001800303520154300321653002601864653003901890653003301929653001601962700003001978700002702008700002402035773011202059852000902171856009202180930003302272946001102305655001202316IND4436921620221116155303.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443692162DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01136.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSCHOMACKER, EDWIN ROBERT10aRecognition and significance of sharp-based mouth-bar deposits in the Eocene Green River Formation, Uinta Basin, Utah  ap. 1069-1087.  aSandstone bodies in the Sunnyside Delta Interval of the Eocene Green River Formation, Uinta Basin, previously considered as point bars formed in meandering rivers and other types of fluvial bars, are herein interpreted as delta mouth-bar deposits. The sandstone bodies have been examined in a 2300 m long cliff section along the Argyle and Nine Mile Canyons at the southern margin of the Uinta lake basin. The sandstone bodies occur in three stratigraphic intervals, separated by lacustrine mudstone and limestone. Together these stratigraphic intervals form a regressive-transgressive sequence. Individual sandstone bodies are texturally sharp-based towards mudstone substratum. In proximal parts, the mouth-bar deposits only contain sandstone, whereas in frontal and lateral positions mudstone drapes separate mouth-bar clinothems. The clinothems pass gradually into greenish-grey lacustrine mudstone at their toes. Horizontally bedded or laminated lacustrine mudstone onlaps the convex-upward sandstone bars. The mouth-bar deposits are connected to terminal distributary channel deposits. Together, these mouth-bar/channel sandstone bodies accumulated from unidirectional jet flow during three stages of delta advance, separated by lacustrine flooding intervals. Key criteria to distinguish the mouth-bar deposits from fluvial point bar deposits are: (i) geometry; (ii) bounding contacts; (iii) internal structure; (iv) palaeocurrent orientations; and (v) the genetic association of the deposits with lacustrine mudstone and limestone. 0aGreen River Formation 0aregressive-transgressive sequences 0asharp-based river mouth-bars 0aUinta Basin1 aKJEMPERUD, AUDUN VESTHEIM1 aNystuen, Johan Petter.1 aJAHREN, JENS SIGURD0 tSedimentology.g2010 June, v. 57, no. 4 p.1069-1087dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0037-07467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.2009.01136.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02727naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001700205245011400222300001800336500036000354500002400714520077600738650001801514650002101532650003101553650002001584650001301604650001501617650001601632650002101648650003101669650001301700650002701713650001001740650001201750650001101762650001101773650002001784650000901804651001201813651001201825653002301837700001201860773010901872852000901981856009001990930003302080945002502113946001102138655001202149IND4397080920221116155321.0071026e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439708092DNAL7 a172766742pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aW000 0aS100 0aJ1001 aLarney, F.J.12aA review of composting as a management alternative for beef cattle feedlot manure in southern Alberta, Canada  ap. 3221-3227.  aIn the special issue: Sustainable organic waste management for environmental protection and food safety / edited by M.

Research on windrow composting of feedlot manure was initiated at the Lethbridge Research Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in 1996. Early studies looked at physical and chemical changes during composting. Studies have also been conducted on greenhouse gas emissions during composting and the effect of composting on reduction of pathogens, parasites and weed seed viability. The quality of commercially-produced composts at southern Alberta feedlots has been examined as has the mineralization rates of soil-applied composts. This paper reviews results from our feedlot manure composting research program. 3acattle manure 3acomposted manure 3aphysicochemical properties 3acompost quality 3afeedlots 3acomposting 3abeef cattle 3agreenhouse gases 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aProtozoa 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3aweeds 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aManure 2aRefuse Disposal 2aSoil 3aAlberta 0aAlberta 0aliterature reviews1 aHao, X.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Dec., v. 98, no. 17 p.3221-3227dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080129b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03691naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001200196245015300208300001800361500036000379500002400739520180100763650001502564650001302579650002602592650001502618650002002633650001202653650001102665650002402676650003702700650002002737650003102757650001002788650003502798650004202833700001602875700001702891773010902908852000903017856009003026930003303116945002503149946001103174655001203185IND4397081120221116155406.0071026e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439708112DNAL7 a169309962pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS100 0aJ500 0aW0001 aPeu, P.10aLong term fate of slurry derived nitrogen in soil: A case study with a macro-lysimeter experiment having received high loads of pig slurry (Solepur)  ap. 3228-3234.  aIn the special issue: Sustainable organic waste management for environmental protection and food safety / edited by M.

For sustainable agriculture there is fear, however, that this practice may have detrimental effects, particularly on the depletion of Soil Organic Matter associated with pig slurry applications. We investigated the long-term fate of nitrogen in a reconstituted soil having received high doses of pig slurry during 5 years (1991-1995). After 5 years of intensive application rates (nearly 1000 m3 yr-1), the N and C content of the soil profile (0-20 cm) had increased by about 60% and 50%, respectively. These results confirm previous findings although it seems that the particularly high rates of application may explain, in part, the relatively important N incorporation in soil. Pig slurry applications ceased in 1995 and nitrogen content in soil and drainage water have been monitored. Apparent mineralization rates were calculated from the decrease in N content of the soil. This analysis indicated that more than 50% of the added N stored in the soil at the end of the applications would eventually be mineralized, leaving nearly 50% of the stored N to be immobilized in the soil. These results are the first published of their kinds, as most reports never examine the fate of applied pig slurry N after halting applications. In addition the few reports on long-term experiments suggest that Soil Organic Matter following pig slurry applications may be unstable. Our analysis tends to show the contrary. However, this conclusion must be tempered because data on nitrate leachate patterns suggest that soil management such as ploughing and sowing may actually trigger mineralization that could eventually deplete nitrogen stored following applications. 3apig manure 3anitrogen 3asoil nutrient balance 3alysimeters 3asoil amendments 2aAnimals 2aManure 2aNitratesxchemistry 2aNitrogenxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxchemistry 2aSwine 2aWaste Disposal, Fluidxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry1 aBirgand, F.1 aMartinez, J.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Dec., v. 98, no. 17 p.3228-3234dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080129b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03171naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002200150245015700172300001600329520139400345650002401739650002101763650001801784650002801802650002601830650001401856650001601870650001501886650001601901650001901917650002101936650002101957650001801978650001901996650001302015650001602028650002002044650001302064650000902077650002502086650001402111650003202125700002402157700002102181700002102202700002102223700002002244773009702264852000902361856009002370856009902460939003302559946001302592655001202605IND4462822620221116155752.0120228s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446282262DNAL7 a10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i5.202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaiti, Swatilekha10aAntitumor Effect of Culinary-Medicinal Oyster Mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus (Jacq.: Fr.)

In the present study, we investigated the in vivo antitumor potential of CBAEP in different tumor-bearing mice models and studied the detailed mechanism of tumor regression in Dalton lymphoma (DL)-bearing mice. The lethal dose (LD50) of CBAEP was found to be 55 mg/kg body weight and sublethal doses (5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight) showed a prolonged tumor survival time in DL, Sarcoma-180, and B16F0 melanoma tumor-bearing mice. Further, CBAEP reduced about 35.68 and 51.43% DL cell growth in 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight, respectively. The in vivo CBAEP treatment showed an apoptotic feature as demonstrated in morphological study and sub-G0/G1 population in cell cycle and Western blot of DL cells. CBAEP also activated immunosuppression condition in DL tumor-bearing host. It also stimulated immune cells in the presence of nonspecific immunostunulator (LPS and ConA) ex vivo as well as enhanced Th1 response with production of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IL-2. Moreover, it activated tumor-associated macrophages and NK cells. The present findings revealed the potent antitumor property of CBAEP, which might help in developing a new anticancer drug. 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal models 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aapoptosis 3abody weight 3acell cycle 3acell growth 3aconcanavalin A 3aimmunomodulation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-2 3alethal dose 50 3alymphoma 3amacrophages 3amedicinal fungi 3amelanoma 3amice 3anatural killer cells 3aremission 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aMallick, Sanjaya K.1 aBhutia, Sujit K.1 aBehera, Birendra1 aMandal, Mohitosh1 aMaiti, Tapas K.0 tInternational journal of medicinal mushrooms.g2011, v. 13, no. 5 p.427-440x1521-94377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i5.203Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.begellhouse.com/journals/708ae68d64b17c52.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20120228  aOther US 7aarticle02932naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001900196245007600215300001800291500036000309500002400669500001500693520105700708650001901765650002201784650002001806650002001826650001901846650002601865650001501891650004001906650002401946650002901970650000901999650002202008653002402030700001302054700001502067700002702082700001602109773010902125852000902234856009002243930003302333945002502366946001102391655001202402IND4397082820140724000000.0071026e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439708282DNAL7 a169498162pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX100 0aJ500 0aJ1001 aSole-Mauri, F.13aAn integrated biochemical and physical model for the composting process  ap. 3278-3293.  aIn the special issue: Sustainable organic waste management for environmental protection and food safety / edited by M.

Heat and mass transfer between the three phases of the system have been taken into account. The gas phase was considered to be composed by nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ammonia and water vapour. Model computer simulations provided results that fitted satisfactory the experimental data. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the key parameters of the model. The partition of both the composting mass and the active biomass into different major groups of substrates and specialized microbial populations, as well as the factors affecting the gas-liquid equilibrium, were important for an accurate description of the composting process. 3adynamic models 3asimulation models 3aActinomycetales 3aphysical models 3abiodegradation 3athermophilic bacteria 3acomposting 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistry 2aModels, Theoretical 2aRefuse Disposalxmethods 2aSoil 2aSoil Microbiology 0amathematical models1 aIlla, J.1 aMagrí, A.1 aPrenafeta-Boldú, F.X.1 aFlotats, X.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Dec., v. 98, no. 17 p.3278-3293dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080129b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03010naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001800196245006400214300001800278500036000296500002400656520111500680650001501795650001101810650001001821650001501831650001901846650001701865650001501882650001601897650002701913650002301940650002001963650001201983650001601995650001102011650001602022650002102038650002302059650001302082650002202095651001002117651001002127700001802137773010902155852000902264856009002273930003302363945002502396946001102421655001202432IND4397083820221116155610.0071026e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439708382DNAL7 a169623242pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aM001 0aM1201 aSalazar, F.J.10aCharacterization of manures from fish cage farming in Chile  ap. 3322-3327.  aIn the special issue: Sustainable organic waste management for environmental protection and food safety / edited by M.

Sampling was carried out below salmon and trout cages in farms located in lakes and in the sea in the South of Chile during 2002-2003. Manure was analyzed for macronutrients, micronutrients and heavy metals. Results showed a high variability between samples and differences between sea and lake manure. Dry matter contents were low averaging c. 12-15%. Manures showed low OM contents with values <c. 15% and a neutral pH (c. 7.0). Both manures had low total N contents with values of <0.9%, more than 75% of which was in the organic form. Lake manure showed high contents of P (1.56%), Ca (3.89%), Fe (27,948 ppm), Mn (446 ppm), Al (31,789 ppm), As (5.13 ppm), Cd (1.04 ppm), Cr (18.8 ppm), Ni (12.3 ppm), Pb (3.5 ppm) and Zn (393 ppm). Sea manure had high contents of Mg (1.65% ppm), K (0.63%), Na (11.8%) and Cu (89 ppm). Salmonid manure had low nutrients and heavy metal contents and a potential use in agricultural soils, which could reduce the risks of water pollution on water from fish farming. 3afish farms 3asalmon 3atrout 3aSalmonidae 3aanimal manures 3afish culture 3afish cages 3amariculture 3afreshwater aquaculture 3aagricultural soils 3asoil amendments 2aAnimals 2aAquaculture 2aCattle 2aFresh Water 2aManurexanalysis 2aSalmonxphysiology 2aSeawater 2aTroutxphysiology 3aChile 0aChile1 aSaldana, R.C.0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Dec., v. 98, no. 17 p.3322-3327dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080129b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle03213naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001800205245010000223300001800323500036000341500002400701520119500725650001501920650002101935650001801956650001501974650001901989650000902008650001202017650003102029650001502060650001702075650001702092650002002109650001702129650001802146650005302164650002402217650002002241650001102261650005402272650000902326650002302335773010902358852000902467856009002476930003302566945002502599946001102624655001202635IND4397083620140724000000.0071026e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439708362DNAL7 a169309982pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aW000 0aL832 0aX3801 aVinnerås, B.10aComparison of composting, storage and urea treatment for sanitising of faecal matter and manure  ap. 3317-3321.  aIn the special issue: Sustainable organic waste management for environmental protection and food safety / edited by M.

By sanitising organic fertilisers derived from faeces and manure, the first step in the disease transmission chain is broken. Two alternatives for this treatment, thermophilic composting and ammonia-based treatment, were evaluated and compared to storage treatment. Thermal composting of faecal matter and food waste resulted in a treatment temperature of over 65 °C in a 90 L reactor. By using insulation and turning the compost three times during the high temperature period, it is possible to ensure a 5 log10 reduction of pathogens. Small scale composting of the same material indicated less efficient reduction of faecal bacteria at temperatures around 50 °C. In the chemical treatment tested, an addition of 3% N-NH3 increased the pH to above 9 within 1 h and resulted in a good reduction in the indicator organisms for bacteria (Salmonella spp. and faecal coliforms D(r) < 0.7 days, Enterococcus spp. D(r) < 3 days). Lower addition rates resulted in a longer treatment period needed. The storage period tested resulted in slow reduction of faecal coliforms, Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus spp. 3acomposting 3acomposted manure 3akitchen waste 3asanitation 3aheat treatment 3aurea 3aammonia 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aSalmonella 3aEnterococcus 3aarable soils 3asoil amendments 3ahuman health 3apublic health 2aEnterococcus faecalisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aHot Temperature 2aHumans 2aSalmonella typhimuriumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aSoil 2aUreaxpharmacology0 tBioresource technology.g2007 Dec., v. 98, no. 17 p.3317-3321dElsevier Applied Sciencex0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2006.07.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080129b20080202c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/01/29  aNon-US 7aarticle01779naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245009600172300001600268520075200284653001901036653002801055653001901083653002401102700002701126700003601153700002901189700002601218773011401244852000901358856008501367946001301452655001201465IND4447743520221116155849.0110121e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444774352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00044-009-9283-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhatia, Manish Sudesh 10aCombinatorial approach: identification of potential antifungals from triazole minilibraries  ap. 116-120.  aEmploying basic principles of solution phase combinatorial chemistry, a solution phase combinatorial synthesis and screening of mini libraries of 1,2,4-triazole derivatives has been carried out. 6 × 6 indexed mini libraries were synthesized comprising of 36 compounds.

These were analyzed by capillary GLC-MS and by packed-column GLC-batch infrared spectroscopy. An unusual major component identified was 2-carene (7 ppm of leaves). Additional evidence was also obtained for the presence of eight previously identified major terpene and sesquiterpene hydrocarbons including p-phellandrene (25 ppm), limonene (4 ppm), caryophyllene (3 ppm), and humulene (0.8 ppm). Evidence was also obtained for the identities of 2 other monoterpenes and 14 oxygenated components not previously reported. Blending of the leaves was found to give as much as 270 ppm of (E)-Zhexenal and 23 ppm of (n-3-hexenal. Determination of odor unit values for the volatile components indicated that the compounds contributing most to the leaf odor include (Z)-3-hexenal, limonene, hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, eugenol, 1,84neole, caryophyllene, 0-phellandrene, humulene, and linalool. 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aleaves 3avolatile compounds 3aaromatic compounds1 aLing, L.C.1 aLight, D.M.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1987 , v. 35, no. 6 p.1039-1042x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf00078a0433Available from publisher's Web site  a20081218b20090206c00000000  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02487naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133100001600151245014300167300001600310520119000326650002201516650001301538650002001551650002001571650002101591650001201612650001401624650001201638650001001650650001801660650001501678650001401693651001001707700001801717773009701735852000901832856009101841856009901932939003302031946001302064655001202077IND4462320820221116155900.0111117s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446232082DNAL7 a10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i4.1002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeena, S.A.10aPaddy straw as a substrate for the cultivation of Lingzhi or Reishi medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum (W.Curt.:Fr.)

More than 100 million tonnes of paddy straw is being produced in India per year, and almost 50% of the straw is potentially available for growing mushrooms. In the present study an attempt was made to use paddy straw as a substrate to cultivate G. lucidim. Different proportions of paddy straw were mixed with 0, 22.5%, 45%, and 67.5% sawdust and 10% rice bran. Spawn run period, fruiting initiation period, yield, moisture content, dry recovery, and fruiting body characteristics were recorded and compared. Fructification was observed with all the substrate formulations and they did not show any significant difference in yield. The highest biological efficiency (BE) (29.9%) was observed with the combination sawdust:paddy straw:rice bran 22.5:67.5:10, followed by saw dust:paddy straw:rice bran 45:45:10 with BE 27.3%. The current study demonstrated for the first time that the cultivation of G. lucidum is possible with paddy straw as the base substrate and indicated the enormous potential of paddy straw for the cultivation of G. lucidum. 3aGanoderma lucidum 3afruiting 3afruiting bodies 3amedicinal fungi 3amushroom growing 3apaddies 3arice bran 3asawdust 3astraw 3awater content 3awood chips 3awood logs 3aIndia1 aPandey, Meera0 tInternational journal of medicinal mushrooms.g2011, v. 13, no. 4 p.397-400x1521-94377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i4.1003Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.begellhouse.com/journals/708ae68d64b17c52.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111117  aOther US 7aarticle03067naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100002600150245018800176300001600364520137400380650002101754650002301775650001701798650001501815650001401830650001201844650002001856650002001876650001901896650002001915650001401935650001301949650002501962650002401987650001302011650001902024651000902043700002002052700002402072700002102096700002202117700001702139700002002156700002002176773009702196852000902293856009002302856009902392939003302491946001302524655001202537IND4462319420221116155853.0111117s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446231942DNAL7 a10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i4.102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaullier, Jean-Michel10aSupplementation with a soluble beta-glucan exported from Shiitake medicinal mushroom, Lentinus edodes (Berk.) Singer mycelium: a crossover, placebo-controlled study in healthy elderly  ap. 319-326.  aLentinus edodes (Shiitake) is a medicinal mushroom with a long tradition of use in Asia. The major active substance in L. edodes is a (1-6,1-3)-beta-glucan (lentinan). No clinical controlled studies have yet investigated the effect of orally administered lentinan on the immune response in healthy, elderly Caucasian subjects. We evaluated the effect and the safety of a beta-glucan from L. edodes mycelium, Lentinex, in healthy, elderly subjects in a double blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. Forty-two subjects were randomly allocated to two groups given orally either 2.5 mg/day Lentinex or placebo for 6 weeks; then after a washout period of 4 weeks, the alternate supplementation was given for 6 weeks. The changes in the number of B-cells were significantly different between the groups. The number of NK cells increased significantly in both groups, but there was no significant difference between the groups. Other factors of the immune response (immunoglobulins, complement proteins, cytokines) were not altered. The safety blood variables (differential cell count, liver function, kidney function, and other blood chemistry) were not influenced by Lentinex, and the number, nature, and severity of adverse events were similar to placebo. Lentinex given orally to elderly subjects was safe and induced an increase in the number of circulating B-cells. 3aLentinula edodes 3aactive ingredients 3abeta-glucans 3acomplement 3acytokines 3aelderly 3aimmune response 3aimmunoglobulins 3aliver function 3amedicinal fungi 3amushrooms 3amycelium 3anatural killer cells 3aoral administration 3aplacebos 3arenal function 3aAsia1 aSleboda, Jowita1 aOfjord, Erik Snorre1 aUlvestad, Elling1 aNurminiemi, Minna1 aMoe, Cecilie1 aAlbrektsen, Tor1 aGudmundsen, Ola0 tInternational journal of medicinal mushrooms.g2011, v. 13, no. 4 p.319-326x1521-94377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i4.103Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.begellhouse.com/journals/708ae68d64b17c52.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111117  aOther US 7aarticle01546naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245016900166300001600335520048600351653003500837653001300872653001500885653002400900653001800924700002300942700002100965700002400986773011501010852000901125856008501134946001301219655001201232IND4444311720221116155837.0101029e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444431172DNAL7 a10.1007/s10593-010-0589-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuyksaar, S.

We used 2nd instar larvae, trans-heterozygous for the third chromosome recessive markers, i.e., multiple wing hairs (mvh) and flare-3 [flr (3)], and fed them for 24 h with the aqueous extract of A. brasiliensis. For antigenotoxicity studies a 24-h pretreatment with the extract was done, followed by a 48-h treatment of the then 3rd instar larvae with MMS. The frequency of mutations of the wing blade changes (i.e., of the number of wing spots of different sizes) induced in somatic cells was determined as a parameter of genetic changes of the wing imaginal discs. The results showed that A. brasiliensis extract did not cause any genotoxic or mutagenic effects. No antigenotoxic and/or protective effect against the induction of mutations by MMS was observed. Instead, a possible enhanced mitotic recombination frequency by MMS was seen after pretreatment of the larvae with A. brasiliensis extract. Possible mechanisms of action are discussed. 3aAgaricus subrufescens 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3achromosomes 3agenotoxicity 3ahairs 3aimaginal discs 3ainstars 3alarvae 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal fungi 3amethyl methanesulfonate 3amitotic recombination 3amutagenicity 3aprotective effect 3asomatic cells 3asomatic mutation1 aPatenkovic, Aleksandra1 aSokovic, Marina1 aGlamoclija, Jasmina1 aAnđelković, Marko.1 aGriensven, Leo J.L.D. van0 tInternational journal of medicinal mushrooms.g2011, v. 13, no. 4 p.377-385x1521-94377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v13.i4.803Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.begellhouse.com/journals/708ae68d64b17c52.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111117  aOther US 7aarticle03073naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001600141245011600157300001600273520181800289650001802107650001702125650001502142650002402157650002502181650001002206650002602216650001702242650001802259650000902277650002602286650001802312650005202330650002402382650002202406700001902428773007002447852000902517856008102526930003302607946001102640655001202651IND4408275120221116155831.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827512DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwn0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, Maki10aSpatiotemporal expression of chondroitin sulfate sulfotransferases in the postnatal developing mouse cerebellum  ap. 602-614.  aChondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycans are major components of the cell surface and the extracellular matrix in the developing brain and bind to various proteins via CS chains in a CS structure-dependent manner. This study demonstrated the expression pattern of three CS sulfotransferase genes, dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase (D4ST), uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (UST), and N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST), in the mouse postnatal cerebellum. These sulfotransferases are responsible for the biosynthesis of oversulfated structures in CS chains such as B, D, and E units, which constitute the binding sites for various heparin-binding proteins. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the expression of UST increased remarkably during cerebellar development. The amounts of B and D units, which are generated by UST activity, in the cerebellar CS chains also increased during development. In contrast, the expression of GalNAc4S-6ST and its biosynthetic product, E unit, decreased during postnatal development. In situ hybridization experiments revealed the levels of UST and GalNAc4S-6ST mRNAs to correlate inversely in many cells including Purkinje cells, granule cells in the external granular layer, and inhibitory interneurons. In these neurons, the expression of UST increased and that of GalNAc4S-6ST decreased during development and/or maturation. D4ST was also expressed by many neurons, but its expression was not simply correlated with development, which might contribute to the diversification of CS structures expressed by distinct neurons. These results suggest that the CS structures of various cerebellar neurons change during development and such changes of CS are involved in the regulation of various signaling pathways. 3abinding sites 3abiosynthesis 3acerebellum 3achondroitin sulfate 3aextracellular matrix 3agenes 3ain situ hybridization 3ainterneurons 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3apostnatal development 3aproteoglycans 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3asulfotransferases1 aMaeda, Nobuaki0 tGlycobiology.g2008 Aug., v. 18, no. 8 p.602-614x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwn0403Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03232naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245010800190300001600298520184700314650001202161650001202173650002502185650002002210650001502230650002802245650003502273650002802308650002302336650003102359653002602390653002302416653002402439653002502463653003702488700002402525773011102549852000902660856008502669930003302754946001102787655001202798IND4433083320221116155841.0100220e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443308332DNAL7 a197797442pmid7 a10.1007/s10071-009-0286-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriedrich, Andrea M. 12aA relational differential outcomes effect: pigeons can classify outcomes as “good” and “better”  ap. 359-365.  aIn a conditional discrimination each of two sample stimuli indicates which of two comparison stimuli is correct. When correct choice following each conditional stimulus is followed by a different outcome (one kind of food following one, a different kind of food following the other) it often facilitates acquisition and improves memory. In transfer designs, in which two different conditional discriminations are followed by the same two differential outcomes, outcome expectation can be shown to be sufficient for comparison choice. That is, the samples from one conditional discrimination are matched to comparisons from the other conditional discrimination based on the common outcomes alone. In the present study we asked if for pigeons the relative value of the differential outcomes (higher versus lower value) can serve as the basis for comparison choice, independent of other characteristics of the outcomes and of differential sample responding. That is, would different outcomes that could be described as “good” and “better” form two stimulus classes. For one conditional discrimination, the differential outcomes involved differential probability of reinforcement for choice of the correct comparison stimulus (0.80 vs. 0.20 for correct choice of the two comparisons, respectively). For the other conditional discrimination, the differential outcomes involved differential responding to the two comparison stimuli (5 pecks vs. 20 pecks to the correct comparisons, respectively). On test trials, when conditional stimuli from the two conditional discriminations were interchanged and the relative value of the differential outcomes could serve as the only basis for comparison choice, we found positive transfer. The results indicate that relational attributes of outcomes can serve as effective cues for comparison choice. 3apigeons 2aAnimals 2aAssociation Learning 2aChoice Behavior 2aColumbidae 2aConditioning, Classical 2aDiscrimination, Psychological. 2aDiscrimination Learning 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aReinforcement, Psychology. 0aDifferential outcomes 0aMatching-to-sample 0aRelational learning 0aCategorical learning 0aDifferential comparison response1 aZentall, Thomas R. 0 tAnimal cognition.g2010 Mar., v. 13, no. 2 p.359-365dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1435-94487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-009-0286-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100220b20100305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02611naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001300159245010100172300001600273500002400289500001500313520104700328650002001375650002501395650002301420650001501443650001901458650002801477650000901505650001801514650002101532650001801553650002501571650001401596650002101610650002301631653001401654653002901668653001901697653002701716700001401743700001501757700001201772700001401784773010301798852000901901856009001910930003302000945002502033946001102058655001202069IND4397562020221116160120.0071106e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439756202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.05.0682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aWang, H.10aIn vitro and in vivo antioxidant activity of aqueous extract from Choerospondias axillaris fruit  ap. 888-895.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn the present study, an aqueous extract from Choerospondias axillaries fruit was evaluated for its in vivo antioxidant activity, using the d-galactose induced mouse aging model, and for its in vitro scavenging effects on the superoxide anions, DPPH, H₂O₂, hydroxyl radical. The reducing power and Fe²⁺-chelating ability, as well as the inhibition of lipid peroxidation were also evaluated. The flavonoid and phenolic contents of the extract were determined. Pertaining to the in vivo activity, the intragastric administration of the extract inhibited d-galactose induced oxidative damage. Furthermore, in the in vitro assays, the extract showed a high antioxidant effect, especially scavenging of DPPH anions and its reducing power. The total content of phenolic and flavonoid compounds was 568 mg of gallic acid equivalents/g dry material and 2.09 mg of quercetin equivalents/g dry material respectively.

We use numerical simulation methods for insights and relate our discussion to the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) in the WTO. We interpret the absence of intertemporal trade as an absence of intermediation services provided by both domestic and foreign service providers. For simplicity, we consider extreme cases where intertemporal intermediation services can only be provided by domestic providers, so that when intertemporal trade in services is not allowed, markets are not complete. To our knowledge, this type of models is not used in the trade literature as general comparative statics results are unavailable. We first consider the liberalization of trade in financial services in an inter-spatial and intertemporal model of two countries, and we show how services liberalization can be welfare worsening in the presence of a tariff on spatial trade in goods. We show that this can hold in an artificial world with no domestic financial services provider. We compare financial service trade autarky in which there is no intermediation to financial service trade liberalization which involves costless intertemporal intermediation provided by foreign service providers. We also consider a more complex (and realistic) world where costly intermediation services can be provided by both domestic and foreign providers. 0aGATS 0aFinancial services 0aIntertemporal trade 0aIntermediation services 0aService trade liberlization1 aWhalley, John 1 aZhang, Chunming.0 tEconomic theory.g2009 Oct., v. 41, no. 1 p.131-145dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0938-22597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00199-008-0414-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100129b20100205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02417naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245008200195300001800277506007600295520127100371506003701642650002101679650001101700650001801711700002201729700001801751700001901769700001801788773008301806852000901889856007801898930003301976946001102009990002302020655001202043IND4408277520221207062230.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827752DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn4022doi7 aPMC24907382pmcid7 a185995142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Niti10aEffect of loop length variation on quadruplex-Watson Crick duplex competition  ap. 4433-4442.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effect of loop length on quadruplex stability has been studied when the G-rich strand is present along with its complementary C-rich strand, thereby resulting in competition between quadruplex and duplex structures. Using model sequences with loop lengths varying from T to T5, we carried out extensive FRET to discover the influence of loop length on the quadruplex-Watson Crick duplex competition. The binding data show an increase in the binding affinity of quadruplexes towards their complementary strands upon increasing the loop length. Our kinetic data reveal that unfolding of the quadruplex in presence of a complementary strand involves a contribution from a predominant slow and a small population of fast opening conformer. The contribution from the fast opening conformer increases upon increasing the loop length leading to faster duplex formation. FCS data show an increase in the interconversion between the quadruplex conformers in presence of the complementary strand, which shifts the equilibrium towards the fast opening conformer with an increase in loop length. The relative free-energy difference (ΔΔG°) between the duplex and quadruplex indicates that an increase in loop length favors duplex formation and out competes the quadruplex.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding capacity 3amodels 3anucleic acids1 aSahoo, Bankanidhi1 aVarun, K.A.S.1 aMaiti, Sudipta1 aMaiti, Souvik0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Aug., v. 36, no. 13 p.4433-4442x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn4023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02962naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001800179245007900197300001800276506007600294520161400370506003701984650000802021650001402029650001502043650001402058650001102072650001102083650001202094650001402106650002102120650002902141650003102170700002402201700002002225700002202245773008302267852000902350856007802359930003302437946001102470990002302481655001202504IND4408278120221207070134.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827812DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn4142doi7 aPMC24907562pmcid7 a186119502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToh, Wen Hong10aTAp73β and DNp73β activate the expression of the pro-survival caspase-2S  ap. 4498-4509.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  ap73, the p53 homologue, exists as a transactivation-domain-proficient TAp73 or deficient deltaN(DN)p73 form. Expectedly, the oncogenic DNp73 that is capable of inactivating both TAp73 and p53 function, is over-expressed in cancers. However, the role of TAp73, which exhibits tumour-suppressive properties in gain or loss of function models, in human cancers where it is hyper-expressed is unclear. We demonstrate here that both TAp73 and DNp73 are able to specifically transactivate the expression of the anti-apoptotic member of the caspase family, caspase-2S. Neither p53 nor TAp63 has this property, and only the p73β form, but not the p73α form, has this competency. Caspase-2 promoter analysis revealed that a non-canonical, 18 bp GC-rich Sp-1-binding site-containing region is essential for p73β-mediated activation. However, mutating the Sp-1-binding site or silencing Sp-1 expression did not affect p73β's transactivation ability. In vitro DNA binding and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that p73β is capable of directly binding to this region, and consistently, DNA binding p73 mutant was unable to transactivate caspase-2S. Finally, DNp73β over-expression in neuroblastoma cells led to resistance to cell death, and concomitantly to elevated levels of caspase-2S. Silencing p73 expression in these cells led to reduction of caspase-2S expression and increased cell death. Together, the data identifies caspase-2S as a novel transcriptional target common to both TAp73 and DNp73, and raises the possibility that TAp73 may be over-expressed in cancers to promote survival.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acaspase-2 3acell death 3achromatin 3ahumans 3amodels 3amutants 3aneoplasms 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation1 aLogette, Emmanuelle1 aCorcos, Laurent1 aSabapathy, Kanaga0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Aug., v. 36, no. 13 p.4498-4509x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn4143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02443naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001800168245011800186300001700304500002400321520107800345650001401423650001301437650002101450650001201471650001501483650002501498650001601523650001101539650002401550650001501574650002401589653002401613700001601637700001501653700001801668700001501686773010401701852000901805856009001814930003301904945002501937946001101962655001201973IND4397564520221116155752.0071106e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439756452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ501 0aQ1011 aCavalli, S.V.10aHydrolysis of caprine and ovine milk proteins, brought about by aspartic peptidases from Silybum marianum flowers  ap. 997-1003.  aIncludes references  aThe flowers of cardoon (Asteraceae) are a rich source of aspartic peptidases which possess milk clotting activity - and are thus used in traditional cheesemaking in the Iberian Peninsula. This study was aimed at characterizing the enzymatic action of the aspartic peptidases present in flowers of Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (Asteraceae), specifically upon degradation of caseins. The proteolytic activities toward Na-caseinates previously prepared from caprine and ovine milks were studied, in a comparative fashion, using urea-PAGE, tricine-SDS-PAGE, densitometry, electroblotting and sequencing. Caprine α(s)₁ - and β-caseins were degraded up to 68% and 40%, respectively, during 24 h of incubation. Only one important and well-defined band corresponding to a molecular weight of 14.4 kDa - i.e. a fragment of β-casein, was observed by 12 h of hydrolysis. By 24 h of incubation, ovine α(s)- and β-caseins were degraded up to 76% and 19%, respectively. In what concerns specificity, the major cleavage site in ovine caseinate was Leu99-Arg100 in α(s)₁-casein. 3agoat milk 3aewe milk 3aSilybum marianum 3aflowers 3apeptidases 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aproteolysis 3acasein 3aprotein degradation 3acaseinates 3acasein hydrolysates 0aaspartic peptidases1 aSilva, S.V.1 aCimino, C.1 aMalcata, F.X.1 aPriolo, N.0 tFood chemistry.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 106, no. 3 p.997-1003dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.07.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/01/23  aNon-US 7aarticle03072naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001600179245014100195300001800336506007600354520144500430506003701875650001601912650002001928650002001948650001001968650001601978650001301994650002102007650001102028650001802039650001802057650004302075650005202118650002402170650002002194650002902214700001502243700001702258700002002275700002202295773008302317852000902400856007802409930003302487946001102520990002302531655001202554IND4408278220221207072930.0080726e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827822DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn4192doi7 aPMC24907542pmcid7 a186119492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRay, Sutapa10aRequirement of histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) in signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) nucleocytoplasmic distribution  ap. 4510-4520.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSignal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling, mediating the acute-phase induction of the human Angiotensinogen (hAGT) gene in hepatocytes. We showed earlier that IL-6 induces acetylation of the STAT3 NH₂-terminus by the recruitment of the p300 coactivator. We had also observed a physical interaction of STAT3 and Histone Deacetylase1 (HDAC1) in an IL-6-dependent manner that leads to transcriptional repression. In this study, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which HDAC1 controls STAT3 transcriptional activity. Here, we mapped the interacting domains of both STAT3 and HDAC1 and found that the COOH-terminal domain of HDAC1 is necessary for IL-6-induced STAT3 transcriptional repression, whereas the NH₂-terminal acetylation domain of STAT3 is required for HDAC1 binding. Interestingly, over expression of HDAC1 in HepG2 cells leads to significantly reduced amounts of nuclear STAT3 after IL-6 induction, whereas silencing of HDAC1 resulted in accumulation of total and acetylated STAT3 in the nucleus. We have found that HDAC1 knockdown also interferes with the responsiveness of the STAT3-dependent MCP1 target gene expression to IL-6, as confirmed by real-time RT-PCR analysis. Together, our study reveals the novel functional consequences of IL-6-induced STAT3-HDAC1 interaction on nucleocytoplasmic distribution of STAT3.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylation 3aangiotensinogen 3agene expression 3agenes 3ahepatocytes 3ahistones 3ahuman cell lines 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-6 3anucleic acids 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asignal transduction 3atransactivators 3atranscription (genetics)1 aLee, Chang1 aHou, Tieying1 aBoldogh, Istvan1 aBrasier, Allan R.0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Aug., v. 36, no. 13 p.4510-4520x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn4193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02766naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245005400168300001600222520131100238650001101549650001901560650001301579650001601592650001601608650001001624650001801634650001501652650002301667650001801690650001501708650002001723650001701743653002201760653002601782653002401808653001301832700002201845700002301867700002101890700002301911700002001934700002401954700002301978773010902001852000902110856008502119930003302204946001102237655001202248IND4438778220221116155958.0100619e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443877822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0283-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarminati, Andrea 10aDynamics of soil water content in the rhizosphere  ap. 163-176.  aWater flow from soil to plants depends on the properties of the soil next to roots, the rhizosphere. Although several studies showed that the rhizosphere has different properties than the bulk soil, effects of the rhizosphere on root water uptake are commonly neglected. To investigate the rhizosphere's properties we used neutron radiography to image water content distributions in soil samples planted with lupins during drying and subsequent rewetting. During drying, the water content in the rhizosphere was 0.05 larger than in the bulk soil. Immediately after rewetting, the picture reversed and the rhizosphere remained markedly dry. During the following days the water content of the rhizosphere increased and after 60 h it exceeded that of the bulk soil. The rhizosphere's thickness was approximately 1.5 mm. Based on the observed dynamics, we derived the distinct, hysteretic and time-dependent water retention curve of the rhizosphere. Our hypothesis is that the rhizosphere's water retention curve was determined by mucilage exuded by roots. The rhizosphere properties reduce water depletion around roots and weaken the drop of water potential towards roots, therefore favoring water uptake under dry conditions, as demonstrated by means of analytical calculation of water flow to a single root. 3adrying 3aimage analysis 3aplanting 3aradiography 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil sampling 3asoil water 3asoil water content 3awater content 3awater flow 3awater potential 3awater uptake 0aRoot water uptake 0aWater retention curve 0aNeutron radiography 0aMucilage1 aMoradi, Ahmad B. 1 aVetterlein, Doris 1 aVontobel, Peter 1 aLehmann, Eberhard 1 aWeller, Ulrich 1 aVögel, Hans-Jörg.1 aOswald, Sascha E. 0 tPlant and soil.g2010 July, v. 332, no. 1-2 p.163-176dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0283-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20100619b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02322naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245012400169300001400293520126400307650001301571653002301584653001301607653002801620653002401648653003601672700002501708700002501733773009801758852000901856856008501865930003301950946001301983655001201996IND4439488620221116155957.0100702e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443948862DNAL7 a10.1007/s10562-010-0380-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeznis, Nadzeya V. 10aCu-ZSM-5 Zeolites for the Formation of Methanol from Methane and Oxygen: Probing the Active Sites and Spectator Species  ap. 14-22.  aA series of Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites was prepared by varying nature of the charge compensating cation, copper precursor, copper loading, and pH. The materials were tested for the oxidation of methane to methanol using oxygen. A linear relationship between the amount of methanol produced over Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites from methane and oxygen and a UV-Vis-NIR DRS charge transfer band at 22,700 cm⁻¹ is reported irrespective of the synthesis route used. The absolute intensity of the 22,700 cm⁻¹ band is always low, indicating a low number of active sites in the samples. In all studied Cu-ZSM-5 zeolites at least two copper species were present: (a) Cu-O clusters dispersed on the outer surface of ZSM-5 and (b) highly dispersed copper-oxo species inside the channels, a minority fraction in the sample. By relating catalytic activity to FT-IR data of adsorbed pivalonitrile, visualizing Cu-O particles on the outer surface of the zeolite, and subsequently adsorbed NO, indicative of the Cu-O species inside the zeolite channel, it was concluded that Cu-O species on the outer surface are not involved in the oxidation reaction, while copper inside the channels are responsible for the selective conversion of methane to methanol.

Single trinucleotide sequences were deleted at random positions in a target gene using the engineered transposon MuDel that were subsequently replaced with a randomized trinucleotide sequence donated by the DNA cassette termed SubSeqNNN. The bla gene encoding TEM-1 β-lactamase was used as a model to demonstrate the effectiveness of TriNEx. Sequence analysis revealed that the mutations were distributed throughout bla, with variants containing single, double and triple nucleotide changes. Many of the resulting amino acid substitutions had significant effects on the in vivo activity of TEM-1, including up to a 64-fold increased activity toward ceftazidime and up to an 8-fold increased resistance to the inhibitor clavulanate. Many of the observed amino acid substitutions were only accessible by exchanging at least two nucleotides per codon, including charge-switch (R164D) and aromatic substitution (W165Y) mutations. TriNEx can therefore generate a diverse range of protein variants with altered properties by combining the power of site-directed saturation mutagenesis with the capacity of whole-gene mutagenesis to randomly introduce mutations throughout a gene.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aamino acid substitution 3abeta-lactamase 3aceftazidime 3adirected evolution 3agenes 3amodels 3amutagenesis 3anucleotides 3asequence analysis 3atransposons1 aBusse, Kathy1 aSimm, Alan M.1 aJones, D.

Activation of iNKT cells by their exogenous ligand α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) exerts therapeutic effects in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the pathophysiological role of iNKT cells in RA, in the absence of exogenous stimulation, is incompletely understood. We investigated the potential pathophysiological effects of iNKT cells in mice with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), a model of RA. We found that iNKT cells underwent activation only in the early phases of the disease (6 days post-induction). In the liver, but not the spleen or lymph nodes, this early activation led to the release of interleukins -4, -17A and -10 and of interferon-γ; and an increased CD69 expression. Importantly, clinical and histological signs of arthritis were improved by the functional blockade of iNKT cells by a monoclonal antibody to CD1d at the early phase of the disease. This improvement was associated on day 6 post-induction with decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86, CD40) on splenic dendritic cells and macrophages, whereas regulatory T-cell suppressive effects and proportions were not modified. Taken in concert, these findings suggest that iNKT cells are activated early in the course of CIA and contribute to the pathogenesis of arthritis. Therefore, iNKT-cell activation may be a valid treatment target in RA. 3acytokines 3ainflammation 3arheumatoid arthritis 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalximmunologyxpharmacology. 2aAntigens, CDxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aAntigens, CD1dximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAntigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocytexbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aArthritis, Experimentalxchemically inducedximmunologyxmetabolismxpathologyxtherapy. 2aArthritis, Rheumatoidxchemically inducedximmunologyxmetabolismxpathologyxtherapy. 2aCollagenxadverse effectsxpharmacology. 2aCytokinesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aGalactosylceramidesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aLectins, C-Typexbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aLymphocyte Activationxdrug effectsximmunology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred DBA 2aNatural Killer T-Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTh1 Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTh2 Cellsximmunologyxmetabolismxpathology. 2aTime Factors 0acollagen-induced arthritis 0anatural killer T cells1 aBiton, Jérôme1 aBourgeois, Elvire1 aHerbelin, André1 aBoissier, Marie-Christophe1 aBessis, Natacha0 tImmunology.g2010 June, v. 130, no. 2 p.296-306dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2009.03235.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02654naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100001700168245012300185300001800308500002400326520100100350650001701351650002501368650001401393650002301407650001101430650001801441650001901459650001601478650001801494650002401512650001601536650001101552650002401563650002701587650001001614650001901624650000901643650002801652653002401680653003201704653002401736653002001760653001801780700001701798773010501815852000901920856009001929930003302019945002502052946001102077655001202088IND4397566320221116155845.0071106e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439756632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.07.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ106 0aQ5061 aRawdkuen, S.10aWhey protein concentrate: Autolysis inhibition and effects on the gel properties of surimi prepared from tropical fish  ap. 1077-1084.  aIncludes references  aEffects of whey protein concentrate (WPC) on autolysis inhibition and gel properties of surimi produced from bigeye snapper (Priacanthus tayenus), goatfish (Mulloidichthys vanicolensis), threadfin bream (Nemipterus bleekeri) and lizardfish (Saurida tumbil) were investigated. WPC (0-3%) showed inhibitory activity against autolysis in all surimi at both 60 and 65 °C in a concentration-dependent manner. Myosin heavy chain (MHC) of surimi was more retained in the presence of WPC. Breaking force and deformation of kamaboko gels of all surimi increased as added levels of WPC increased (P < 0.05). This was associated with lower levels of protein degradation, as evidenced by the decrease in trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptide content (P < 0.05). WPC at 3% (w/w) significantly decreased the whiteness of gels. However, water-holding capacity of kamaboko gels was improved with increasing concentration of WPC. The microstructure of surimi gels generally became denser with the addition of WPC. 3awhey protein 3aprotein concentrates 3aautolysis 3agelling properties 3asurimi 3atropical fish 3aSaurida tumbil 3atemperature 3adose response 3amyosin heavy chains 3adeformation 3aforces 3aprotein degradation 3awater holding capacity 3acolor 3amicrostructure 3agels 3afood processing quality 0aPriacanthus tayenus 0aMulloidichthys vanicolensis 0aNemipterus bleekeri 0abreaking forces 0akamaboko gels1 aBenjakul, S.0 tFood chemistry.g2008 Feb. 1, v. 106, no. 3 p.1077-1084dApplied Science Publishersx0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2007.07.0283Available from publisher's Web site  a20080226b20080301c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/01/24  aNon-US 7aarticle04003naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002600152245018200178300001600360520200800376650002502384650002202409650001702431650001302448650001702461650002002478650001502498650001202513650002302525650002602548650001702574650001102591650001102602650001102613650001402624650001502638650001502653650001802668650001902686650000902705650001702714650001902731651002602750653001502776700002202791700001602813700002402829700002002853700002002873700002202893700002202915700002402937700001802961700002102979700001803000700002003018700001803038773012803056852000903184856009203193930003303285946001103318655001203329IND4438368620221116155750.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443836862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00526.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiuk-Wasser, Maria A.10aField and climate-based model for predicting the density of host-seeking nymphal Ixodes scapularis, an important vector of tick-borne disease agents in the eastern United States  ap. 504-514.  aIxodes scapularis is the most important vector of human tick-borne pathogens in the United States, which include the agents of Lyme disease, human babesiosis and human anaplasmosis, among others. The density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs is an important component of human risk for acquiring Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease. In this study we used climate and field sampling data to generate a predictive map of the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs that can be used by the public, physicians and public health agencies to assist with the diagnosis and reporting of disease, and to better target disease prevention and control efforts. Eastern United States of America. We sampled host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs in 304 locations uniformly distributed east of the 100th meridian between 2004 and 2006. Between May and September, 1000 m² were drag sampled three to six times per site. We developed a zero-inflated negative binomial model to predict the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs based on altitude, interpolated weather station and remotely sensed data. Variables that had the strongest relationship with nymphal density were altitude, monthly mean vapour pressure deficit and spatial autocorrelation. Forest fragmentation and soil texture were not predictive. The best-fit model identified two main foci - the north-east and upper Midwest - and predicted the presence and absence of I. scapularis nymphs with 82% accuracy, with 89% sensitivity and 82% specificity. Areas of concordance and discordance with previous studies were discussed. Areas with high predicted but low observed densities of host-seeking nymphs were identified as potential expansion fronts. This model is unique in its extensive and unbiased field sampling effort, allowing for an accurate delineation of the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs, an important component of human risk of infection for B. burgdorferi and other I. scapularis-borne pathogens. 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes scapularis 3aLyme disease 3aaltitude 3aanaplasmosis 3aautocorrelation 3ababesiosis 3aclimate 3adisease prevention 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahost seeking 3ahumans 3amodels 3anymphs 3apathogens 3aphysicians 3aprediction 3apublic health 3aremote sensing 3arisk 3asoil texture 3avapor pressure 3aEastern United States 0atick-borne1 aVourc'h, Gwenaël1 aCislo, Paul1 aHoen, Anne Gatewood1 aMelton, Forrest1 aHamer, Sarah A.1 aRowland, Michelle1 aCortinas, Roberto1 aHickling, Graham J.1 aTsao, Jean I.1 aBarbour, Alan G.1 aKitron, Uriel1 aPiesman, Joseph1 aFish, Durland0 tGlobal ecology and biogeography.g2010 July, v. 19, no. 4 p.504-514dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1466-822X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00526.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04006naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245010600174300001800280500020000298520217400498650002502672650002002697650002202717650002302739650001802762650001702780650001302797650001102810650002802821650000902849650001302858650001602871650003402887650001702921650001402938650001302952650001102965650001902976650001502995650002703010650001903037650002003056650002303076650001903099650001603118650001203134651002403146651001103170651001803181651001803199773014603217856005603363852000903419655001203428IND60596351520221116155725.0180619e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059635152DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.1752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkins, C.

The last couple of decades has represented a time of great innovation for the postharvest community, however, especially with the development of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and dynamic controlled atmosphere (DCA) based technologies. Other postharvest technologies available to meet specific needs of horticultural products include modified atmosphere packaging (MAP), edible coatings, heat, intermittent warming, sulphur dioxide, irradiation and ethylene adsorbants and oxidizers. Others, however, such as nitric oxide positively affect product storability but have not been commercialized. Also, an extensive literature on the effects of other chemicals, including salicylic acid, polyamines and γ-aminobutyric acid on ameliorating chilling injuries and improving storage potential, is available, but the potential of these compounds for commercial development is less clear. Meanwhile, established technologies such as diphenylamine face an uncertain future. 1-MCP and DCA provide an interesting insight into factors that can affect commercialization of a technology as they have distinct regional patterns of adoption, the latter being much more commonly used in Europe than elsewhere. Possible reasons for these differences include earlier availability of 1-MCP in the Americas and Australasia compared with Europe, differing emphases on organic and avoidance of any postharvest chemical usage, availability of storage room quality necessary to maintain the very low oxygen concentrations required for successful DCA, and differing demands for firm fruit texture by consumers. In this overview, 1-MCP, DCA and other selected technologies are discussed in relation to factors associated with commercialization and their adoption by various industries. These include the benefit of a given technology on a horticultural product, the competitive edge that it can provide an industry in relation to cost of its application, ownership of the technology that justifies the expense of registration and meeting regulatory requirements, and consumer expectations. 3a1-methylcyclopropene 3achilling injury 3acommercialization 3aconsumer attitudes 3adiphenylamine 3aedible films 3aethylene 3afruits 3agamma-aminobutyric acid 3aheat 3aindustry 3airradiation 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3anitric oxide 3aownership 3aoxidants 3aoxygen 3aplant products 3apolyamines 3apostharvest technology 3asalicylic acid 3astorage quality 3astorage technology 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3atexture 3aAustralasian region 3aEurope 3aNorth America 3aSouth America0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.1233-1244dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.175  aDNAL 7aarticle01827naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245009000171300001800261500020000279520069700479650002301176650001901199650002401218650001701242650001501259650002001274650002001294773014601314856005601460852000901516655001201525IND60596350620180731000000.0180619e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059635062DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.1702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPech, J.

The epic of postharvest teaches us that a good knowledge of the literature and the choice of good strategies have been crucial for scientific and technological advances. In recent years high throughput analytical methods of transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics have generated a huge amount of data whose biological significance and practical outcomes are often still awaited. However, with the help of bioinformatics, they open new perspectives for the genetic improvement of the quality and storability of fresh products. 3aanalytical methods 3abioinformatics 3agenetic improvement 3ametabolomics 3aproteomics 3astorage quality 3atranscriptomics0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.1195-1204dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.170  aDNAL 7aarticle02551naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245008000170300001600250520127100266650001001537650002601547650002601573650002401599650002301623650002001646650001201666650001101678650001401689650002001703650001301723650002601736650001901762650001101781650001301792650001701805651001801822700002101840773009901861852000901960856009201969930003302061946001102094655001202105IND4443095020221116155830.0101001e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444309502DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.01308.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichaud, J.P.10aRelative toxicity of three wheat herbicides to two species of Coccinellidae  ap. 434-438.  aOn the High Plains of the USA, herbicides specific for broad-leaf weeds are regularly applied to winter wheat in the early spring, sometimes late enough to coincide with the colonization of fields by cereal aphids and their natural enemies. We tested the toxicity of three such herbicides, Ally (Dupont), Rave (Syngenta) and 2,4-D ester (generic), to neonate larvae of two coccinellid species important in cereal aphid biocontrol, Coleomegilla maculata DeGeer and Hippodamia convergens Guérin-Méneville. Topical treatment of larvae with 2,4-D resulted in 25% and 60% mortality in the two species, respectively, with surviving C. maculata larvae experiencing a 5% increase in developmental time. No significant effects were noted for the other two materials, save for a 2.5% increase in developmental time for C. maculata larvae exposed to Rave. No material caused significant mortality in either species when larvae were fed on prey (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) treated with herbicide 24 h earlier, although 2,4-D reduced developmental time slightly in C. maculata. When herbicide applications are delayed enough in spring to coincide with aphid activity in wheat, farmers can reduce the risk of disrupting biological control by selecting an alternative to 2,4-D. 3a2,4-D 3aColeomegilla maculata 3aHippodamia convergens 3aSchizaphis graminum 3abiological control 3abroadleaf weeds 3afarmers 3alarvae 3amortality 3anatural enemies 3aneonates 3apesticide application 3arisk reduction 3aspring 3atoxicity 3awinter wheat 3aUnited States1 aVargas, Germán.0 tInsect science.g2010 Oct., v. 17, no. 5 p.434-438dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-96097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2009.01308.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101001b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245010100155300001800256520118600274650001301460650002201473650001701495650002001512650002101532650001701553650001301570650000701583650001301590650001601603650001901619650002601638650002601664653001401690653001301704653002301717653002401740700002101764700002401785700002001809773010201829852000901931856007701940930003302017945001302050946001302063655001202076IND2196566620221116155723.0990121e199807  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219656662DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970902s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeemaes, C.A.10aEffect of pH on pressure and thermal inactivation of avocado polyphenol oxidase: a kinetic study  ap. 2785-2792.  aHigh-pressure and thermal inactivations of avocado polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were studied for enzyme systems with pH 4-8. Both pressure and temperature inactivation of the enzyme followed first-order kinetics in the pH range 5-8 but showed deviation from simple first-order kinetics at pH 4. Threshold pressure and temperature for PPO inactivation, as well as pressure and temperature dependence of the inactivation rate constants, were influenced by pH. The minimum inactivation pressure increased from approximately 450 MPa at pH 4 to approximately 850 MPa at pH8. The threshold temperature increased from approximately 40 at pH to approximately 65 degrees C at pH 6 and was approximately constant at higher pH values. The z(p) value and the absolute value of the activation volume both reflecting the pressure dependency of the inactivation rate constant, respectively increased and decreased with increasing pH, in the pH range 5-8. The z(t) value and activation energy, both reflecting the temperature dependency of the inactivation rate constant, respectively decreased and increased with increasing pH in the pH range 5-7. At pH 8, the activation energy was slightly lowered. 3aavocados 3amechanical damage 3afood storage 3afood processing 3acatechol oxidase 3ainactivation 3akinetics 3apH 3apressure 3atemperature 3aheat stability 3aenvironmental factors 3aquantitative analysis 0astability 0abrowning 0apressure stability 0apostharvest storage1 aLudikhuyze, L.R.1 aBroeck, I. van den.1 aHendrickx, M.E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1998 July, v. 46, no. 7 p.2785-2792x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970902s3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02611naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001900137245020300156300001800359500001500377520108200392650001501474650001501489650002201504650002201526650002501548650001901573650001201592650002201604650001801626650001401644653001801658653002101676653002901697653002601726653002601752653001501778653001701793700001901810700001801829700002301847773010201870852000901972856007701981930003302058945001302091946001302104655001202117IND2196567320221116160110.0990121e199807  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219656732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf97109952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCespedes, C.L.10aPhytochemical and biochemical characterization of epimeric photogedunin derivatives.

The results indicate that compounds 3 and 4 behave as Hill reaction inhibitors. alpha-Photogedunin acetate 3 inhibits PS II electron flow from H2O to DCBQ without affecting PS I electron transport from reduced DCPIP to MV and PSII from water to SiMo. Therefore, its target is localized at the QB level. beta-Photogedunin acetate 4 inhibits PS I electron flow from reduced DCPIP to MV, PMSred to MV, and TMQH2 to MV without affecting PS II electron flow, interacting at the b6f level and in the span of P700 to Fx. 3athylakoids 3aherbicides 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aelectron transfer 3aphotophosphorylation 3aphotosystem II 3aCedrela 3aspectral analysis 3aphotosystem I 3alimonoids 0aproton uptake 0agreen herbicides 0ahill reaction inhibitors 0acedrela salvadorensis 0aphotogedunin acetates 0ainhibition 0achloroplasts1 aCalderon, J.S.1 aKing-Diaz, B.1 aLotina-Hennsen, B.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1998 July, v. 46, no. 7 p.2810-2816x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf97109953Available from publisher's Web site  a20060804b20060906c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02887naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245007000171300001800241500020000259520140500459650003401864650001801898650002501916650002001941650001901961650001901980650002501999650000902024650001202033650001902045650001302064650001602077650001702093650001102110650001502121650001602136650001602152700001802168700001602186700001602202773014602218856005602364852000902420655001202429IND60596350520180731000000.0180619e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059635052DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.1692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSommano, S.10aPotentials of Thai tropical edible flowers as fresh cut salad mix  ap. 1187-1194.  aPaper presented at the VIII International Postharvest Symposium: Enhancing Supply Chain and Consumer Benefits - Ethical and Technological Issues held June 21 – 24, 2016, Cartagena Murcia, Spain  aAntioxidant capacities and total phenolic content of five common Thai edible flowers that have potential as ingredients in salad mix, namely marigold (Tagetes erecta L.), paper flower (Bougainvillea hybrid), ixora (Ixora chinensis Lam.), cape jasmine (Gardenia jasminoides J.Ellis) and damask rose (Rosa damascena Mill.) were investigated. Antioxidant activity by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity assay and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) (TEAC) and total phenolics content were analysed from the methanolic extract of petals of the flowers. Paper flower, ixora and damask rose gave high DPPH radical scavenging activity (>90% inhibition). All tested flowers had high TEAC (>90% inhibition or 17 mg Trolox g-1 sample). Among those flower, damask rose gave highest total phenolic content (31.9 mg GAE g-1 sample) followed by marigold and ixora (~28 mg GAE g-1 sample). Mixed petals of marigold paper flower, ixora, cape jasmine, and damask rose were packed in polyethylene bags and stored at5 and 13°C. Weight loss and deterioration (%) were evaluated; shelf life of each flower was terminated when >20% of the petals deteriorated. Mixed petals can be kept at low temperatures for 8 and 4 days at 5 and 13°C, respectively. The result from this study could be useful toward marketability and future research opportunity for edible flowers in fresh-cut industry. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBougainvillea 3aGardenia jasminoides 3aIxora chinensis 3aRosa damascena 3aTagetes erecta 3aantioxidant activity 3abags 3acorolla 3aedible flowers 3aindustry 3aingredients 3apolyethylene 3asalads 3ashelf life 3atemperature 3aweight loss1 aSuksathan, R.1 aColelli, G.1 aKumpuan, W.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.1187-1194dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.169  aDNAL 7aarticle02538naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245010200173300001800275500020000293520138900493650001201882650001201894650002201906650001901928650001601947650002101963650001401984700001501998773014602013856005602159852000902215655001202224IND60596354020221116155957.0180619e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059635402DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.1852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBender, R.

Getting a hold on the mechanical injuries in the course of banana transport from a packinghouse to a distribution market was the objective of the present work. Bananas were harvested, packed and degreened as customary commercial practices and afterwards transported by truck along a paved road for about 150 km to the market. An instrumented sphere and vibration sensor modules were positioned in the whole truckload to sense compression and impact forces. The various parameters are read as analog inputs by means of their respective analog-to-digital converters and transmitted to a base station via radio frequency. Data were collected at different intervals of time in response to remarkable events to the length of the transport time. For the whole itinerary 82 peaks of more than 1 g (gravitational acceleration) were determined by sensors at the rear end of the banana load. At the front end, far less vibrations were determined. For a period of 1 h, the sensor at the front end of the truckload detected only four peaks higher than 1 g. The observed vibratory patterns are recurrent in amplitude as well as in frequency suggesting that the mechanical system (load and vehicle) exhibit a unique vibration characteristic. 3abananas 3amarkets 3amechanical damage 3apacking houses 3aradio waves 3aretail marketing 3avibration1 aMuller, I.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.1315-1320dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.185  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001900162245009300181300001800274500002400292500002300316520152100339650002101860650002001881650001601901650002001917650001901937650001101956651000901967653002301976653002801999700001902027700001602046773013502062852000902197856007502206930003302281945002502314946001102339655001202350IND4397544820221116160030.0071105e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439754482DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-0392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF300 0aK0011 aJoesting, H.M.14aThe photosynthetic response of American chestnut seedlings to differing light conditions  ap. 1714-1722.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aRestoration attempts to reintroduce American chestnut trees to the eastern deciduous forest by means of a disease-resistant Chinese-American hybrid seed are in progress. Knowing the light conditions required for optimum seedling performance is necessary to maximize the success of reintroduction. American chestnut (Castanea dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.) seedlings were planted in two replicate forests in Vinton County, Ohio, in areas that had been thinned (more available light) and in control areas (intact canopy, less available light). The photosynthetic capacity of 12 seedlings per treatment was assessed using an infrared gas-exchange analyzer. Seedlings in the thinned treatment reached light-saturating rates of photosynthesis at an irradiance level approximately 33% higher than did the seedlings in the control treatment. Seedlings grown in the thinned treatment had a significantly greater maximum rate of photosynthesis (A(max)), dark respiration rate (R(d)), and daily carbon gain per seedling than seedlings grown in the control treatment. The light compensation point (LCP), quantum efficiency (φ), leaf mass per area (LMA), and leaf nitrogen concentration per unit leaf area (N(area)) were not significantly different between treatments. American chestnut seedlings in the thinned treatment clearly maximize leaf-level photosynthetic capacity. These results will aid land managers in planning reintroduction trials by providing information on the light conditions required for maximum seedling success. 3aCastanea dentata 3alight intensity 3atree growth 3aseedling growth 3aphotosynthesis 3acarbon 3aOhio 0alight availability 0awhole-plant carbon gain1 aMcCarthy, B.C.1 aBrown, K.J.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2007 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1714-1722dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-0393Available from publisher's Web site  a20071109b20071210c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02121naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008700123300001400210520098800224650002801212650001101240650000901251650001201260650002501272650001301297650001201310650001301322650001601335650001201351650002001363700001701383700001401400700001901414773007801433852000901511856017101520939003301691946001101724655001201735IND4479464320221116155943.0140411s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447946432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBass, M.10aLocalized histiocytic sarcoma in a dog: an uncommon diagnosis in forelimb lameness  ap. 48-52.  aThe clinical, ultrasonographic, arthrographic and histo-pathological aspects of a localized histiocytic sarcoma in the tendon sheath of the biceps brachii muscle in a Flat-Coated Retriever are described. An eight-year-old female Flat-Coated Retriever was referred for evaluation of chronic forelimb lameness. The orthopaedic examination revealed a painful shoulder joint. Ultrasono graphic evaluation revealed distention of the tendon sheath of the biceps brachii muscle and the presence of multiple, hyperechoic structures in the distal portion of the sheath. The histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis of a biopsy taken during surgical exploration of the shoulder joint was histiocytic sarcoma. Palliative treatment with corticosteroids was administered but the dog was euthanized at the owner’s request four months following diagnosis due to progressing lameness. Post-mortem examination confirmed the diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma without any evidence of metastases. 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3abiopsy 3adogs 3afemales 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alameness 3amuscles 3anecropsy 3aorthopedics 3asarcoma 3aultrasonography1 aGardelle, O.1 aGrest, P.1 aBernasconi, C.0 pVet. comp. orthop. traumatolg2004, v. 17, no. 1 p.48-52x0932-08147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.schattauer.de/en/magazine/subject-areas/journals-a-z/vcot/contents/archivestandard/issue/150/manuscript/1264/show.html3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20140411  aNon-US 7aarticle03866naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100001500186245013100201300001600332500001500348520151300363650001401876650001701890650002101907650001201928650004001940650002801980650005702008650002202065650006902087650002902156650004702185650002102232650003702253650003202290650003702322650001102359650003902370650005702409650001102466650000902477650001502486650004502501650002702546650002902573650005202602650001702654650003702671653001702708653002702725700002702752700002502779700001602804700002602820700002702846700002002873700001902893773011802912852000903030856008503039930003303124946001103157655001203168IND4441252720221116155946.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444125272DNAL7 a199369152pmid7 aPMC37691742pmcid7 a10.1007/s10549-009-0638-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wei 12aA novel synthetic iminoquinone, BA-TPQ, as an anti-breast cancer agent: in vitro and in vivo activity and mechanisms of action  ap. 321-331.  a2019-12-04  aHerein, we report our examination of the anti-breast cancer activity of a novel synthetic compound, 7-(benzylamino)-1, 3, 4, 8-tetrahydropyrrolo [4, 3, 2-de]quinolin-8(1H)-one (BA-TPQ). This agent is an analog of a naturally occurring marine compound, and was found to be the most active out of more than 40 related compounds. We investigated the in vitro activity of BA-TPQ on the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of breast cancer cells using the MTT and BrdUrd assays, and Annexin/Annexin-PI staining and flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-cancer effects of BA-TPQ were evaluated in xenograft models of breast cancer. Finally, the mechanisms of action of the compound were also assessed by cDNA microarrays, RT-PCR and Western blotting. In a dose-dependent manner, BA-TPQ inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in vitro, and showed in vivo efficacy in mice bearing MCF-7 or MDA-MB-468 xenograft tumors. We demonstrated that BA-TPQ modifies the expression of numerous molecules involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Similar changes in protein expression were observed in vitro and in vivo, as determined by examination of cells and excised xenograft tumors. Our preclinical data indicate that BA-TPQ is a potential therapeutic agent for breast cancer that has multiple hormone-, Her2-, and p53-independent mechanisms of action, providing a basis for further development of the compound as a novel anticancer agent. 3aapoptosis 3adrug therapy 3abreast neoplasms 2aAnimals 2aAntineoplastic Agentsxpharmacology 2aApoptosisxdrug effects 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBlotting, Western 2aBreast Neoplasmsxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCell Cyclexdrug effects 2aCell Cycle Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Profilingxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Nude 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPyrrolesxpharmacology 2aQuinolonesxpharmacology 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTime Factors 2aXenograft Model Antitumor Assays 0achemotherapy 0aCell cycle progression1 aRayburn, Elizabeth R. 1 aVelu, Sadanandan E. 1 aChen, Deng 1 aNadkarni, Dwayaja H. 1 aMurugesan, Srinivasan 1 aChen, Dongquan 1 aZhang, Ruiwen 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2010 Sept., v. 123, no. 2 p.321-331dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-009-0638-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100813b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02710naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001400162245016900176300001800345500002400363500002300387500001500410520122200425650001601647650001001663650003201673650001101705650001301716650001001729651001001739653002101749653001001770653002501780653001701805653001501822653002901837653002301866700001301889700001401902773013501916852000902051856007502060930003302135945002502168946001102193655001202204IND4397545120221116160054.0071105e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439754512DNAL7 a10.1139/X07-0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK250 0aF4001 aZhang, X.10aDifferential responsiveness in stem height and diameter growth of two Ficus tree species in the Three Gorges reservoir region of China as affected by branch removal  ap. 1748-1754.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-06  aIn the Three Gorges reservoir region of China, Ficus microcarpa L. and Ficus virens Ait. var. sublanceolata (Miq.) Corner (Moraceae) are widely used in greening and ecological restoration following construction, including roads, railways, towns, etc. Branch cuttings are used for cultivating saplings of these trees. We conducted a 4 year experiment that included four branch-removal intensities to evaluate the influence of branch removal on stem height and diameter growth of these Ficus spp. It was found that branch removal did not affect the stem height growth of either F. microcarpa or F. virens, but decreased the growth of their stem basal diameters. The reduction in growth of stem basal diameter was intensified with branch removal. As expected, branch removal decreased the tapering of whole tree stems, but this effect was mainly due to the alteration of the shape of the bare stem part, and the shape of the stem part within the intact upper crown was not affected by the treatment. The data clearly showed that stem height growth was less sensitive than stem diameter growth to branch removal, and that the response of stem diameter growth to branch removal differed between bare and intact stem parts. 3atree growth 3aFicus 3atree and stand measurements 3aheight 3abranches 3ashape 3aChina 0aFicus microcarpa 0astems 0astem diameter growth 0aFicus virens 0astem taper 0abranch removal intensity 0astem height growth1 aZeng, B.1 aZhong, Z.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2007 Sept., v. 37, no. 9 p.1748-1754dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X07-0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20071108b20071210c00000000  aINDdLYNe2007/11/08  aNon-US 7aarticle01736naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245006400184300001600248520041300264650001600677650001000693650004700703650002000750650001100770650005600781650004300837650000900880650001600889650005400905650002200959650003000981650001601011653001301027653001001040773012601050852000901176856008501185930003301270946001101303655001201314IND4430109220221116160040.0091218e200908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443010922DNAL7 a200273562pmid7 a10.1007/s10517-009-0692-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTkachuk, V.

This paper reviews a participatory evaluation of the 6-week residential ‘Namgis Treatment Centre (NTC) program in Alert Bay, British Columbia. Intake files (n = 218) were reviewed for clients who participated in 17 different 6-week sessions over a period of two and a half years. The assessment included a telephone follow-up survey, developed in conjunction with all of the NTC staff, for clients who had been out of treatment for 3-37 months (n = 91, 52.7% male and 47.3% female participants). In total, 24 clients (26.37%) were abstinent at the time of the interview, and 67 clients (73.6%) had had a relapse on average 155.29 (SD = 167.77) days after completing treatment. Cox regression univariate and bivariate analysis revealed that pre-treatment variables were not associated with time to relapse or what happened after relapse (abstinence again, harm reduction or resuming pre-treatment consumption levels). However, the greater number of supports the client had, the more likely they were to be completely abstinent, and the less supports the client had, the more likely they were to completely relapse. NTC staff and community members were consulted on the implications of the data, and recommendations were shared with NTC policy makers. Based on the findings of this project, it is apparent, that in this context, follow-up and aftercare are critical for effective treatment. 3asubstance abuse 3aprogram evaluation 0aTreatment outcomes 0aAboriginal1 aCox, David N. 1 aReading, Jeff 1 aKmetic, Andrew 0 tInternational journal of mental health and addiction.g2010 Apr., v. 8, no. 2 p.374-389dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1557-18747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-009-9266-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01414naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014600124300001400270520047400284650001000758650002000768650001200788700001900800700001500819773007800834852000900912856017100921939003301092946001101125655001201136IND4479462520221116160052.0140411s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447946252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShani, J.10aStabilization of traumatic coxofemoral luxation with an extra-capsular suture from the greater trochanter to the origin of the rectus femoris  ap. 12-16.  aA wide variety of surgical techniques to stabilize the coxo-femoral joint have been described in the veteri-nary literature.

The spectral features of the most noteworthy bands are studied, and their correlations with the amount of fatty acids quantified by gas chromatography are presented. Principal component analysis is applied to classify the set of samples by their level of unsaturation [saturated (SFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)]. The most remarkable MUFA and PUFA oil sources are independently classified by applying stepwise linear discriminant analysis to the Raman shifts selected by their correlation with fatty acids or structural assignments. The results show that FT-Raman spectra not only have information of the degree of unsaturation but also of the balance among the amounts of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA. The scattering intensities near different Raman shifts (3013, 1663, and 1264 cm-1) show high correlations with the fatty acid profile determined by gas chromatography. 3afatty acids 3acorrelation 3aclassification 3aanimal fats and oils 3aplant fats 3aspectral analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 0afourier transform-raman spectroscopy 0aspecies 0aplant fats and oils 0asources1 aHourant, P.1 aMorales, M.T.1 aAparicio, R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1998 July, v. 46, no. 7 p.2638-2646x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf97078513Available from publisher's Web site  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02020naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003000145245011500175300001600290520068200306650001700988650002101005650001101026650002601037650002101063650002901084653003301113653001401146653003701160653004401197653002501241700003001266700001901296700002701315700002801342773010201370852000901472856008501481930003301566946001101599655001201610IND4437042220221116155822.0100514e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443704222DNAL7 a10.1365/s10337-010-1550-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDamaramadugu, Rajasekhar 10aSimultaneous Determination of Ritonavir and Lopinavir in Human Plasma after Protein Precipitation and LC-MS-MS  ap. 815-824.  aA simple, rapid, specific and sensitive method has been developed and validated for simultaneous determination of lopinavir and ritonavir in human plasma.

During two-week-long seedling growth, we observed a gradual decrease in the total SA content in shoots but not in roots. In shoots, the content of conjugated SA increased and that of its free form reduced. Seed presowing treatment with SA reduced total content of endogenous SA in both seedling shoots and roots. The content of free SA reduced intensely in shoots and somewhat less in roots. Such reduction was supposed to occur due to the disturbance in SA biosynthesis. These were accompanied by the increases in the shoot and especially root biomass and length, stimulation of total dark respiration, and changes in the ratio between respiratory pathways. In the roots, we observed an increased proportion of cytochrome respiration, whereas in the shoots — alternative cyan-resistant respiration. We also observed changes in the plant antioxidant system. A degree of lipid peroxidation was stronger in shoots than in roots. Pretreatment with SA resulted in MDA 2.5-fold accumulation in shoots, whereas its content in roots reduced by 1.7 times. We concluded that the type and intensity of SA effects on plant growth, energetic balance, and antioxidant status were related to changes in its endogenous content and redistribution between free and conjugated forms. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3abiosynthesis 3alipid peroxidation 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3awheat 0aexogenous/endogenous salicylic acid 0agrowth 0arespiration 0aantioxidant system1 aFedyaev, V.

In this work three blackberry (Rubus fruticosus L.) cultivars ('Chester', 'Arapaho' and 'Triple Crown') grown in the hill (Valle Imagna, BG, Italy) or in the plain (Arcagna, LO, Italy) were evaluated immediately after minimal processing and after 3, 6 and 8 days of shelf-life at 3°C. Following parameters were evaluated: firmness, soluble solids content (SSC), acidity (AC), color (a*, b*, Hue), total anthocyanin (TA), total polyphenols (TP) and antioxidant activity (DPPH). All the cultivars, especially if grown in the plain, showed a slight decrease in firmness during shelf-life, however, they maintained adequate firmness values until the end of the storage. Blackberries grown in the plain had higher SSC and hue and lower acidity than those coming from the hill. 'Chester' was the richest in TP and in TA followed by 'Arapaho' and 'Triple Crown'. TA content was always higher in fruits cultivated in the plain compared to those from the hill. Minimal processing did not importantly affect TA, TP content and DPPH. The nutritional content of the fruit at the end of shelf-life was not statistically different from the harvest. All the evaluated cultivars showed good physico-chemical parameters and nutritional properties throughout the storage and, then, they have an interesting potential as ready-to-eat product. 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aRubus plicatus 3aacidity 3aanthocyanins 3aantioxidant activity 3ablackberries 3acolor 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afruits 3ahills 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3apolyphenols 3aready-to-eat foods 3ashelf life 3atotal soluble solids 3avegetables 3aItaly1 aDe Vecchi, P.1 aUghini, V.1 aEccher, T.1 aGranelli, G.1 aLo Scalzo, R.1 aCortellino, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.1451-1457dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.203  aDNAL 7aarticle03760naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245009500174300001800269500020000287520191300487650001502400650001702415650001302432650001702445650002402462650001202486650001302498650001802511650001102529650001702540650001302557650002202570650001902592650001302611650001502624650001902639650001002658650001602668650001202684650002602696650001302722650001502735650002402750650002302774650002502797650003102822700001602853700001602869700001402885700001702899700001702916700001402933773014602947856005603093852000903149655001203158IND60596356420221116155956.0180619e20180404xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059635642DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.2002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCeccarelli, A.10aIs the physiological maturity at harvest influencing nectarine flavour after cold storage?  ap. 1429-1434.  aPaper presented at the VIII International Postharvest Symposium: Enhancing Supply Chain and Consumer Benefits - Ethical and Technological Issues held June 21 – 24, 2016, Cartagena Murcia, Spain  aPeach and nectarine are often harvested immature to withstand the postharvest handling without considering the consequence on fruit quality and therefore consumer's satisfaction and their likelihood of repurchase. Indeed, the inaccurate determination of the optimal harvest time leads to a considerable reduction in fruit quality at consumption. Despite fruit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) being positively associated with the consumer acceptance, VOCs are not well-considered in the optimization of pre- and postharvest fruit management. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of fruit physiological maturity at harvest on the development of VOCs during a simulated postharvest chain. Fruits of 'Stark Red Gold' nectarine, harvested at different maturity stages, determined by the “index of absorbance difference” (IAD), were stored at 1°C (90-95% RH) for 20 days then maintained 6 days in shelf-life at 20°C. The evolution in aroma production was monitored in each day of shelf life by proton transfer reaction - time of flight - mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). Besides the VOC measurement, fruit were assessed for the main quality traits: soluble solids content, flesh firmness and titratable acidity. Results of this research shows that the concentration of the main aroma compounds such as lactones (mainly γ- and δ-decalactones) and esters (mainly methyl acetate) increased during the progression of ripening while aldehydes (mainly pentanal) and C6-aldehydes (predominantly hexanal and 3-hexenal) decreased. However the concentration of these compounds, irrespective of the harvest maturity stages, was significantly reduced after cold storage, indicating a negative effect of low temperature in the development of aroma compounds. In addition fruit senescence was clearly marked by an enhanced emission of off-flavour compounds, such as ethanol, acetaldehyde and methanol. 3aabsorbance 3aacetaldehyde 3aacetates 3acold storage 3aconsumer acceptance 3aethanol 3afirmness 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aharvest date 3alactones 3amass spectrometry 3amaturity stage 3amethanol 3anectarines 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aoff flavors 3apeaches 3apostharvest treatment 3aripening 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3avolatile organic compounds1 aFarneti, B.1 aBusatto, N.1 aCosta, F.1 aBiasioli, F.1 aSpinelli, F.1 aCosta, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2018 Apr. 4, , no. 1194 p.1429-1434dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1194.200  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001800137245008900155300001800244520078500262650000901047650001101056650004301067650002101110650001501131650001701146650001301163650001501176650001301191650001201204650001801216700001601234700002001250700001601270773010301286852000901389856007701398930003301475945001301508946001301521655001201534IND2163850220221116160028.0980904e199712  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216385022DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970525j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerrari, R.A.10aAlteration of sterols and steryl esters in vegetable oils during industrial refining  ap. 4753-4757.  aSteryl esters of fatty acids have been isolated from vegetable oils by rapid chromatography on a short column of silica gel and quantitatively determined by HPLC on RP-18 columns using an evaporative light scattering detector that was calibrated with beta-sitosteryl oleate as external standard.

Breaking strain studies were also conducted for the four UPR model products before and after different aging procedures (moisture, UVB exposure, melt/freeze). NMR analysis of the chemical composition of the UPR resin extracts showed they contain several low MW organic compounds and oligomers rich in polar -OH groups that play a significant role in the degradation behavior of the composite UPR materials. Statistical analysis of the NMR compositional data showed that styrene and benzaldehyde contents can be used to differentiate between fresh and aged UPR samples. The phthalate and propylene glycol unit speciation (esterified, primary or secondary -OH) of the extracts provided evidence that UPR resin C was used in the construction of the two art installations, and direct comparison of ¹H and ¹³C NMR spectra verified this compositional similarity. UPR resin C was shown by both NMR and breaking strain studies to be the reference UPR most susceptible to degradation by different aging procedures, a characteristic attributed to the lower styrene content of resin C.

In order to better understand the protective immune responses elicited, we used RT-PCR assays to define the changes in expression levels of a range of cytokine transcripts in lymph nodes draining the ovine abomasum following a challenge infection with T. circumcincta. This study compared the changes in cytokine expression in the abomasal lymph node following challenge with T. circumcincta in naïve sheep (Group 2) and sheep immunised by a previous trickle infection (Group 3), in comparison to unchallenged naive sheep (Group 1). There was a significant up-regulation of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13 in both the challenged groups compared to naïve individuals. There was also an up-regulation of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNFα) by day 5 after infection. IL-12p(40) was found to be increased in the previously infected Group 3 animals by day 5 following challenge. By contrast, transcription of this cytokine was found to be reduced by day 10 following infection of Group 2 animals. Expression of IL-2 and Interferon-γ (IFNγ) did not significantly differ between the three groups. 3asheep diseases 3agastrointestinal nematodes 3aTeladorsagia circumcincta 3aprotective effect 3anematode infections 3agene expression 3adisease resistance 3alymph nodes 3ainterleukins 3atransforming growth factors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3atranscriptional activation 3anormal values 3asheep 3aabomasum 0acytokines 0abiological resistance 0aimmunologic factors 0aimmune system1 aMiller, H.R.P.1 aSmith, W.D.1 aKnight, P.A.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2007 Nov. 11, v. 120, no. 1-2 p.47-54dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2007.07.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080214b20080301c00000000  aINDd4CTe2008/01/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02206naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100001300137245009700150300001800247520102800265650002101293650001901314650001801333650002101351650001301372650002701385650001401412650001801426650001201444650001601456650002101472700001701493700001701510700002101527773010301548852000901651856007701660930003301737945001301770946001301783655001201796IND2163844720221116154013.0980903e199712  dcu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216384472DNAL7 a10.1021/jf970292w2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Z.10aPilot scale extraction and fractionation of rice bran oil using supercritical carbon dioxide  ap. 4540-4544.  aIn the first stage of this two-stage process, crude rice bran oil was extracted with supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) from a 300 g batch of rice bran. Oil-laden SC-CO2 from the extractor (24.1 MPa/40 degrees C) passed continuously to a second-stage column where an oil phase (raffinate) separated from the SC-CO2 at various controlled temperatures and pressures. Measurement of the compositions of raffinates and extracts allowed calculation of partition coefficients of triglycerides, free fatty acids (FFAs), alpha-tocopherol, sterols, and oryzanol and, hence, the selectivities of the fractionations. Fractionation removed almost all water and reduced the FFA concentration in raffinate by up to 50%. Oryzanol and alpha-tocopherol concentrations in the raffinate were not reduced by fractionation, but the sterol concentration was reduced under conditions favoring FFA removal. Under the flow rate conditions studied (3.5 kg of CO2/h), the fractionations could be described by equilibria between oil and CO2 phases. 3aalpha-tocopherol 3acarbon dioxide 3afractionation 3afree fatty acids 3aoryzanol 3apartition coefficients 3arice bran 3arice bran oil 3asterols 3atemperature 3atriacylglycerols1 aPalmer, M.V.1 aTing, S.S.T.1 aFairclough, R.J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Dec., v. 45, no. 12 p.4540-4544x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970292w3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01734naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245009800163300001800261520057000279650001200849650002000861650001300881650001900894650001200913650002700925650000900952650002100961653003200982653002201014700002001036700002001056700001901076773011501095852000901210856008501219930003301304946001101337655001201348IND4437511820221116154026.0100522e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443751182DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-009-9929-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chuanhai 10aEighteen novel microsatellite markers for the greater long-tailed hamster (Tscherskia triton)  ap. 1227-1230.  aEighteen polymorphic microsatellite markers were developed for the greater long-tailed hamster (Tscherskia triton), a species of interest across northern China.

The furosine content in semimembranosus muscles separated from legs tumbled for 25, 45, and 65 h and then subsequently heat treated at 65, 75, and 85 degrees C for different times is not dependent on tumbling time. Raw muscles with various quantities of dextrose added (between 0.25 and 1.50 g/100g) after heat treatment at 80 degrees C for different time periods display a quantity of furosine that is directly correlated to the amount of added dextrose. A highly significant correlation (P < 0.001) between the furosine index (FI = milligrams of furosine per 100 g of protein divided by percent dextrose) and the intensity of the heat treatment, expressed in terms of C0 (equivalent time at 80 degrees C), was noted for semimembranosus muscle heated for different lengths of time and in various temperature conditions. 3aglucose 3aham 3aheat treatment 3alegs 3amuscles 3atemperature1 aSpagnolello, A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g1997 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.4080-4083x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf970116n3Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01954naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245005300165300001600218520084600234650001901080650001401099650002201113650001601135700002301151700002301174700001701197700001801214700001901232700002801251700001801279700002001297773012501317852000901442856008301451930003301534946001301567655001201580IND4408273520221116154135.0080726e20080725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827352DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11596632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWagner, Katherine10aEntangling the Spatial Properties of Laser Beams  ap. 541-543.  aPosition and momentum were the first pair of conjugate observables explicitly used to illustrate the intricacy of quantum mechanics. We have extended position and momentum entanglement to bright optical beams. Applications in optical metrology and interferometry require the continuous measurement of laser beams, with the accuracy fundamentally limited by the uncertainty principle. Techniques based on spatial entanglement of the beams could overcome this limit, and high-quality entanglement is required. We report a value of 0.51 for inseparability and 0.62 for the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion, both normalized to a classical limit of 1. These results are a conclusive optical demonstration of macroscopic position and momentum quantum entanglement and also confirm that the resources for spatial multimode protocols are available. 3ainterferometry 3ametrology 3aquantum mechanics 3auncertainty1 aJanoušek, Jiří.1 aDelaubert, Vincent1 aZou, Hongxin1 aHarb, Charles1 aTreps, Nicolas1 aMorizur, Jean François1 aLam, Ping Koy1 aBachor, Hans A.0 tScience.g2008 July 25, v. 321, no. 5888 p.541-543dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11596633Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02219naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245006700170300001600237500001500253520095300268650001001221650002201231650001101253650001301264650001501277650002501292650001601317650001001333650000901343650002801352650001601380650001301396650001801409653001301427653003201440653001001472653002301482700001701505773010101522852000901623856008501632930003301717946001101750655001201761IND4449091020221116154002.0110211e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444909102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10709-010-9537-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLachapelle, Marc Y. 10aInactivation dates of the human and guinea pig vitamin C genes  ap. 199-207.  a2019-12-04  aThe capacity to biosynthesize ascorbic acid has been lost in a number of species including primates, guinea pigs, teleost fishes, bats, and birds. This inability results from mutations in the GLO gene coding for L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the enzyme responsible for catalyzing the last step in the vitamin C biosynthetic pathway. We analyzed available primate and rodent GLO gene sequences to determine their evolutionary history. We used a method based on sequence comparisons of lineages with and without functional GLO genes to calculate inactivation dates of 61 and 14 MYA for the primate and guinea pig genes, respectively. These estimates are consistent with previous phylogeny-based estimates. An analysis of transposable element distribution in the primate and rodent GLO sequences did not reveal conclusive evidence that illegitimate recombination between repeats has contributed to the loss of exons in the primate and guinea pig genes. 3abirds 3asequence analysis 3ahumans 3amutation 3aChiroptera 3abiochemical pathways 3aguinea pigs 3aexons 3afish 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3atransposons 3aPrimates 3aascorbic acid 0aGLO gene 0aL-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase 0agenes 0aUnitary pseudogene1 aDrouin, Guy 0 tGenetica.g2011 Feb., v. 139, no. 2 p.199-207dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-010-9537-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110211b20110305c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02076naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245008800162300001600250520100600266650002101272650001401293650002601307650001101333650001201344650002201356650001901378650001101397650001801408650003701426773012501463852000901588856008301597930003301680946001301713655001201726IND4408273020221116153928.0080726e20080725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827302DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11528002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUrban, Knut W.10aStudying Atomic Structures by Aberration-Corrected Transmission Electron Microscopy  ap. 506-510.  aSeventy-five years after its invention, transmission electron microscopy has taken a great step forward with the introduction of aberration-corrected electron optics. An entirely new generation of instruments enables studies in condensed-matter physics and materials science to be performed at atomic-scale resolution. These new possibilities are meeting the growing demand of nanosciences and nanotechnology for the atomic-scale characterization of materials, nanosynthesized products and devices, and the validation of expected functions. Equipped with electron-energy filters and electron-energy-loss spectrometers, the new instruments allow studies not only of structure but also of elemental composition and chemical bonding. The energy resolution is about 100 milli-electron volts, and the accuracy of spatial measurements has reached a few picometers. However, understanding the results is generally not straightforward and only possible with extensive quantum-mechanical computer calculations. 3achemical bonding 3acomputers 3aelemental composition 3aenergy 3afilters 3amaterials science 3ananotechnology 3aoptics 3aspectrometers 3atransmission electron microscopy0 tScience.g2008 July 25, v. 321, no. 5888 p.506-510dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11528003Available from publisher's Web site  a20080726b20080801c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02207naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245003600205300001600241506007600257520064500333506003700978650003501015650001801050650002601068650002001094650001701114700001601131700001701147700002101164700001601185700002501201700002001226700003601246700001901282700002201301700002401323700002401347700002301371700002201394700002201416773012501438852000901563856008301572930003301655946001301688655001201701IND4408273220221207064154.0080726e20080725xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440827322DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11603552doi7 aPMC28356912pmcid7 a186538842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrant, Robert M.10aWhither or Wither Microbicides?  ap. 532-534.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAfter disappointing results from all efficacy trials conducted to date, the field of microbicides research now faces substantial challenges. Poor coordination among interested parties and the choice of nonvalidated scientific targets for phase III studies have hampered progress and created mistrust about the use of microbicides as a method to prevent HIV-1 sexual transmission. Although new promising strategies are available, there will need to be serious reappraisals of how decisions are made to advance the next generations of candidates into clinical trials, and the use of appropriate animal models in this process will be critical.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aanimal models 3aanti-infective agents 3aclinical trials 3astakeholders1 aHamer, Dean1 aHope, Thomas1 aJohnston, Rowena1 aLange, Joep1 aLederman, Michael M.1 aLieberman, Judy1 aMiller, C.

We used the three-dimensionally digitized response variables and the size and distance of trees growing within a 5-m radius of the study trees to establish a relationship between tree performance and the effect of competing neighbouring tree species on crown architecture. B. pendula was able to modify its crown architecture and thus alter its strategy to compete with different neighbours. Trees of B. pendula growing beside species counterparts had the highest growth of new long shoots in relation to the already existing branch length [growth vigour (GV)], while GV was the lowest next to L. sibirica. With B. pendula or P. sylvestris as its main neighbour, B. pendula invested in short shoots by growing them rather densely in short branches with limited numbers, whereas with L. sibirica the number, length and angle of the branches were high. The competitive response was also strongly dependent on tree ontogeny and the shoot and branch characteristics were significantly affected by their location inside the crown. B. pendula was able to respond to the challenges posed by its neighbours, which was also reflected in the GV. The ability to maintain steady growth with alternative crown designs in different neighbourhoods reflects plasticity in the crown responses. 3aAlnus glutinosa 3aBetula pendula 3aLarix sibirica 3aPinus sylvestris 3abranches 3aontogeny 3ashoots 3atrees 3avigor 0aCompetition 0aCrown architecture 0aShoot growth 0aNeighbour effect1 aKaitaniemi, Pekka 0 tTrees.g2010 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.411-424dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-010-0409-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03656naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100002100155245011900176300001800295500002400313520194900337650001302286650001902299650002502318650001002343650002102353650002002374650002402394650002002418650002002438650001702458650001102475650001702486650002002503650002302523650002102546650002802567650001702595650002702612650001302639650002302652650002302675653001902698700001802717700002002735700001802755773015002773852000902923856007702932930003303009945002503042946001103067655001203078IND4397560420140724000000.0071106e20070815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439756042DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28922doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aR100 0aR3001 aFernández, S.S.10aSaltbush (Atriplex lampa) leaf protein concentrate by ultrafiltration for use in balanced animal feed formulations  ap. 1850-1857.  aIncludes references  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of ultrafiltration and discontinuous diafiltration (DD) to obtain a protein concentrate from Atriplex lampa saltbush, improving its palatability by decreasing the salt content (mainly sodium and potassium chloride). The experimental work was done using a Pellicon® cassette (25 units) system equipped with polyethersulfone organic membranes with a molecular weight cut-off value of 10 kD. The characteristic of the membranes and the feed material, the parameters and operational conditions were studied in the pretreatment of the sample as well as in the ultrafiltration process to obtain a maximum performance. The product obtained contained 85% protein on aa dry weight basis and a marked decrease in salt content, from 40% in fresh leaves to 2.5% after processing by DD, which is in agreement with the average conductivity values observed, from 18.1 mS cm-1 in the initial aqueous alkaline extract to a final value of 3.5 mS cm(-1). Measurements of normalized water permeability were determined after each wash cycle in order to verify the flow recovery through the membrane. Analysis of amino acids from the protein concentrate with a chemical score of 85.13 was calculated using a Food Agricultural Organization reference pattern (sulfur amino acids as limiting amino acids). Nitrogen retention was evaluated by means of a biological test and the following values were obtained: net protein utilization = 63.00 ± 4.00, true digestibility = 79.00 ± 5.21, and biological value = 79.80. The presence of oxalic acid, nitrates, saponins, phenolic compounds and condensate tannins is not significant. The results indicate that the concentrate obtained has a high content of lysine, making these products particularly useful as a complement for cereal flour, which is deficient in this amino acid. The determined values suggest that the product can be used in balanced animal feed formulation. 3aAtriplex 3aplant proteins 3aprotein concentrates 3afeeds 3afeed supplements 3adietary protein 3aprotein supplements 3aultrafiltration 3afeed processing 3apalatability 3aleaves 3asalt content 3asodium chloride 3apotassium chloride 3amolecular weight 3aelectrical conductivity 3apermeability 3aamino acid composition 3anitrogen 3anutrient retention 3adigestible protein 0aAtriplex lampa1 aMenéndez, C.1 aMucciarelli, S.1 aPadilla, A.P.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 Aug. 15, v. 87, no. 10 p.1850-1857dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28923Available from publisher's Web site  a20080624b20080704c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/06/03  aNon-US 7aarticle03099naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008200174300001800256520162100274650001801895650002301913650001101936650003001947650002001977650001501997650001502012650002102027650001302048650001402061650002302075650001302098650001102111650001502122650001402137650000702151650001202158650001202170650001502182650001502197651001102212651001602223651001802239653002002257653003002277773011702307852000902424856009202433930003302525946001102558655001202569IND4438330620221116153826.0100611e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443833062DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02442.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFriberg, Nikolai.10aPressure-response relationships in stream ecology: introduction and synthesis  ap. 1367-1381.  a1. The articles in this Special Issue on pressure-response relationships in stream ecology cover a range of pressures including acidification, excess loading of metals, nutrients and organic matter to stream ecosystems and changes in riparian and catchment land use. Impacts on the biota (macroinvertebrates), ranging from single species to community responses, are addressed over a multitude of spatial scales using large data sets. 2. The majority of articles are based on monitoring data compiled as part of the EU-funded project REBECCA, but the Special Issue also includes articles from outside Europe (US and New Zealand) as well of studies using other data sources. 3. Results from the six articles gave new insights of relevance to water managers and documented that large-scale monitoring can be an asset to freshwater science. The large data sets enable a range of analytical approaches that single out important patterns in highly variable data.: importance of humic substances in reducing the negative impact of low pH; impact of very low levels of BOD (<2 mg L⁻¹); higher sensitivity of trait-based metrics compared with identity-based metrics and importance of catchment and riparian vegetation for the ecological quality of streams. 3. We advocate an increased use of monitoring and survey data in addressing questions relevant to scientist and end-users, but issues relating to especially data quality should be considered. In future, the use of these data could increase knowledge exchange between the scientific community and managers with the ultimate aim of improving our freshwater resources. 3aacidification 3aanalytical methods 3aassets 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3afreshwater 3ahumic substances 3aland use 3alimnology 3amacroinvertebrates 3amanagers 3ametals 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3apH 3astreams 3asurveys 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aEurope 3aNew Zealand 3aUnited States 0alarge data sets 0awater framework directive0 tFreshwater biology.g2010 July, v. 55, no. 7 p.1367-1381dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02442.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100612b20100703c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02736naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005000169300002000219520165600239592002801895650001501923650001501938650001901953650001601972650001001988650002201998650002102020650001302041700001602054700002202070700002502092700001502117700002202132773011302154856008602267852000902353655001202362IND60551551420221123003148.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055155142DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b029152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeale, Brendon10aDigital Microfluidics for Immunoprecipitation  ap. 10223-10230.  aImmunoprecipitation (IP) is a common method for isolating a targeted protein from a complex sample such as blood, serum, or cell lysate. In particular, IP is often used as the primary means of target purification for the analysis by mass spectrometry of novel biologically derived pharmaceuticals, with particular utility for the identification of molecules bound to a protein target. Unfortunately, IP is a labor-intensive technique, is difficult to perform in parallel, and has limited options for automation. Furthermore, the technique is typically limited to large sample volumes, making the application of IP cleanup to precious samples nearly impossible. In recognition of these challenges, we introduce a method for performing microscale IP using magnetic particles and digital microfluidics (DMF-IP). The new method allows for 80% recovery of model proteins from approximately microliter volumes of serum in a sample-to-answer run time of approximately 25 min. Uniquely, analytes are eluted from these small samples in a format compatible with direct analysis by mass spectrometry. To extend the technique to be useful for large samples, we also developed a macro-to-microscale interface called preconcentration using liquid intake by paper (P-CLIP). This technique allows for efficient analysis of samples >100× larger than are typically processed on microfluidic devices.

An interesting group of compounds for which pronounced activity against this phenomenon can be expected consists of low molecular weight substances (osmolytes) which have the ability to change protein stability. Here we investigate the influence of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in acidic solution (pH=2) on the fibrillation of hen egg white lysozyme (HEWL). The process was monitored by five techniques: circular dichroism in the UV region, atomic force microscopy, dynamic light scattering, densimetry and gel electrophoresis. The obtained results show that protonated TMAO in a concentration of 400mM inhibits amyloidogenesis. In the conditions of the experiment the HEWL molecules form clusters about 30nm in diameter containing a relatively high fraction of covalent-bonded dimers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamyloid 3aatomic force microscopy 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3aegg albumen 3agel electrophoresis 3ahens 3alight scattering 3alysozyme 3amolecular weight 3apH 3aprotein aggregates 3aprotein folding 3atrimethylamine 0aHen egg white lysozyme 0aProtein aggregation 0aProtein dimerisation 0aTrimethylamine N-oxide 0aAmyloid inhibition1 aKrakowiak, Joanna1 aSzociński, Michał1 aLustig, Zofia1 aOlszewski, Marcin1 aSzostak, Kamila0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2014 Sept., v. 70 p.214-221dElsevier B.V.x0141-81307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.06.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04448naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245012800175300001600303500001500319520245100334592002802785650002602813650001402839650002402853650001902877650001802896650001302914650001202927650001202939650001102951650001102962650001302973650002302986650001103009650001103020650001203031650001303043650002403056650001303080650001303093650001403106650001003120650001503130650001503145650000903160650001303169650002203182650001803204650001503222650001403237650000703251650001303258653001903271653001803290653002203308653001603330653002003346653001803366700001803384700002103402700002203423700001903445700002203464700001803486773010203504856008703606852000903693655001203702IND60545616120221118182824.0160902e20141115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054561612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCambier, Philippe10aImpact of long-term organic residue recycling in agriculture on soil solution composition and trace metal leaching in soils  ap. 560-573.  a2019-12-06  aRecycling composted organic residues in agriculture can reduce the need of mineral fertilizers and improve the physicochemical and biological properties of cultivated soils. However, some trace elements may accumulate in soils following repeated applications and impact other compartments of the agrosystems. This study aims at evaluating the long-term impact of such practices on the composition of soil leaching water, especially on trace metal concentrations. The field experiment QualiAgro started in 1998 on typical loess Luvisol of the Paris Basin, with a maize–wheat crop succession and five modalities: spreading of three different urban waste composts, farmyard manure (FYM), and no organic amendment (CTR). Inputs of trace metals have been close to regulatory limits, but supplies of organic matter and nitrogen overpassed common practices. Soil solutions were collected from wick lysimeters at 45 and 100cm in one plot for each modality, during two drainage periods after the last spreading. Despite wide temporal variations, a significant effect of treatments on major solutes appears at 45cm: DOC, Ca, K, Mg, Na, nitrate, sulphate and chloride concentrations were higher in most amended plots compared to CTR. Cu concentrations were also significantly higher in leachates of amended plots compared to CTR, whereas no clear effect emerged for Zn. The influence of amendments on solute concentrations appeared weaker at 1m than at 45cm, but still significant and positive for major anions and DOC. Average concentrations of Cu and Zn at 1m depth lied in the ranges [2.5; 3.8] and [2.5; 10.5μg/L], respectively, with values slightly higher for plots amended with sewage sludge compost or FYM than for CTR. However, leaching of both metals was less than 1% of their respective inputs through organic amendments. For Cd, most values were <0.05μg/L. So, metals added through spreading of compost or manure during 14years may have increased metal concentrations in leachates of amended plots, in spite of increased soil organic matter, factor of metal retention. Indeed, DOC, also increased by amendments, favours the mobility of Cu; whereas pH variations, depending on treatments, influence negatively the solubility of Zn. Generic adsorption functions of these variables partly explain the variations of trace metal concentrations and helped to unravel the numerous processes induced by regular amendments with organic waste products.  aPublisher supplied data 3afield experimentation 3aleachates 3amineral fertilizers 3aanimal manures 3asoil solution 3asulfates 3acadmium 3asolutes 3aanions 3asodium 3adrainage 3atemporal variation 3abasins 3acopper 3acalcium 3acomposts 3asoil organic matter 3aleaching 3aLuvisols 3apotassium 3aloess 3asolubility 3aadsorption 3azinc 3anitrogen 3along term effects 3asewage sludge 3alysimeters 3amagnesium 3apH 3anitrates 0aorganic matter 0aOrganic waste 0aOrganic amendment 0aHeavy metal 0aCultivated soil 0aTrace element1 aPot, Valérie1 aMercier, Vincent1 aMichaud, Aurélia1 aBenoit, Pierre1 aRevallier, Agathe1 aHouot, Sabine0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Nov. 15, v. 499 p.560-573dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02268naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245011900159300002000278520106700298592002801365650002401393650001601417650001701433650001201450650002001462650000901482650002201491650001301513650001301526650001401539650001301553650001201566700002001578700001801598700001601616700002001632773012301652856007401775852000901849655001201858IND60667525020221120225519.0190919e20150519xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066752502DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05159b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Tzu-Heng10aHydroxyl radical-induced etching of glutathione-capped gold nanoparticles to oligomeric Auᴵ–thiolate complexes  ap. 45158-45164.  aThiol-induced core etching of gold nanoparticles is a general method for the production of gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) of various sizes. This paper is the first report on the efficient reaction of glutathione-capped gold nanoparticles (GSH-AuNPs) with hydroxyl radicals to produce oligomeric Auᴵ–thiolate complexes at ambient temperature. Also, hydroxyl radicals can etch commercially available gold nanoparticles (100 nm); this strategy can be applied for the removal of gold from scrap electronics. Additionally, proteins can trigger the aggregation of oligomeric Auᴵ–thiolate complexes under neutral conditions resulting in the formation of fluorescent AuNCs. For example, the reaction of trypsin, lysozyme, and glucose oxidase with oligomeric Auᴵ–thiolate complexes produces Au₅, Au₈, and Au₁₃ clusters with emission maxima at 415, 460, and 535 nm, respectively. Interestingly, trypsin- and glucose oxidase-stabilized AuNCs could sense GSH and glucose via GSH-induced etching of AuNCs and H₂O₂-mediated oxidation of AuNCs, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aelectronics 3afluorescence 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3agold 3ahydroxyl radicals 3alysozyme 3ananogold 3aoxidation 3aproteins 3atrypsin1 aNieh, Chih-Chun1 aShih, Ya-Chen1 aKe, Chen-Yi1 aTseng, Wei-Lung0 tRSC advances.g2015 May 19, v. 5, no. 56 p.45158-45164dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05159b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03307naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012400170300002000294500001500314520166900329592002801998650001102026650003002037650001602067650001902083650002002102650001502122650003502137650001502172650001702187650002802204650002802232650001102260650001502271650001302286650001902299650003002318650001202348650001402360650001802374653001702392700002102409700001902430700002002449700001702469700002202486700001902508700001802527773011302545856008602658852000902744655001202753IND60551551520221123020536.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055155152DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b029202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xin-Chun10aPlant Cell Wall-Penetrable, Redox-Responsive Silica Nanoprobe for the Imaging of Starvation-Induced Vesicle Trafficking  ap. 10231-10236.  a2019-12-06  aAutophagy is a self-protection process against reactive oxygen species (ROS). The intracellular level of ROS increased when cells were cultured under nutrient starvation. Antioxidants such as glutathione and ascorbic acid play an important role in ROS removal. However, the cellular redox state in the autophagic pathway is still unclear. Herein, we developed a new redox-sensitive probe with a disulfide-linked silica scaffold to enable the sensing of the reduction environment in cell organelles. This redox-responsive silica nanoprobe (ReSiN) could penetrate the plant cell wall and release fluorescent molecules in response to redox states. By applying the ReSiN to tobacco BY-2 cells and tracing the distribution of fluorescence, we found a higher reducing potential in the central vacuole than in the autolysosomes. Upon cysteine protease inhibitor (E64-c) treatment in sucrose-free medium, the disulfide-silica structures of the ReSiNs were broken down in the vacuoles but were not degraded and were accumulated in the autolysosomes. These results reveal the feasibility of our nanoprobe for monitoring the endocytic and macroautophagic pathways. These pathways merge upstream of the central vacuole, which is the final destination of both pathways. In addition, different redox potentials were observed in the autophagic pathway. Finally, the expression of the autophagy-related protein (Atg8) fused with green fluorescence protein confirmed that the ReSiN treatment itself did not induce the autophagic pathway under normal physiological conditions, indicating the versatility of this nanoprobe in studying stimuli-triggered autophagy-related trafficking.  aPublisher supplied data 3asilica 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aglutathione 3aimage analysis 3aredox potential 3amonitoring 3acysteine proteinase inhibitors 3acell walls 3afluorescence 3aphysiological transport 3areactive oxygen species 3aresins 3astarvation 3avacuoles 3acultured cells 3acellular microenvironment 3atobacco 3aautophagy 3aascorbic acid 0aantioxidants1 aInoue-Aono, Yuko1 aMoriyasu, Yuji1 aHsieh, Pei-Ying1 aTu, Wei-Ming1 aHsiao, Shae-Chien1 aJane, Wan-Neng1 aHsu, Hsin-Yun0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Oct. 18, v. 88, no. 20 p.10231-10236dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b029203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245011000175300001400285520165000299592002801949650002401977650002402001650001902025650001602044650002502060650002902085650000902114650000802123650001602131650001202147650001502159650000902174650001802183650001902201650000902220650001202229650003202241650002102273650002302294650001102317653001602328653000902344653001802353653001302371653001202384700001702396700002202413700001502435700001702450700001302467700001802480773010602498856009002604852000902694655001202703IND60526396220221120075114.0190405e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052639622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.12.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCiliberti, M.G.10aRole of different sources of dietary PUFA supplementation on sheep welfare under high ambient temperature  ap. 32-38.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of different sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) supplemented in the diet on the welfare of lactating sheep exposed to high ambient temperature. The experiment was conducted during summer, it involved 32 ewes divided into 4 groups, and lasted 6 weeks. All groups were fed twice daily and received 1.8kg/ewe/d of oat hay. The control group also received 1kg/ewe/d of pelleted concentrate, whereas ewes in the experimental groups were supplemented with whole flaxseed (FS), seaweed Ascophyllum nodosum (Tasco®, AG), or their combination (FS+AG). At the beginning of the experiment, and weekly thereafter, the respiration rate, rectal temperature, body condition score (BCS) and body weight of the ewes were recorded. Milk samples were collected from each ewe weekly for the determination of the chemical composition, somatic cell count, and coagulating properties. Milk samples were also analyzed for their concentration of plasmin. Flaxseed diet during heat stress resulted in a reduction of the respiration rate, and in an increase of both milk and fat yield. The PUFA in the combined diet influenced the rectal temperature, and the respiration rate; also the milk yield and the concentration of plasmin (PL) increased in FS+AG diet. The lowest value of BCS recorded in ewes receiving the AG diet together with a rise in the respiration rate and rectal temperature suggested poor sheep welfare. Furthermore, sheep receiving the AG diet showed a consistent increase in the milk PL concentration that was responsible of the increase of milk clotting time and rate of clot formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3aambient temperature 3abody condition 3abody weight 3achemical composition 3adietary nutrient sources 3aewes 3ahay 3aheat stress 3alinseed 3amacroalgae 3amilk 3amilk clotting 3amilk fat yield 3aoats 3aplasmin 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3arespiratory rate 3asomatic cell count 3asummer 0aHeat stress 0aPUFA 0aSheep welfare 0aFlaxseed 0aSeaweed1 aAlbenzio, M.1 aAnnicchiarico, G.1 aMarino, R.1 aSantillo, A.1 aSevi, A.1 aCaroprese, M.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Feb., v. 135 p.32-38dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.12.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02498naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002200154245011400176300001600290520135700306592002801663650001501691650001201706650001401718650001001732650002001742650001001762650001901772650002701791650001101818700002201829700001801851773018201869856008802051852000902139655001202148IND60125923720221120192214.0150428e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012592372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.01965.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, Ximena J.10aWidespread reliance on olfactory sex and species identification by lyssomanine and spartaeine jumping spiders  ap. 664-677.  aJumping spiders (Salticidae) are renowned for their exceptional vision, but this does not preclude use of other senses. Here we provide evidence that olfactory pheromones are widespread in the Spartaeinae and Lyssomaninae, two subfamilies regarded as basal clades within the Salticidae. Pheromone use by salticids was tested in a series of experiments: males were tested with the odour of conspecific females, heterospecific females, and conspecific males, and females were tested with the odour of conspecific males. With seven of the 29 species tested, we also tested males using the draglines of conspecific females (spider absent) as the odour source. Males of all species tested were attracted to the odour of conspecific females and to the odour of the draglines of conspecific females. There was no evidence of males responding to the odour of heterospecific females or conspecific males, or of females responding to the odour of conspecific males. These findings suggest that it is primarily males that respond to olfactory sex pheromones, consistent with the apparent trend within spiders of males more actively searching for females and females placing greater emphasis on mate‐choice decisions. Compared with most salticid groups, lyssomanines and spartaeines are unusually sedentary and this lifestyle may favour olfactory mate searching.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalticidae 3afemales 3alifestyle 3amales 3amating behavior 3aodors 3asex pheromones 3aspecies identification 3avision1 aWarui, Charles M.1 aJackson, Rob,0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2012 Nov., v. 107, no. 3 p.664-677dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2012.01965.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03771naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245014000156500002000296520179000316592002802106596006602134596006602200596006602266596006602332596006602398596009202464596005502556650001102611650001502622650002002637650001502657650001502672650001302687650001102700650002102711650001302732650002402745650001702769651001002786700005702796700001702853700005802870700005702928700005702985773013703042856007703179852000903256655001203265IND60773488920221119142841.0220415e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077348892DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JB0220092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKong, Kai10aThermal Alteration History of the Fenghuoshan Group, Hoh Xil Basin, Northern Tibetan Plateau: Insights From Clumped Isotope Thermometry  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe carbonate clumped isotope (Δ₄₇) thermometer has been widely used for paleoclimatic and paleo‐elevation reconstructions in sedimentary basins. Its reliable use requires that carbonates are free from later diagenetic alteration and retain their depositional Δ₄₇ compositions, which is not always the case during the burial history of a basin. Therefore, identifying the alteration mechanisms that occurred during burial is essential for the correct interpretation of Δ₄₇ signatures. In this study, we used the Δ₄₇ thermometer to investigate possible carbonate alteration during burial of the Fenghuoshan Group (FHSG) in the Hoh Xil Basin, northern Tibetan Plateau, China. The Δ₄₇ temperatures [T(Δ₄₇)] of 30 carbonate samples through the ∼4.5 km thickness of the FHSG range from 51 to 132°C and exceed the surface temperature, implying the effects of thermal alteration on FHSG carbonates. The T(Δ₄₇) values combined with the water‐rock exchange model, indicating that the alteration occurred under closed burial conditions at low water:rock ratios. The solid‐state reordering model fails to predict the Δ₄₇ values, even with a modified time‐temperature history. In contrast, most measured Δ₄₇ values are in agreement with predictions from recrystallization models. Therefore, the proposed alteration scenario is that FHSG carbonates underwent progressive microscale recrystallization during deep burial and subsequent exhumation, during which process recrystallized carbonate equilibrated with ambient burial temperature and therefore modified Δ₄₇ values. This study highlights the potential of Δ₄₇ thermometry and related models for evaluating the burial history and diagenesis of carbonates in sedimentary basins.  aPublisher supplied data  a41991325cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41722301cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a41973003cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a42003001cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  a42021002cNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)  aGML2019ZD0308cSouthern Marine Science and Engineering Guangdong Laboratory (Guangzhou)  a2019SZJJ‐09cGuangzhou Institute of Geochemistry 3abasins 3acarbonates 3acrystallization 3adiagenesis 3ageophysics 3aisotopes 3amodels 3apaleoclimatology 3aresearch 3asurface temperature 3athermometers 3aChina1 aDeng, Wenfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1722-80311 aGuo, Yangrui1 aJin, Chunsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2944-23581 aLiu, Qingsong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9472-49041 aWei, Gangjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9620-00870 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Oct., v. 126, no. 10 p.e2021JB022009-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB0220093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02188naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015900157300002000316520104500336592002801381650001501409650003001424650000901454650001101463650001101474650001701485650001101502650001601513700001601529700001501545700001301560700001601573700001801589773012401607856007401731852000901805655001201814IND60667525220221120235634.0190919e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066752522DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05164a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Lin Lin10aExploring the influence of electron donating/withdrawing groups on hexamolybdate-based derivatives for efficient p-type dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)  ap. 39821-39827.  aA series of polyoxometalates (POMs)-based dyes with electron donating/withdrawing groups were investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations. The light harvesting efficiency (LHE), dye regeneration efficiency (DRE), charge recombination efficiency (CRE), holes injecting efficiency (HJE) and reorganization energy (Eᵣₑₒᵣg) were systematically evaluated. The maximum absorptions of the designed dyes with electron donating groups (systems 1–3) are red shifted comparing with those containing the electron withdrawing groups (systems 4 and 5). Different electron donating groups have significant differences on the binding energy of dye–(NiO)₄ system. In the dye regeneration, the I₂ interacts with the terminal oxygen of POM cluster. System 1 (–NH₂) balances all parameters, and it may perform better than others. Therefore, the introduction of –NH₂ into POM-based organic–inorganic hybrids may improve the performance of dye in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3adensity functional theory 3adyes 3aenergy 3aiodine 3anickel oxide 3aoxygen 3asolar cells1 aZhang, Ting1 aWang, Jing1 aLi, Hong1 aYan, Li Kai1 aSu, Zhong Min0 tRSC advances.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 5, no. 50 p.39821-39827dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05164a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02588naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100005700155245005900212300001200271520108000283592002801363650001101391650001201402650001301414650001201427650001101439650002501450650001701475650002601492650001401518650000901532650001001541650001401551650001401565650000901579650001301588650000701601650001401608650002001622650001301642650001101655650001401666650001701680650000901697653000901706653001001715653001601725653001401741653001201755653001201767700002801779773010401807856009001911852000902001655001202010IND60526396620221120075134.0190405e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052639662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.10.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatir, Gulcin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1862-643410aHow kefir fermentation can affect product composition?  ap. 1-7.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the effects of kefir fermentation on the chemical properties, as well as the vitamin and mineral compositions of hair and Saanen goat milk samples, including intensive and extensive nutritional regimes. Kefir samples were produced with natural kefir grains (2%). Chemical properties (pH, titration acidity, total solids, fat, protein and ash), vitamin (A, E, B1, B2, B3, B6 and C) and mineral (Na, K, Ca, Mg, P, Fe, Zn, Se, Cu and Mn) compositions were analyzed using liquid chromatography.Kefir made from hair goat milk had a higher content of proximate values and vitamin–mineral composition. Local (indigenous) breed hair goat milk exhibited important nutritional and functional properties, including high contents of protein, fat, total solids, vitamins and minerals. This study demonstrated that feeding conditions, breeds and fermentation have significant influences on vitamin–mineral contents of milk and kefir. Both the extensive feeding regime and breeding led to enhanced concentrations of fat-soluble vitamins in milk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaanen 3aacidity 3abreeding 3acalcium 3acopper 3afat soluble vitamins 3afermentation 3afunctional properties 3agoat milk 3airon 3akefir 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amilk 3aminerals 3apH 3apotassium 3aprotein content 3aselenium 3asodium 3atitration 3atotal solids 3azinc 0aGoat 0aKefir 0aSaanen goat 0aHair goat 0aVitamin 0aMineral1 aGuzel-Seydim, Zeynep B.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2016 Jan., v. 134 p.1-7dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.10.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02813naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010200163300001200265520145600277592002801733650001301761650002001774650001601794650002001810650001901830650003001849650001301879650001601892650001501908650001801923650001601941650002401957650001401981650001301995700001502008700001702023700001302040700001702053700002102070700005402091773011902145856008202264852000902346655001202355IND60557922220221121202041.0180619e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055792222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-016-3026-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopes, A.F.10aBehavioural lateralization and shoaling cohesion of fish larvae altered under ocean acidification  ap. 243.  aRecent studies have shown that the behaviour and development of coral reef fish larvae is hampered by projected future CO₂ levels. However, it is uncertain to what extent this effect also occurs in temperate species. The effects that elevated pCO₂ (~2000 µatm) levels, which are expected to occur in coastal upwelling regions in the future, have on shoaling behaviour and lateralization (turning preference) of fish, were tested in temperate sand smelt Atherina presbyter larvae. The hypothesis that behavioural changes are caused by interference of high CO₂ with GABA-A receptor function was tested by treating larvae with a receptor antagonist (gabazine). Routine swimming speed did not differ between control and high pCO₂, but exposure to high pCO₂ for 7 days affected group cohesion, which presented a more random distribution when compared to control fish. However, this random distribution was reversed after 21 days of exposure to high CO₂ conditions. Lateralization at the individual level decreased in fish exposed to high pCO₂ for 7 and 21 days, but gabazine reversed this decline. This adds to the growing body of evidence that the effects of a more acidified environment on fish larvae behaviour are likely due to altered function of GABA-A receptors. Overall, our results suggest that future pCO₂ levels likely to occur in temperate coastal ecosystems could have an adverse effect on temperate larval fish behaviour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAtherina 3aadverse effects 3aantagonists 3abehavior change 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3acohesion 3acoral reefs 3aecosystems 3afish behavior 3afish larvae 3aocean acidification 3areceptors 3aswimming1 aMorais, P.1 aPimentel, M.1 aRosa, R.1 aMunday, P.L.1 aGonçalves, E.J.1 aFaria, A.M.1http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7969-31770 tMarine biology.g2016 Dec., v. 163, no. 12 p.243-243dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3080x0025-31627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-016-3026-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245008500207300001600292520103100308592002801339650001901367650002101386650001501407650001201422650001001434650001501444650001101459650002201470650001101492650000901503650001601512650001501528651001201543773013601555856008101691852000901772655001201781IND60619958220221120095923.0181105e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061995822DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-017-0189-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrinh, Trong Anh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8102-712214aThe Impact of Climate Change on Agriculture: Findings from Households in Vietnam  ap. 897-921.  aThis paper examines farm household-level impacts of climate change by examining the relationship between climatic variables and Vietnamese agricultural output. The Ricardian technique is applied with panel data which accounts for both adaptation strategies and household characteristics. This study proposes a two-stage Hsiao model to correct for collinearity between climatic variables and individual effects. The results show that in the dry season, increases in temperatures are beneficial to all farms in the warmer southern regions, while increases in precipitation will damage only irrigated farms in the Central and South regions. The impact of higher temperature in the wet season is similar, except that it will negatively affect net revenue of irrigated farms in the long run. More rainfall in the wet season will increase net revenue in the North region only. Finally, this study combines the estimated results with future climate scenarios to predict how future changes in climate will affect farmers on aggregate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimatic factors 3adry season 3afarmers 3afarms 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3airrigated farming 3amodels 3arain 3atemperature 3awet season 3aVietnam0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2018 Dec., v. 71, no. 4 p.897-921dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-017-0189-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001400152245012100166300001600287520129500303592002801598650001501626650001501641650002201656650001401678650001101692650003101703650002101734650001501755650001401770650001401784650001101798650000701809650002301816650001601839650001501855650002001870653001401890653002601904653001101930653000901941653002201950700001401972700001801986700001502004773013502019856008702154852000902241655001202250IND60777400620221119183255.0220706e20220630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077740062DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.05.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGao, Jing10aEnhanced adsorption of copper ions from aqueous solution by two-step DTPA-modified magnetic cellulose hydrogel beads  ap. 689-699.  aCopper contamination of water is one of the most pressing environmental problems which has attracted extensive concern in recent decades. In this study, a series of magnetic adsorbents were synthesized by two-step modified cellulose with N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine (KH-792) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) using for removal of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions. Adsorption performance of Cu(II) was systematically investigated under various treatment conditions as the effect of solution pH, contact time, initial concentration and temperature. The adsorption process was found to match better with the pseudo-second-order kinetics model, and the equilibrium adsorption data were well described by Langmuir model, which meant predominant governance of monolayer chemical adsorption. The analysis of FTIR and XPS confirmed the possible adsorption mechanism between Cu(II) and the synthesized adsorbents was electrostatic attraction and the chemical coordination. Compared with MCCs and APMC, DPMC showed higher adsorption capacity of Cu(II), reaching maximum adsorption capacity of 298.62 mg·g⁻¹ at pH 6. Given this, ease of preparation, low cost and excellent reusability, DPMC will be promising adsorbent for application in Cu(II) removal from wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acellulose 3acopper 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aethylenediamines 3agovernance 3ahydrogels 3amagnetism 3amodels 3apH 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater pollution 0aCellulose 0aChemical modification 0aSilane 0aDTPA 0aCu(II) adsorption1 aZhang, Li1 aLiu, Shejiang1 aLiu, Xiuli0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2022 June 30, v. 211 p.689-699dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2022.05.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02324naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245009700163300001600260520121100276592002801487650001801515650001601533650001101549650000901560650002201569650001001591650001701601650001201618650001101630650001101641650002301652650001101675651001001686700001601696773013601712856008101848852000901929655001201938IND60619958320221120120952.0181105e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061995832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10640-017-0186-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xuan14aThe Value of Air Quality in Chinese Cities: Evidence from Labor and Property Market Outcomes  ap. 849-874.  aUsing a dual-market sorting model of workers’ location decisions, this paper studies the capitalization of air pollution in wages and property prices across Chinese cities. To account for endogeneity of air pollution in the determination of wages and property prices, we exploit quasi-experimental variation in air quality induced by a policy subsidizing coal-based winter heating in northern China, and document a discontinuity in average air quality for cities located north and south of the policy boundary. Using data for all 288 Chinese cities in 2011, we estimate an equilibrium relationship between wages and house prices for the entire system of Chinese cities, and specify a regression discontinuity design to quantify how variation in air quality induced by the policy affects this relationship locally. Our preferred estimates of the elasticity of wages and house prices with respect to [Formula: see text] concentration are 0.53 and [Formula: see text] 0.71 respectively. At the average of our sample, the willingness to pay for a unit reduction in [Formula: see text] concentration is CNY 261.28 ([Formula: see text] USD 40.50), with a significant share reflected in labor market outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acities 3aheat 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3alabor market 3amarkets 3amodels 3aprices 3awillingness to pay 3awinter 3aChina1 aLanz, Bruno0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2018 Dec., v. 71, no. 4 p.849-874dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-017-0186-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01793naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245007200169300001600241500001900257520079400276592002801070650001801098650001201116650002101128650001801149650002401167650001001191650001201201700002101213700002001234773011101254856008101365852000901446655001201455IND60733242020221119215626.0210405e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073324202DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078210200442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelshtein, K.

The Ib moiety is an enhancer of KTP-NH₂ analgesic action. In the present study, we have tested the hypothesis that KTP-NH₂ is an enhancer of the Ib anti-inflammatory action. Moreover, the impact of the IbKTP-NH₂ conjugation on microcirculation was also evaluated by a unified approach based on intravital microscopy in the murine cremasteric muscle. Our data show that KTP-NH₂ and conjugates do not cause damage on microcirculatory environment and efficiently decrease the number of leukocyte rolling induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Isothermal titration calorimetry showed that the drugs bind to LPS directly thus contributing to LPS aggregation and subsequent elimination. In a parallel study, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR data showed that the IbKTP-NH₂ tandem adopts a preferential “stretched” conformation in lipid bilayers and micelles, with the simulations indicating that the Ib moiety is anchored in the hydrophobic core, which explains the improved partition of IbKTP-NH₂ to membranes and the permeability of lipid bilayers to this conjugate relative to KTP-NH₂. The ability to bind glycolipids concomitant to the anchoring in the lipid membranes through the Ib residue explains the analgesic potency of IbKTP-NH₂ given the enriched glycocalyx of the blood–brain barrier cells. Accumulation of IbKTP-NH₂ in the membrane favors both direct permeation and local interaction with putative receptors as the location of the KTP-NH₂ residue of IbKTP-NH₂ and free KTP-NH₂ in lipid membranes is the same.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalgesics 3ablood-brain barrier 3acalorimetry 3aglycolipids 3ahydrophobicity 3aibuprofen 3aleukocytes 3alipid bilayers 3alipopolysaccharides 3amice 3amicelles 3amicroscopy 3amolecular dynamics 3amuscles 3aneuropeptides 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apermeability 3areceptors 3atitration1 aMagalhães, Pedro R.1 aCampos, Sara R.

At first, the molecular docking experiments predicted good binding. Several MD simulations and MM-PBSA experiments confirmed the reliable binding, showing optimal kinetics and energy. As an application, resveratrol inclusion complexes with β-cyclodextrin were obtained in an aqueous alcohol medium via microwave treatment. The results of thermographic measurements of the obtained clathrates using a differential scanning calorimeter are presented, and the obtained activation energy was calculated using the Ozawa–Flynn–Wall and Friedman methods, as well as nonparametric kinetics. The effect of complexation on the kinetic parameters of thermal destruction of the β-cyclodextrin–resveratrol inclusion complex was considered. The morphology of the surface of the obtained clathrate complexes was described using a scanning electron microscope. The spectral properties of the inclusion complex were characterized by FT-IR, ¹H, and ¹³С NMR spectroscopic data. The obtained in silico, morphological, thermogravimetric, and spectral results confirmed the formation of the resveratrol–β-cyclodextrin complex. The antioxidant activities of the inclusion complex were determined to be 12.1 μg/mL, compared to 14.3 μg/mL for free resveratrol, indicating an improvement in the bioactivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aalcohols 3aantioxidants 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acalorimeters 3acomputer simulation 3aencapsulation 3aenergy 3amicrowave treatment 3aresveratrol 3aspectral analysis 3athermography 3athermogravimetry1 aFazylov, Serik 1 aBakirova, Ryszhan 1 aSarsenbekova, Akmaral 1 aPustolaikina, Irina 1 aSeilkhanov, Olzhas 1 aAlsfouk, Aisha A.1 aElkaeed, Eslam B.1 aEissa, Ibrahim H.1 aMetwaly, Ahmed M.0 tPlants.g2022 June 24, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111316783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03860naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245009700170500001900267520210100286592002802387650001002415650001202425650002102437650001802458650002202476650001202498650001102510650000902521650000902530650002002539650001702559650002202576650001002598650001502608653001402623653001502637653002402652653002102676653001902697700001902716700002102735700002002756700006302776700005902839700005902898700005702957700006003014700002203074773011603096856008503212852000903297655001203306IND60710808020221117191239.0210108e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071080802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1185212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorimoto, Junko10aRisk assessment of forest disturbance by typhoons with heavy precipitation in northern Japan  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aUnder future climate regimes, the risk of typhoons accompanied by heavy rains is expected to increase. Although the risk of disturbance to forest stands by strong winds has long been of interest, we have little knowledge of how the process is mediated by storms and precipitation. Using machine learning, we assess the disturbance risk to cool-temperate forests by typhoons that landed in northern Japan in late August 2016 to determine the features of damage caused by typhoons accompanied by heavy precipitation, discuss how the process is mediated by precipitation as inferred from the modelling results, and delineate the effective solutions for forest management to decrease the future risk in silviculture. In the results, we confirmed two types of behaviours in the model: one represents the same process as that of forest disturbance by strong wind, which has been widely studied, and another represents a unique process mediated by storms and precipitation that has not been previously investigated. Specifically, the ridges that received strong wind from the front side had the highest risk of disturbance. Precipitation increased the probability of disturbance in forest stands, and its effect was dependent on the dominant species composition. Our hypothesis regarding treefall mediated by storms and precipitation is that rainwater flows into the gaps around the tree root systems during sway and the introduction of rainwater below the root-soil plate decreases the root anchorage. The species-specific vulnerability to rainfall may depend on the volume of lateral roots. Modelling the disturbance risk helped us to examine the kinds of factors that were related to exposure and vulnerability that should be managed to effectively decrease the risk of disturbance by typhoons during future uncontrollable hazards. It is recommended to avoid silviculture on the ridges of plateaus considering the high risk estimated in this area. In addition, species with dense lateral roots would be suitable for planting because they may have high resistance to typhoons with heavy precipitation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJapan 3aclimate 3adominant species 3aforest damage 3aforest management 3aforests 3amodels 3arain 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3asilviculture 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3awind speed 0aWindthrow 0aTopography 0aTotal precipitation 0aForest structure 0aClimate change1 aAiba, Masahiro1 aFurukawa, Flavio1 aMishima, Yoshio1 aYoshimura, Nobuhiko1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0451-31051 aNayak, Sridhara1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2421-51991 aTakemi, Tetsuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7596-23731 aChihiro, Haga1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3325-63151 aMatsui, Takanori1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9441-76641 aNakamura, Futoshi0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 479 p.118521-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1185213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02303naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245007800163300002000241520124100261592002801502650001801530650001301548650001201561650002001573650002501593650001801618700001801636700001801654700002901672700003001701700001501731773012401746856007401870852000901944655001201953IND60667525820221120225501.0190919e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066752582DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05185a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiszka, Barbara M.12aA microfluidic chip for high resolution Raman imaging of biological cells  ap. 49350-49355.  aA microfluidic chip was designed, prepared and tested for integration with a confocal Raman imaging spectrometer with the specific purpose of enabling studies of individual biological cells. The design of the chip effectively overcomes the limitations arising from the high numerical aperture (NA) and short working distance objectives, which are necessary for high resolution imaging. The high confocal spatial resolution was achieved by a careful design of the geometry of the chip together with a thin, optically and Raman silent sealing window as the embedding medium for the channels. A leak-free microfluidic chip was obtained by surface plasma modification of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and optimization of the liquid loading parameters. Raman images of biological cells, which were transported by flow into the microfluidic chip, are presented as an example of a Raman-microfluidics application. The broad band Raman spectra from −50 cm⁻¹ to 3650 cm⁻¹ were recorded in 1600 frequency intervals without any signal enhancement or sample labeling. Raman images were recorded in ∼400 seconds and they typically consisted of 64 × 64 pixels with a step size of 250 nm, thus containing ∼4 × 10⁶ data points altogether.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman imaging 3ageometry 3aliquids 3aorgan-on-a-chip 3apolydimethylsiloxane 3aspectrometers1 aRho, Hoon Suk1 aYang, Yoonsun1 aLenferink, Aufried T.

Furthermore, we test whether (possibly) slow convergence or the complete lack of it may be the result of structural changes to the deterministics of each of the relative per-capita emissions series by means of the tests of Berkes et al. (Ann Stat 1140–1165, 2006) and Mayoral (Oxford Bull Econ Stat 74(2):278–305, 2012). Our results show relatively weak support for stochastic convergence of [Formula: see text] emissions, indicating that only between 30 and 40% of the countries converge to the OECD average in a stochastic sense. This weak evidence disappears if we enlarge the sample to include 4 out of the 5 BRICS, indicating that our results are not robust to the inclusion of countries which are experiencing rates of growth which are far larger than those of the OECD members. Our results also decisively indicate that a slow or lack of convergence is not the results of a structural break in the relative [Formula: see text] emissions series.  aPublisher supplied data 3aemissions 3ainternational organizations 3astochastic processes 3aEurope1 aSpagnolo, Nicola1 aZhao, Yuqian0 tEnvironmental and resource economics.g2018 Dec., v. 71, no. 4 p.923-968dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3871699x0924-64607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10640-017-0190-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03911naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002200135024001900157040001800176100001400194245008600208300001600294506007600310520195000386592002802336506003702364650002202401650001902423650001902442650001602461650000902477650002102486650002802507650001302535650002302548650001202571650002102583650001002604650001802614650001402632650001802646650000802664650003002672650001902702650002402721650001202745650001002757651001202767653000802779653000902787653000802796653000702804653000702811653003002818653002202848653001302870700001602883700002002899700001702919700001602936700001602952700001702968700001802985773010203003856008703105852000903192655001203201IND60545616920221207140905.0160902e20141015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054561692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1132doi7 aPMC46172052pmcid7 a251156052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavuk, M.10aPredictors of serum polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations in Anniston residents  ap. 624-634.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Anniston Community Health Survey was a community-based cross-sectional study of Anniston, Alabama, residents who live in close proximity to a former PCB production facility to identify factors associated with serum PCB levels. The survey comprises 765 Anniston residents who completed a questionnaire interview and provided a blood sample for analysis in 2005–2007. Several reports based on data from the Anniston survey have been previously published, including associations between PCB exposure and diabetes and blood pressure. In this study we examine demographic, behavioral, dietary, and occupational characteristics of Anniston survey participants as predictors of serum PCB concentrations. Of the 765 participants, 54% were White and 45% were African-American; the sample was predominantly female (70%), with a mean age of 55years. Serum PCB concentrations varied widely between participants (range for sum of 35 PCBs: 0.11–170.4ng/g wet weight). Linear regression models with stepwise selection were employed to examine factors associated with serum PCBs. Statistically significant positive associations were observed between serum PCB concentrations and age, race, residential variables, current smoking, and local fish consumption, as was a negative association with education level. Age and race were the most influential predictors of serum PCB levels. A small age by sex interaction was noted, indicating that the increase in PCB levels with age was steeper for women than for men. Significant interaction terms indicated that the associations between PCB levels and having ever eaten locally raised livestock and local clay were much stronger among African-Americans than among White participants. In summary, demographic variables and past consumption of locally produced foods were found to be the most important predictors of PCB concentrations in residents living in the vicinity of a former PCB manufacturing facility.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAfrican Americans 3ablood pressure 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3aclay 3acommunity health 3across-sectional studies 3adiabetes 3aeducational status 3afemales 3afood consumption 3afoods 3alinear models 3alivestock 3amanufacturing 3amen 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asurveys 3awomen 3aAlabama 0aPCB 0aACHS 0aLOD 0aOR 0aCI 0aPolychlorinated biphenyls 0aLinear regression 0aAnniston1 aOlson, J.R.1 aWattigney, W.A.1 aDutton, N.D.1 aSjödin, A.1 aShelton, C.1 aTurner, W.E.1 aBartell, S.M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Oct. 15, v. 496 p.624-634dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04117naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245014500204300001100349520254400360592002802904596006302932650001502995650002403010650001703034650001003051650002203061650002903083650002603112650002203138650001703160650002003177650002503197651001103222700006203233700002303295700001903318700005803337700006303395773013303458856008303591852000903674655001203683IND60733242320221119215956.0220524e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073324232DNAL7 a10.1186/s12302-021-00475-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLai, Adelene1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2985-647310aRetrospective non-target analysis to support regulatory water monitoring: from masses of interest to recommendations via in silico workflows  ap. 43.  aBACKGROUND: Applying non-target analysis (NTA) in regulatory environmental monitoring remains challenging—instead of having exploratory questions, regulators usually already have specific questions related to environmental protection aims. Additionally, data analysis can seem overwhelming because of the large data volumes and many steps required. This work aimed to establish an open in silico workflow to identify environmental chemical unknowns via retrospective NTA within the scope of a pre-existing Swiss environmental monitoring campaign focusing on industrial chemicals. The research question addressed immediate regulatory priorities: identify pollutants with industrial point sources occurring at the highest intensities over two time points. Samples from 22 wastewater treatment plants obtained in 2018 and measured using liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry were retrospectively analysed by (i) performing peak-picking to identify masses of interest; (ii) prescreening and quality-controlling spectra, and (iii) tentatively identifying priority “known unknown” pollutants by leveraging environmentally relevant chemical information provided by Swiss, Swedish, EU-wide, and American regulators. This regulator-supplied information was incorporated into MetFrag, an in silico identification tool replete with “post-relaunch” features used here. This study’s unique regulatory context posed challenges in data quality and volume that were directly addressed with the prescreening, quality control, and identification workflow developed. RESULTS: One confirmed and 21 tentative identifications were achieved, suggesting the presence of compounds as diverse as manufacturing reagents, adhesives, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals in the samples. More importantly, an in-depth interpretation of the results in the context of environmental regulation and actionable next steps are discussed. The prescreening and quality control workflow is openly accessible within the R package Shinyscreen, and adaptable to any (retrospective) analysis requiring automated quality control of mass spectra and non-target identification, with potential applications in environmental and metabolomics analyses. CONCLUSIONS: NTA in regulatory monitoring is critical for environmental protection, but bottlenecks in data analysis and results interpretation remain. The prescreening and quality control workflow, and interpretation work performed here are crucial steps towards scaling up NTA for environmental monitoring.  aPublisher supplied data  aA18/BM/12341006cFonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg 3aautomation 3acomputer simulation 3adata quality 3adrugs 3aenvironmental law 3aenvironmental protection 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3aquality control 3awastewater treatment 3aEurope1 aSingh, Randolph R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4500-34001 aKovalova, Lubomira1 aJaeggi, Oliver1 aKondić, Todor1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6662-43751 aSchymanski, Emma L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6868-81450 tEnvironmental sciences Europe.g2021 Dec., v. 33, no. 1 p.43-43dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001276x2190-47077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12302-021-00475-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03063naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245019300159300002000352520157400372592002801946650002601974650002002000650004602020650001602066650002602082650001702108650002302125650002602148650001002174650002102184650000902205650002702214650002302241650002902264700001702293700002002310700001802330700001502348700001602363700001902379773012402398856007402522852000902596655001202605IND60667525920221120225507.0190919e20150610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066752592DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra05188f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaoping10aRapid quantification of a chemically synthesized peptide GAP162 in rat plasma by liquid chromatography/triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry and application to a pharmacokinetic study  ap. 51708-51716.  aLiquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a promising analytical platform for the quantification of therapeutic peptide in biological fluids for pharmacokinetics (PK) studies. Herein, an absolute quantification method based on liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) technique was developed to quantify GAP162, a new synthetic peptide derived from RasGAP₃₀₁–₃₂₆, which is a promising candidate as antitumor drug. A synthetic peptide P119 was used as internal standard. Solid phase extraction (SPE) of the mixed-mode of ion exchange and reversed-phase was employed for sample preparation. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C4 column (30 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 μm) with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile–water containing 0.1% formic acid with gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min⁻¹ for 2.0 min. Multiple reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode was performed with ion pairs of m/z: 748.2 → 830.2, and 526.7 → 585.5 for GAP162 and internal standard of P119, respectively. Calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of 5–500 ng mL⁻¹ with a correlation coefficient >0.99. The lower limit of detection was at 5 ng mL⁻¹ in rat plasma for GAP162. The results of the intra- and inter-day precision and accuracy studies were well within the acceptable limits. The validated method was successfully applied to investigate the pharmacokinetics study of GAP162 after single intravenous administration to male Sprague-Dawley rats at 5 mg kg⁻¹.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantineoplastic agents 3adetection limit 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aformic acid 3aintravenous injection 3aion exchange 3alaboratory animals 3aliquid chromatography 3amales 3apharmacokinetics 3arats 3asolid phase extraction 3asynthetic peptides 3atandem mass spectrometry1 aKang, Liping1 aZhang, Taichang1 aChen, Jianhua1 aRen, Xinyi1 aBao, Yuanwu1 aCheng, Yuanguo0 tRSC advances.g2015 June 10, v. 5, no. 64 p.51708-51716dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra05188f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02826naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100003100171245008300202300001400285520128800299592002801587650001001615650001101625650001101636650000901647650001001656650002501666650002601691650003701717650002701754650002401781650004901805650001101854650001101865650002101876650002301897650003701920650002201957650001601979700003001995700002302025700002102048700001902069700001902088773008302107856008602190990002302276852000902299655001202308IND60091875920221118060945.0141103e20120727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009187592DNAL7 a226836882pmid7 a10.1016/j.brainres.2012.05.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartínez-Jauand, Mercedes10aSomatosensory activity modulation during observation of other's pain and touch  ap. 48-55.  aWe examined whether somatosensory activity could be modulated by the observation of bodily experiences. For this purpose, somatosensory-evoked potentials elicited by non-painful stimulation were recorded when subjects were viewing a hand penetrated by a needle, touched by a cotton swab or at resting without stimulation. Participants were instructed to adopt an egocentric perspective when viewing the videos and to rate pain intensity and unpleasantness supposedly experienced by the model, as well as the unpleasantness induced by the video clips. Results indicated that pain videos were rated as more unpleasant than touch videos, and that observation of both pain and touch video clips led to a significant enhancement of P50 amplitudes as compared to viewing a hand without stimulation. Moreover, enhanced P50 amplitudes during observation of both pain and touch in others were associated with increased unpleasant ratings induced by the video clips, as well as with high scores in a perspective taking scale (IRI). These findings provide support for the involvement of an attentional bottom-up mechanism which could be responsible to enhance sensory processing of somatic information when observing bodily experiences in others irrespective of whether they are painful or not.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrain 3acotton 3amodels 3apain 2aAdult 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAttentionxphysiology 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aElectroencephalography 2aEmpathyxphysiology 2aEvoked Potentials, Somatosensoryxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aPainxpsychology 2aPhotic Stimulation 2aSomatosensory Cortexxphysiology 2aTouchxphysiology 2aYoung Adult1 aGonzález-Roldán, Ana M.1 aMuñoz, Miguel A.,1 aSitges, Carolina1 aCifre, Ignacio1 aMontoya, Pedro0 tBrain research.g2012 July 27, v. 1467 p.48-55dElsevier B.V.x0006-89937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2012.05.0553Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01485naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245016700156300001800323520037500341592002800716650001700744650001800761650001300779650001700792650002400809650001600833650002200849700002100871700002500892700002500917773012200942856007401064852000901138655001201147IND60664135420221122045602.0190910e20120730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066413542DNAL7 a10.1039/c2ra21204h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaetge, Jan10aToward ordered mesoporous rare-earth sesquioxide thin films via polymer templating: high temperature stable C-type Er₂O₃ with finely-tunable crystallite sizes  ap. 7053-7056.  aFacile polymer templating enables the production of cubic C-type Er₂O₃ thin films with a 3D honeycomb structure of 15–17 nm diameter pores and crystalline domain sizes ranging from 3–4 nm at 600 °C to ∼13 nm at 900 °C.

Although these resources remain scattered across the Internet, such databases complement each other and support efficient growth in the functional genomics area. This review presents the features and the most recent gene co-expression network databases in crops and summarises the present status of the tools that are widely used for constructing the gene co-expression network. The highlights of gene co-expression network databases and the tools presented here will pave the way for a robust interpretation of biologically relevant information. With this effort, the researcher would be able to explore and utilise gene co-expression network databases for crops improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3agenes 3agenomics 3aresearchers 3atranscriptomics1 aHarun, Sarahani 1 aVengatharajuloo, Vinothienii 1 aTamizi, Amin-Asyraf 1 aSamsulrizal, Nurul Hidayah0 tPlants.g2022 June 21, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111316253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04295naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004700113040001800160100002000178245012600198300001600324520201500340592002802355650001502383650001802398650002002416650002002436650001602456650001602472650003902488650002302527650001302550650002902563650001602592650001202608650006902620650002902689650002302718650002302741650004702764650006202811650002802873650001502901650002302916650002302939650001602962650001102978650004002989650003503029650000903064650001703073650001903090650002403109650002903133650002303162650006503185651001603250700002003266700002303286700001703309700001903326700001903345773009603364856009303460990002303553852000903576655001203585IND60088885220221122141420.0141102e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008888522DNAL7 a219824112pmid7 a10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.09.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiesor, Eric J.10aEffect of dalcetrapib, a CETP modulator, on non-cholesterol sterol markers of cholesterol homeostasis in healthy subjects  ap. 761-767.  aOBJECTIVE: Subjects with high HDL-C show elevated plasma markers of cholesterol absorption and reduced markers of cholesterol synthesis. We evaluated the effect of dalcetrapib, a cholesteryl ester transfer protein modulator, on markers of cholesterol homeostasis in healthy subjects. METHODS: Dalcetrapib was administered daily with or without ezetimibe in a randomized, open-label, crossover study in 22 healthy subjects over three 7-day periods: dalcetrapib 900mg, ezetimibe 10mg, dalcetrapib 900mg plus ezetimibe 10mg. Plasma non-cholesterol sterols lathosterol and desmosterol (cholesterol synthesis markers) and campesterol, β-sitosterol and cholestanol (intestinal cholesterol absorption markers) were measured. A hamster model was used to compare the effect of dalcetrapib and torcetrapib with or without ezetimibe on these markers and determine the effect of dalcetrapib on cholesterol absorption. RESULTS: Dalcetrapib increased campesterol, β-sitosterol, and cholestanol by 27% (p=0.001), 32% (p<0.001), and 12% (p=0.03), respectively, in man (non-cholesterol sterol/cholesterol ratio). Dalcetrapib+ezetimibe reduced campesterol by 11% (p=0.02); β-sitosterol and cholestanol were unaffected. Lathosterol and desmosterol were unchanged with dalcetrapib, but both increased with ezetimibe alone (56–148%, p<0.001) and with dalcetrapib+ezetimibe (32–38%, p<0.001). In hamsters, dalcetrapib and torcetrapib increased HDL-C by 49% (p=0.04) and 72% (p=0.003), respectively. Unlike torcetrapib, dalcetrapib altered cholesterol homeostasis towards increased markers of cholesterol absorption; cholesterol synthesis markers were unaffected by either treatment. Dalcetrapib did not change plasma ³H-cholesterol level but increased ³H-cholesterol in plasma HDL vs non-HDL, after oral dosing of labeled cholesterol. CONCLUSION: Dalcetrapib specifically increased markers of cholesterol absorption, most likely reflecting nascent HDL lipidation by intestinal ABCA1, without affecting markers of synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanimal models 3aatherosclerosis 3abeta-sitosterol 3acampesterol 3acholesterol 3acholesteryl ester transfer protein 3across-over studies 3ahamsters 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahomeostasis 2aAnimals 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aAzetidinesxpharmacology 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aCholestanolxblood 2aCholesterolxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aCholesterol Ester Transfer Proteinsxbloodxdrug effects. 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCricetinae 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDesmosterolxblood 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMesocricetus 2aModels, Animal 2aPhytosterolsxblood 2aQuinolinesxpharmacology 2aSitosterolsxblood 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 0aSwitzerland1 aChaput, Evelyne1 aStaempfli, Andreas1 aBlum, Denise1 aDerks, Michael1 aKallend, David0 tAtherosclerosis.g2011 Dec., v. 219, no. 2 p.761-767dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0021-91507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2011.09.0173Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03285naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016000173300001200333520173800345592002802083650001102111650001502122650001502137650003502152650002502187650001202212650001302224650001302237650001102250650001502261650000902276650001702285650000902302650001102311650001102322650000902333650001402342650001102356650000902367651001202376651001802388700003502406700002702441700003002468700002602498773015202524856008202676852000902758655001202767IND60619958920221120024913.0181212e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061995892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-018-7023-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIbe, Francis Chizoruo10aEnvironmental and health implications of trace metal concentrations in street dusts around some electronic repair workshops in Owerri, Southeastern Nigeria  ap. 696.  aAssessment of trace metal concentrations in street-deposited sediments around some selected electronic repair workshops in Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria, was carried out. The objective of the study was to determine the concentrations of trace metals, namely nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), and zinc (Zn), in surface dusts from streets within some electronic repair workshops in Owerri, Imo State, Nigeria. Dust samples were collected from seven locations within the month of January 2014 during the dry season when the onset of dust was high in the area. The samples were air-dried, sieved, and digested in aqua regia, with the concentrations of trace metals determined with atomic absorption spectroscopy, Agilant FS 240AA model (USA). Results of the study revealed all the trace metals assessed except Cr in dust sample from Aladinma (ALA). Though elevated concentrations of Zn and Cu were observed in all the sampled locations, the concentrations did not exceed the Dutch intervention values. Risk assessment of the heavy metals showed high average daily dose (ADD) of the heavy metals for children and adults at New Market 2 (NMK2), New Market 1 (NMK1), and Tetlow (TEL), which could be attributed to the presence of electronic repair workshops and activities of electronic scrap dealers within these areas. It was observed that the values of hazard quotient (HQ) were less than 1, while that of hazard index (HI) were all below 1–5, indicating that the heavy metals pose no health risk to adults and children in the environment. However, there may be potential danger if the waste generated from the electronic repair workshops and electronic scrap dealers are not properly disposed and managed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aair drying 3aaqua regia 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3aaverage daily intake 3acadmium 3achildren 3achromium 3acopper 3adry season 3adust 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amodels 3anickel 3arisk 3asediments 3awastes 3azinc 3aNigeria 3aUnited States1 aOpara, Alexander Iheanyichukwu1 aIbe, Bridget Onyekachi1 aAdindu, Blessing Chinonso1 aIchu, Bright Chigozie0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2018 Dec., v. 190, no. 12 p.696-696dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl33242x0167-63697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-018-7023-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100006300153245015600216300001600372520193600388592002802324650001802352650001202370650001102382650001302393650001202406650001202418650001102430650001702441650002402458650001202482650001602494650001202510650002202522650001202544650001102556650001902567650001502586650001202601650001002613651001102623653001802634653003102652653001202683653001702695653001002712653002302722700002402745700002102769773010602790856008702896852000902983655001202992IND60545617020221118175645.0160902e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054561702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZetterberg, Therese1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9500-243310aSensitivity analyses of MAGIC modelled predictions of future impacts of whole-tree harvest on soil calcium supply and stream acid neutralizing capacity  ap. 187-201.  aForest biofuel is a main provider of energy in Sweden and the market is expected to grow even further in the future. Removal of logging residues via harvest can lead to short-term acidification but the long-term effects are largely unknown. The objectives of this study were to 1) model the long-term effect of whole-tree harvest (WTH) on soil and stream water acidity and 2) perform sensitivity analyses by varying the amounts of logging residues, calcium (Ca2+) concentrations in tree biomass and site productivity in nine alternate scenarios. Data from three Swedish forested catchments and the Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) were used to simulate changes in forest soil exchangeable Ca2+ pools and stream water acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) at Gammtratten, Kindla and Aneboda. Large depletions in soil Ca2+ supply and a reversal of the positive trend in stream ANC were predicted for all three sites after WTH. However, the magnitude of impact on stream ANC varied depending on site and the concentration of mobile strong acid anions. Contrary to common beliefs, the largest decrease in modelled ANC was observed at the well-buffered site Gammtratten. The effects at Kindla and Aneboda were much more limited and not large enough to offset the general recovery from acidification. Varying the tree biomass Ca2+ concentrations exerted the largest impact on modelled outcome. Site productivity was the second most important variable whereas changing biomass amounts left on site only marginally affected the results. The outcome from the sensitivity analyses pointed in the same direction of change as in the base scenario, except for Kindla where soil Ca2+ pools were predicted to be replenished under a given set of input data. The reliability of modelled outcome would increase by using site-specific Ca2+ concentrations in tree biomass and field determined identification of site productivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3aacidity 3aanions 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acalcium 3aenergy 3aforest soils 3aforested watersheds 3aforests 3agroundwater 3alogging 3along term effects 3amarkets 3amodels 3aneutralization 3aprediction 3astreams 3atrees 3aSweden 0aAcidification 0aAcid neutralizing capacity 0aCalcium 0aForest soils 0aMAGIC 0aWhole-tree harvest1 aKöhler, Stephan J.1 aLöfgren, Stefan0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 494-495 p.187-201dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.06.1143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01976naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245007200168300002000240520092200260592002801182650002201210650002101232650002001253650001501273650001801288700002401306700002201330700003701352700002201389700001901411773011301430856008601543852000901629655001201638IND60551552420170410000000.0161019e20161018xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055155242DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b030242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Ji Yeon,10aNanometer Scale Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy Instrumentation  ap. 10284-10289.  aWe report the crucial components required to perform scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) with nanometer-scale resolution.

The length of the main inflorescence and the number of siliques produced are important traits contributing to rapeseed yield. Therefore, studying genes related to main inflorescence and silique number is beneficial to increase rapeseed yield. Herein, we focused on the effects of BnKAT2 on the main inflorescence length and silique number in B. napus. We explored the mechanism of BnKAT2 increasing the effective length of main inflorescence and the number of siliques through bioinformatics analysis, transgenic technology, and transcriptome sequencing analysis. The full BnKAT2(BnaA01g09060D) sequence is 3674 bp, while its open reading frame is 2055 bp, and the encoded protein comprises 684 amino acids. BnKAT2 is predicted to possess two structural domains, namely KHA and CNMP-binding domains. The overexpression of BnKAT2 effectively increased the length of the main inflorescence and the number of siliques in B. napus, as well as in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. The type-A Arabidopsis response regulator (A-ARR), negative regulators of the cytokinin, are downregulated in the BnKAT2-overexpressing lines. The Aux/IAA, key genes in auxin signaling pathways, are downregulated in the BnKAT2-overexpressing lines. These results indicate that BnKAT2 might regulate the effective length of the main inflorescence and the number of siliques through the auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways. Our study provides a new potential function gene responsible for improvement of main inflorescence length and silique number, as well as a candidate gene for developing markers used in MAS (marker-assisted selection) breeding to improve rapeseed yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBrassica napus 3abioinformatics 3acytokinins 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3amarker-assisted selection 3aoil crops 3arapeseed 3asiliques 3atranscriptome 3aChina1 aZhang, Yin 1 aWang, Zhen 1 aQu, Cunmin 1 aZhu, Dongming 1 aWan, Huafang 1 aLiang, Ying 0 tPlants.g2022 June 24, v. 11, no. 13dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111316793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245012700175500001900302520218900321592002802510650003002538650001002568650001902578650001702597650001502614650001502629650002302644650001302667650002002680650001702700650001902717650001102736650002402747651001402771653003302785653002102818653001702839653001402856653002402870653001302894700002002907700002302927700002102950700001802971700002402989773011603013856008503129852000903214655001203223IND60710808420221117191244.0210108e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071080842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1185362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreeman, Amanda N.D.10aEnhancing bird-mediated seed dispersal to increase rainforest regeneration in disused pasture – A restoration experiment  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFrugivorous birds are important seed dispersers but are infrequent visitors to pasture. Therefore, the recruitment of rainforest trees into disused pasture is often limited by dispersal. We studied potential seed sources, seed-dispersing birds, seed rain and seedling recruitment in an experimental management project that aimed to catalyse rainforest regeneration adjacent to old-growth forest in north-eastern Australia. To attract birds, nine semi-natural perches and water basins were installed in each of three 0.64 ha experimental plots, concurrent with herbicide control of pasture grasses. Despite a diverse avian seed-disperser community in the adjacent forest, only three species visited the plots. However, the presence of water increased seed deposition. Water basins collected twelve times as many native tree seeds as mesh seed traps (a 24-fold increase in seed deposition per unit area), including more large seeds (≥10 mm), and more species, especially of bird-dispersed forest trees. This was due to the large-gaped Pied Currawong (Strepera graculina) that deposited large seeds beneath the perches, when using water to regurgitate seeds. Deposition of large native forest tree seeds was also enhanced under perches positioned close to an already established tree or large shrub, highlighting an important indirect effect of pasture trees. Such pasture trees can themselves be effective regeneration nuclei, and their function improved by actions to suppress pasture growth and encourage dispersers. However, in this study, these interventions were not sufficient to fully mitigate barriers to rainforest regeneration. Although seed deposition was enhanced by the presence of water, semi-natural perches and pasture trees, recruited seedlings in the plots were not representative of the seed deposited. Instead they were dominated by a subset of small-diaspore, pioneer species. To further test the potential for semi-natural perches, water and pasture suppression to increase rainforest regeneration in disused pasture, requires testing of water source designs and carefully designed experimental restoration to examine dispersal and other regeneration barriers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3abirds 3aforest ecology 3aforest trees 3afrugivores 3aherbicides 3aold-growth forests 3apastures 3apioneer species 3arain forests 3aseed dispersal 3ashrubs 3aspecies recruitment 3aAustralia 0aFrugivory and seed dispersal 0aSecondary forest 0aRegeneration 0aSeed size 0aSupplementary water 0aStrepera1 aFreebody, Kylie1 aMontenero, Michael1 aMoran, Catherine1 aShoo, Luke P.1 aCatterall, Carla P.0 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 479 p.118536-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1185363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03786naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245017900167500001900346520202600365592002802391650003002419650002202449650003002471650001902501650002302520650001502543650001902558650001202577650002102589650001502610650001402625650002302639650001602662650002102678650001402699650001102713650002402724650001102748653001902759653001702778653001902795653002602814653002002840700001902860700005702879700001302936700001602949700005702965773011603022856008503138852000903223655001203232IND60710808520221117191322.0210108e20210101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071080852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1185392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFan, Zhaofei10aInvasibility of fire-managed ecosystems to the Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera) in the lower Gulf Coastal Plain, USA: Mechanisms and key factors at the landscape level  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Chinese tallow tree (Triadica sebifera, hereafter, tallow) is a nonnative invasive species that has invaded diverse ecosystems including forests, prairies and wetlands in the Gulf Coastal Plain of the southeastern United States. We proposed a landscape (ecosystem)-level modeling framework of tallow invasion and applied it to a fire-managed landscape to evaluate the effect of prescribed fire on tallow invasion and ecosystem invasibility. A spatially random sample consisting of 55 0.04-ha circular plots was installed in a landscape of appropriately 2,900 ha in the Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge in 2015. These plots, plus ten additional tallow-invaded plots from another study were measured in May-June of 2015 and remeasured in November of 2018. Across the entire landscape, pine flatwoods (invasion probability = 0.52) were generally more susceptible to tallow invasion than pine savannas (invasion probability = 0.16) (p = 0.002), and the former had a greater number of tallow seedlings and saplings (p < 0.001), but fewer large tallow trees (p = 0.07) than the latter. The effect of fire on tallow invasion is two-fold and changes with fire return intervals and ecosystem conditions. Fire may promote seed germination and seedling recruitment, but recurrent fires top-kill or even completely kill young seedlings and saplings. Large proportions of invaded plots and abundant tallow seedlings and saplings that accumulate in pine flatwoods are essentially attributed to their high overstory tree basal area but relatively low shrub/grass coverage. On sites near roadways or with tallow seed trees, short fire intervals tend to increase invasion probability and the abundance of tallow seedlings and saplings, whereas long fire intervals increase the abundance of large tallow trees. Under current fire treatments, pine flatwoods are more susceptible to seedling colonization and sapling establishment, while pine savannas favor the growth and development of large tallow trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAntigone canadensis pulla 3aTriadica sebifera 3aadministrative management 3acoastal plains 3aconservation areas 3aecosystems 3aforest ecology 3agrasses 3ainvasive species 3alandscapes 3aoverstory 3aprescribed burning 3aprobability 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3ashrubs 3aspecies recruitment 3atallow 0aChinese tallow 0aInvasibility 0aInvasion stage 0aPine flatwood/savanna 0aPrescribed fire1 aYang, Shaoyang1 aCheng, Nannan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2943-34781 aLiu, Xia1 aSong, Aiyun1 aDong, Linshui1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6249-07950 tForest ecology and management.g2021 Jan. 01, v. 479 p.118539-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl9013x0378-11277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.1185393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007600147245014000223300001600363520166200379592002802041650001402069650002702083650003302110650002002143650002002163650001502183650001102198650002102209650002302230650001502253650001102268650001102279650001802290650001502308650001602323650001302339651001102352653001502363653001402378653001402392653001602406653001302422700006302435700006902498773013902567856008102706852000902787655001202796IND60749936920221120150334.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074993692DNAL7 a10.1017/S00074853210002492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, Patricia Daniela da Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4831-591X10aCan Anastrepha fraterculus larval feeding influence chemotaxis and parasitism of Diachasmimorpha longicaudata and Aganaspis pelleranoi?  ap. 560-567.  aAnastrepha fraterculus (Diptera: Tephritidae) is a major barrier to fruit production and exportation. In Brazil, the native parasitoid Aganaspis pelleranoi (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) and the exotic parasitoid Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Hymenoptera, Braconidae) stand out as biological control agents. Knowledge of the factors that affect interactions among parasitoids, A. fraterculus, and host fruits may enhance the use of these agents in biological control programmes. This study evaluated the chemotaxis and parasitism of A. pelleranoi and D. longicaudata females reared on A. fraterculus larvae and kept on an artificial diet, red guava (Psidium guajava) or apple (Malus domestica). Females of both parasitoid species that emerged from larvae raised on artificial diet, guava or apple, were tested to Y olfactometer choice tests. In the parasitism tests, both parasitoid species were made to choose between A. fraterculus larvae brushed with water, apple pulp or guava pulp. D. longicaudata females from artificial diet (control) did not distinguish between fruit odours; however, females of D. longicaudata from larvae kept in apple or guava directed to the odours of their original fruit. The greatest parasitism for D. longicaudata occurred in the units that contained the pulp in which the larvae grew. A. pelleranoi from artificial diet preferred guava odours, including the females kept in apple. Similar results were observed in the parasitism bioassays. Our results found that A. fraterculus larval feeding influenced search behaviour and parasitism of D. longicaudata, whereas A. pelleranoi rearing experience did not affect its host choices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAganaspis 3aAnastrepha fraterculus 3aDiachasmimorpha longicaudata 3aMalus domestica 3aPsidium guajava 3aapple pulp 3aapples 3aartificial diets 3abiological control 3achemotaxis 3afruits 3aguavas 3aolfactometers 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aresearch 3aBrazil 0aBraconidae 0aFigitidae 0afruit fly 0aHymenoptera 0alearning1 aSant’ Ana, Josué1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8548-53901 aRedaelli, Luiza Rodrigues1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6418-11760 tBulletin of entomological research.g2021 Oct., v. 111, no. 5 p.560-567dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853210002493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04049naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014000164300001200304520233900316592002802655596005902683596008202742596005902824650002202883650002802905650001102933650001902944650001302963650000802976650001302984650000902997650001103006650000903017650001303026650001503039650001503054650001103069650001803080650001603098650001603114650001803130651001003148700001403158700001603172700001503188700001703203700006003220773013503280856008303415852000903498655001203507IND60745699620221119033227.0210811e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074569962DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-021-09777-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Qiang10aCombined effects of temperature and precipitation on the spring runoff generation process in a seasonal freezing agricultural watershed  ap. 490.  aThis study aims to investigate the combined effects of temperature and precipitation on the hydrological processes in a watershed with intensive agricultural land uses during the spring snowmelt period. Temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, frozen soil depth, and discharge were monitored during the freezing and thawing periods in 2014, 2015, and 2016 within the 75 km² agricultural Heidingzi watershed in northeast China. The results indicated that high autumn rainfall and early precipitation, as well as the corresponding temperature rise, during the stable freezing period, increased the amount of surface water stored in the ice form before the spring runoff. These conditions produced a prolonged and increasing runoff event, and the highest runoff ratio of the ice melt runoff process during the thawing period in 2014. However, low autumn rainfall, dispersed precipitation, and negligible temperature rises during the stable freezing period in 2014–2015 led to a significant but short-term snowmelt runoff during the thawing period in 2015. Because of similar precipitation conditions as in 2014–2015 and a temperature rise event during the freezing period in 2015–2016, the runoff during the thawing period in 2016 was a combination of snow and ice melt; the runoff ratio during the early- and late-melt stages in the maize-dominated drainage region (DR) was the highest with the lowest precipitation. Additionally, the early low rainfall during the thawing period in 2014 increased the direct runoff ratios by 2–13 times for the entire watershed, DRM, and DRP₋M, as early rainfall resulted in small soil thaw depth and low water storage. Different land use activities in the agricultural watershed supported the spatial and temporal differences and uncertainties in the spring snow or ice melt runoff generation process. Moreover, snowmelt simulation models can rarely distinguish between ice and snowmelt during spring runoff generation processes, probably leading to high uncertainty in simulating spring runoff response to climate change in seasonal freezing areas. This study reveals the characteristics and causes of snow and ice melt runoff processes in agricultural watersheds that experience seasonal freezing and provides a new perspective for improving the modeling of water generation processes.  aPublisher supplied data  a51790532cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC0402405cState's Key Project of Research and Development Plan of China  a51909175cnational natural science foundation of china 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural watersheds 3aautumn 3aclimate change 3adrainage 3aice 3aland use 3arain 3arunoff 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3asoil depth 3asoil water 3aspring 3asurface water 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3awater storage 3aChina1 aTan, Xiao1 aZeng, Qiang1 aZhao, Hang1 aWu, Jing-wei1 aHuang, Jie-sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6579-91030 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2021 Aug., v. 80, no. 15 p.490-490dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000001228x1866-62807nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-021-09777-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03100naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245008700177300001600264520140300280592002801683650001601711650002401727650002301751650002101774650001701795650001901812650001901831650001301850650002301863650004401886650001501930650001401945650001401959650001701973650002001990650001402010650002102024653001602045653001802061653002202079653001202101700002402113700002902137700002502166700006402191700006202255700002402317773012502341856008302466852000902549655001202558IND60737639120221117235712.0210904e20211115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073763912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.05.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOspennikov, Alexander S.10aTransformations of wormlike surfactant micelles induced by a water-soluble monomer  ap. 590-601.  aWormlike surfactant micelles (WLMs) are prospective as nanoreactors for micellar copolymerization of hydrophilic and hydrophobic monomers. Hydrophilic monomers can destroy WLMs. Large size and cylindrical shape of micelles can be preserved by high salt content favoring closer packing of surfactant heads.The effect of a water-soluble monomer (acrylamide) on the structure and rheological properties of giant WLMs of an anionic surfactant potassium oleate at different salt content was investigated by combined experimental (SANS, rheometry, fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy, tensiometry) and molecular dynamics simulations studies.At low salt content, when WLMs are linear, acrylamide induces their shortening and transformation into spherical micelles as a result of its incorporation into the micellar corona, leading to the drop of viscosity. At high salt content providing branched WLMs, monomer first triggers their transition to long linear chains, which enhances the viscoelasticity, and then to rods. This is the first report showing that the effect of monomer on the rheological properties is quite different for linear and branched micelles. Using branched micelles allows preserving large WLMs at high water-soluble monomer content, which is favorable for their use as nanoreactors for synthesis of copolymers with high degree of blockiness, which give mechanically tough polymer gels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacrylamides 3aanionic surfactants 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3afluorescence 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3amolecular dynamics 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoleic acid 3apotassium 3arheometry 3asalt content 3aviscoelasticity 3aviscosity 3awater solubility 0aSurfactants 0aSelf-assembly 0aWormlike micelles 0aMonomer1 aGavrilov, Alexey A.1 aArtykulnyi, Oleksandr P.1 aKuklin, Alexander I.1 aNovikov, Valentin V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0225-05941 aShibaev, Andrey V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3019-57641 aPhilippova, Olga E.0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Nov. 15, v. 602 p.590-601dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.05.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03248naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002000145245011900165300001800284500002000302520182600322592002802148596005902176650001402235650001402249650001602263650001402279650001902293650001002312650002102322650001302343650002602356650002202382650001402404650002302418650001102441650001102452650003802463700002302501700001402524700002002538700001902558773011202577856008002689852000902769655001202778IND60790283820221119064128.0220824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079028382DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.123012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Wen‐Wu10aSodium hydrosulfide attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury by suppressing overactivated autophagy in rats  ap. 1686-1695.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIschemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and autophagy may be involved in the pathological process of cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. Hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) is an endogenous gasotransmitter with protective effects against multiple diseases. Here, we tested the effect of H₂S on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in rats. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), an H₂S donor, improved neurological function and reduced the size of the infarcts induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by reperfusion in rats. NaHS treatment reduced the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in the serum (a marker of cellular membrane integrity) and the expression of cleaved caspase‐3 (a marker for apoptosis) in the brains of MCAO rats. We also found that autophagy was overactivated in the brains of MCAO rats, as indicated by an increased ratio of LC3 II to I, decreased expression of p62, and transmission electron microscope detection. NaHS treatment significantly inhibited the autophagic activity in the brains of MCAO rats. Furthermore, PC12 cells were subjected to oxygen–glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) to mimic MCAO in vitro. We found that NaHS treatment reduced cellular injury and suppressed overactivated autophagy induced by OGD/R in PC12 cells. An autophagy stimulator (rapamycin) eliminated the protective effect of NaHS against LDH release and caspase‐3 activity induced by OGD/R in PC12 cells. An autophagy inhibitor (3‐methyladenine, 3‐MA) also reduced the cellular injury induced by OGD/R in PC12 cells. In conclusion, the results indicate that overactivated autophagy accelerates cellular injury after MCAO in rats and that exogenous H₂S attenuates cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury via suppressing overactivated autophagy in rats.  aPublisher supplied data  a81472160cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aapoptosis 3aautophagy 3ablood serum 3acaspase-3 3acell membranes 3adeath 3ahydrogen sulfide 3aischemia 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aprotective effect 3arapamycin 3areperfusion injury 3asodium 3astroke 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aHuang, Bai‐Sheng1 aHan, Yang1 aDeng, Lv‐Hong1 aWu, Li‐Xiang0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.1686-1695dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.123013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02614naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245013400163300001600297520127900313592002801592650001101620650002601631650002101657650001601678650000901694650001401703650002001717653001601737653001901753653001401772653002701786653002601813700001801839700001601857700001401873700001401887700001901901700001501920700001601935773012501951856008302076852000902159655001202168IND60737639320221117235714.0210820e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073763932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.05.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Rui10aFacile synthesis of a rod-like porous carbon framework confined magnetite nanoparticle composite for superior lithium-ion storage  ap. 602-612.  aThis work demonstrates a streamlined method to engineer a rod-like porous carbon framework (RPC) confined magnetite nanoparticles composite (Fe₃O₄/RPC) starting from metallic iron and gallic acid (GA) solution. First, a mild redox reaction was triggered between Fe and GA to prepare a rod-shaped metal–organic framework (MOF) ferric gallate sample (Fe-GA). Then, the Fe-GA sample was calcinated to obtain a prototypic RPC supported metal iron nanoparticle intermediate sample (Fe/RPC). Finally, the Fe₃O₄/RPC composite was synthesized after a simple hydrothermal reaction. The Fe₃O₄/RPC composite exhibited competitive electrochemical behaviors, which has a high gravimetric capacity of 1140 mAh·g⁻¹ at a high charge and discharge current of 1000 mA·g⁻¹ after 300 cycles. The engineered RPC supportive matrix not only offers adequate voids to buffer the volume expansion from inside well-dispersed Fe₃O₄ nanoparticles, but also facilitates both the ionic and electronic transport during the electrochemical reactions. The overall material synthesis involves of no hazardous or expensive chemicals, which can be regarded to be a scalable and green approach. The obtained samples have a good potential to be further developed for wider applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3agallic acid 3airon 3amagnetite 3aredox reactions 0aGallic acid 0aFerric gallate 0aMagnetite 0aRod-like porous carbon 0aLithium-ion batteries1 aBao, Shouchun1 aTan, Qingke1 aLi, Bowen1 aWang, Can1 aShan, Liangjie1 aWang, Chao1 aXu, Binghui0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 600 p.602-612dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.05.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02149naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245014100170300001800311500002000329520087700349592002801226596002701254650001301281650003501294650001901329650001801348650002301366650001301389650001101402650001601413700001901429700001801448700002101466700001801487700002001505773011201525856008001637961001301717852000901730655001201739IND60790283920221119064130.0220824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079028392DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.123122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmad, Abdelmonim A.10aDynamic integration and excision of filamentous phage XacF1 in Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, the causative agent of citrus canker disease  ap. 1715-1721.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInovirus XacF1 (7325 nucleotides) is integrated into the genome of Xanthomonas citri pv. citri (Xcc) strains at the host dif site (attB) by the host XerC/D recombination system. The XacF1 attP sequence is located within the coding region of ORF12, a possible phage regulator. After integration, this open reading frame (ORF) is split into two pieces on the host genome. We examined dynamic integration/excision of XacF1 in Xcc strain MAFF 301080 and found that the integration started at 4 h postinfection (p.i.) and peaked at 12 h p.i. Thereafter, the ratio of integrated to free forms remained constant, suggesting equilibrium of integration and excision of XacF1 in the host genome. However, the integrated state became very unstable following a 5′‐deletion of ORF12 in XacF1, suggesting that ORF12 plays a key role in the integration cycle of XacF1 in Xcc strains.  aPublisher supplied data  a24380049cJSPS Kakenhi 3aInovirus 3aXanthomonas citri subsp. citri 3abacteriophages 3acitrus canker 3aetiological agents 3aexcision 3agenome 3anucleotides1 aKawabe, Makoto1 aAskora, Ahmed1 aKawasaki, Takeru1 aFujie, Makoto1 aYamada, Takashi0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.1715-1721dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.123123Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03026naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245015300210300001600363520146200379592002801841650001801869650002601887650001801913650001101931650001201942650003001954650001601984650002102000650001402021650001302035650000902048651001402057651001002071653001802081653002702099653001602126700007302142700007202215700006402287773013902351856008102490852000902571655001202580IND60749937120221120135107.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074993712DNAL7 a10.1017/S00074853210002622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAgrain, Federico A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7871-935510aUnusual host selection in Amblycerus dispar larvae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae) and its potential impact on stored almonds (Prunus dulcis)  ap. 585-594.  aWe present the first report of Amblycerus dispar (Sharp) attacking stored almonds [Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D. A. Webb] in Argentina. A summarized diagnosis, illustrations, and photographs of the adult and mature larva are provided to facilitate identification. We performed species distribution models for A. dispar and its main host plant Geoffroea decorticans (Gillies ex Hook. & Arn.) Burkart. We include A. dispar into a previous morphological character matrix and conduct a phylogenetic analysis to infer its phylogenetic position. The evolution of host plant associations of the genus Amblycerus is herein re-analyzed. A. dispar and its main host shows high suitability areas especially in central-west Argentina and Chile, whereas for the USA, high suitability areas were found for the south-western which include the area of almond production in this country. Although the presence of A. dispar in the USA region is very unlikely, we recommend some awareness as other bruchines are present in the area. Although A. dispar is unlikely to become an economically important risk, monitoring for early detection is recommended to avoid productivity loss, especially when the native host is nearby cultivated areas. A. dispar is hypothesized to be the sister species of A. schwarzi Kingsolver. The colonization of a Rosaceae species is a novelty for this genus, being host shifts known as an important factor affecting both natural and agricultural systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomelidae 3aGeoffroea decorticans 3aPrunus dulcis 3aadults 3aalmonds 3ageographical distribution 3ahost plants 3ahost preferences 3aphylogeny 3aresearch 3arisk 3aArgentina 3aChile 0aemergent pest 0apotential distribution 0asystematics1 aHernández Del Pino, Santiago1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0071-38981 aLópez-García, Guillermo P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8425-29151 aRoig-Juñent, Sergio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3619-53510 tBulletin of entomological research.g2021 Oct., v. 111, no. 5 p.585-594dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl46143x1475-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00074853210002623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02933naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015500168300001400323520138500337592002801722650001301750650000901763650001501772650001101787650003101798650001201829650001701841650001801858650001301876650000901889650001601898650001401914650002201928650002201950650001601972650001901988653001202007653002302019653001802042653001802060653001602078700002202094700002202116700001902138700002102157773014602178856008202324852000902406655001202415IND60646244820221118221130.0200117e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064624482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2019.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuy, Vinh Nguyen10aExperimental study on improving performance and emission characteristics of used motorcycle fueled with ethanol by exhaust gas heating transfer system  ap. 56-62.  aReduction of environmental pollution and fossil fuel dependence are two worldwide concerned problems. Many research projects have addressed many solutions for these issues, in which, the trend of using bio-fuel has been widely studied and applied. Ethanol, a kind of biofuel has been used on motorcycle engines, which use carburetor system, to replace conventional gasoline. Ethanol is characterized by a higher heat of vaporization value than gasoline, thus the reduction of the intake manifold temperature which effects engine performance especially at cold starting and idling conditions. In this study, a certain amount of exhaust gas was recirculated to heat the intake manifold, thereby increasing intake mixture temperature, to improve the combustion process of the engine, results in improvement of engine performances. In experiment, an exhaust gas heating transfer system was designed to recirculate a partial mass of exhaust gas to transfer heat energy to the intake manifold of the test motorcycle fueled with ethanol. The experimental results show that, with the exhaust gas heating transfer system, the specific fuel consumption of the test engine improve remarkably and some gaseous emissions tend to be reduced; in addition, hot starting ability of the test engine with the heating transfer system improves significantly compared to the case of without the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3acold 3acombustion 3aenergy 3aenergy use and consumption 3aethanol 3afossil fuels 3agas emissions 3agasoline 3aheat 3amotorcycles 3apollution 3apollution control 3aresearch projects 3atemperature 3avolatilization 0aBiofuel 0aEthanol fuel blend 0aHeat recovery 0aHeat transfer 0aExhaust gas1 aDuc, Khanh Nguyen1 aCong, Doan Nguyen1 aXa, Hoi Nguyen1 aLê, Anh Tuấn,0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2019 Aug., v. 51 p.56-62dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2019.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245012300205300001600328506007600344520102000420592002801440506003701468650002201505650003501527650002501562650001801587650001701605650002501622650001801647651002101665700002301686700001601709700001501725700001701740700002001757700001801777773008401795856008101879852000901960655001201969IND60555801420221207092739.0161029e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055580142DNAL7 a10.1007/s13337-016-0329-52doi7 aPMC53947122pmcid7 a284660442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Seungmo10aMolecular detection and characterization of a divergent isolate of Plantago asiatica mosaic virus in Plantago asiatica  ap. 307-310.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFour samples of Plantago asiatica showing mottle or mottled yellowing symptoms were collected and three of them were confirmed to be infected with Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (PlAMV) by Illumina HiSeq 2500 paired-end RNA sequencing. Consequently, the complete genomic sequence of a Korean isolate of PlAMV (PlAMV isolate Gunwi) from P. asiatica was determined. The nucleotide sequence of PlAMV-Gunwi was most closely related to a Russian isolate of PlAMV (PlAMV-Ru) collected from P. asiatica but highly dissimilar (~23 %) to other isolates of PlAMV from other plant species. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the complete replicase protein and coat protein of PlAMV-Gunwi share 85.15–91.20 and 84.54–90.82 % amino acid sequence identities, respectively, to the corresponding proteins of other PlAMV isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the natural infection of P. asiatica by PlAMV in Korea, and the divergent PlAMV isolate Gunwi expands our understanding of the epidemiology of PlAMV.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlantago asiatica 3aPlantago asiatica mosaic virus 3aamino acid sequences 3acoat proteins 3aepidemiology 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant viruses 3aKorean Peninsula1 aIgori, Davaajargal1 aZhao, Fumei1 aDo, Yun Su1 aCho, In-Sook1 aChoi, Gug-Seoun1 aMoon, Jae Sun0 tVirusDis..g2016 Sept., v. 27, no. 3 p.307-310dSpringer Indiax2347-35847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13337-016-0329-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01973naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245009900160300001600259520108100275592002801356650001201384650001901396650001501415650002701430650001101457650003501468700001701503773009401520856004801614852000901662655001201671IND4494222320221120190620.0150225e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449422232DNAL7 a10.1007/s12041-011-0110-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yumei,14aThe effect of genotyping errors on the robustness of composite linkage disequilibrium measures  ap. 453-457.  aWe conclude that composite linkage disequilibrium (LD) measures be adopted in population-based LD mapping or association mapping studies since it is unaffected by Hardy–Weinberg disequilibrium. Although some properties of composite LD measures have been recently studied, the effects of genotyping errors on composite LD measures have not been examined. In this report, we derived deterministic formulas to evaluate the impact of genotyping errors on the composite LD measures [Formula: see text] and r AB , and compared the robustness of [Formula: see text] and r AB in the presence of genotyping errors. The results showed that [Formula: see text] and r AB depend on the allele frequencies and the assumed error model, and show varying degrees of robustness in the presence of errors. In general, whether there is HWD or not, r AB is more robust than [Formula: see text] except some special cases and the difference of robustness between [Formula: see text] and r AB becomes less severe as the difference between the frequencies of two SNP alleles A and B becomes smaller.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3agene frequency 3agenotyping 3alinkage disequilibrium 3amodels 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aXiang, Yang,0 tJournal of genetics.g2011 Dec., v. 90, no. 3 p.453-457dSpringer-Verlagx0022-13337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12041-011-0110-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01632naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007200166300001800238520051700256592002800773650001200801650002000813650001400833650002300847650001100870650001700881650001300898650001700911700002000928700002200948700002000970700001800990700002301008700001801031773010701049856008101156852000901237655001201246IND60119290920221119231343.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011929092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-014-1147-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jih-Jung10aGmelinoiridoside, a New Iridoid Glycoside from Gmelina philippensis  ap. 1005-1008.  aA new iridoid glycoside, gmelinoiridoside (1), has been isolated from the leaves of Gmelina philippensis, together with seven known compounds, 6-O-α-L-(2″-O-,3″-O-,4″-O-tribenzoyl)rhamnopyranosylcatalpol (2), 6-O-α-L-(2″-O-,3″-O-dibenzoyl,4″-O-trans-p-coumaroyl)rhamnopyranosylcatalpol (3), 2-pyrrolidinone (4), (–)-syringaresinol (5), squalene (6), and a mixture of β-sitosterol (7) and stigmasterol (8).

In México, eight endemic species occurs and several taxa are endangered. The species’ limits and phylogenetic relationships of these taxa have been recently examined using morphology; nevertheless, little is known about phylogenetic relationships among Cryptotis species at the molecular level. Therefore, our research included a mitochondrial DNA marker as a source of additional information to corroborate taxonomic identification and produce a phylogenetic hypothesis of the C. mexicanus species group. We were particularly interested in the status of Cryptotis magnus, a species considered as relict on the basis of primitive characters. Based on the analyses of genetic sequences of a high number of Cryptotis species, outgroups, and phylogenetic analyses of parsimony and Bayesian inference, we confirmed that Cryptotis genus consists of different lineages that represent species groups. A detailed analysis suggests that C. magnus is a species that shares an evolutionary history with the C. mexicanus species group because it is imbedded within this group. In particular, our data strongly support that C. magnus and Cryptotis phillipsii are sister groups, a pair of species that inhabit allopatrically Southern México.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMammalia 3agenetic markers 3ahighlands 3aindigenous species 3amitochondrial DNA 3amolecular systematics 3aphylogeny 3ashrews 3aspecies identification1 aCervantes, Fernando A.0 tActa theriologica.g2014 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.233-242dSpringer-Verlagx0001-70517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-013-0165-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245012600206300001600332506007600348520124600424592002801670506003701698650003101735650001001766650001601776650001001792650002501802650001401827650003001841650001001871651001001881700002401891700001901915700001401934700002101948700001701969700001601986700001302002773008402015856008102099852000902180655001202189IND60555801520221207082858.0161029e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055580152DNAL7 a10.1007/s13337-016-0330-z2doi7 aPMC53947142pmcid7 a284660452pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAishwarya, J.10aFirst report of detection and molecular characterization of porcine parvovirus in domestic and wild pigs in Kerala, India  ap. 311-314.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPorcine parvovirus (PPV) is a DNA virus of the genus Parvovirus of family Parvoviridae. It is the causative agent of many disease problems in pigs such as maternal reproductive failure, stillbirth, mummification, embryonic or fetal death, infertility, abortion and neonatal death. A study was conducted to assess the incidence of the virus in pigs in Kerala State in South India. A total of 38 samples were collected from domestic and wild pigs from different districts of the State. Polymerase chain reaction targeting a 265 bp fragment of the NS1 gene of the virus was carried out. Of the samples tested, 2 (5.26 %) were found to be positive for PPV virus genome, one of which was from a wild pig. One of the positive samples was sequenced and the nucleotide sequence obtained was compared with other sequences of PPV from India and abroad. The results revealed that the sequence had very close similarity to PPV sequences previously reported from India and to that of Chinese isolates. This is the first report of the existence of PPV in domestic and wild pigs in Kerala, India. The study highlights the need to test for the presence of PPV in addition to other infectious agents in diagnosis of cases of reproductive disorders in pigs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aUngulate protoparvovirus 1 3adeath 3afetal death 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aswine 3aIndia1 aRavishankar, Chintu1 aRajasekhar, R.1 aSumod, K.1 aBhaskar, Nimisha1 aShaji, Shiju1 aJohn, Koshy1 aMini, M.0 tVirusDis..g2016 Sept., v. 27, no. 3 p.311-314dSpringer Indiax2347-35847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13337-016-0330-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03083naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001400166245011400180300001700294520152900311592002801840650001301868650001201881650001201893650001101905650001301916650001101929650002201940650001101962650001201973650002201985650000902007650001102016650001702027650002402044650001102068650001402079650001102093650002202104650001002126650000902136651002202145700001502167700002602182700001502208700001702223700001602240700001602256700001402272700001602286773011302302856008102415852000902496655001202505IND60081313020221118051312.0150217e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008131302DNAL7 a247374182pmid7 a10.1007/s10653-014-9614-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumas, C.10aStorm-induced transfer of particulate trace metals to the deep-sea in the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea)  ap. 995-1014.  aIn order to calculate budgets of particulate matter and sediment-bound contaminants leaving the continental shelf of the Gulf of Lion (GoL), settling particles were collected in March 2011 during a major storm, using sediment traps. The collecting devices were deployed in the Cap de Creus submarine canyon, which represents the main export route. Particulate matter samples were analyzed to obtain mass fluxes and contents in organic carbon, Al, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb and La, Nd and Sm. The natural or anthropogenic origin of trace metals was assessed using enrichment factors (EFs). Results are that Zn, Cu and Pb appeared to be of anthropogenic origin, whereas Ni, Co and Cr appeared to be strictly natural. The anthropogenic contribution of all elements (except Cd) was refined by acid-leaching (HCl 1 N) techniques, confirming that Zn, Cu and Pb are the elements that are the most enriched. However, although those elements are highly labile (59–77 %), they do not reflect severe enrichment (EFs <4). Most particles originate from the Rhone River. This has been confirmed by two different tracing procedures using rare earth elements ratios and concentrations of acid-leaching residual trace metals. Our results hence indicate that even in this western extremity of the GoL, storm events mainly export Rhone-derived particles via the Cap de Creus submarine canyons to the deep-sea environments. This export of material is significant as it represents about a third of the annual PTM input from the Rhone River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acadmium 3acanyons 3acarbon 3achromium 3acobalt 3acontinental shelf 3acopper 3aexports 3ahydrochloric acid 3alead 3anickel 3aparticulates 3arare earth elements 3arivers 3asediments 3astorms 3atracer techniques 3atraps 3azinc 3aMediterranean Sea1 aAubert, D.1 aDurrieu de Madron, X.1 aLudwig, W.1 aHeussner, S.1 aDelsaut, N.1 aMenniti, C.1 aSotin, C.1 aBuscail, R.0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2014 Oct., v. 36, no. 5 p.995-1014dSpringer-Verlagx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-014-9614-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02177naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245012900154300001600283500002000299520110800319592002801427650000901455650001701464650001001481650001301491650002001504650001601524650002101540650001301561700001801574700001401592773013901606856007301745852000901818655001201827IND60588104820221119115254.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058810482DNAL7 a10.1111/vco.121762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillem, J.10aEfficacy and toxicity of carboplatin and cytarabine chemotherapy for dogs with relapsed or refractory lymphoma (2000–2013)  ap. 400-410.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMedical records of 22 dogs treated with carboplatin (n = 8) or carboplatin and cytarabine (n = 14) chemotherapy for relapsed or refractory lymphoma between 2000 and 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical response rate was 18.2% (4/22). Median time to progression was 18 days (56 for responders; 12 for non‐responders, P = 0.0006). Median overall survival time was 28 days (109 for responders; 21 for non‐responders, P = 0.0007). Thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 84.2% (16/19) and 52.6% (10/19), respectively. Grade IV thrombocytopenia and neutropenia occurred in 56.3% (9/16) and 60.0% (6/10), respectively. Dogs that received both drugs were more likely to become neutropenic (P = 0.022) or thrombocytopenic (P = 0.001) than dogs receiving carboplatin alone. All responders received both drugs giving a 28.6% (4/14) response rate for the combination. Although some dogs responded to the combination, toxicity was high and the responses were not durable. With adequate supportive care, this protocol may be an acceptable rescue option for some dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3adogs 3adrug therapy 3adrugs 3alymphoma 3amedical records 3aneutropenia 3athrombocytopenia 3atoxicity1 aGiuffrida, M.1 aKrick, E.0 tVeterinary and comparative oncology.g2017 June, v. 15, no. 2 p.400-410dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:J000000162x1476-58107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vco.121763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02022naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245005600178520095600234592002801190650001301218650001101231650002201242650001601264650001801280700002101298700001601319700002401335700002101359700002601380700002201406700002101428773012801449856008601577852000901663655001201672IND60757829420221120064355.0211125e20211031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075782942DNAL7 a10.3390/microorganisms91122692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohiuddin, Sayed Golam10aCellular Self-Digestion and Persistence in Bacteria  aCellular self-digestion is an evolutionarily conserved process occurring in prokaryotic cells that enables survival under stressful conditions by recycling essential energy molecules. Self-digestion, which is triggered by extracellular stress conditions, such as nutrient depletion and overpopulation, induces degradation of intracellular components. This self-inflicted damage renders the bacterium less fit to produce building blocks and resume growth upon exposure to fresh nutrients. However, self-digestion may also provide temporary protection from antibiotics until the self-digestion-mediated damage is repaired. In fact, many persistence mechanisms identified to date may be directly or indirectly related to self-digestion, as these processes are also mediated by many degradative enzymes, including proteases and ribonucleases (RNases). In this review article, we will discuss the potential roles of self-digestion in bacterial persistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteria 3aenergy 3apopulation growth 3aproteinases 3aribonucleases1 aGhosh, Sreyashi 1 aNgo, Han G.1 aSensenbach, Shayne 1 aKarki, Prashant 1 aDewangan, Narendra K.1 aAngardi, Vahideh 1 aOrman, Mehmet A.0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Oct. 31, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91122693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01596naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245006000165300001800225500001900243520052400262592002800786650002100814650002400835650001500859650001400874653001300888653004000901653001000941700001400951700001200965700001200977700001200989773013701001856008701138852000901225655001201234IND60713283220221121223537.0201209e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071328322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.2112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Mei10aSingle-stranded DNA-binding proteins in plant telomeres  ap. 1463-1467.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aTelomere single-stranded DNA-binding proteins bind to the terminal single-stranded DNA of telomeres, maintaining and protecting the chromosomal end in eukaryotes.

This method utilizes a biolistic gun apparatus and involves a simple protein/projectile preparation step. The protein to be delivered is mixed with a gold particle microprojectile suspension and is placed onto a gene gun cartridge, where it is dehydrated using either lyophilization or room-temperature air-drying. Subsequent intracellular protein delivery is achieved in plant and mammalian tissues upon bombardment. Because the method does not require modification of delivery agents or cargo biomolecules and involves a simple physical deposition of the protein onto the microprojectiles, there is no restriction on protein type in terms of molecular weight, isoelectric point or tertiary structure. Because the method delivers protein through the widely used gene gun system, it can be readily applied to any tissue or organism amenable to biolistics. A variety of proteins with molecular weight ranging from 24 to 68 kDa and isoelectric point from 4.8 to 10.1 were tested in this work. It is anticipated that this simple and versatile technique will offer biologists a powerful tool for basic research in areas such as understanding of cell and gene functions and for biotechnological applications such as genome editing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair drying 3abiolistics 3afreeze drying 3agenes 3agold 3aisoelectric point 3amammals 3amolecular weight 3aproteins1 aWang, Kan0 tTransgenic research.g2014 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.743-756dSpringer-Verlagx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-014-9807-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02029naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009400167300001500261520099400276592002801270650001101298650001201309650000901321650001101330650001001341650001001351650001201361651001801373651001201391700001701403700001801420700001501438700001801453773009101471856008401562852000901646655001201655IND60085963520221120083115.0141101e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008596352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.10.0402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoytek, E.B.10aThunder Bay, Ontario, was not a pathway for catastrophic floods from Glacial Lake Agassiz  ap. 98-105.  aA series of airgun single-channel seismic-reflection profiles from Thunder Bay and the adjacent Isle Royal Trough of Lake Superior suggest that water from Glacial Lake Agassiz did not catastrophically drain into Lake Superior at this locality, as has been previously suggested. Thunder Bay is underlain by a relatively smooth bedrock surface, the double bedrock sill at its mouth is not significantly incised, and no subaqueous fans occur at the base of the escarpment into the Superior basin. The Thunder Bay area contains none of the features observed further north in Lake Superior, which have been interpreted as flood-related from earlier seismic surveys. These previously reported northern features are interpreted as resulting from a younger (post-Marquette) catastrophic release of Lake Agassiz water. The absence of such features in the Thunder Bay area suggests that Lake Agassiz did not drain catastrophically through the bay at the beginning of the Younger Dryas cold interval.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3abedrock 3acold 3afloods 3alakes 3amouth 3asurveys 3aLake Superior 3aOntario1 aColman, S.M.1 aWattrus, N.J.1 aGary, J.L.1 aLewis, C.F.M.0 tQuaternary international.g2012 May 18, v. 260 p.98-105dElsevier Ltdx1040-61827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.quaint.2011.10.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245018400162300001600346500001900362520143600381592002801817650003101845650002201876650001201898650001201910650001501922650001601937650001401953650001701967650004301984650001602027650001002043650000902053700001702062700001702079700001602096700001702112700001702129773009202146856004802238852000902286655001202295IND50071385020221117172302.0140402e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007138502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-013-1915-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Nan10aEffects of different plant root exudates and their organic acid components on chemotaxis, biofilm formation and colonization by beneficial rhizosphere-associated bacterial strains  ap. 689-700.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAIM: It is necessary to understand the roles of root exudates involved in plant-microbe interactions to inform practical application of beneficial rhizosphere microbial strains. METHODS: Colonization of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SQR9 (isolated from cucumber rhizosphere) and Bacillus subtilis N11 (isolated from banana rhizosphere) of their original host was found to be more effective as compared to the colonization of the non-host plant. Organic acids in the root exudates of the two plants were identified by High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The chemotactic response and effects on biofilm formation were assessed for SQR9 and N11 in response to cucumber and banana root exudates, as well as their organic acids components. RESULTS: Citric acid detected exclusively in cucumber exudates could both attract SQR9 and induce its biofilm formation, whereas only chemotactic response but not biofilm formation was induced in N11. Fumaric acid that was only detected in banana root exudates revealed both significant roles on chemotaxis and biofilm formation of N11, while showing only effects on biofilm formation but not chemotaxis of SQR9. CONCLUSION: The relationship between PGPR strain and root exudates components of its original host might contribute to preferential colonization. This study advances a clearer understanding of the mechanisms relevant to application of PGPR strains in agricultural production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aBacillus subtilis 3abananas 3abiofilm 3achemotaxis 3acitric acid 3acucumbers 3afumaric acid 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3arhizosphere 3aroots 3asoil1 aWang, Dandan1 aLiu, Yunpeng1 aLi, Shuqing1 aShen, Qirong1 aZhang, Ruifu0 tPlant and soil.g2014 Jan., v. 374, no. 1-2 p.689-700dSpringer-Verlagx0032-079X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-013-1915-6  aDNAL 7aarticle01636naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166300001600273520067600289592002800965650002600993650001201019650002901031650001101060650001201071651001201083700002201095773012701117856008101244852000901325655001201334IND60119291520221119231426.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011929152DNAL7 a10.1134/S106235901410001X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbramov, S.

The significant factors of the three-dimensional ecological space were identified by using multidimensional statistical analysis (multidimensional scaling, cluster and canonical discriminant function analyses). The differences in the sensitivity of species to environmental factors were shown to cause a divergence of their ecological niches, which ensures the independence of these species within their community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental factors 3aforests 3amultidimensional scaling 3aniches 3arodents 3aSiberia1 aVinogradov, V.

Yellowing of leaves is a morphological indicator of senescence, which results due to loss of green pigments, i.e., chlorophylls. Alteration in mitochondrial and thylakoid structure, shrinkage of chloroplast and nucleus are prominent effects observed during senescence. Essential macromolecules like carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids are degraded during senescence and these degraded constituents play important role in nutrient recycling mechanisms, which are mediated by senescence associated genes (SAGs). Sugar senescing mechanism, down regulation of photosynthetic genes, phytohormones, reactive oxygen species and SAGs play important role in signal transduction pathways to initiate progress and terminate the senescence process. The levels of heavy metals have increased in the environment due to various anthropogenic activities, which produce phytotoxic effects and reduce productivities. This review paper describes various biochemical/metabolic changes associated with leaf senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiochemical pathways 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarotenoids 3achlorophyll 3adeath 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheavy metals 3aleaves 3alipids 3amitochondria 3anucleic acids 3aphotosynthesis 3aphytotoxicity 3apigments 3aplant hormones 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3ashrinkage 3asignal transduction 3asugars 3athylakoids 3atissues1 aSharma, Vivek1 aKishore, Kamal0 tIndian journal of plant physiology.g2016 Sept., v. 21, no. 3 p.225-238dSpringer Indiax0019-55027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40502-016-0234-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02822naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010600168300001600274500001900290520136400309592002801673650002601701650001601727650002101743650002401764650002101788650001301809650001701822650001301839650001401852650003101866650002001897650001401917650001701931653000801948653001901956653001401975653002101989653002602010700001802036700001202054700001402066700001702080773013502097856008702232852000902319655001202328IND60713283620221122005350.0201209e20201215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071328362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.2132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Rong10aPhysicochemical characterization and immunomodulatory activity of sulfated Chinese yam polysaccharide  ap. 635-644.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA sulfated Chinese yam polysaccharide (S-CYP) was obtained from non-starch Chinese yam polysaccharide (CYP) by chlorosulfonic acid-pyridine (CSA-Pyr) method. The physicochemical characteristics and immunological activity of S-CYP were evaluated in this study. Results showed that sulfated modification changed the physicochemical properties of Chinese yam polysaccharide. Body weights and thymus index of the mice in polysaccharides group were increased compared with the cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppressed mice in model group, and could restore the splenomegaly that caused by Cy. It also showed that S-CYP could enhance the immunomodulatory activity on splenic lymphocytes since it could increase the proliferation of splenic lymphocytes and effectively cooperate with ConA to induce splenic lymphocytes differentiation into T lymphocytes. Meanwhile, the number of CD3⁺CD4⁺ and CD3⁺CD8⁺ T lymphocytes was elevated, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was restored in polysaccharides group. The levels of splenic lymphocytes cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis (TNF)-α), and the levels of immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) secretion in serum were also increased by S-CYP significantly. These findings demonstrate that CYP and S-CYP can serve as a promising immunomodulator with potential application in functional food and nutraceutical industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDioscorea polystachya 3ablood serum 3acyclophosphamide 3adietary supplements 3afunctional foods 3aindustry 3ainterleukins 3anecrosis 3aneoplasms 3aphysicochemical properties 3apolysaccharides 3asecretion 3asplenomegaly 0aYam 0aPolysaccharide 0aSulfation 0aImmunomodulatory 0aImmunosuppressed mice1 aShen, Mingyue1 aYu, Yue1 aLiu, Xuan1 aXie, Jianhua0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Dec. 15, v. 165 p.635-644dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.09.2133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02530naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245016000168520131500328592002801643650002101671650001201692650001101704650001601715650001901731650002301750650002401773653002801797653002501825653002201850653001601872653002101888700001901909700001801928773011501946856008602061852000902147655001202156IND60782777620221119171301.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078277762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhazi, Mahan10aSelective monitoring of natural gas sulphur-based odorant mixture of t-butyl mercaptan and methyl ethyl sulphide using an array of microfluidic gas sensors  aA natural gas (NG) odorization system requires continuous monitoring as well as an optimal injection to satisfy the odorization guidelines, minimize over-odorization, and prevent hazardous gas leaks. NG consists of hydrocarbons such as methane, odorants such as tert-butyl mercaptan, and other sulphur-based VOCs such as hydrogen sulphide; therefore, selectivity is paramount for the reliable and accurate monitoring of odorants. In this study, we developed a portable device integrated with an array of five different sensors to detect a mixture of tert-butyl mercaptan and methyl ethyl sulphide for a concentration range of 1 ppm to 10 ppm. A machine learning model was developed to predict the presence and concentration of NG odorants from the sensor data. The best-performing sensors in the array achieved high sensitivity and selectivity indicators (measured using the Davies-Bouldin index) of 0.3667 (1⁄ppm) and 0.125, respectively. The sensor system achieved a classification accuracy of 98.75% between NG odorants and hydrogen sulphide, with an overall Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 error (for the regression model) of 0.50 and 95.16%. These results indicate that the developed portable device and the machine learning model have promising applications for the selective monitoring of NG odorants.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amethane 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aodor compounds 3aportable equipment 3aregression analysis 0aMicrofluidic gas sensor 0aNatural gas odorants 0aHydrogen sulphide 0aSelectivity 0aMachine learning1 aTasnim, Nishat1 aHoorfar, Mina0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 438 p.129548-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01838naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015800168300001600326520059600342592002800938650002800966650001300994650001701007650001401024650001101038650000901049650001001058650001201068650001001080650002201090650001001112650001001122700001901132700002001151700001901171700002101190773012701211856008101338852000901419655001201428IND60119291820221119231434.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011929182DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590141000212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBazhenov, Yu.

All patients admitted between 1 May 2011 and 31 August 2014 undergoing SOT were included in the retrospective study. The primary outcomes included a description of the association of enteric colonization and invasive infections by CP-Kp with one-year mortality. Secondary outcomes were the study of risk factors for colonization and invasive infections by CP-Kp. Results: A total of 5.4% (45/828) of SOT recipients had at least one positive rectal swab for CP-Kp, with most (88.9%) occurring after transplantation. 4.5% (35/828) of patients developed a CP-Kp-related invasive infection, with 68.6% (24/35) being previously colonized. The 1-year mortality was 31.1% in patients with enteric colonization with CP-Kp and, it was 51.4% among patients with CP-Kp-related invasive infections. At univariate analysis, colonization, invasive infections, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were significantly associated with 1-year mortality. At multivariate analysis, only invasive infections and the combination of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock were significantly associated with 1-year mortality, whereas gastrointestinal colonization was significantly associated with survival. In this population, the 1-year mortality was significantly associated with invasive infections; otherwise, gastrointestinal colonization was not associated with increased 1-year mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aKlebsiella pneumoniae 3agastrointestinal system 3amortality 3amultivariate analysis 3aorgan transplantation 3aretrospective studies 3aseptic shock1 aCorcione, Silvia 1 aLupia, Tommaso 1 aScabini, Silvia 1 aFilippini, Claudia 1 aAngilletta, Roberto 1 aShbaklo, Nour 1 aMornese Pinna, Simone 1 aRomagnoli, Renato 1 aBiancone, Luigi 1 aCavallo, Rossana 1 aDi Perri, Giovanni 1 aSolidoro, Paolo 1 aBoffini, Massimo 1 aDe Rosa, Francesco Giuseppe0 tMicroorganisms.g2021 Oct. 31, v. 9, no. 11dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27145x2076-26077nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms91122723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03204naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245013000169300001800299500002000317520167500337592002802012596002202040596003402062650001702096650002102113650001202134650001802146650001802164650001202182650002102194650002402215650001402239650000902253650002402262650001702286650002002303650002702323650002302350700002002373700002002393700001902413700002102432700002202453700002202475773011202497856008002609852000902689655001202698IND60790284920221119064421.0220824e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079028492DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.123152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFujiwara, Mitsuhiro10aDecreased grip strength, muscle pain, and atrophy occur in rats following long‐term exposure to excessive repetitive motion  ap. 1737-1749.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWork‐related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) are caused by the overuse of muscles in the workplace. Performing repetitive tasks is a primary risk factor for the development of WMSD. Many workers in highly repetitive jobs exhibit muscle pain and decline in handgrip strength, yet the mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions are poorly understood. In our study, rats performed voluntary repetitive reaching and grasping tasks (Task group), while Control group rats did not perform these activities. In the Task group, grip strength and forearm flexor withdrawal threshold declined significantly from week 2 to week 6, compared with these values at week 0 (P < 0.05). Relative muscle weight and muscle fiber cross‐sectional area of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) muscles decreased significantly in the Task group, compared with the Control group, at 6 weeks (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). Nerve growth factor, glial cell line‐derived neurotrophic factor, and tumor necrosis factor α‐expression in FDS muscles were not significantly different in Control and Task groups at 3 and 6 weeks. At 6 weeks, the Task group had elevated MuRF1 protein levels (P = 0.065) and significant overexpression of the autophagy‐related (Atg) proteins, Beclin1 and Atg5–Atg12, compared with in the Control group (both P < 0.05). These data suggested that long‐term exposure to excessive repetitive motion causes loss of grip strength, muscle pain, and skeletal muscle atrophy. Furthermore, this exposure may enhance protein degradation through both the ubiquitin‐proteasome and autophagy‐lysosome systems, thereby decreasing skeletal muscle mass.  aPublisher supplied data  cA‐kit Co., Ltd.  cPublic Advertisement Research 3aarms (limbs) 3achronic exposure 3adecline 3ahand strength 3amuscle fibers 3amuscles 3amuscular atrophy 3anerve growth factor 3aneuroglia 3apain 3aprotein degradation 3arisk factors 3askeletal muscle 3atumor necrosis factors 3aworking conditions1 aIwata, Masahiro1 aInoue, Takayuki1 aAizawa, Yosuke1 aYoshito, Natsumi1 aHayashi, Kazuhiro1 aSuzuki, Shigeyuki0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Nov., v. 7, no. 11 p.1737-1749dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.123153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02184naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010000211500001900311520096400330592002801294650002001322650001701342650001501359650002201374650002001396650001001416650001001426650001601436650001601452650001501468653000901483653001701492653002201509700002001531700002401551773011601575856008601691852000901777655001201786IND60741211520221119133140.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074121152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.1050952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes, Ignacio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7066-748210aVolume and uncertainty estimates of on-farm reservoirs using surface reflectance and LiDAR data  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAccurate estimates of water volumes are crucial for water management. This study applies an automated methodology to detect small-scale on-farm dams and develops a novel application of Bayesian inference to jointly simulate volumes and uncertainties. A linear relationship was assumed between flooded pixel area images derived from LiDAR datasets and water index rasters derived from Sentinel 2 images. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method led to accurate estimates of water elevations and reservoir volumes, with a systematic error of about 2.5% and 10% of the maximum capacity during the study period in Keepit dam and Pamamaroo lake, respectively. Additionally, the method quantifies uncertainties of volumes. The presence of woody vegetation growing at the reservoir walls leads to a deterioration of estimates. This methodology may be used as an auditing tool in water governance schemes or to gain knowledge on water losses at the field scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aMarkov chain 3aautomation 3acomputer software 3adata collection 3alakes 3alidar 3areflectance 3auncertainty 3avegetation 0aMCMC 0aOn-farm dams 0aVolume estimation1 aScalzo, Richard1 aVervoort, R.

In this study, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells were exposed to polystyrene particles (PS-particles) of 50 nm, 500 nm and 5 µm to investigate organelle damage and the mechanism of cell death. PS-particles induced oxidative stress, which in turn led to mitochondrial and lysosomal damage, arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and finally caused apoptosis. Anti-apoptotic genes (Bcl-2) were down regulated, and pro-apoptotic genes (Bax) and a key gene (caspase-3) in apoptosis were upregulated. The molecular mechanism of apoptosis was further explored via the combination of transcriptome sequencing, RT-qPCR verification and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology. The modulator of apoptosis-1 (MOAP-1) was significantly upregulated, and apoptosis was abolished by knocking down MOAP-1. This finding clarifies that PS-particles promote MOAP-1 to induce apoptosis. Hence, PS-particles may promote the binding of MOAP-1 and Bax, which ultimately activates caspase-3 and causes apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. The 50-nm PS-particles resulted in the most serious mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. Eventually, PS-particles cause oxidative stress, damage organelles and induce apoptosis by promoting MOAP-1. Altogether, our study emphasizes the need to assess the cytotoxicity of micro(nano)plastics and helps to predict the health risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acytotoxicity 3agenes 3aleukemia 3amicroplastics 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3apolystyrenes 3arats 3atranscriptome 0aPS-particles 0aROS 0aOrganelle damage 0aCell death 0aModulator of apoptosis-11 aLiu, Bingyan1 aZhang, Bowen1 aYe, Yiyuan1 aJiang, Wei0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 438 p.129550-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03284naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001700169245005300186300001600239520156600255592002801821650001101849650001901860650001301879650002101892650002401913650002001937650000901957650002301966650001201989650001702001650001502018650001602033650001202049650001602061650001902077650002102096650001902117650001102136650001102147650004702158650004902205650001502254650001102269650004502280651001102325651001402336651001802350651001102368651001802379651002002397651001802417651001802435773012402453856008402577852000902661655001202670IND60083780720221116195853.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008378072DNAL7 a229176012pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2012.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLutter, C.K.10aGrowth and complementary feeding in the Americas  ap. 806-812.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: To describe growth patterns of young children in Latin America and the Caribbean, the types of nationally representative data available on complementary feeding practices and complementary feeding practices. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on growth, timing of introduction of liquids and foods, and complementary feeding practices were abstracted from nationally representative surveys. The high prevalence of stunting relative to the low prevalence of underweight is striking, with the “average” child in the region, with the exception of the Haitian child, short and chubby. The focus of the demographic and health surveys continues to be on undernutrition with only one question, intake of sugary foods, related foods that may have consequences for adult health. The United States has more comprehensive information; Mexico has information on beverage consumption and Brazil on soft drink and biscuit or snack consumption. In 14 of 19 countries, fewer than half of infants are exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life, indicating an early introduction of liquids and complementary foods. Among the 5 countries with data on the intake of sugary foods, intake in the previous 24 h among children 6–23 months of age ranged from 14% to 79%. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of data to characterize complementary feeding diets as they relate to risk of overweight and chronic diseases in the Region of the Americas calls attention to the need to improve data collection frameworks and methods to address this important gap in knowledge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3abreast feeding 3achildren 3achronic diseases 3acomplementary foods 3adata collection 3adiet 3agrowth retardation 3ainfants 3amalnutrition 3aoverweight 3asoft drinks 3asurveys 3aunderweight 2aBreast Feeding 2aFeeding Behavior 2aHealth Surveys 2aHumans 2aInfant 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aMalnutritionxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aPrevalence 2aSnacks 2aThinnessxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 3aBrazil 3aCaribbean 3aLatin America 3aMexico 3aUnited States 0aCaribbean Area. 0aLatin America 0aUnited States0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2012 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.806-812dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2012.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245012400168500001900292520116000311592002801471650001501499650002201514650002201536650001001558650001801568650002201586650001901608653004001627653002101667653001401688653002701702700002001729700002401749773011601773856008601889852000901975655001201984IND60741211620221119133319.0210813e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074121162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.1050992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Wencai12aA new pseudo three-dimensional hydrodynamic model with Lagrangian vertical mixing and Eulerian horizontal mass exchange  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe Multi-Basin DYnamic Reservoir Simulation Model (MB-DYRESM) has been developed to bridge the gap between the computationally cheap, one-dimensional lake models and the computationally expensive, three-dimensional lake models. It was extended from the classic one-dimensional lake model DYRESM by incorporating a horizontal water exchange algorithm to simulate gravitational mass transport between adjacent sub-basins. Numerical experiments with increasing complexity were carried out for capacity demonstration, in which MB-DYRESM successfully reproduced the thermal structure and mass distribution in each sub-basin with accuracy comparable to and computational speed approximately 300 times faster than the three-dimensional model applied in parallel. In situations where turbulence was suppressed by stratification it actually provided better simulation results. The combination of low computational demand, reasonable spatial resolution of mass flux path and constrained numerical diffusion makes MB-DYRESM a more applicable option for simulations where the balance between affordable computational power and proper spatial resolution is concerned.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3ahydrologic models 3alakes 3amass transfer 3asimulation models 3aturbulent flow 0aPseudo three-dimensional lake model 0aStratified lakes 0aFlux path 0aGravitational exchange1 aImberger, Jorg,1 aMarti, Clelia Luisa0 tEnvironmental modelling & software.g2021 Sept., v. 143 p.105099-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11634x1364-81527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2021.1050993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010800166300001600274520126000290592002801550650002401578650002101602650001401623650001101637650002501648650001301673650001501686650002501701651001201726653003001738653003201768653003001800653002601830653003801856700001501894700001901909700001601928700001801944773012201962856008202084852000902166655001202175IND60646245820221118221022.0191214e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064624582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2019.05.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZaman, Masuduz10aEnhanced biological phosphorus removal using thermal alkaline hydrolyzed municipal wastewater biosolids  ap. 164-174.  aThis study reports the feasibility of using municipal wastewater biosolids as an alternative carbon source for biological phosphorus removal. The biosolids were treated by a low-temperature, thermal alkaline hydrolysis process patented by Lystek International Inc. (Cambridge, ON, Canada) to produce short-chain volatile fatty acids and other readily biodegradable organics. Two sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) were operated with synthetic volatile fatty acids (SynVFA) and readily biodegradable organics produced from the alkaline hydrolysis of municipal wastewater biosolids (Lystek) as the carbon source, respectively. Municipal wastewaters with different strengths and COD:N:P ratios were tested in the study. The reactors' performances were compared with respect to nitrogen and phosphorus removal. It was observed that phosphorus removal efficiencies were between 98%–99% and 90%–97% and nitrogen removal efficiencies were 78%–81%, and 67% for the SynVFA and Lystek, respectively. However, the kinetics for phosphorus release and uptake during the anaerobic and aerobic stages with Lystek were observed to be significantly lower than SynVFA due to the presence of higher order VFAs (C4 and above) and other fermentable organics in the Lystek.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3abiodegradability 3abiosolids 3acarbon 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3avolatile fatty acids 3aOntario 0aAlternative carbon source 0aBiological nutrient removal 0aOrganic resource recovery 0aBiosolids application 0aPhosphorus accumulating organisms1 aKim, Mingu1 aNakhla, George1 aSingh, Ajay1 aYang, Fenghua0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Dec., v. 86 p.164-174dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2019.05.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01922naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008400166300001600250520097900266592002801245650001301273650001001286650001201296650001301308650001301321650002301334650002201357650001201379773012701391856008101518852000901599655001201608IND60119292120221119231257.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011929212DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623590141000572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKorovin, V.

After a period of almost complete absence in the 1970s and 1980s, since the early 1990s, temporarily vacant parts of the range have been inhabited again and an increase in the population has been observed. By the beginning of the 21st century, the little bustard had almost regained its former habitat in the region. By the end of the 1990s, the average population density in the agricultural landscape reached 1 ind./km². By the end of the first decade of the 2000s, it exceeded 2 ind./km². In recent years, the little bustard has rarely been observed in steppe pastures but is found more frequently on perennial grass crops and harvested grain fields, while the bulk of its population (up to 70–80% of all couples) inhabits fallow lands, the appearance and preservation of which is associated with the steady reduction in agricultural production in the last two decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOtididae 3acrops 3agrasses 3ahabitats 3apastures 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3asteppes0 tBiology bulletin of the Russian Academy of Sciences.g2014 Dec., v. 41, no. 10 p.856-861dSpringer-Verlagx1062-35907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S10623590141000573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03446naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245013500215300001600350520173100366592002802097650002002125650000802145650002402153650002502177650001502202650001002217650000902227650000902236650001002245650001102255650003302266650001802299650001102317650001502328650002702343650001602370651002102386653001502407653001102422653001102433653001602444653001402460653001102474700002402485700002602509700002502535700002002560700001902580700001602599700005702615773009702672856009002769852000902859655001202868IND60622526220221120113826.0190129e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062252622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarakuş, Mehmet1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9460-121510aVector and reservoir surveillance study in a canine and human leishmaniasis endemic area in most western part of Turkey, Karaburun  ap. 177-182.  aLeishmaniasis is an arthropod borne disease that is endemic in 102 countries and one and half million new cases are reported each year. Sand flies are the one and only proven vectors of the disease and dogs are the main reservoirs in urban areas. Karaburun peninsula is located in most western part of Turkey and is reported to be an endemic area for human and canine leishmaniasis. The most recent study was undertaken more than 15 years ago in The peninsula and no clear data available for vectors or reservoirs. Thus, we aimed to update the information regarding sand fly diversity, infection status of reservoirs and vectors in the study area.Sand flies were collected using CDC light traps at 13 different sites of Karaburun and species identification was made using previously published keys. Monospecific pools were generated using midguts with blood retention and were screened for the presence of Leishmania spp. DNA by molecular techniques. A non-invasive conjunctival swab sampling was performed to identify the infection status among reservoirs and species typing of the causative agent was also undertaken using ITS1 PCR.Three out of 30 pools were found positive for Leishmania infantum that were generated using guts of Phlebotomus tobbi (n:36). Among all sampled dogs (44) and cats (19), 11 and one of them were found positive for L. infantum, respectively. There was a decrease in the number of P. papatasi during the study period, while increase was observed in the number of P. tobbi.The presence of proven vectors and reservoirs as well as Leishmania DNA in cats was shown in the present study. Sand fly fauna is updated and Leishmania DNA presence in cats was reported in the study area for the first time.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCDC light traps 3aDNA 3aLeishmania infantum 3aPhlebotomus papatasi 3aarthropods 3ablood 3acats 3adogs 3afauna 3ahumans 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleishmaniasis 3amidgut 3amonitoring 3aspecies identification 3aurban areas 3aTurkey (country) 0aLeishmania 0aCanine 0aFeline 0aPhlebotomus 0aKaraburun 0aTurkey1 aArserim, Suha Kenan1 aErişöz Kasap, Özge1 aPekağırbaş, Metin1 aAküzüm, Duygu1 aAlten, Bülent1 aTöz, Seray1 aÖzbel, Yusuf1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8335-19970 tActa tropica.g2019 Feb., v. 190 p.177-182dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2018.11.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02421naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245012000172520115100292592002801443650001201471650001401483650002301497650001301520650001801533650001101551650002801562653001201590653001801602653002401620653002101644700001801665700001801683700002001701700001801721700001601739700001701755700001701772773011501789856008601904852000901990655001201999IND60782778120221119171543.0220824e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078277812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Chengxiong10aUnderstanding ammonia and nitrous oxide formation in typical three-way catalysis during the catalyst warm-up period  aAmmonia (NH₃) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) have been regarded as the typical secondary pollutants emitted from vehicles equipped with a three-way catalyst (TWC). MultiGas FT-IR Analyzer was applied to determine the outlet gas concentrations in the light-off experiments, in order to understand how different reaction conditions and catalyst aging affect the production of these two pollutants. It was found that N₂O formation is favored by the existence of excess oxygen during NO reduction, whereas NH₃ is readily formed within the lack of reactive oxygen species. Interestingly, the reduction of NO by H₂ in presence of excess oxygen can also lead to NH₃ formation when the active metal particles are large enough, which provides the rational explanation why the increased NH₃ was emitted from older gasoline vehicles. The loss of the catalytically active sites and reducibility caused by thermal aging requires longer time to warm-up thereby favors the N₂O and NH₃ formation, which is the major reason for the higher CO, NOx, HC, N₂O and NH₃ emissions from the old gasoline vehicles than that of low-mileage gasoline vehicles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3agasoline 3anitrous oxide 3aoxygen 3areactive oxygen species 0aAmmonia 0aNitrous oxide 0aThree-way catalysis 0aGasoline vehicle1 aXia, Wenzheng1 aYang, Dongxia1 aZheng, Tingting1 aRong, Yangjia1 aDu, Junchen1 aWu, Bingxian1 aZhao, Yunkun0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 438 p.129553-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1295533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245011100176300001800287520130000305592002801605650002201633650001001655650001401665650001101679650002401690650002001714650002501734650000901759650001801768650000901786650001701795650001901812650002201831650000901853653001101862653001801873653001301891700002301904700002901927700001801956700002101974700002501995700002402020700001902044700002002063700002802083700005802111773012002169856008102289852000902370655001202379IND60749938420221119002335.0210908e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074993842DNAL7 a10.1017/S00311820210011162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShariatzadeh, Seyyed Ali14aThe global seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection in bovines: a systematic review and meta-analysis  ap. 1417-1433.  aBovines, especially cattle, are considered as one of the main sources of Toxoplasma gondii infection for humans. A more comprehensive understanding of the occurrence of T. gondii is needed to provide a global perspective on the prevalence of T. gondii in bovines. Here, we present the results of the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the global T. gondii seroprevalence in bovines. Six databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest and Google Scholar) were comprehensively searched for relevant studies published between 1 January 1967 and 30 May 2019. Among 7691 publications searched, 178 studies (from 50 countries) with 193 datasets were included in the meta-analysis. The global pooled and weighted seroprevalence of T. gondii among bovines was 17.91% [95% confidence interval (CI): 15.32–20.6]. Weighted prevalence based on the host was as follows: cattle 16.94% (95% CI: 14.25–19.81), buffalo 22.26% (95% CI: 16.8–29), yak 23% (95% CI: 14–33) and bison 8.1% (95% CI: 3.9–13.7). Continued monitoring on the status of T. gondii seroprevalence in bovines is essential. Study on the prevalence of T. gondii in the products of bovines such as milk, meat, etc., which are considered as the source of transmission of infection to humans, is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToxoplasma gondii 3abison 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3aconfidence interval 3adata collection 3adisease transmission 3ameat 3ameta-analysis 3amilk 3aparasitology 3aseroprevalence 3asystematic review 3ayaks 0aBovine 0atoxoplasmosis 0azoonosis1 aSarvi, Shahabeddin1 aHosseini, Seyed Abdollah1 aSharif, Mehdi1 aGholami, Shirzad1 aPagheh, Abdol Sattar1 aMontazeri, Fattaneh1 aNayeri, Tooran1 aNakhaei, Maryam1 aMikaeili Galeh, Tahereh1 aDaryani, Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8571-58030 tParasitology.g2021 Oct., v. 148, no. 12 p.1417-1433dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45572x1469-81617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00311820210011163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03593naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001500166245011700181300001800298520155700316592002801873650003101901650001701932650002501949650001601974650001601990650001602006650002002022650002102042650002002063650001702083650000902100650001602109650001502125650001702140650001302157650001802170650002202188650001202210650001602222650002702238650005102265650006702316650003202383650005502415650000902470650000902479650002402488650005202512650002602564650003002590650002202620650002702642650002202669700002002691700001302711700001802724773009902742856008102841852000902922655001202931IND60081310720221118051514.0150217e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008131072DNAL7 a247888482pmid7 a10.1007/s00705-014-2098-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Yadong10aIn vivo delivery of interleukin-35 relieves coxsackievirus-B3-induced viral myocarditis by inhibiting Th17 cells  ap. 2411-2419.  aInterleukin (IL)-35 is a new member of the IL-12 cytokine family. The suppressive role of IL-35 in the immune response to parasitic and bacterial infections and in autoimmunity has been demonstrated in terms of its anti-inflammatory properties. However, the functional role of IL-35 in viral myocarditis has not been investigated. In this study, IL-35 expression was measured in heart tissues with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis. It was significantly reduced in the late stage of viral infection and correlated negatively with disease severity. To examine the therapeutic role of IL-35 in viral myocarditis, an IL-35-expressing plasmid (pIL-35-FC) was packaged with polyethyleneimine and delivered intraperitoneally to BALB/c male mice before and after CVB3 infection. The severity of myocarditis was assessed 7 days after infection. The in vivo delivery of IL-35 significantly ameliorated the severity of viral myocarditis, reflected in an increased survival rate and increased bodyweights, and reduced serum creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB activities, cardiac pathological scores, and viral replication. We also show that the overexpression of IL-35 reduced splenic Th17 cells and Th17-related proinflammatory cytokines in heart tissues. In conclusion, our data indicate that IL-35 effectively protects the myocardium from the pathogenesis of CVB3-induced viral myocarditis, which may be attributable to reduced Th17 production. This suggests that supplementation with IL-35 could be a novel therapeutic treatment for viral myocarditis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aautoimmunity 3abacterial infections 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acorrelation 3acreatine kinase 3adisease severity 3aimmune response 3ainterleukins 3amice 3amyocarditis 3amyocardium 3apathogenesis 3aplasmids 3asurvival rate 3avirus replication 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aCreatine Kinasexblood 2aEnterovirus B, Humanxisolation & purification 2aImmunosuppressive Agentsxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aInterleukinsxadministration & dosageximmunology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMyocarditisxdrug therapyxpathologyxvirology. 2aMyocardiumxpathology 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aSurvival Analysis 2aTh17 Cellsximmunology 2aTreatment Outcome1 aDong, Chunsheng1 aYue, Yan1 aXiong, Sidong0 tArchives of virology.g2014 Sept., v. 159, no. 9 p.2411-2419dSpringer-Verlagx0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-014-2098-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03324naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006400142245021000206500002000416520174800436592002802184596002802212596005002240596002702290596003402317596003802351650001202389650001502401650001102416650001302427650001902440651000902459700006002468700005602528700005902584700006102643773013602704856007702840852000902917655001202926IND60790282020221119064346.0220824e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079028202DNAL7 a10.1029/2021JB0226962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrambling, Nadine L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1658-622410aThermal History of Lithosphere Formed Beneath Fast Spreading Ridges: Constraints From the Mantle Transition Zone of the East Pacific Rise at Hess Deep and Oman Drilling Project, Wadi Zeeb, Samail Ophiolite  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe investigate the cooling histories of peridotites and gabbros from localities that expose oceanic lithosphere formed beneath two fast seafloor spreading centers: Hess Deep as recovered from IODP Expedition 345 and ODP Leg 147, and the Oman Ophiolite as sampled by the Oman Drilling Project, ICDP Expedition 5057 (OmanDP). At these locations, relict crust‐mantle transition zones are directly sampled, enabling characterization of the thermal history of the crust‐mantle transition, and by inference, the depth extent of hydrothermal circulation beneath spreading centers. We measured major and trace element abundances in crustal gabbros and mantle peridotites from Hess Deep and OmanDP, and applied major and trace element‐based thermometers. Geospeedometric interpretation of the temperatures suggests similar cooling histories at both locations; cooling rates ranged from 0.02 to 2.6 °C/y from peak temperatures up to 1,350°C. The rates are consistent on either side of the paleo‐Moho (i.e., in the crust and mantle). Models for conductive cooling of the lower oceanic crust predict rates more than two orders of magnitude slower at the crust‐mantle transition zone, while thermal models that invoke deep and efficient hydrothermal circulation throughout the entire crustal section predict rates consistent with our observations. We infer that hydrothermal cooling extended to or near the petrologic Moho beneath the East Pacific Rise and the OmanDP paleo‐spreading center, consistent with the Sheeted Sills model for crustal accretion. Comparison with previously published rates recalculated using the methods we employed suggests the oceanic lower crust is cooled hydrothermally in some places and by conduction at others.  aPublisher supplied data  cUniversity of Tennessee  cNational Aeronautics and Space Administration  cSpace Grant Consortium  cUniversity of Texas at Austin  cAlexander von Humboldt Foundation 3acooling 3ageophysics 3amodels 3aresearch 3atrace elements 3aOman1 aDygert, Nicholas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5630-87391 aBoring, Beau1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8416-28611 aJean, Marlon M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2788-87381 aKelemen, Peter B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4757-08550 tJournal of geophysical research.g2022 Jan., v. 127, no. 1 p.e2021JB022696-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2021JB0226963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006900151245017000220520087600390592002801266650002401294650001801318650001101336650002901347650001101376650003201387650002201419650001201441650001801453653002701471653001101498653003601509653002501545653003301570653002801603700001701631700001801648773011801666856008601784852000901870655001201879IND60782775020221119165836.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078277502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGulsen Akbay, Habibe Elif1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1144-927910aEvaluation of electro-oxidation and Fenton pretreatments on industrial fruit waste and municipal sewage sludge to enhance biogas production by anaerobic co-digestion  aThis study presents the effect of electro-oxidation and Fenton pre-treatment on anaerobic co-digestion (AnCoD) of fruit-juice industrial waste (FJW) and municipal sewage sludge (MSS).

This pathway is believed to play a role in peripheral cholesterol degradation. Aim of this study was to investigate the impact of hyperlipidemia on 27-hydroxycholesterol appearance rate, and to assess the effects induced by treatment with statins. METHODS AND RESULTS: Seven patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and eight patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia underwent determination of 27-hydroxylation rates in vivo by i.v. infusion of deuterated 27-hydroxycholesterol. Isotope enrichment was assayed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, allowing to calculate 27-hydroxycholesterol appearance rates. Six normocholesterolemic subjects were regarded as controls. In some hypercholesterolemic patients the infusions were repeated during treatment with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Hydroxylation rates were higher in hypercholesterolemic patients (8.7 ± 2.5 mg/h; controls, 3.4 ± 2.0 mg/h; combined hyperlipidemia, 4.4 ± 1.6 mg/h; mean ± SD, P < 0.01 vs both). After statin treatment, both plasma cholesterol levels and hydroxylation rates dropped by nearly 50%. No difference was detectable between the two statins. A linear correlation was shown between plasma cholesterol and 27-hydroxylation rates. CONCLUSION: Hypercholesterolemia associates with increased 27-hydroxycholesterol appearance rates, which decrease during hypocholesterolemic treatment. The correlation with cholesterol levels supports the view that 27-hydroxylation may act as a compensatory mechanism in a condition of larger plasma cholesterol pool. A regulatory role for hepatic and extrahepatic nuclear receptors seems reasonable. These data prompt novel pharmacological approaches for the management of hypercholesterolemia and the prevention of atherosclerosis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatherosclerosis 3abile acids 3abiosynthesis 3acholesterol 3agas chromatography 3ahydroxylation 3ahypercholesterolemia 3aisotopes 3aliver 3amass spectrometry 3apatients 3areceptors 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCholesterolxbloodxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aFluorobenzenesxtherapeutic use 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHeptanoic Acidsxtherapeutic use 2aHumans 2aHydroxycholesterolsxblood 2aHydroxylation 2aHypercholesterolemiaxbloodxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aHyperlipidemia, Familial Combinedxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aHyperlipoproteinemia Type IIxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPyrimidinesxtherapeutic use 2aPyrrolesxtherapeutic use 2aSulfonamidesxtherapeutic use1 aDel Puppo, M.1 aCorna, F.1 aAnzivino, C.1 aGabbi, C.1 aBaldelli, E.1 aCarulli, L.1 aLoria, P.1 aGalli Kienle, M.1 aCarulli, N.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2012 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.823-830dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2011.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01657naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245009200164300001800256520051000274592002800784650002300812650001400835650004600849650001500895650004400910650002900954700002300983700002101006700002201027700001701049700001601066700001601082773010701098856008101205852000901286655001201295IND60119289020221119193055.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011928902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-014-1153-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKicha, A.

However, the problem with many of the cross-sectional studies of wine expertise that have been published to date is that they simply cannot rule out the possibility that those with superior chemosensory abilities end-up gravitating toward a career in wine. Definitions of expertise also tend to vary widely between studies, making direct comparison of the results obtained rather difficult. By contrast, the longitudinal learning studies that have been published have typically only assessed the effects of relatively small amounts of training. And, taken as a whole, the majority of studies in this area tend to look statistically underpowered nowadays in terms of the sample sizes that have been used. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, the literature converges on the conclusion that chemosensory perceptual learning does occur, though the gains (e.g., in terms of lower detection thresholds) are usually modest at best, and tend to be highly stimulus-specific. By contrast, cognitive/semantic improvements in describing/discriminating wines, and wine-relevant compounds, as well as the acquisition of relevant conceptual knowledge, are much more salient differentiators in the cross-sectional empirical literature. Enhanced attention and olfactory recognition memory abilities have also been reported amongst wine experts. Looking to the future, the hope is that the insights garnered from studies of perceptual learning in the higher spatial senses may help to optimize the training regimes for those wishing to enhance their wine-tasting abilities, and perhaps also aid recovery in those suffering from olfactory loss.  aPublisher supplied data 3acognition 3across-sectional studies 3aexperts 3amemory 3asensation 3asensory evaluation 3awines 0aPerceptual learning 0aChemical senses 0aExpertise 0aAttention 0aWine 0aBeer 0aOlfaction0 tFood research international.g2019 Sept., v. 123 p.746-761dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100002200169245008000191300001600271520104000287592002801327650001301355650001701368650001301385650001601398650001101414650001301425650000901438650003101447650001401478650001901492650001601511650001201527650001301539650001001552650002501562650002901587650002801616650001101644650003301655650001101688650002901699650002001728650005101748650004101799650003901840650001401879650002801893650002201921650001501943650005001958650004302008651001302051651001302064653001802077653001902095653001402114653003702128653000802165653001302173773011402186856005102300852000902351655001202360IND50075716120221117235614.0140410e20120901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007571612DNAL7 a228813592pmid7 a10.1080/03670244.2012.6960122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, Crystal L.10aAppetite Sensations in Pregnancy among Agropastoral Women in Rural Tanzania  ap. 431-443.  aWomen all over the globe report physical and appetite sensations in early pregnancy, and this study contributes to this growing literature by reporting on the appetite sensations experienced by pregnant women from rural Tanzania. Appetite changes associated with 545 pregnancies were compiled from surveys conducted to report on the prevalence of appetite loss, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, joint pain, cravings, aversions, and pica experienced by agropastoral women from rural north-central Tanzania. In addition to these symptoms, specific craved and aversive food groups are described. Statistical associations among appetite sensations, NVP, and birthweight are tested. The only symptom associated with a lower average birth weight for newborns was vomiting. In addition to investigating micronutrient content and chemical properties of specific food and non-food items, future research should include assessing relationships among various appetite sensations and short- and long-term health outcomes for both the mother and child.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanorexia 3abirth weight 3achildren 3afood groups 3anausea 3aneonates 3apain 3aphysicochemical properties 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3arural women 3asurveys 3avomiting 2aAdult 2aAppetitexphysiology 2aBirth Weightxphysiology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aFood Preferencesxpsychology 2aHumans 2aInfant, Low Birth Weight 2aInfant, Newborn 2aMorning Sicknessxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aNauseaxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aPicaxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aPregnancy 2aPregnancy Complications 2aPregnancy Outcome 2aPrevalence 2aRural Populationxstatistics & numerical data 2aVomitingxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 3aTanzania 0aTanzania 0afood cravings 0afood aversions 0apregnancy 0anausea and vomiting in pregnancy 0aNVP 0aTanzania0 tEcology of food and nutrition.g2012 Sept. 1, v. 51, no. 5 p.431-443dTaylor & Francis Groupx1543-52377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2012.696012  aDNAL 7aarticle01996naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245009500205300001600300520069000316592002801006650001501034650001501049650002201064650001401086650001201100650001301112650001201125650001201137650002401149650001101173650001201184650002301196653002901219653002401248653001801272700001401290700001401304700001801318700001801336773010201354856008501456852000901541655001201550IND60637397020221120044656.0190529e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063739702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2019.04.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Liqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6039-122410aExperimental study on adsorption of Hg(II) with microwave-assisted alkali-modified fly ash  ap. 153-158.  aMicrowave alkali-modified fly ash was prepared as an adsorbent for mercury (II) in aqueous solution and its adsorption kinetics and mechanism are reported in this paper.

Several other enzymes have homologous tertiary structures to HOs, while sharing little sequence homology. These homologues include thiaminases, the hydroxylase component of methane monooxygenases, and the R2 component of Class I ribonucleotide reductases (RNR). This study compared these structural homologues of HO, using a large number of protein sequences for each homologue. Alignment of a total of 472 sequences showed little sequence conservation, with no residues having conservation in more than 80% of aligned sequences and only five residues conserved in at least 60% of the sequences. Fourteen additional positions, most of which were critical for hydrophobic packing, displayed amino acid similarity of 60% or higher. Ten conserved sequence motifs were identified in HOs and RNRs. Phylogenetic analysis verified the existence of the four distinct groups of HO homologues, which were then analyzed by group entropy analysis to identify residues critical to the unique function of each enzyme. Other methods for determining functional residues were also performed. Several common index positions identified represent critical evolutionary changes that resulted in the unique function of each enzyme, suggesting potential targets for site‐directed mutagenesis. These positions included residues that coordinate ligands, form the active sites, and maintain enzyme structure.

MET1 is one of DNA methyltransferases that affect the level of methylation in the entire genome. To explore the effect of MET1 gene silencing on gene expression profile of Chrysanthemum × morifolium 'Zijingling'. The stem section and leaves at the young stage were taken for transcriptome sequencing. MET1-RNAᵢ leaves had 8 differentially expressed genes while 156 differentially expressed genes were observed in MET1-RNAᵢ stem compared with control leaves and stem. These genes encode many key proteins in plant biological processes, such as transcription factors, signal transduction mechanisms, secondary metabolite synthesis, transport and catabolism and interaction. In general, 34.58% of the differentially expressed genes in leaves and stems were affected by the reduction of the MET1 gene. The differentially expressed genes in stem and leaves of transgenic plants went through significant changes. We found adequate amount of candidate genes associated with flowering, however, the number of genes with significant differences between transgenic and control lines was not too high. Several flowering related genes were screened out for gene expression verification and all of them were obseved as consistent with transcriptome data. These candidate genes may play important role in flowering variation of chrysanthemum. This study reveals the mechanism of CmMET1 interference on the growth and development of chrysanthemum at the transcriptional level, which provides the basis for further research on the epigenetic regulation mechanism in flower induction and development.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1000403cNational Key Research and Development Program  a31372090cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a182300410026cScience and Technology Development Project of Henan 3aChrysanthemum 3aDNA methylation 3aDNA methyltransferase 3aRNA interference 3acatabolism 3aepigenetics 3aflowering 3agene expression 3agenes 3amolecular biology 3asecondary metabolites 3asignal transduction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics1 aZhu, Yi1 aLi, Shuai-lei1 aAi, Peng-hui1 aKhan, Muhammad Ayoub1 aDing, Hong-xu1 aWang, Ying1 aWang, Zi-cheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6086-90960 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2021 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.1455-1468dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-01022-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01543naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008500166300001800251520045200269592002800721650001800749650001300767650002000780650001100800650001400811650001100825650000900836700001800845700002200863700002900885700002100914700001800935700001900953773010700972856008101079852000901160655001201169IND60119289220221119192722.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011928922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-014-1155-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaltina, L.

Its simple neural circuit has made this behavior a model for examining neural control of movement. The S-start, initiated with an S-shaped body bend, is a physiologically distinct escape that occurs in esocid fishes. Here we examine whether zebrafish larvae perform S-starts in order to better understand startle diversity and to attempt to identify the S-start in a system that is tractable for neurobiological studies. We found that larval zebrafish startles varied in the extent of their caudal bending, resulting in C, S and intermediate-shaped responses. We recorded two distinct motor patterns: nearly simultaneous initial activity along one side of the body, characteristic of C-starts, and nearly simultaneous activity rostrally on one side and caudally on the other, characteristic of S-starts. Head stimulation generally elicited C-starts while tail stimulation elicited C- and S-starts. These results demonstrate that the S-start is more common than previously documented and occurs in early developmental stages. We suggest that the S-start may be a fundamental escape behavior in fishes and may provide a comparative model to the C-start for understanding simple neural circuits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aearly development 3aescape behavior 3afish 3alarvae 3amodels 3atail 2aAnimals 2aElectric Stimulationxmethods 2aLarva 2aMotor Activityxphysiology 2aNerve Netxphysiology 2aPhysical Stimulationxmethods 2aReflex, Startlexphysiology 2aSwimmingxphysiology 2aZebrafishxphysiology1 aBailey, Ian1 aHale, Melina E.0 tJournal of comparative physiology.g2012 Jan., v. 198, no. 1 p.11-24dSpringer-Verlagx0340-75947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00359-011-0682-1  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005900151245015900210520149400369592002801863650000801891650001201899650002401911650002101935650002601956650002001982650002902002650001202031650001602043650002102059650000702080650001902087650001602106653003202122653001702154653003402171653002602205700001802231700002302249773011802272856008602390852000902476655001202485IND60782775320221119171603.0221004e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078277532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdghim, Mohamad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9217-467010aPost-hydrolysis ammonia stripping as a new approach to enhance the two-stage anaerobic digestion of poultry manure: Optimization and statistical modelling  aPost-hydrolysis ammonia stripping was investigated as a new approach to enhance the methane potential of high ammonia substrates, such as poultry manure. The objective of the proposed approach is to address some of the noticeable disadvantages in the existing ammonia-stripping techniques i.e., treatment of raw samples and side-stream stripping. Poultry manure (PM) and a co-substrate (mixed wastes from a cheese factory and a coffee house, referred to as MS) characterized by a high carbon-to-nitrogen ratio were mixed at five different ratios: PM:MS of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100. Samples were hydrolyzed for six days to promote ammonia conversion from organic nitrogen and then the samples with higher ammonia levels (>2000 mg NH₃–N/L) were stripped with air at initial pH values of 9 and 10 and temperatures of 40 and 55 °C. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) test results showed that post-hydrolysis ammonia stripping had alleviated ammonia inhibition and improved methane potential up to 200% when compared with untreated samples. The ammonia removal efficiency was mostly affected by pH. On the other hand, methane potential was highest in the samples treated at a higher temperature as their biodegradability was enhanced when compared with the samples treated at lower temperatures. Post-BMP characterization showed that the proposed approach had also limited the increase of ammonia in the digestate which ensured proper growth of methanogenic microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aammonia 3aanaerobic digestion 3abiodegradability 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acheese industry 3aenvironmental management 3amethane 3amethanogens 3aorganic nitrogen 3apH 3apoultry manure 3atemperature 0aPoultry manure pretreatment 0aCo-digestion 0aBiochemical methane potential 0aStatistical modelling1 aSartaj, Majid1 aAbdehagh, Niloofar0 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 319 p.115717-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1157173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01587naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245002900172300001300201520081200214592002801026650001701054650001501071650001901086650000901105651001401114773008801128856008401216852000901300655001201309IND60085961020221117175613.0141101e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008596102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.quaint.2011.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChesner, Craig A.14aThe Toba Caldera Complex  ap. 5-18.  aThe Toba Caldera in Indonesia is one of the most remarkable volcanic features formed during Quaternary geologic time. Its rich history of research for over a century has yielded important information on the physical volcanology of silicic calderas and super-eruptions, geochemical evolution of silicic magma bodies, and geophysical imaging of active sub-volcanic systems. During the past 1.3 my, the Toba area has erupted intermediate composition lavas, followed by intermediate pyroclastics, three quartz-bearing silicic tuffs, and most recently, intermediate to silicic lavas. This pattern represents the incremental assembly and periodic eruption of a crustal magma body of batholithic proportions. The apparent migration of activity to the west, may have implications for the next?

In a previous work, we showed that the expression of the PreS2‐S gene of HBV in yeast was negatively regulated at the translational level dependent of glucose. In this study, we show that the S mRNA is detected in the polysomes indicating its active translation, while the PreS2‐S mRNA was mainly found in monosomes. Moreover, we used the gene reporter assay based on Zeocin resistance, to better characterize the PreS2 region responsible for this control. Two chimeric genes composed of the N‐ and C‐terminal part of the PreS2 fused to the Sh‐bleomycin gene conferring the resistance to Zeocin were expressed in yeast. We found that the strain expressing the N‐terminal part of the PreS2 was sensitive to Zeocin on rich medium with 2% glucose. In contrast, the strain harbouring the C‐terminal part of the PreS2 fused to the Sh‐bleomycin grew on Zeocin, indicating that the Sh‐bleomycin mRNA is efficiently translated, subsequently conferring resistance to Zeocin. Our data suggest the establishment of a translational control via the N‐terminal part of the PreS2 mediated by the presence of 2% glucose in the media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantibiotic resistance 3acarbon 3achimerism 3agene expression 3agenetic resistance 3aglucose 3amessenger RNA 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3apolyribosomes 3areporter genes 3atranslation (genetics) 3ayeasts1 aBorchani‐Chabchoub, Istabrak1 aGargouri, Ali1 aMokdad‐Gargouri, Raja0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.357-363dElsevier Sciencex1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.12117  aDNAL 7aarticle02536naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245011700162300001400279520115500293592002801448650001101476650002201487650001401509650002101523650001301544650001701557650001901574650001901593650000901612653003001621653003701651653005701688653003501745700001801780700001301798700001501811700001601826700001501842700001801857773012301875856008301998852000902081655001202090IND60737637920221117235735.0210820e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073763792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Hao12aA self-healing neutral aqueous rechargeable Zn/MnO2 battery based on modified carbon nanotubes substrate cathode  ap. 83-89.  aRechargeable aqueous Zn/MnO₂ batteries show great potential for grid-scale storage due to their low cost, high safety, and energy density, yet suffer from continuous capacity decay during operation. Therefore, this work proposes a capacity self-healing aqueous Zn/MnO₂ (Zn/cCNTs-MnO₂) battery using carboxyl-modified carbon nanotubes (cCNTs) as the cathode substrate, ZnSO₄ + MnSO₄ mixed aqueous solution as the electrolyte, and Zn foil as the anode. Based on the controllable electrodeposition reaction of MnO₂, the specific capacity of Zn/cCNTs-MnO₂ batteries can be achieved or recovered by operating several cycles under a low current density (0.1 mA cm⁻²). Then, the batteries can stably perform under a high current density (1 mA cm⁻²). By repeating the above steps, a capacity self-healing usage scheme was established, which can significantly improve the cycling performance of Zn/cCNTs-MnO₂ batteries. Moreover, the results of the proposed Zn/cCNTs-MnO₂ batteries verify the MnO₂ electrodeposition mechanism and introduce a novel method for the development of durable aqueous rechargeable Zn/MnO₂ batteries.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aaqueous solutions 3abatteries 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3aelectrolytes 3aelectroplating 3aenergy density 3afoil 0aAqueous Zn/MnO2 batteries 0aDeposition-dissolution mechanism 0aCarboxyl-modified carbon nanotubes cathode substrate 0aSelf-healing specific capacity1 aKuang, Haizhu1 aLiu, Fan1 aWu, Yuanke1 aCai, Shinan1 aXu, Maowen1 aBao, Shu-Juan0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 600 p.83-89dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04258naa a2200841 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001900169245013500188300001600323520162700339592002801966650002301994650001402017650001902031650001602050650002502066650002802091650001502119650001702134650001202151650004102163650002502204650004002229650002302269650001302292650001702305650001702322650002102339650001102360650001002371650000902381650005402390650003002444650002202474650003302496650002302529650002802552650002802580650008302608650000902691650001702700650002402717650001802741650001102759650002502770650001102795650000902806650007002815650001602885650004202901650001702943650002402960650002502984650001103009700001703020700002303037700001803060700001503078700002103093700001503114700001803129700002303147700001703170773012403187856008403311852000903395655001203404IND60083778820221116200541.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008377882DNAL7 a213169342pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2010.12.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSialvera, T.E.10aPhytosterols supplementation decreases plasma small and dense LDL levels in metabolic syndrome patients on a westernized type diet  ap. 843-848.  aBACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several studies have observed a hypocholesterolemic effect of plant sterols in hypercholesterolemic patients on a balanced diet. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of phytosterol supplementation on risk factors of coronary artery disease in metabolic syndrome patients on a Westernized type diet. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized placebo-controlled design 108 patients with metabolic syndrome were assigned to consume either 2 plant sterol-enriched yogurt mini drink which provided 4 g phytosterols per day, or a yogurt beverage without phytosterols (control). The duration of the study was 2 months and the patients in both groups followed their habitual westernized type diet and recording it on food diaries. Blood samples were drawn at baseline and after 2 months of intervention. After 2 months supplementation with phytosterols, a significant reduction in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, small and dense LDL (sdLDL) levels, as well as, apoB and triglycerides concentrations were observed in the intervention group (P < 0.05) compared to the control group. In addition, phytosterol supplementation lowered serum total cholesterol by 15.9%, LDL-cholesterol by 20.3% and triglyceride levels by 19.1% (P = 0.02, P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively), although the patients kept their habitual westernized type diet. No differences were observed in HDL cholesterol, apoA1, glucose, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen levels and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Phytosterol supplementation improves risk factors of coronary artery disease even if the diet is a westernized type.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3abeverages 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3acholesteremic effect 3acoronary artery disease 3afibrinogen 3afood records 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3ametabolic syndrome 3apatients 3aphytosterols 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 3ayogurt 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixblood 2aArterial Pressure 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aC-Reactive Protein 2aCholesterol, HDLxblood 2aCholesterol, LDLxblood 2aCoronary Artery Diseasexcomplicationsxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aDiet 2aDiet Records 2aDietary Supplements 2aEnergy Intake 2aFemale 2aFibrinogenxanalysis 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMetabolic Syndromexcomplicationsxdrug therapyxphysiopathology. 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytosterolsxadministration & dosage 2aRisk Factors 2aSingle-Blind Method 2aTriglyceridesxblood 2aYogurt1 aPounis, G.D.1 aKoutelidakis, A.E.1 aRichter, D.J.1 aYfanti, G.1 aKapsokefalou, M.1 aGoumas, G.1 aChiotinis, N.1 aDiamantopoulos, E.1 aZampelas, A.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2012 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.843-848dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2010.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01423naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245006200163300001800225520037000243592002800613650002100641650002200662650001300684650004400697650001200741700001400753700001700767700001900784700001400803700001600817700001400833700001700847773010700864856008100971852000901052655001201061IND60119289420221119193012.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011928942DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-014-1157-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHou, Senlin10aMALDI-MS of Pseudo-Alkaloid Taxanes from Taxus canadensis  ap. 1050-1055.  aSix previously reported taxanes with alkaloid side chains were isolated from the methanol extract of the needles of Taxus canadensis.

We used digital holographic microscopy to compare the refractive index and dry mass density of two B16 murine melanoma sublines of different metastatic potential. Using statistical methods, the distribution of phase shifts within the reconstructed quantitative phase images was analyzed by the method of bimodality coefficients. The observed correlation of refractive index, dry mass density and bimodality profile with the metastatic potential of the cells was validated by real time impedance‐based assay and clonogenic tests. We suggest that the refractive index and bimodality analysis of quantitative phase image histograms could be developed as optical biomarkers useful in label‐free detection and quantitative evaluation of cell metastatic potential.  aPublisher supplied data  a24450/01.10.2013cRomanian Ministry of Education 3abiomarkers 3acell division 3amass density 3amelanoma 3amembrane permeability 3ametastasis 3amice 3amicroscopy 3aquantitative analysis 3arefractive index1 aMihailescu, Mona1 aScarlat, Eugen I.1 aBaluta, Alexandra V.1 aCalin, Daniel1 aKovacs, Eugenia1 aSavopol, Tudor1 aMoisescu, Mihaela G.0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.1527-1538dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02563naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009600162300001600258520119400274592002801468650002901496650002601525650001701551650001701568650001501585650002701600650001701627650002001644650001001664650001301674650001601687650001201703650001901715700002001734700001801754700002101772700001701793700002001810700002001830773017901850856007902029852000902108655001202117IND50074055220221119155740.0150218e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007405522DNAL7 a10.1111/1567-1364.120982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTakada, Yuki10aIsolation and characterization of baker's yeast capable of strongly activating a macrophage  ap. 261-269.  aA physiological function of the β‐glucans which constitute the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is to activate immune cells. Here, we focused on the immunostimulation ability of S. cerevisiae itself to give this ability to fermented foods including yeast. Previously, we found that in S. cerevisiae the deletion of MCD4 gene causes exposure of β‐glucans on the cell surface and that the mcd4 deletion mutant strongly enhances immunity in vitro and in vivo. However, this is not a practical strain but a genetically modified strain with an antibiotic resistance gene, and growth was very slow. The aim of this study was to acquire a practical strain capable of strongly activating a macrophage. The parental strain y‐21 was mutated with ethyl methanesulfonate, and the resulting strain was screened. Two mutants (AP‐57 and AQ‐37) were obtained. AQ‐37 had the same fermentation capacity as y‐21. In addition, a mutation point of AQ‐37 was identified, suggesting that the mutation of NDD1 gene affects the cell wall structure and confers a high ability for macrophage stimulation. The obtained yeast may activate immune cells in materials to which the yeast is added.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantibiotic resistance 3abakers yeast 3abeta-glucans 3acell walls 3aethyl methanesulfonate 3afermentation 3afermented foods 3agenes 3aimmunity 3amacrophages 3amutants 3apoint mutation1 aNishino, Yumiko1 aIto, Chinatsu1 aWatanabe, Hajime1 aKanzaki, Ken1 aTachibana, Taro1 aAzuma, Masayuki0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.261-269dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.120983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03566naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245011100167300001800278520189400296592002802190650002602218650003102244650003002275650003102305650000902336650001102345650001402356650001702370650001702387650001302404650001302417650001402430650001802444650001702462650001602479650001302495650001902508650002102527650002202548650001702570650002402587650002602611650001402637650001302651650001102664700002102675700002302696700006902719773013302788856008202921852000903003655001203012IND60745698420221119033624.0210723e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074569842DNAL7 a10.1007/s12298-021-01034-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaral, Anamika10aPlant growth promoting bacteria induce anti-quorum-sensing substances in chickpea legume seedling bioassay  ap. 1577-1595.  aMicroorganisms and their hosts communicate through an array of signals. Many physiological processes regulated in quorum sensing (QS) are dependent on auto-inducers, like N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) as in numerous groups of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. In vitro grown seven-day old chickpea seedlings treated with plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPRs) were used to screen the AHL mimicking and for phytochemical substances like phytohormones and secondary metabolites such as phenolics and flavonoids. Potential anti-quorum sensing (anti-QS) activity surrounding the roots on semi-solid agar lawn of Chromobacterium violaceum (ATCC12742) was observed. Crude protein (4.46–8.30 μg/mL) and methanolic extracts (100 μg/mL) of seedling gave moderate anti-QS activity against CV12742 anti QS bioassay, respectively. Crude protein and methanolic extract of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (34.00 ± 2.23; 34.00 ± 4.33 mm) and B. subtilis A (27.00 ± 2.10; 3.29 ± 2.16 mm) treated samples showed higher zone of inhibition due to anti-QS activity. Phytohormone analysis using LC–MS for zeatin, auxin and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) indicated that phytohormones were significantly upregulated by 1909.80 ng/g FW, 669.67 ng/g FW and 244.55 ng/g FW, respectively in Pseudomonas brassicacearum treated seedlings compared to control. UHPLC of PGPR treated seedlings showed overly expressed gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, catechin, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, catechol, vanillin, and ferulic acid in B. amyloliquefaciens treated seedlings compared to others. Enrichment analysis identified significant pathways related to metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The present study indicates that chickpea neutralizes an extensive range of functional responses to AHLs that may play important role in legume host-microbe interactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3aBacillus amyloliquefaciens 3aChromobacterium violaceum 3aPseudomonas brassicacearum 3aagar 3aauxins 3abioassays 3abiosynthesis 3acaffeic acid 3acatechin 3acatechol 3achickpeas 3acrude protein 3aferulic acid 3agallic acid 3alactones 3alawns and turf 3amethyl jasmonate 3amolecular biology 3aplant growth 3aprotocatechuic acid 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3avanillin 3azeatin1 aKanekar, Saptami1 aKoul, Kirtee Kumar1 aBhagyawant, Sameer Suresh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4405-59300 tPhysiology and molecular biology of plants.g2021 July, v. 27, no. 7 p.1577-1595dSpringer IndiawJournal:22882x0971-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-021-01034-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002600145245012700171300001800298500002000316520138500336592002801721596009401749596006401843596003901907596006701946650001302013650002802026650001902054650001902073700002202092700002502114700002002139700002002159773011202179856008002291852000902371655001202380IND60790282620221119064511.0220824e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079028262DNAL7 a10.1002/2211-5463.122802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRamos‐León, Félix10aSeptal protein SepJ from the heterocyst‐forming cyanobacterium Anabaena forms multimers and interacts with peptidoglycan  ap. 1515-1526.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHeterocyst‐forming cyanobacteria grow as filaments that can be hundreds of cells long. Proteinaceous septal junctions provide cell–cell binding and communication functions in the filament. In Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120, the SepJ protein is important for the formation of septal junctions. SepJ consists of integral membrane and extramembrane sections – the latter including linker and coiled‐coil domains. SepJ (predicted MW, 81.3 kDa) solubilized from Anabaena membranes was found in complexes of about 296–334 kDa, suggesting that SepJ forms multimeric complexes. We constructed an Anabaena strain producing a double‐tagged SepJ protein (SepJ‐GFP‐His₁₀) and isolated the tagged protein by a two‐step affinity chromatography procedure. Analysis of the purified protein preparation provided no indication of the presence of specific SepJ partners, but suggested that SepJ is processed to remove an N‐terminal fragment. Additionally, pull‐down experiments showed that His₆‐tagged versions of SepJ and of the SepJ coiled‐coil domain interact with Anabaena peptidoglycan (PG). Our results indicate that SepJ forms multimers, that it interacts with PG, and that the coiled‐coil domain is involved in this interaction. These observations support the idea that SepJ is a component of the septal junctions that join the cells in the Anabaena filament.  aPublisher supplied data  cFPI (Formación de Personal Investigador) fellowship/contract from the Spanish Government  aBFU2014‐56757‐PcPlan Nacional de Investigación, Spain  cEuropean Regional Development Fund  a307335cCenter of Excellence Grant from the Academy of Finland 3aAnabaena 3aaffinity chromatography 3apeptidoglycans 3asolubilization1 aMariscal, Vicente1 aBattchikova, Natalia1 aAro, Eva‐Mari1 aFlores, Enrique0 tFEBS Open Bio.g2017 Oct., v. 7, no. 10 p.1515-1526dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:23386x2211-54637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2211-5463.122803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02410naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010800153300001600261500002000277520116800297592002801465650002001493650000901513650001901522650002601541650001201567650001401579700001901593700001601612700001601628700001601644700002601660700001401686700001801700700001601718700001601734700001701750773013901767856007301906852000901979655001201988IND60588103520221119115428.0180103e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058810352DNAL7 a10.1111/vco.121842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoggi, A.10aPrognostic significance of Ki67 evaluated by flow cytometry in dogs with high‐grade B‐cell lymphoma  ap. 431-440.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aKi67 can discriminate between high‐ and low‐grade canine lymphomas, but its prognostic role in specific subtypes of the neoplasm is unknown. We assessed the prognostic significance of Ki67% (percentage of Ki67‐positive cells), evaluated by flow cytometry, in 40 dogs with high‐grade B‐cell lymphoma, treated with a modified Wisconsin–Madison protocol (UW‐25). The following variables were investigated for association with lymphoma specific survival (LSS) and relapse free interval (RFI): Ki67%, breed, sex, age, stage, substage, complete remission (CR). By multivariate analysis, Ki67% (P = 0.009) and achievement of CR (P = 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for LSS. Dogs with intermediate Ki67% (20.1–40%) presented longer LSS and RFI (median = 866 and 428 days, respectively) than dogs with low (median = 42 days, P < 0.001; median = 159 days, P = 0.014) or high (median = 173 days, P = 0.038; median = 100 days, P = 0.126) values. Determination of Ki67 is a prognostic tool that improves the clinical usefulness of flow cytometric analysis in canine high‐grade B‐cell lymphoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-cell lymphoma 3adogs 3aflow cytometry 3amultivariate analysis 3arelapse 3aremission1 aMiniscalco, B.1 aMorello, E.1 aGattino, F.1 aDelaude, A.1 aFerrero Poschetto, L.1 aAresu, L.1 aGelain, M.

Pereira, Taís10aEvaluation of solid waste management sustainability of a coastal municipality from northeastern Brazil  aMunicipal solid waste has increased in volume all over the world. In developing countries in particular this may cause severe impacts to the environment and public health. In Brazil, many municipalities present difficulties to sustainably manage their solid waste. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate waste management quality in a coastal municipality in Brazil, Mata de São João, and test the applicability of a system of indicators to reach this goal. A sustainability indicator matrix for municipal solid waste management was used, which was based on the five sustainability dimensions defined by the Brazilian National Policy on Solid Waste (NPSW) (political, economic, environmental, cultural, and social). Results indicated that Mata de São João presents low municipal solid waste management sustainability due to: (i) lack of an Integrated Municipal Solid Waste Plan; (ii) absence of selective waste collection; (iii) economic insufficiency of public cleaning service; (iv) environmental education restricted to tourist areas; (v) absence of means for social control over public policies related to solid waste; and (vi) lack of a social inclusion program for the municipality's recyclable material collectors. Comparisons with reports of Brazilian federal agencies and research institutes indicated that the problems faced by Mata de São João regarding its adequacy to the NPSW are similar to those of other small municipalities in Brazil. The methodology used in the present study can be easily conducted by municipal technicians and managers who have access to information concerning this issue and can also be used in other Brazilian municipalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3acleaning 3acoastal zone management 3acollectors 3adeveloping countries 3aenvironmental education 3amunicipal solid waste 3apolitics 3apublic health 3apublic policy 3aresearch institutions 3atechnicians 3atourists 3awaste management 3aBrazil 0aMunicipal solid waste management 0aBrazilian national policy on solid waste 0aIndicators 0aSustainability1 aFernandino, Gerson0 tOcean & coastal management.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 179 p.104839-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11975x0964-56917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2019.1048393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03747naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245015600175300001100331520184000342592002802182596005602210596007002266650001602336650001702352650001802369650002502387650001202412650001202424650002602436650001202462650002102474650002102495650001902516650002602535650001702561650001902578650001402597650001402611700001802625700001902643700001902662700001902681700001902700700002102719700001902740700002502759700002302784700002002807700002202827700001602849700006002865773014102925856008203066852000903148655001203157IND60749936120221119001526.0211229e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074993612DNAL7 a10.1186/s40538-021-00242-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammerschmiedt, Tereza10aAssessing the potential of biochar aged by humic substances to enhance plant growth and soil biological activity [Erratum: December 2021, v.8(1); p.64]  ap. 46.  aBACKGROUND: Soil carbon-rich organic amendments (biochar, humic substances) may improve the quality and fertility of arable soil. Their co-application can additively enhance the beneficial effect on soil. Hypothetically, the pre-treatment of biochar, by aging via soaking in a solution of commercially available humic substances, could result in synergism, which may exceed the benefit from simple co-application of both amendments to the soil. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of biochar, humic substances, the combination of both, and the impact of biochar aged by humic substances solution on soil microbial activities and plant growth in a short-term pot experiment with lettuce. RESULTS: The aging of biochar decreased the C:N ratio as compared to non-activated biochar. The co-application of biochar and humic substances into the soil resulted in the highest microbial biomass carbon and respiration activity. The majority of enzyme activities (β-glucosidase, arylsulfatase, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, phosphatase) were the highest in humic substances-amended soil. The application of humic substances and biochar with humic substances seemed to stimulate microbial growth and activity followed by the competition of microflora for nutrients with plants, whereas the aged biochar behaved differently. The plants treated by aged biochar achieved the highest values of dry aboveground and root biomass of all variants. However, the assumed rapid uptake of nutrients by plants resulted in lower nutrient availability for microflora, and a decline in microbial viability. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, the positive effect of co-applied humic substances and biochar on soil fertility, quality, and health can be concluded. The usability of biochar aging by humic solution requires further study.  aPublisher supplied data  aTH03030319cTechnology Agency of the Czech Republic  aFCH-S-21-7398cministerstvo školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy 3aagriculture 3aarable soils 3aarylsulfatase 3abioactive properties 3abiochar 3abiomass 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3alettuce 3amicrobial carbon 3amicrobial growth 3amicroorganisms 3anutrient availability 3aplant growth 3asoil fertility 3asynergism 3aviability1 aHolatko, Jiri1 aPecina, Vaclav1 aHuska, Dalibor1 aLatal, Oldrich1 aKintl, Antonin1 aRadziemska, Maja1 aṢādiq, Em.,1 aGusiatin, Zygmunt M.1 aKolackova, Martina1 aNasir, Muhammad1 aBaltazar, Tivadar1 aAhmed, Niaz1 aBrtnicky, Martin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5237-722X0 tChemical and biological technologies in agriculture.g2021 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.46-46dSpringer International Publishingx2196-56417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40538-021-00242-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02302naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002100145245009500166300001600261520121800277592002801495650002901523650001101552650002001563650001401583650001501597650001201612650001201624650002001636650001101656700003001667773017901697856007901876852000901955655001201964IND50074055420221119155842.0150218e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007405542DNAL7 a10.1111/1567-1364.121092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalakar, Pushkar10aGAL regulon of Saccharomyces cerevisiae performs optimally to maximize growth on galactose  ap. 346-356.  aThe GAL regulon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a well‐characterized genetic network that is utilized for the metabolism of galactose as an energy source. The network contains a transcriptional activator, Gal4p, which binds to its cognate‐binding site to express GAL genes. Further, Gal80p and Gal3p are the repressor and galactose sensor, respectively, which are also under the regulation of GAL regulon. It is shown that the wild‐type strain produces only about 80% of the maximum expression feasible from the regulon, which is observed in a mutant strain lacking Gal80p. This raises a fundamental question regarding the optimality of expression from the GAL regulon in S. cerevisiae. To address this issue, we evaluated the burden on growth due to the synthesis of GAL proteins in S. cerevisiae. The analysis demonstrated that both the media type and the extent of enzyme synthesized play a role in determining the burden on growth. We show that the burden can be quantified by relating to a parameter, β, the ratio of enzyme activity to the initial substrate concentration. The analysis demonstrated that the GAL regulon of the wild‐type strain performed effectively to optimize growth on galactose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aenergy 3aenzyme activity 3agalactose 3ametabolism 3amutants 3aregulon 3atransactivators 3ayeasts1 aVenkatesh, Kareenhalli V.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.346-356dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.121093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01455naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168300001800249500001500267520033800282592002800620650001300648650002500661650002300686650001400709650003100723650002100754650001400775653001100789700002200800700002100822700002100843700002000864773010700884856008100991852000901072655001201081IND60119289820221119192856.0141211e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011928982DNAL7 a10.1007/s10600-014-1160-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomanenko, N.

However, this relationship can be enriched by allowing ‘wild’ non‐Saccharomyces yeast to participate in a sequential manner in the early phases of grape must fermentation. However, such a triangular relationship is complex and can only be taken to ‘the next level’ if there are no spoilage yeast present and if the ‘wine yeast’ – S. cerevisiae – is able to exert its dominance in time to successfully complete the alcoholic fermentation. Winemakers apply various ‘matchmaking’ strategies (e.g. cellar hygiene, pH, SO₂, temperature and nutrient management) to keep ‘spoilers’ (e.g. Dekkera bruxellensis) at bay, and allow ‘compatible’ wild yeast (e.g. Torulaspora delbrueckii, Pichia kluyveri, Lachancea thermotolerans and Candida/Metschnikowia pulcherrima) to harmonize with potent S. cerevisiae wine yeast and bring the best out in wine. Mismatching can lead to a ‘two is company, three is a crowd’ scenario. More than 40 of the 1500 known yeast species have been isolated from grape must. In this article, we review the specific flavour‐active characteristics of those non‐Saccharomyces species that might play a positive role in both spontaneous and inoculated wine ferments. We seek to present ‘single‐species’ and ‘multi‐species’ ferments in a new light and a new context, and we raise important questions about the direction of mixed‐fermentation research to address market trends regarding so‐called ‘natural’ wines. This review also highlights that, despite the fact that most frontier research and technological developments are often focussed primarily on S. cerevisiae, non‐Saccharomyces research can benefit from the techniques and knowledge developed by research on the former.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida 3aDekkera bruxellensis 3aMetschnikowia pulcherrima 3aPichia kluyveri 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aTorulaspora delbrueckii 3aalcoholic fermentation 3agrape must 3ahygiene 3amarkets 3amarriage 3anutrient management 3aspoilage 3asulfur dioxide 3atemperature 3awine yeasts 3awinemaking 3awines1 aVarela, Cristian1 aPretorius, Isak S.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2014 Mar., v. 14, no. 2 p.215-237dPublished by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societiesx1567-13567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1567-1364.121113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03805naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003800113040001800151100001400169245011600183300001600299520176800315592002802083650001902111650001602130650002002146650001302166650002102179650001902200650001702219650001602236650001202252650001302264650002402277650001702301650001502318650001002333650000902343650001902352650002802371650002502399650002802424650001102452650001102463650005702474650007402531650000902605650001602614650001502630650001702645650004502662650005802707650001602765700001502781700001602796700001702812700001402829700001602843700001402859700001302873700001602886773012402902856008403026852000903110655001203119IND60083779220221116200533.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008377922DNAL7 a219372072pmid7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2011.06.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFallo, F.10aLow serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in essential hypertension  ap. 871-876.  aBACKGROUND AND AIM: Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels may have an important role in predisposing to hypertension and myocardial disease. We investigated the relationship between 25(OH)D and left ventricular (LV) structure and function, assessed by echocardiography, in a series of patients with essential hypertension (EH). METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixty-two newly diagnosed never-treated patients (32 male/30 female), aged 18–65 years, with grade 1–2 hypertension, no diabetes, no obesity, no hyperlipidemia, and no cardiopulmonary, renal, or hepatic disease, were studied. Twenty-four healthy normotensive sex-, age-, BMI-matched subjects served as controls. Hypertensive patients with 25(OH)D deficiency, defined as serum 25(OH)D levels <50 nmol/L, had higher prevalence of LV hypertrophy (LVH) than their 25(OH)D-sufficient counterparts (57.1 vs 17.6%, P = 0.02); no differences between the two groups were found in blood pressure levels as well as in other biochemical and hormone parameters. There was an inverse correlation between LV mass index and 25(OH)D levels (r = –0.366, P < 0.003) and a direct correlation between LV mass index and BMI (r = 0.333, P < 0.006) in the entire hypertensive population. The two variables remained independently associated with LVH at multivariable logistic regression analysis (OR 1.05, P < 0.005 and OR 1.25, P = 0.03, respectively). Prevalence of 25(OH)D deficiency was similar in EH patients and controls (45.1 vs 41.6%, P = 0.89), whereas no correlation between echocardiographic parameters and hormone levels was found. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of major cardiovascular risk factors, 25(OH)D deficiency is a frequent finding in EH patients and is independently associated with LVH.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3adiabetes 3aechocardiography 3ahyperlipidemia 3ahypertension 3ahypertrophy 3aobesity 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBlood Pressure 2aCardiovascular Diseases 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypertensionxbloodxcomplicationsxphysiopathology. 2aHypertrophy, Left Ventricularxbloodxcomplicationsxphysiopathology. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPrevalence 2aRisk Factors 2aVitamin Dxanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aVitamin D Deficiencyxcomplicationsxphysiopathology. 2aYoung Adult1 aCatena, C.1 aCamozzi, V.1 aLuisetto, G.1 aCosma, C.1 aPlebani, M.1 aLupia, M.1 aTona, F.1 aSechi, L.A.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2012 Oct., v. 22, no. 10 p.871-876dElsevier B.V.x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2011.06.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01918naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245007400129300001600203500006300219500001500282520064300297650001600940650002500956650002300981650001101004650001301015650002701028651001501055651001501070651001301085653001401098653002401112653002401136653002701160653002101187653002201208653002301230700002201253700001901275700001601294773007201310852000901382930003301391945001301424946001101437655001201448IND2044079120221119100545.0950113e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204407912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStermitz, F.R.10aIridoid glycosides from some butterflies and their larval food plants  ap. 997-999.  aPart 29 in the series 'Chemistry of the Scrophulariaceae.'  a2019-12-05  aCatalpol was the major iridoid glycoside isolated from Penstemon newberryi and P. strictus.

We investigated whether 4 weeks of near normalisation of blood glucose (BG) improves the potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by GLP-1. Methods Nine obese patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control (HbA₁c 8.0 ± 0.4%) were investigated before and after 4 weeks of near normalisation of BG using insulin treatment (mean diurnal blood glucose 6.4 ± 0.3 mmol/l, HbA₁c 6.6 ± 0.3%). Nine matched healthy participants were also studied. Beta cell function was investigated before and after insulin treatment using stepwise glucose infusions and infusion of saline or GLP-1 (1.0 pmol kg⁻¹ min⁻¹), resulting in supraphysiological total GLP-1 concentrations of approximately 200 pmol/l. The responsiveness to glucose or glucose+GLP-1 was expressed as the slope of the linear regression line relating insulin secretion rate (ISR) and plasma glucose concentration (pmol kg⁻¹ min⁻¹ [mmol/l]⁻¹). Results In the diabetic participants, the slopes during glucose+saline infusion did not differ before and after insulin treatment (0.33 ± 0.07 and 0.39 ± 0.04, respectively; p = NS). In contrast, near normalisation of blood glucose improved beta cell sensitivity to glucose during glucose+GLP-1 infusion (1.27 ± 0.2 before vs 1.73 ± 0.31 after; p < 0.01). In the healthy participants, the slopes during the glucose+saline and glucose+GLP-1 infusions were 1.01 ± 0.14 and 4.79 ± 0.53, respectively. Conclusions/interpretation A supraphysiological dose of GLP-1 enhances beta cell responses to glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes, and 4 weeks of near normalisation of blood glucose further improves this effect.

Different levels of vine growth were generated by implementing three management schemes: (i) perennial cover crop, (ii) chemical weed control and (iii) irrigation and fertilisation. Grey mould incidence was assessed at harvest, together with various sets of variables linked with canopy microclimate, shoot vigour, vine capacity, cluster architecture, yield components and fruit composition. Significant positive correlations were observed between disease incidence and key variables of shoot vigour and vine capacity: total leaf number, leaf dry matter, leaf layer number, leaf area per metre of row, pruning mass and nitrogen accumulation. In 2004, Botrytis cinerea developed in all experimental plots because climatic and microclimatic conditions were conducive to grey mould. The climatic and microclimatic variables that significantly favoured grey mould development were: precipitation, duration of relative humidity >90% in the canopy and low potential evapotranspiration. However, in 2005 and 2006, under dry summer conditions, disease developed only in the most vigorous vines, which were both irrigated and fertilised. These vines showed a very high canopy growth, very compact clusters and a delayed fruit maturity. This evidenced that unfavourable climatic conditions for the disease development can be counterbalanced by conditions of high vine growth and associated canopy and cluster features. 3avines 3acanopy 3agrapes 3avigor 3aBotrytis cinerea 3amicroclimate 3ashoots 3avegetative growth 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adisease resistance 3afruit composition 3aclimatic factors 3amolds (fungi) 3adisease incidence 3aFrance 0aplant growth1 aFermaud, Marc1 aRoudet, Jean1 aCalonnec, Agnès1 aGary, Christian0 tCrop protection.g2008 Aug., v. 27, no. 8 p.1174-1186dElsevier Sciencex0261-21947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cropro.2008.02.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080616b20080704c00000000  aINDdGAYe2008/06/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03455naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004000110040001800150100001800168245010700186300001800293500001500311520175300326650002102079650002202100650001402122650002502136650001802161650002402179650002602203650002402229650002802253650003102281650003002312650002702342650001802369650004902387650002702436650002302463653001202486653002802498653002502526653001902551700001502570700001602585700001502601773010402616852000902720856009002729930003302819945001302852946001302865990002302878655001202901IND2046580120221119100853.0950626e199504  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204658012DNAL7 a76262432pmid7 a10.1080/07391102.1995.105088002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKralovics, R.10aDNA curvature of the tobacco GRS repetitive sequence family and its relation to nucleosome positioning  ap. 1103-1119.  a2019-12-04  aRecently, a highly repetitive DNA sequence family (GRS) from tobacco was described in our laboratory. These sequences were found to be localized predominantly in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of tobacco chromosomes. To test the hypothesis that these sequences play an important role in the formation of heterochromatin, we investigated the DNA curvature of the GRS sequences and its possible impact to the chromatin structure at these loci. Application of the nearest-neighbour wedge model of intrinsic DNA curvature for the GRS1 family member predicted two loci of curvature: a major bend at the 5' end of the sequence and a minor bend of opposite direction at the centre of the GRS1. The presence of the major and the minor loci of DNA curvature was studied experimentally using permutation analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. The experimental results were consistent with the computer predictions. We gave evidence that the described DNA curvature is also present in the entire GRS family. Genomic statistical sequencing showed the conservation of the major bend sequence determinants in the members of the GRS family. To investigate the chromatin structure at the GRS sequences, we determined the nucleosome positioning in vivo at these sequences using thermal cycle primer extension. A relation between the curvature pattern and the histone octamer position was observed: the major bend is excluded from the nucleosome surface to the linker region, while the minor bend is distributed along the core DNA. The suggestion is made that the sequences in the minor locus of curvature define the rotational setting of the nucleosome, and a possible role of the major bend as a factor, which defines the translational setting, is discussed. 3aDNA conformation 3aNicotiana tabacum 3achromatin 3arepetitive sequences 2aBase Sequence 2aComputer Simulation 2aDNA, Plantxchemistry 2aHistonesxchemistry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aNucleosomesxchemistry 2aPlants, Toxic 2aRepetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acidxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTobaccoxchemistry 0abending 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0agenbank/x782631 aFajkus, J.1 aKovarik, A.1 aBezdek, M.0 tJournal of biomolecular structure & dynamics.g1995 Apr., v. 12, no. 5 p.1103-1119x0739-11027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07391102.1995.105088003Available from publisher's Web site  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03173naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245016600182300001600348520127700364650001201641650002901653650001201682650003501694650001001729650002201739650001501761650001101776650001401787650001901801650001101820650001101831650001901842650001701861650001201878650001001890650001201900650003801912650001401950650003801964650003502002650001102037650001302048650001102061650002902072650001002101650002102111651001002132651001002142653000802152653000902160700001502169700002102184700001702205700001702222773013402239852000902373856008502382930003302467946001102500655001202511IND4415109320221119100405.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441510932DNAL7 a182785612pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0211-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, P.

The impact was assessed using an information extraction method applied to temporal satellite data (LANDSAT and IRS scenes) in GIS domain. For assessing the impact on natural resources, the classification scheme was restricted to (1) Forest patches ((a) completely cleared, (b) partially cleared, (c) least affected), (2) Non-Forest ((d) completely changed, (e) least changed), (3) Industrial/Mining area, and (4) River. Over the three decades 22.22% of forests have been completely cleared and converted to industrial setup. Another 25% is completely cleared and 10% is degraded. Around 4% of agricultural area is totally affected due to industrial activity. Random assessment of plant distribution (Trees, Shrubs and Herbs) indicates significant changes in the herb distribution directly related to distance gradient form the industrial/mining setup.

Depth, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and transparency (Secchi disk) were measured in situ, while collected water samples were analyzed in the laboratory for the determination of BOD, COD, total phosphorus (TP), ortho-phosphate (OP), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, total Κjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) and heavy metals (Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Pb, Ni and Cd). Measured concentrations were compared to those from two previous studies conducted in July 1987 to June 1988 and January 1991 to February 1993. The following conclusions are drawn: the effect of the watershed on the lake environment, mostly through Aliakmon River, is significant, and it accelerates the eutrophication of the lake. The anoxic zones, which were defined in the lake, reinforce this conclusion. Nitrate, nitrite and ammonia were measured at lower concentrations compared to previous studies, while total phosphorus and chlorophyll-a were found at increased concentrations. The current trophic state of Polyphytos reservoir is eutrophic, based on the OECD method and Carlson's Trophic State Indices (TSI). The concentration of BOD and COD ranged at low levels. Furthermore, the mean concentrations of metals Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Pb, and Cd were below the potable water standards set by WHO and EU. During most part of the study period the ratio N/P for Polyphytos reservoir was higher than 7.2:1, and therefore, phosphorus is the limiting nutrient for algal growth. 3amonitoring 3anutrients 3aeutrophication 3aheavy metals 0aANOVA 0aPolyphytos reservoir 0aAliakmon River1 aTsihrintzis, Vassilios A.1 aAkratos, Christos S.1 aHaralambidis, Georgios0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2009 Feb., v. 149, no. 1-4 p.163-181dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0191-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01973naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245006400143300001800207500001500225520046700240650001400707650000900721650002100730650001100751650002200762650003600784650002700820650001000847650005200857650002600909650005300935650003600988650002201024650002801046650002701074650003301101650005201134650003201186650003501218651001001253653002301263700001401286700001501300773007401315852000901389930003301398945001301431946001101444655001201455IND2043650620221119100416.0941212e199408  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204365062DNAL7 a77654372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOuyang, Y.10aCanthin-6-one alkaloids from Brucea mollis var. tonkinensis  ap. 1543-1546.  a2019-12-05  aThree new alkaloids were isolated from the root-wood of Brucea mollis var. tonkinensis collected in China.

This effect has generally been attributed to the action of endogenous pectinesterase which hydrolyzes the methyl ester linkages in pectin molecules. The resulting free carboxyl groups then form Ca-bridges between pectin molecules. We hove shown, by using the pectinesterases of pea sprouts, that the enzymes catalyzed not only the hydrolysis of the methoxyl groups of pectin molecules, but also a transacylation reaction of the galacturonic acyl groups from methanol to other hydroxyl groups of pectin. The latter reaction results in the formation of new ester linkages between pectin molecules, which also contributes to the firming of the tissue. The pectinesterases have been separated into four isozymes, PE1, PE2, PE3, and PE5. The isozymes exhibited similar transacylation activity, with the exception of PE5 that did not catalyze transacylation. 3ahydrolysis 3aisozymes 3amethanol 3apeas 3apectinesterase 3apectins 3aprecooking 3atemperature 3avegetables1 aChang, W.H.0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g1997, v. 20, no. 5 p.397-416x0145-88847nnas  aDNAL  a19980902b19980908c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02984naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245012100168300001600289520182100305650001602126650001802142653001602160653001902176653001302195653002202208700002102230700002302251700002502274700002202299700002602321700002302347773010202370852000902472856008502481930003302566946001102599655001202610IND4403401920221119100730.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440340192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10719-007-9092-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVideira, Paula A. 10aSurface α2-3- and α2-6-sialylation of human monocytes and derived dendritic cells and its influence on endocytosis  ap. 259-268.  aSeveral glycoconjugates are involved in the immune response. Sialic acid is frequently the glycan terminal sugar and it may modulate immune interactions. Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells with high endocytic capacity and a central role in immune regulation. On this basis, DCs derived from monocytes (mo-DC) are utilised in immunotherapy, though many features are ignored and their use is still limited. We analyzed the surface sialylated glycans expressed during human mo-DC generation. This was monitored by lectin binding and analysis of sialyltransferases (ST) at the mRNA level and by specific enzymatic assays. We showed that α2-3-sialylated O-glycans and α2-6- and α2-3-sialylated N-glycans are present in monocytes and their expression increases during mo-DC differentiation. Three main ST genes are committed with this rearrangement: ST6Gal1 is specifically involved in the augmented α2-6-sialylated N-glycans; ST3Gal1 contributes for the α2-3-sialylation of O-glycans, particularly T antigens; and ST3Gal4 may contribute for the increased α2-3-sialylated N-glycans. Upon mo-DC maturation, ST6Gal1 and ST3Gal4 are downregulated and ST3Gal1 is altered in a stimulus-dependent manner. We also observed that removing surface sialic acid of immature mo-DC by neuraminidase significantly decreased its endocytic capacity, while it increased in monocytes. Our results indicate the STs expression modulates the increased expression of surface sialylated structures during mo-DC generation, which is probably related with changes in cell mechanisms. The ST downregulation after mo-DC maturation probably results in a decreased sialylation or sialylated glycoconjugates involved in the endocytosis, contributing to the downregulation of one or more antigen-uptake mechanisms specific of mo-DC. 3aendocytosis 3aimmunotherapy 0aSialic acid 0aDendritic cell 0aMonocyte 0aSialyltransferase1 aAmado, Inês F. 1 aCrespo, Hélio J. 1 aAlgueró, M.

At 40C Cod trypsin was inactivated by a 2nd order reaction; n = 2 (+/- 0.014) with a pseudo rate constant (k') of 6.46 (+/- 0.04) X 10(-4) (s-1). The order of reaction decreased with increasing temperature; n = 1.54 (+/- 0.003) at 45C, n = 0.8 (+/- 0.005) at 50 C or n = 0.64 (+/- 0.014) at 55C. At 45-55C the consecutive model also indicated 1st-order inactivation kinetics. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that with progressive heating the concentration of cod trypsin decreased and there was an appearance of lower molecular weight polypeptides. The results are consistent with a heat inactivation process involving trypsin autolysis. A mechanism for cod tysin heat inactivation is proposed which accounts for the observed 1st-order or 2nd-order reaction kinetics as limiting cases. 3aGadus morhua 3aautolysis 3acod (fish) 3aheat 3aheat inactivation 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apolypeptides 3areaction kinetics 3atemperature 3atrypsin1 aGalani, D.1 aOwusu-Apenten, R.K.0 tJournal of food biochemistry.g1997 Oct., v. 21, no. 4 p.273-288x0145-88847nnas  aDNAL  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle01918naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245002100131300001600152300002100168500001500189520108400204650001201288650001301300650002501313650002201338650002101360650002201381653001301403653001401416773008901430852000901519939003301528945000801561946001101569655001201580991588336320742620221119100856.0840917e19830924xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI840055702DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrisp, A.H.10aAnorexia nervosa  ap. 855-858.  ap. 855-858. ill.  a2019-12-05  aAn historical review of anorexia nervosa includes diagnosis, etiology, treatment and prognostic indicators. Little has been proved about the prevalence of the condition but from available information in Britain there are probably more than 10,000 severely affected patients with the fatality rate about 1 in 20. Anorexia nervosa appears to be the most common cause of longlasting emaciation in the young adult and diagnosis is difficult because of the anorectic's need for secrecy. Definitive diagnosis depends upon recognition of abnormal behaviors and the underlying terror of weight gain. Theories of etiology lean toward the psychogenic causes. Treatment involves both the physiological and psychological aspects (e.g., refeeding and counseling). Prognostic indicators are described. Although people of lower socioeconomic status are less prone to develop anorexia, when it occurs in this group, the outcome is poor. Family behavior appears to influence greatly the development of anorexia in those of higher socioeconomic status with outcome based on behavior changes.

Data on various aspects of the role of lectins in cancer is being accumulated at a rapid pace. The data on lectins available in the literature is so diverse, that it becomes difficult and time-consuming, if not impossible to comprehend the advances in various areas and obtain the maximum benefit. Not only do the lectins vary significantly in their individual functional roles, but they are also diverse in their sequences, structures, binding site architectures, quaternary structures, carbohydrate affinities and specificities as well as their potential applications. An organization of these seemingly independent data into a common framework is essential in order to achieve effective use of all the data towards understanding the roles of different lectins in different aspects of cancer and any resulting applications. An integrated knowledge base (CancerLectinDB) together with appropriate analytical tools has therefore been developed for lectins relevant for any aspect of cancer, by collating and integrating diverse data. This database is unique in terms of providing sequence, structural, and functional annotations for lectins from all known sources in cancer and is expected to be a useful addition to the number of glycan related resources now available to the community. The database has been implemented using MySQL on a Linux platform and web-enabled using Perl-CGI and Java tools. Data for individual lectins pertain to taxonomic, biochemical, domain architecture, molecular sequence and structural details as well as carbohydrate specificities. Extensive links have also been provided for relevant bioinformatics resources and analytical tools. Availability of diverse data integrated into a common framework is expected to be of high value for various studies on lectin cancer biology.

All computers have 4 basic parts: an input terminal, an output screen or printer, a processing unit, and ancillary storage units (discs or tapes). A microcomputer usually contains 1-2 microprocessors, and is designed for a single user. A minicomputer contains many computer chips and serves many users rapidly. A typical microcomputer contains up to 64 kilobytes of memory (usually having 8 memory bits to a byte) with another megabyte available on auxiliary storage device. Recent trends are to use microprocessors having 16 bits to a byte (rather than 8).

Genetic diversity of the pathogen based on sequencing of two plasmid-located genes, those for outer surface protein A (ospA) and outer surface protein C (ospC), has been examined in both tick and human specimens at local, regional, and worldwide population scales. Additionally, previous studies have only been conducted with tick or human specimens at the local population level in areas with high LD transmission rates. This study examined the genetic diversity of circulating borreliae in the reservoir population from a large region of the western coastal plains of southern Maryland, where moderate numbers of human LD cases are reported. Six ospA mobility classes, including two that were not previously described, and eight ospC groups were found among the P. leucopus samples. Twenty-five percent of all specimens were infected with more than one ospA or ospC variant. The frequency distribution of variants was homogeneous, both locally and spatially. The spirochete diversity found in Maryland was not as high as that observed among northern tick populations, yet similar genotypes were observed in both populations. These results also show that mice are important for maintaining Borrelia variants, even rare variants, and that reservoir populations should therefore be considered when assessing the diversity of B. burgdorferi.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBorrelia burgdorferi 3aIxodes scapularis 3aLyme disease 3aPeromyscus leucopus 3acase studies 3acoastal plains 3adisease reservoirs 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahumans 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3asurface proteins 3aticks 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialxgenetics 2aAntigens, Surfacexgenetics 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgenetics 2aBacterial Vaccines 2aBorrelia burgdorferixclassificationxgenetics. 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aEndemic Diseases 2aGenetic Variation 2aHumans 2aLipoproteinsxgenetics 2aLyme Diseasexepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aPeromyscusxmicrobiology 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational 3aMaryland 0aMaryland1 aNorris, Douglas E.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Aug., v. 72, no. 8 p.5331-5341dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.00014-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://aem.asm.org/contents-by-date.0.shtml 7aarticle01655naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005300132300001600185300002100201500001500222520067400237650001100911650002300922650002200945650002300967650002100990650002401011650001201035653003201047653001801079653002501097653001101122773008701133852000901220939003301229945000801262946001101270655001201281991588335650742620221119100910.0801217e19800209xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800032142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValman, H.B.14aThe first year of life: Growth and growth charts  ap. 381-384.  ap. 381-384. ill.  a2019-12-05  aGrowth charts have an important diagnostic function in distinguishing between disease and normal growth adjustments in the first year of life. Weight and head circumference are more accurate measurements of infant growth than length; plots of these measurements confirm normal development and nutrition, especially in short normal children whose parents often fear the child is not eating enough. Percentile lines of weight and head circumference are usually parallel. Growth charts provide early warnings of obesity, poor lactation, failure to thrive and hydrocephalus, and are also used to monitor the growth of infants of diabetic mothers or low birthweight infants. 3aweight 3ahead circumference 3afailure to thrive 3ainfant development 3alow birth weight 3areference standards 3ainfants 0aanthropometric measurements 0agrowth charts 0aphysical development 0agrowth0 tBritish medical journal.g1980 Feb. 9, v. 280, no. 6211 p.381-384x0007-14477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19801217c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle01448naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245011900133300001600252300003000268500001500298520045700313650001700770650001700787650001100804650002000815650001900835653001700854700001900871700001500890700001500905700001700920773008800937852000901025939003301034945000801067946001101075655001201086991588335370742620221119100607.0850711e19840818xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI850073292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErwteman, TM.10aBlockade, diuretics, and salt restriction for the management of mild hypertension: A randomised double blind trial  ap. 406-409.  ap. 406-409. ill., charts.  a2019-12-05  aA randomized placebo-controlled study of 94 mildly hypertensive patients assigned the patients to a moderately Na-restricted diet with/without beta-blocker drug treatment (chlorthalidone and/or metoprolol) or to a normal diet.

A control group of 106 healthy subjects, matched for age and sex with the CD patients, was included. Non-smokers in the control and UC groups were heavier than cigarette smokers and had more subcutaneous fat (determined by skinfold thickness). There was no difference between smokers and non-smokers in CD patients, but total skinfold thickness was greater in smokers. Non-smokers with CD had significantly lower values for all measurements than those in the control and UC groups. The results indicate that CD patients are undernourished when compared with a healthy population, while UC patients are well nourished. The results further emphasize the importance of considering smoking habits in any nutritional study.

B10) fruit at 5 °C maintained fruit firmness, inhibited the solubilization and depolymerization of chelator-soluble wall polyuronides and significantly reduced the increase in pectinesterase and β-galactosidase activities. At 10 °C, the fruit exhibited reduced rates of firmness loss, and associated polyuronide solubilization and depolymerization, as well as the increase in pectinesterase, β-galactosidase, polygalacturonase and β-(1,4)-glucanase activities being markedly retarded compared to fruit held at ambient temperature (28 °C). Storage at both 5 and 10 °C also retarded colour change and reduced water loss. However, chilling injury (CI), as characterised by skin browning, was induced at these temperatures. The CI symptoms were noticeable in fruit kept for 10 and 20 days at 5 and 10 °C, respectively. The physiological and biochemical responses of the stage 1 carambola fruit kept at 10 °C for 7, 14 or 21 days prior to ripening at ambient temperature showed that the incidence and severity of CI symptoms increased with time of exposure to low temperature (LT). CI symptoms other than skin browning that were manifested upon returning the cold-stored fruit to ambient temperature were enhanced rate of water loss and colour development, as well as accelerated texture loss, which corresponded with an accelerated increase in cell wall modifying enzyme activities. Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) in low density polyethylene film of carambolas held at 10 °C (LT) markedly retarded the decline in tissue firmness and the development of fruit colour, restricted water loss, and suppressed the incidence of CI. The retardation of fruit softening by MAP and/or LT, which correlates closely with delayed solubilization and depolymerization of the chelator-soluble polyuronides, may partly be attributed to suppression of the increase in activity of the major wall hydrolases. Suppression of the enzyme activities in fruit under MAP also appears to contribute to increased tolerance of the carambolas to CI incidence. 3aAverrhoa carambola 3aambient temperature 3abeta-galactosidase 3abeta-glucanase 3acell walls 3achilling injury 3acold storage 3acolor 3acontrolled atmosphere storage 3adepolymerization 3aenzyme activity 3afirmness 3afruits 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3apectinesterase 3aphysiological response 3apolyethylene film 3apolygalacturonase 3apolyuronides 3aripening 3asolubilization 3astorage temperature 3atexture 3awater1 aChin, L.H.1 aMārimuttu, Em.1 aLazan, H.0 tPostharvest biology and technology.g2004 Aug., v. 33, no. 2 p.181-192dElsevierx0925-52147nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01162naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245004200123300001600165500001500181520019100196650001000387650001100397650002200408650003600430650002700466650001200493653002300505653002300528700001500551700002500566700001700591700001300608700001600621773007300637852000900710930003300719945001300752946001100765655001200776IND2043605020221119100832.0941208e199409  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204360502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKato, M.12aA betaine lipid from Pavolova lutheri  ap. 279-280.  a2019-12-05  aA new betaine lipid, named DGCC, was isolated from Pavloua lutheri and its structure determined to be 1,2-diacylglyceryl-3-O-carboxyhydroxymethylcholine on the basis of NMR spectroscopy. 3aalgae 3alipids 3aspectral analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3amolecular conformation 3abetaine 0aalgae and seaweeds 0achemical structure1 aAdachi, K.1 aHajiro-Nakanishi, K.1 aIshigaki, E.1 aSano, H.1 aMiyachi, S.0 tPhytochemistry.g1994 Sept., v. 37, no. 1 p.279-280x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19950110b19950113c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02742naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024004000110040001800150100001400168245007900182300001600261500001500277520124900292650001401541650000801555650002201563650002501585650002101610650000801631650001501639650002101654650001801675650001901693650001601712650002801728650003001756650004001786653003101826653001301857653004001870653002701910700001601937773010201953852000902055856009002064930003302154945001302187946001302200990002302213655001202236IND2040418520221119100814.0940621e199402  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204041852DNAL7 a82042132pmid7 a10.1080/07391102.1994.105080312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, R.10aZ curves, an intutive tool for visualizing and analyzing the DNA sequences  ap. 767-782.  a2019-12-04  aA novel method mapping the DNA or RNA sequence into a folding curve in three dimensional space, the Z curve, has been proposed based on the symmetry of the regular tetrahedrons. There exists a unique Z curve for a given DNA sequence, on the contrary, the DNA sequence can be uniquely determined by the given Z curve. The properties of the Z curves have been studied in great details. The symmetry, the periodicity, the local motif, and the global feather of the distribution of bases of the DNA sequences are reflected by the rich folding structures of the Z curves. The Z curves may be smoothed by the B-spline functions of different orders. Therefore, the Z curves may have any resolution by choosing the suitable spline functions. The higher the order of the B-spline function chosen, the lower the resolution of the Z curve. So, the Z curves are suitable for visualizing and analyzing the DNA sequences with any length. The study of the Z curves develops further a new area to visualizing and analyzing the DNA sequences by a geometrical approach. The method of the Z curves may be strengthened by using the ripe mathematical tools of geometry on the one hand; and by using the powerful technique of the computer graphics on the other hand. 3aequations 3aDNA 3acomputer graphics 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA conformation 3aRNA 2aAlgorithms 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aDNAxchemistry 2aMathematics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 0amathematics and statistics 0ageometry 0a3 dimensional vector representation 0amolecular conformation1 aZhang, C.T.0 tJournal of biomolecular structure & dynamics.g1994 Feb., v. 11, no. 4 p.767-782x0739-11027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07391102.1994.105080313Available from publisher's Web site  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02487naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008900163300001800252500002400270520115400294650001401448650001601462650001601478650002201494650002001516650002001536650001001556650001101566650001701577650001301594650001901607650001701626650001001643651001001653653001901663653001301682653002101695653002701716653002401743700001801767700002201785700001701807700001401824773009801838852000901936856004801945655001201993IND4394877220221119100301.0070909e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439487722DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-007-0173-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, S.

It is known that unregulated pumping will lead to upconing of saline water and therefore it is necessary to determine optimal rates and associated well locations (from an existing group of candidate wells that supply drinking water to the city of Delhi) that will minimize the total salinity. The nonlinear, non-convex problem is solved by embedding the calibrated groundwater model within a simulation-optimisation (S/O) framework. Optimisation is accomplished by using simulated annealing (SA), a search algorithm. The computational burden is primarily managed by replacing the numerical model with a surrogate simulator-artificial neural network (ANN). The model is applied to the real system to determine the optimal pumping schedule. The results of the operational model suggest that the skimming wells must be operated from optimal locations such that they are staggered in space and time to obtain the least saline water. 3aannealing 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3ahydrologic models 3aneural networks 3aproblem solving 3apumps 3arivers 3asaline water 3asalinity 3aspace and time 3awater supply 3awells 3aIndia 0aSkimming wells 0aUpconing 0aConceptual model 0aGroundwater management 0aSimulated annealing1 aKumar, Sudhir1 aShekhar, Shashank1 aSinha, S.

In this paper we examine this organism's database for overlapping N-tuples of high frequency and find A and T tracts possess among the highest frequencies in flanking sequences but not in coding sequences. We examined both overlapping and non-overlapping frequencies of the A, T, G and C homopolymer tracts of 2 < N < 6. Overlapping (dG).(dC) and (dA).(dT) tracts occur at greater frequencies than expected, based on random occurrence. Long (dA).(dT) tracts of N > 10 occur at well above expected frequencies in flanking and intron regions, while (dG).(dC) tracts above N = 5 are rarely found. Some of the implications of these findings for tract origins in slip-strand replication and for chromatin structure are discussed. 3aoligonucleotides 3aadenine 3athymine 3astructural genes 3aDNA 3aDictyostelium discoideum 3afrequency 3aintrons 2aAnimals 2aBase Composition 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistry 2aDictyosteliumxchemistryxgenetics. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aIntrons 2aOligodeoxyribonucleotidesxanalysis 2aPoly dA-dTxanalysis 0aflanking sequences 0athymine tracts 0aadenine tracts 0anucleotide sequences 0aDictyostelium 0aflanking regions1 aHess, S.T.1 aBlake, R.D.0 tJournal of biomolecular structure & dynamics.g1993 Aug., v. 11, no. 1 p.57-66x0739-11027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07391102.1993.105087093Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03296naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245007300171300001600244520158900260650001901849650002501868650002001893650001101913650002501924650002001949650000701969650002201976650001901998650002202017650002102039650001202060650001602072650006402088650001202152650003302164650004102197650002402238650004302262650003002305650002902335650001902364650002302383650003202406650002602438653001702464773010402481852000902585856007702594930003302671945001302704946001302717655001202730IND2327795020221119100504.0020630e200104  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232779502DNAL7 a113047502pmid7 a10.1002/arch.10262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFunk, C.J.10aAlkaline phosphatase activity in whitefly salivary glands and saliva  ap. 165-174.  aAlkaline phosphatase activity was histochemically localized in adult whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci B biotype, syn. B. argentifolii) with a chromogenic substrate(5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate) and a fluorogenic substrate (ELF-97). The greatest amount of staining was in the basal regions of adult salivary glands with additional activity traced into the connecting salivary ducts. Other tissues that had alkaline phosphatase activity were the accessory salivary glands, the midgut, the portion of the ovariole surrounding the terminal oocyte, and the colleterial gland. Whitefly nymphs had activity in salivary ducts, whereas activity was not detected in two aphid species (Rhodobium porosum and Aphis gossypii). Whitefly diet (15% sucrose) was collected from whitefly feeding chambers and found to have alkaline phosphatase activity, indicating the enzyme was secreted in saliva. Further studies with salivary alkaline phosphatase collected from diet indicated that the enzyme had a pH optimum of 10.4 and was inhibited by 1 mM cysteine and to a lesser extent 1 mM histidine. Dithiothreitol, inorganic phosphate, and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) also inhibited activity, whereas levamisole only partially inhibited salivary alkaline phosphatase. The enzyme was heat tolerant and retained approximately 50% activity after a 1-h treatment at 65 degrees C. The amount of alkaline phosphatase activity secreted by whiteflies increased under conditions that stimulate increased feeding. These observations indicate alkaline phosphatase may play a role during whitefly feeding. 3aBemisia tabaci 3aBemisia argentifolii 3asalivary glands 3asaliva 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aenzyme activity 3apH 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aheat stability 3aprotein secretion 3afeeding behavior 3asucrose 3apilocarpine 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aFluorescent Dyesxmetabolism 2aHemipteraxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aOrganophosphorus Compoundsxmetabolism 2aPilocarpinexpharmacology 2aQuinazolinesxmetabolism 2aQuinazolinones 2aSalivaxenzymology 2aSalivary Glandsxenzymology 2aSucrosexpharmacology 0alocalization0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Apr., v. 46, no. 4 p.165-174x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.10263Available from publisher's Web site  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03018naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245019100126300001400317520181900331650001202150650001702162650002102179650002102200650001102221650002402232650001302256650002202269650001202291650001402303650001102317650002502328653001202353653001502365653001502380653001602395700001502411700001902426773007302445852000902518930003302527945001302560946001102573655001202584IND2201371320221119100430.0991029e19990430ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220137132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTouraki, M.10aBioaccumulation of trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole and N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole in Artemia nauplii and residual kinetics in seabass larvae after repeated oral dosing of medicated nauplii  ap. 15-30.  aThe pharmacokinetics of trimethoprim (TMP), sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and its metabolite N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole (N-acetyl-SMX), were studied in Artemia nauplii as a function of the duration and temperature of their storage, following their enrichment with the therapeutics using the bioencapsulation technique. A marked decrease in the therapeutic content of the nauplii was observed upon storage at 18 degrees C and 25 degrees C and it was concluded that medicated nauplii should either be administered fresh to fish larvae or after storage for 8 h at 5 degrees C, at the most. Under the latter conditions, satisfactory levels of TMP and SMX were achieved, high survival rates and dry weight contents of the nauplii were preserved and minimal leakage of the therapeutics to the environment was secured. Treatment of seabass larvae with one, three, six or ten doses of medicated Artemia nauplii, showed that maximum levels of the therapeutics are achieved in fish larvae when 10 doses are used. Following the treatment scheme of oral administration of 10 doses of medicated Artemia nauplii to fish larvae, the residual kinetics of TMP, SMX and N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole were studied in seabass larvae. TMP and SMX showed different kinetic characteristics. A steady state of SMX concentration is considered to be achieved in fish body tissue during the 5-day medication period. TMP, SMX as well as the metabolite N-acetyl-sulfamethoxazole, were detectable in small amounts in fish body tissue even 100 h-post treatment. These data suggest that oral medication of fish larvae through the use of Artemia nauplii as a carrier of therapeutics, appears to be a quite promising approach to be used as an alternative method of treatment, which could minimize some of the problems arising from the methods currently in use. 3aArtemia 3atrimethoprim 3asulfamethoxazole 3apharmacokinetics 3alarvae 3aoral administration 3aduration 3awater temperature 3astorage 3amortality 3adosage 3aDicentrarchus labrax 0aleakage 0adry matter 0aenrichment 0aderivatives1 aNiopas, I.1 aKastritsis, C.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 30, v. 175, no. 1/2 p.15-30x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02067naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010700128300001600235520105100251650001201302650002001314650001401334650001601348650001901364650002001383650001301403650002101416650002501437653001101462700001501473700001601488700001801504700001801522773007501540852000901615930003301624945001301657946001101670655001201681IND2201289320221119100334.0991025e19990420ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220128932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThetmeyer, H.10aGrowth of European sea bass (Dicentrarachus labrax L.) under hypoxic and oscillating oxygen conditions  ap. 355-367.  aEffects of moderate hypoxia and oscillating oxygen conditions on growth of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.) were investigated. Groups of four to six sea bass (initial weights 40-90 g) were exposed to one of three oxygen regimes (40% air saturation; oscillations between 40-86% with a period of 770 min; 86% as a control) at 22 degrees C and a salinity of 37 for 1 month. All fish survived and gained weight, but relative to the controls, the sea bass exposed to hypoxic conditions consumed significantly less food, exhibited a reduced growth, and had a lower condition factor. Oscillating groups were intermediate, and not statistically distinguishable from either normoxic or hypoxic treatments. Feed conversion efficiency and variation in body size were not significantly affected by oxygen conditions. Growth was correlated with feed intake, suggesting that reduced growth under moderate hypoxic or oscillating oxygen conditions is primarily due to reduced appetite and not a consequence of a decrease in feed conversion efficiency. 3ahypoxia 3aliveweight gain 3amortality 3afeed intake 3abody condition 3afeed conversion 3aappetite 3adissolved oxygen 3aDicentrarchus labrax 0agrowth1 aWaller, U.1 aBlack, K.D.1 aInselmann, S.1 aRosenthal, H.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 20, v. 174, no. 3/4 p.355-367x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03672naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100001400176245011700190300001600307500002400323500001500347520147200362650001001834650001501844650001701859650001901876650001701895650002501912650000901937650001601946650001601962650001801978650002701996650001602023650001202039650002302051650006702074650000902141650001102150650003702161650002702198650008002225650004902305650005502354650004102409650000902450650006102459650004802520650003002568653000902598700001602607700002402623700001802647700002502665700001502690773011502705852000902820856008802829930003302917945002502950946001102975655001202986IND4405865020221119100543.0080520e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440586502DNAL7 a184064702pmid7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.02.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8231 aZafra, R.10aHigh iNOS expression in macrophages in canine leishmaniasis is associated with low intracellular parasite burden  ap. 353-359.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe expression of iNOS by macrophages in 33 dogs suffering from spontaneous leishmaniasis was analysed by immunohistochemistry in skin, liver and lymph nodes. A correlation study between the number of macrophages expressing iNOS and the number of macrophages containing leishmania amastigotes was carried out. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from the skin (28 cases), popliteal lymph nodes (8 cases) and liver (3 cases) of dogs of different age, sex and breed suffering from leishmaniasis were included in the study. Dogs were referred as positive for Leishmania spp by serology and the diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of leishmania amastigotes within macrophages by histopathology. Tissue samples of skin (3 cases), popliteal lymph nodes (5 cases) and liver (3 cases) from dogs seronegative for leishmaniasis with no histopathological changes were included in the study as controls. The immunohistochemical study revealed that macrophages containing a high number of leishmania did not express iNOS. Correlation between the number of macrophages expressing iNOS and the number of macrophages containing leishmania amastigotes was assessed using the Spearman test. High expression of iNOS in macrophages was related with low number of leishmania amastigotes in macrophages in all cases (r =-0.47, p =0.002). These results suggest that iNOS expression by macrophages plays an important role during the control of Leishmania infection in dogs. 3aliver 3aLeishmania 3anitric oxide 3aseroprevalence 3adog diseases 3aimmunohistochemistry 3adogs 3amacrophages 3aamastigotes 3aleishmaniasis 3aimmunologic techniques 3alymph nodes 2aAnimals 2aBiopsyxveterinary 2aDog Diseasesxenzymologyximmunologyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aDogs 2aFemale 2aImmunohistochemistryxveterinary 2aLeishmaniaximmunology 2aLeishmaniasisxenzymologyximmunologyxparasitologyxpathologyxveterinary. 2aLiverxenzymologyximmunologyxparasitology. 2aLymph Nodesxenzymologyximmunologyxparasitology. 2aMacrophagesxenzymologyximmunology. 2aMale 2aNitric Oxide Synthase Type IIxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aSkinxenzymologyximmunologyxparasitology. 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 0askin1 aJaber, J.R.1 aPérez-Écija, R.A.1 aBarragán, A.1 aMartínez-Moreno, A.1 aPérez, J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 June 15, v. 123, no. 3-4 p.353-359dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.02.0223Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03124naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001500156245013100171300001400302520118700316650002601503650002101529650002201550650002501572650002501597650002201622650001201644650001401656650002201670650002401692650001201716650001801728650002301746650003301769650001101802650001801813650005401831650002801885650003901913650004301952650002401995650005202019653001502071653001402086653001202100653001802112653002802130653003602158653002302194700001902217700001502236773010202251852000902353856007702362930003302439945001302472946001302485655001202498IND2325580620221119100830.0020223e200110  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232558062DNAL7 a115689662pmid7 a10.1002/arch.10592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTufail, M.10aMolecular evidence for two vitellogenin genes and processing of vitellogenins in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana  ap. 72-80.  aThe American cockroach, Periplaneta americana has two vitellins (Vn1 and Vn2) and corresponding vitellogenins (Vg1 and Vg2). Vns/Vgs were separated on the SDS-PAGE as three major polypeptide bands [170, 100 (multisubunits), and 50 kD] and a minor polypeptide band (150 kD) both in the egg (mature terminal oocyte) extract and in the female hemolymph. We previously cloned one Vg (Vg1) cDNA and showed that the 170-kD polypeptide originated from the C-terminus of the Vg1. In the present study, we cloned the other Vg (Vg2) cDNA. It is 5,826 bp long encoding 1,876 amino acid residues (including 16 residues for putative signal peptide) in a single ORF. The deduced amino acid sequences of both Vgs (Vg1 and Vg2) of P. americana showed 30% identity. The GL/ICG motif is followed by eight cysteine residues at conserved locations near the C-terminal and the DGXR motif starts 18 residues upstream of the GL/ICG motif. The chemically determined N-terminal amino acid sequences of the 150-kD and of the 50-kD polypeptides matched exactly with each other and with the deduced N-terminal amino acid sequence of the Vg2 cDNA. The pattern of processing in P. americana Vns/Vgs is discussed. 3aPeriplaneta americana 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein synthesis 3aoocytes 3ahemolymph 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxgenetics 2aFemale 2aGenes, Insect 2aInsect Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeriplanetaxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Processing, Post-Translational 2aSpecies Specificity 2aVitellogeninsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aprecursors 0avitellins 0acloning 0avitellogenins 0amolecular sequence data 0an terminal amino acid sequences 0aprotein processing1 aHatakeyama, M.1 aTakeda, M.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 48, no. 2 p.72-80x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.10593Available from publisher's Web site  a20020401b20020405c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02613naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245018000125300001800305500001500323520144800338650001401786650003601800650002501836650002201861650001601883650001201899650002301911650001901934650002001953650001601973650001101989653001502000700001702015700001602032700001502048773007402063852000902137930003302146945001302179946001102192655001202203IND2044562320221119100832.0950213e199411  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204456232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBiswal, B.10aCarotenoid composition and its relationship to chlorophyll and D1 protein during leaf development in a normally senescing cultivar and a stay-green mutant of Festuca pratensis  ap. 1257-1262.  a2019-12-05  aChlorophyll and carotenoid were measured with reference to the developmental gradient along the expanding fourth leaf of Rossa, a normally yellowing cultivar of Festuca pratensis, and of a mutant genotype Bf993 which is unable to degrade pigments and associated thylakoid proteins during foliar senescence. Although pigment levels were highest in the central, mature portion of the leaf, there were nevertheless readily detectable amounts of chlorophyll and carotenoid even in basal tissues enclosed in the sheaths of older leaves. Carotenoid compositions were the same in all the tissues except the senescent tissue at the leaf tip. Here chlorophyll to carotenoid ratio decreased in Rossa but along the young leaf tissue of this genotype and throughout the leaf of Bf993 this ratio was constant. Amounts of D1 protein, associated with the Photosystem II reaction centre, were correspondingly retained to a somewhat greater extent in senescing tissue of Bf993 but surprisingly, given the expression of the genetic lesion in a delayed senescence, amounts of the protein were lower in young tissue from the stay-green mutant than in the normal genotype. When the leaf of Rossa was allowed to senesce until the entire blade was yellow there were marked changes in carotenoid composition, and chlorophyll degradation products accumulated. Any increase in zeaxanthin was slight and there was no evidence to suggest operation of a xanthophyll cycle. 3acultivars 3achemical constituents of plants 3adevelopmental stages 3aFestuca pratensis 3acarotenoids 3amutants 3aprotein metabolism 3aphotosynthesis 3aprotein content 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 0asenescence1 aRogers, L.J.1 aSmith, A.J.1 aThomas, H.0 tPhytochemistry.g1994 Nov., v. 37, no. 5 p.1257-1262x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a19950303b19950309c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03802naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169100002000178245010000198300001600298500011200314500002400426520200700450650002102457650002302478650001902501650002302520650001602543650001702559650001602576650002002592650001502612650002502627650001202652650001502664650001402679651001302693653002302706653001802729700001902747700002302766700002202789700002102811700002402832700002502856700002002881700002102901773011902922852000903041856009103050930003303141945002503174946001303199655001203212IND4405866320221119100436.0080520e20080515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440586632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.01.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aB2001 aTanaka, Nobuaki12aA review of evapotranspiration estimates from tropical forests in Thailand and adjacent regions  ap. 807-819.  aIn the special issue: AsiaFlux special issue/ edited by M. Tani, S. Yamamoto, R. Leuning, and M.Y. Leclerc.  aIncludes references  aTo understand the potential roles of seasonally dry tropical forests (tropical monsoon forests) of mainland Southeast Asia in the regional climate system, we briefly describe the complex forest types in this region and review published studies which reported water vapour exchange between tropical monsoon forests and the atmosphere. In addition, we propose future research needs to address deficiencies in our current knowledge base. Seasonal variation in atmospheric evaporative demand, which generally increases with atmospheric water vapour deficit and incoming solar radiation, is conspicuous in this monsoon region, reaching maxima in the late dry season and relatively low values in the wet season. Though the number of reviewed studies is limited, a comparison of seasonal patterns of evapotranspiration (ET) between forest types shows increased ET corresponding with the atmospheric evaporative demand in two evergreen forest ecosystems, but not in both an evergreen and two deciduous forest ecosystems. This contrasting ET seasonality results in considerable differences in dry season ET among forest types, ranging from a low of 0.6mmd⁻¹ at one evergreen forest type, to 5.9mmd⁻¹ at another evergreen forest type. Further investigations of both rooting-depths and responses of stomatal conductance of individual trees to dry conditions are suggested to be necessary to draw a more general conclusion regarding dry season ET difference between forest types. Besides the seasonal changes in evaporative demand, inter-annual fluctuations of rainfall and its seasonal distribution are also significant in this region. Recent phenological and physiological studies suggest that these inter-annual variations in rainfall can have significant impacts on water and energy exchanges above the tropical monsoon forests. Thus, we stress the need for further examination of the effects of rainfall-regime anomalies on water and energy exchanges between tropical monsoon forests and the atmosphere. 3atropical forests 3aevapotranspiration 3amonsoon season 3aseasonal variation 3awater vapor 3agas exchange 3aevaporation 3asolar radiation 3adry season 3astomatal conductance 3arooting 3asoil depth 3aphenology 3aThailand 0aliterature reviews 0arooting depth1 aKume, Tomonori1 aYoshifuji, Natsuko1 aTanaka, Katsunori1 aTakizawa, Hideki1 aShiraki, Katsushige1 aTantasirin, Chatchai1 aTangtham, Nipon1 aSuzuki, Masakazu0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2008 May 15, v. 148, no. 5 p.807-819dElsevier Science Ltd.x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.01.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20080716b20080801c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/07/09  aOther US 7aarticle01226naa a2200385 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097024002200115040001800137100002100155245006200176300001200238520015300250650002600403650001200429650001000441650001100451650002700462650002600489650000900515650002600524650003200550650003200582651001200614651001700626653003700643773008700680852000900767939003300776945000800809946001100817655001200828991588327280742620221119100427.0830331e19810307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830032092DNAL7 a67831702pmid7 aPMC15045802pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnston, I.D.A.10aPossible transmission of malaria by renal transplantation  ap. 780.  aPlasmodium falciparum, man who had undergone renal transplant, infection possibly acquired from donor kidney, case report: London, from Saudi Arabia 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3asurgery 2aAdult 2aHumans 2aKidney Transplantation 2aMalariaxtransmission 2aMale 2aPlasmodium falciparum 2aPostoperative Complications 2aTransplantation, Homologous 3aEngland 3aSaudi Arabia 0aDisease transmission, Man to man0 tBritish medical journal.g1981 Mar. 7, v. 282, no. 6266 p.780-780x0007-14477nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19830331c00000000  aPAR  aNon-US 7aarticle02775naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001700154245011500171300001600286500018600302520144500488650001901933650001401952650002201966650001101988650002201999650001002021650001802031650001202049650001502061650001402076650001002090700001802100700001502118700001802133700001802151773014402169856005502313852000902368655001202377IND60637298520221119100427.0190417e20181205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063729852DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1228.372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiack, R.

In general, European pears are considered a difficult-to-root species, and this trait is one of the obstacles to developing successful clonal rootstocks for pear fruit production. Identifying a parent which is easy to propagate would be of benefit in a rootstock development programme. Using dormant hardwood cuttings, we compared the propagation success rates of 81 different European pear cultivars, with that of a 303 seedling population from a Pyrus communis ‘Old Home’ × ‘Louise Bonne de Jersey’ cross. There was a little root development among the pear cultivars; 73% of them showed no root development. Rooting success among the remaining 22 cultivars ranged from 6 to 33%. ‘Worden Seckel’ was the cultivar with the highest proportion of rooted cuttings amongst those assessed, while only 10% of the ‘Old Home’ and ‘Louise Bonne de Jersey’ cuttings produced roots. In the mapping population successful root development occurred in 75% of the seedlings; 48 seedlings had a rooting success between 50 and 100%. Despite the difficulty of propagation amongst the majority of pear cultivars evaluated, the higher rates of rooting in the seedling population indicate potential to identify plant material that could be used to incorporate ease of propagation into a rootstock development programme. 3aPyrus communis 3acultivars 3aearly development 3afruits 3ahardwood cuttings 3apears 3aroot cuttings 3arooting 3arootstocks 3aseedlings 3atrees1 aFriend, A.

In New Caledonia, where different Vibriosis affect shrimp production and antibiotic use is banned in growing ponds, the Hawaiian population was introduced to increase the allelic variability available for local shrimp farmers and start a genetic improvement program. Growth and survival rates of the two pure populations and the two-way F₁-hybrids obtained by breeding Hawaiian animals with New Caledonian animals were assessed in several simple experiments (earthen ponds, floating cages and experimental infection challenges) during two years on two successive generations. Results were very consistent: F₁-hybrids growth rates in earthen ponds were 37% (±7% SD) higher than for pure populations. Cage experiments demonstrated no competition between the different populations when reared together or separately in a common environment. The F₁-hybrids also showed better survival rates in all experiments. Combining the results on growth and survival rates leads to the conclusion that biomass production is much higher with F₁-hybrid populations than with pure populations using the same quantity of juveniles stocked: biomass production in ponds was increased 1.4 and 2.3 times on year 1 and year 2 respectively, and 1.9 times in floating cages. The advantage of growing F₁-hybrids appeared proportionally higher when environmental and sanitary conditions led to poorer survival (34% in year 2 vs. 56% in year 1). These results are a good example of performance improvement by heterosis effect and/or of performance loss due to inbreeding in the pure populations. This study demonstrates that aquaculture industries which cannot afford large selection programs may benefit from using two different inbred parental stocks to produce F₁-hybrids for each commercial growout. This is notably true when only inbred populations are available, or when introduction of genetic variability from the wild or from other genetic resources represents a zoo-sanitary risk. In our case, the expected increase in L. stylirostris production could be around 85% (according to our average results) if producers keep stocking their ponds at their current densities using F₁-hybrids. However, for sustainability reasons, it is advisable to stock F₁-hybrid animals at lower densities, the gain in performance allowing producing the same amount of biomass with less input. 3aheterosis 3aanimal growth 3adisease prevalence 3agenetic improvement 3aanimal pathogenic bacteria 3aLitopenaeus stylirostris 3ainbreeding 3amortality 3aVibrio nigripulchritudo 3ashrimp 3aanimal breeding 3ashrimp culture 3aHawaii 3aNew Caledonia 0acrossing1 aGoarant, Cyrille1 aAnsquer, Dominique1 aBrun, Pierre1 ade Decker, Sophie1 aDufour, Robert1 aGalinié, Christian1 aPeignon, Jean-Marie1 aPham, Dominique1 aVourey, Elodie1 aHarache, Yves1 aPatrois, Jacques0 tAquaculture.g2008 June 10, v. 278, no. 1-4 p.43-50dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.03.0183Available from publisher's Web site  a20080805b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02353naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002300180245009900203300001400302500002400316520093100340650001701271650001001288650001601298650001101314650001601325650001701341650003201358650001801390650002201408650001801430650001701448700002301465700001801488700002401506700002201530700001801552700002701570773009101597852000901688856009301697930003301790945002501823946001101848655001201859IND4405862020221119100551.0080520e20080610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440586202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aM001 0aM1201 aCastillo, Ana G.F.10aInterspecific hybridization and introgression are associated with stock transfers in salmonids  ap. 31-36.  aIncludes references  aDomestic stocks may endanger wild populations by escapes or deliberate releases, not only through competition for resources but also through gene pool contamination if they reproduce in the wild. One of the risks is increased interspecific hybridization by interspecific matings. Stocking of domesticated genomes into wild ecosystems leads to a heightened frequency of interspecific hybridization in sympatric south European Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta. Introgressive hybridization involving brown trout males of domestic origin was demonstrated. Following cessation of domestic stock releases in eight south European rivers, hybridization decreased significantly. These results emphasize the risks associated with stock transfers and escapes of domestic individuals in wild ecosystems and illustrate the potential role of domestic stocks when they contribute to secondary contact between species. 3aSalmo trutta 3atrout 3aSalmo salar 3asalmon 3afarmed fish 3awild animals 3ainterspecific hybridization 3aintrogression 3amitochondrial DNA 3aribosomal DNA 3afish culture1 aAyllón, Fernando.1 aMoran, Paloma1 aIzquierdo, Jorge I.1 aMartinez, Jose L.1 aBeall, Edward1 aGarcía Vázquez, Eva.0 tAquaculture.g2008 June 10, v. 278, no. 1-4 p.31-36dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.03.0293Available from publisher's Web site  a20080805b20080905c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/08/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03507naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007700127300001600204520209300220650001902313650001002332650001302342650002402355650001802379650001102397650001702408650001102425650001102436650000702447650001302454650002202467650002602489650002202515650001402537650001302551650001302564650001902577650001502596650002302611650002102634650002302655651001202678653001602690653001602706700001402722700001902736700001902755700002602774773007502800852000902875930003302884945001302917946001102930655001202941IND2201372120221119095123.0991029e19990430ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220137212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlongi, D.M.10aPelagic processes in extensive shrimp ponds of the Mekong delta, Vietnam  ap. 121-141.  aRates of pelagic primary production, respiration, and bacterioplankton dynamics were measured in relation to water quality parameters in three extensive shrimp ponds in the Mekong delta, Vietnam. There were few consistent differences in pelagic characteristics among different locations within these ponds, among the three ponds, or between the ponds and adjacent river water. Rates of primary production ((14)C uptake) ranged from < 1 to 94 mg C m(-3) d(-1). Rates of gross primary production (light-dark bottle technique) ranged from -184 to 2697 mg C m(-3) d(-1). Rates of pelagic respiration ranged from 60 to 3783 mg C m(-3) d(-1). Primary production rates measured by oxygen flux were greater than those measured via (14)C uptake, with P/R ratios varying widely (-0.45 to 3.4), but the mean P/R at each site was < 1 with a grand mean among ponds of 0.7. Bacterioplankton numbers (mean range: 0.2 to 27.2 x 10(8) cells ml(-1)) and productivity (range: 2.5 to 297.3 mg C m(-3) d(-1)) did not vary consistently among ponds with season. Mean bacterioplankton growth rates were fastest (micro = 0.29 d(-1)) in the pond with highest shrimp production and slowest in the poorest yielding pond (micro = 0.08 d(-1)). The primary production and respiration rates, and bacterioplankton dynamics, indicate that these pond waters are net heterotrophic. Plankton measurements rarely correlated with changes in physicochemistry (pH, dissolved O(2), salinity, temperature) or nutrient concentrations as within-site and temporal variability were large for most parameters. The diurnal cycles of physicochemical characteristics were similar to those measured in other unfertilized, low-alkalinity ponds, but these cycles were dampened by intense rainfall. Our data indicate that low net primary production, high rates of respiration, moderate rates of bacterioplankton production, high suspended solid and nutrient concentrations, low and very variable pH and dissolved O(2) concentrations, and variations in salinity due to intense rainfall episodes limit shrimp production in these extensive ponds. 3ashrimp culture 3aponds 3aplankton 3apopulation dynamics 3awater quality 3aoxygen 3agas exchange 3acarbon 3ayields 3apH 3asalinity 3awater temperature 3anutrient availability 3adiurnal variation 3aturbidity 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aorganic matter 3aphosphates 3aammonium compounds 3adissolved oxygen 3abiomass production 3aVietnam 0agrowth rate 0arespiration1 aDixon, P.1 aJohnston, D.J.1 aDoan Van Tien.1 aTrà̂n, Thanh Xuân.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 30, v. 175, no. 1/2 p.121-141x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009500130300001500225500001500240520119000255650001601445650001401461650002301475650001201498650001301510650001801523650001301541650001601554653002001570653001101590653001301601700001701614700001601631773007401647852000901721930003301730945001301763946001101776655001201787IND2201371820221119095115.0991029e19990430ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220137182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkjervold, P.O.10aRigor in Atlantic salmon as affected by crowding stress prior to chilling before slaughter  ap. 93-101.  a2019-12-05  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on salmon meat quality of pre-slaughter crowding stress, prior to live-chilling. Atlantic salmon (3-6 kg) were exposed to two levels of crowding (< 50 vs. > 300 kg/m(3)) followed by 45 min live chilling (1 degree C), prior to anaesthetisation and slaughter. Blood samples were taken from both groups (high density and low density) before and after chilling, and analysed for cortisol, glucose, lactate and osmolality. Corresponding muscle samples were analysed for glycogen. Rigor mortis development (0-120 h) was evaluated visually and manually. Both before and after live-chilling, there were significant differences between the low density and high density groups in the four blood parameters. Values for cortisol, lactate and osmolality were significantly higher in the high density group of fish. Glycogen levels in the muscle tissue were very low in both groups of fish before and after live-chilling. There were differences between the two groups in development of rigor strength as a consequence of different stress level before live-chilling. The onset and resolution of rigor was brought forward by the high density treatment. 3aSalmo salar 3aslaughter 3apostmortem changes 3acooling 3aglycogen 3ablood glucose 3acortisol 3alactic acid 0ablood chemistry 0astress 0acrowding1 aFjaera, S.O.1 aOstby, P.B.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 30, v. 175, no. 1/2 p.93-101x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03250naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001500157245013400172300001400306500001500320520122500335650002501560650001001585650002101595650002301616650001801639650001701657650001101674650002501685650001001710650001401720650002401734650001901758650002501777650002401802650001201826650001801838650002401856650004101880650004101921650005501962650001502017650002502032650008502057650003202142650003102174650003802205653001702243653001602260653001302276653001402289653003502303700001402338773010202352852000902454856007802463930003302541945001302574946001302587655001202600IND2330168720221119095205.0021220e200206  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233016872DNAL7 a121732932pmid7 a10.1002/arch.100332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoeb, M.J.10aPeptides that elicit midgut stem cell differentiation isolated from chymotryptic digests of hemolymph from Lymantria dispar pupae  ap. 85-96.  a2019-12-04  aIsolated stem cells of Heliothis virescens, cultured in vitro, were induced to differentiate by Midgut Differentiation Factors 3 and 4. These were peptides identified from a chymotrypsin digest of hemolymph taken from newly pupated Lymantria dispar. Partial purification was obtained by filtration through size exclusion filters. The most active preparation was subsequently subjected to a series of 3 Reverse Phase-HPLC procedures. Partial sequences of the peptides were identified via automated Edman degradation as the nanomers EEVVKNAIA-OH (MDF 3) and ITPTSSLAT-OH (MDF 4). These sequences were commercially synthesized. The synthetic compounds proved active in a dose-dependent manner. Stem cells responded to synthetic MDF 3 and MDF 4 as they did to previously identified peptides MDF 1 and 2, which have quite different amino acid sequences. All of the 4 MDFs administered singly induced statistically similar differentiation responses at 2 x 10(-8), 2 x 10(-9), and 2 x 10(-10) M. However, pairs of the 4 MDFs produced even more differentiation, the same response as one alone, no response, or were inhibitory, dependent on the MDF pair and its concentration. The data suggests complicated receptor interactions. 3acell differentiation 3apupae 3aLymantria dispar 3asynthetic peptides 3adose response 3achymotrypsin 3amidgut 3aamino acid sequences 3acells 3ahemolymph 3aHeliothis virescens 3agrowth factors 3achemical degradation 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aCell Division 2aChromatography, Gel 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aChymotrypsinxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDigestive Systemxchemistryxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aHelianthus 2aHemolymphxchemistry 2aInsect Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolismxpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aMothsxgrowth & development 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aStem Cellsxcytologyxmetabolism. 0apurification 0acombination 0apeptides 0ainduction 0amidgut differentiation factors1 aJaffe, H.0 tArchives of insect biochemistry and physiology.g2002 June, v. 50, no. 2 p.85-96x0739-44627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/arch.100333Available from publisher's Web site  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle03253naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009700130300001400227500001500241520218700256650001002443650001202453650001902465650001102484650001302495650001102508650001102519650001502530650001302545650001702558650001402575653001602589653000902605653002102614653001802635653001102653700001602664773007302680852000902753930003302762945001302795946001102808655001202819IND2201371720221119095131.0991029e19990430ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220137172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuvanendran, V.10aForaging, growth and survival of Atlantic cod larvae reared in different prey concentrations  ap. 77-92.  a2019-12-05  aLaboratory studies have shown that suboptimal prey concentrations during the first feeding usually result in slower growth and higher mortality. We investigated the growth, survival and foraging behaviour of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae in different prey concentrations under laboratory conditions. Larvae were reared from hatching to metamorphosis (6 weeks post-hatch) on rotifers and/or Artemia nauplii at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 and 16,000 prey l(-1). Once a week, standard length and myotome height were recorded and mortalities were monitored from day 15. Observations on feeding behaviour were recorded twice a week. Larvae reared at 4000-16,000 prey l(-1) were significantly larger and had significantly higher condition indices than larvae from lower prey concentration (less than or equal to 2000). Initially, specific growth rates (SGR) were significantly higher in larvae reared at higher prey concentrations (greater than or equal to 4000), but from 3 weeks post-hatch, no difference was found among treatments in SGR. Instantaneous mortality rates (Z) decreased in all treatments as the larvae grew. Survival was significantly lower for larvae reared at lower prey concentrations until week 3. Larvae reared at 250 and 500 prey l(-1) did not survive beyond days 11 and 24, respectively. Survival of larvae was significantly higher at higher prey concentrations at weeks 2 and 6 post-hatch. Although survival of cod larvae at week 2 was similar among the three highest prey concentrations; survival at the end of the experiment (week 6) was higher, but not significantly, in the 4000 prey l(-1) treatment than the other two treatments (8000 and 16,000 prey l(-1)). Swimming duration was significantly higher among larvae reared at lower prey concentrations. Larvae reared at higher prey concentrations (greater than or equal to 4000) showed higher orientations and captured success rates but lower attack rates than larvae reared at lower prey concentrations. Our results indicate that for intensive rearing of cod larvae, higher prey concentrations are required to sustain reasonable growth and survival than that have been reported for mesocosm studies. 3afeeds 3aArtemia 3abody condition 3aheight 3aRotifera 3alength 3alarvae 3acod (fish) 3aforaging 3afish feeding 3amortality 0agrowth rate 0aprey 0afeeding behavior 0aconcentration 0agrowth1 aBrown, J.A.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 30, v. 175, no. 1/2 p.77-92x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02836naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001600157245013500173300001600308500002400324500001500348520115400363650002501517650002301542650001401565650001401579650001801593650001801611650001301629650003701642650002801679650002001707650001101727650002901738653002001767653002401787653001801811653001501829653002201844700001801866700001601884700001601900700002101916700001801937700001701955700001701972773011501989852000902104856008802113930003302201945002502234946001102259655001202270IND4405863320221119095141.0080520e20080615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440586332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8001 aReber, A.J.10aTransfer of maternal colostral leukocytes promotes development of the neonatal immune system.

This study examined the effects of maternal colostral leukocytes on development and maturation of neonatal antigen presenting cells. At birth, groups of neonatal calves received whole or cell-free colostrum (CFC) from their respective dams. Peripheral blood samples were obtained over the first 4 weeks of life, and expression of surface markers associated with cellular activation and physiological stress were monitored on monocyte lineage cells. Calves receiving cell-free colostrum at birth expressed elevated levels of CD11a, CD11c, and CD14, compared to calves receiving whole colostrum (C). Calves receiving cell-free colostrum had an elevated number of monocytes in the peripheral blood during the first 2 weeks of life, however, these cells expressed lower levels of expression of CD25 and MHC class I compared to calves receiving whole colostrum. The most significant differences in marker expression occurred within the first 7 days of life. 3aantigen presentation 3acolostral immunity 3acolostrum 3amonocytes 3aanimal stress 3aT-lymphocytes 3aneonates 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amaternal-fetal transfer 3aimmune response 3acalves 3alymphocyte proliferation 0awhole colostrum 0acell free colostrum 0alineage cells 0aleukocytes 0amaternal immunity1 aDonovan, D.C.1 aGabbard, J.1 aGalland, K.1 aAceves-Avila, M.1 aHolbert, K.A.1 aMarshall, L.1 aHurley, D.J.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g2008 June 15, v. 123, no. 3-4 p.186-196dElsevierx0165-24277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetimm.2008.01.0343Available from publisher's Web site  a20080830b20080905c00000000  aINDd7CTe2008/08/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01923naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005100128300001600179500001500195520084400210650002101054650002501075650001201100650002101112650001101133650001901144650002101163650002001184650001801204653001501222653000901237653001501246653002201261700002001283700001701303700001501320700001301335773007501348852000901423930003301432945001301465946001101478655001201489IND2201565320221119095102.0991110e19990415ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220156532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNavarro, J.C.10aLipid conversions during enrichment of Artemia  ap. 155-166.  a2019-12-05  aArtemia nauplii were enriched for 24 h with radiolabelled fatty acid ethyl esters and then starved for a subsequent period of 24 h. Analyses of the distribution of radioactivity in lipids from samples taken at the end of the enrichment period and after the subsequent starvation showed that the ethyl esters were readily converted into other lipid classes, mainly triacylglycerols, during assimilation by the nauplii. The proportions of radioactivity recovered in free fatty acids and phospholipids increased during the starvation period indicating the mobilisation of fatty acids from triacylglycerols for use in catabolism and in the formation of biomembrane lipids. The distribution pattern of radioactivity from [U-(14)C]22:6n-3 in the fatty acids of nauplii demonstrates that Artemia are capable of retroconverting 22:6n-3 to 20:5n-3. 3aisotope labeling 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aArtemia 3atriacylglycerols 3acarbon 3acell membranes 3alipid metabolism 3astable isotopes 3aphospholipids 0ametabolism 0aprey 0aenrichment 0afatty acid esters1 aHenderson, R.J.1 aMcEvoy, L.A.1 aBell, M.V.1 aAmat, F.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 15, v. 174, no. 1/2 p.155-166x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03605naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245014400189300001600333500002400349500001500373520146700388650001301855650001201868650002501880650001001905650002301915650002501938650002201963650001201985650001201997650001102009650001402020650003002034650001302064650002002077650001302097650002002110650002202130650002802152650001202180650001402192650001002206650003602216650002602252650004302278650005002321650002602371650002602397650002802423650003502451650003702486650003402523650002702557650003902584653002002623653001502643700001602658700001402674700001702688700001702705773010902722852000902831856005502840655001202895IND4457809820221119095114.0110507e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445780982DNAL7 a215353492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00684.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJIANG, JINHUA10aInvolvement of a putative response regulator FgRrg-1 in osmotic stress response, fungicide resistance and virulence in Fusarium graminearum  ap. 425-436.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResponse regulator (RR) proteins are core elements of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which plays an important role in the adaptation of fungi to a variety of environmental stresses. In this study, we constructed deletion mutants of two putative RR genes, FgRRG-1 and FgRRG-2, which are orthologues of Neurospora crassa RRG-1 and RRG-2, respectively. The FgRRG-1 deletion mutant (ΔFgRrg1-6) showed increased sensitivity to osmotic stress mediated by NaCl, KCl, sorbitol or glucose, and to metal cations Li⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺. The mutant, however, was more resistant than the parent isolate to dicarboximide and phenylpyrrole fungicides. Inoculation tests showed that the mutant exhibited decreased virulence on wheat heads. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays indicated that the expression of FgOS-2, the putative downstream gene of FgRRG-1, was decreased significantly in ΔFgRrg1-6. All of the defects were restored by genetic complementation of ΔFgRrg1-6 with the wild-type FgRRG-1 gene. Different from the FgRRG-1 deletion mutant, FgRRG-2 deletion mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild-type progenitor in virulence and in sensitivity to the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione and osmotic stresses. These results indicate that the RR FgRrg-1 of F. graminearum is involved in the osmotic stress response, pathogenicity and sensitivity to dicarboximide and phenylpyrrole fungicides and metal cations. 3asorbitol 3acations 3afungicide resistance 3agenes 3apotassium chloride 3aFusarium graminearum 3aNeurospora crassa 3aglucose 3aparents 3ametals 3avirulence 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aglycerol 3asodium chloride 3aproteins 3astress response 3agenetic disorders 3agenetic complementation 3amutants 3aiprodione 3afungi 2aAntifungal Agentsxpharmacology 2aCalciumxpharmacology 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFusariumxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aLithiumxpharmacology 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aOsmotic Pressurexdrug effects 2aPotassium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aSorbitolxpharmacology 2aVirulencexdrug effectsxgenetics. 0aGibberella zeae 0aadaptation1 aYUN, YINGZI1 aFu, Jing.1 aSHIM, WON-BO1 aMA, ZHONGHUA0 tMolecular plant pathology.g2011 June, v. 12, no. 5 p.425-436dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1464-67227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1364-3703.2010.00684.x 7aarticle02285naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010300130300001400233500001500247520119100262650002801453650001201481650002001493650001501513650002201528650002501550650001401575650001601589650001701605650001301622651001001635653002401645653001601669653000901685653001101694700001901705773007301724852000901797930003301806945001301839946001101852655001201863IND2201561820221119095004.0991110e19990415ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220156182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutierrez, R.M.10aPrey attack, food preference and growth in juveniles of the edible muricid snail, Chorus giganteus  ap. 69-79.  a2019-12-05  aChorus giganteus is a marine snail with potential in aquaculture or sea-farming. Considering predictions of optimal foraging, the aim of this study was to identify the preferred prey and to determine the extent to which this preferred prey promotes a higher rate of growth. Prey handling mechanisms, prey preference and resulting growth were assessed by offering C. giganteus the mussels Semimytilus algosus and Perumytilus purpuratus as alternative prey items. Juvenile snails of two size classes were used to assess handling behaviour and prey preference. Experimental treatments included mixed (S. algosus-P. purpuratus) as well as pure diets. A tendency to drill the prey shell, instead of using pedal handling, was observed in smaller snails (6-8 mm), while among larger snails (10-12 mm), the handling mechanism depended upon the prey species offered. Shell drilling was used more frequently to feed on P. purpuratus; in contrast, pedal handling was clearly favored when feeding on S. algosus. S. algosus was significantly preferred as prey (Quade test, T= 30.51; K1 = 1 and K2 = 8; P < 0.01), and the growth thus obtained was significantly higher than with P. purpuratus as prey. 3ainterspecific variation 3amussels 3aanimal behavior 3aGastropoda 3ashellfish culture 3adevelopmental stages 3apredators 3afeed intake 3afood choices 3aforaging 3aChile 0aspecies differences 0agrowth rate 0aprey 0agrowth1 aGallardo, C.S.0 tAquaculture.g1999 Apr. 15, v. 174, no. 1/2 p.69-79x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02031naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245017000130300001400300500001500314520076800329650001701097650001201114650000901126650003101135650002401166650001801190650001501208650002001223650002001243650001301263651001101276653001901287653001601306653002901322653001401351700002901365700001901394700003301413773007301446852000901519930003301528945001301561946001101574655001201585IND2201559920221119094935.0991110e19990415ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220155992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalcagnotto, D.10aBiochemical genetic characterization of F1 reciprocal hybrids between neotropical pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus) and tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) reared in Brazil  ap. 51-57.  a2019-12-05  aElectrophoretic profiles for pacu (Piaractus mesopotamicus), tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and their reciprocal hybrids 'tambacu' and 'paqui' are presented.

For this reason, CO2 evolution was measured in vitro from Typic Rendoll soils of the Champagne Crayeuse at four temperatures. Microbial biomass was also estimated by a plate-count technique that had been calibrated by two independent methods: chloroform fumigation and bioluminescence. Carbon dioxide evolution curves fit an equation consisting of a zero- and first-order reaction. The three parameters of this equation were interpreted as: (i) the amount of easily decomposable organic matter generated by the disturbance, (ii) the time constant for the disappearance of that disturbance, and (iii) the sustained respiration of the native microflora. This model implies that the rate of CO2 evolution is maximum at the start of the incubation, while the observed maximum in bacterial biomass occurred about 5 d later. Comparison of the results presented here with data from the literature shows that there is an almost continuous spectrum of values for the amounts of easily decomposable organic matter generated by any disturbance, and that the time constant for its mineralization is of the order of a very few days. Therefore, the use of the double exponential model is superfluous unless the duration of the incubation experiments exceeds 100 d. 3acarbon dioxide 3aevolution 3akinetics 3amicrobial activity 3atemperature 3acalcareous soils 3asoil organic matter 3adegradation 3abiomass production1 aMüller, J.1 aLaudelout, H.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1990 , v. 54, no. 5 p.1324-1328x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle00762naa a2200229 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092245001500110300001400125520018500139650002400324650000900348650002300357773007200380852000900452930003300461945001300494946001300507655001200520IND2035801720221119094946.0931112e199310  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203580172DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL12aA new USDA  ap. 68-69.  aThis article includes excerpts from a speech by Ellen Haas, Assistant Secretary for Food and Consumer Services, USDA, concerning the role of USDA in school food service operations. 3aschool food service 3aUSDA 3aDietary Guidelines0 tSchool food service journal.g1993 Oct., v. 47, no. 9 p.68-697nnas  aDNAL  a19931201b19931207c00000000  aINDdJFM  aOther US 7aarticle01539naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110245011800128300001600246520057400262650001100836650000900847650002500856650001700881650005700898650003200955650001100987650001300998650003501011653001201046773007501058852000901133930003301142945001301175946001301188655001201201IND2035530720221119095143.0931025e199308  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203553072DNAL7 a83024962pmid  aAGLbengcAGL10aMutations in the copper- and zinc-containing superoxide dismutase gene are associated with "Lou Gehrig's Disease"  ap. 243-245.  aRecent genetic analyses of patients with a familial, chromosome 21-linked form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease, suggest that mutations in the cytosolic copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene may be involved in development of the disease.

Different stages of virus amplification, maturation and assembly were observed at nucleus, cytoplasm and cellular membranes. The matured virus particles, were not only distributed diffusely in nucleus, cytoplasm and cellular surface, but also aggregated as pseudocrystalline arrays in the cytoplasm. Virions were released by budding from the plasma membranes, or following cell lysis. Various types of cell damage, such as small vacuoles, spherical inclusions, and swollen and empty mitochondria, were also found. Some typical characteristics of RGV, such as the symmetrical shape of the virions, replication process involving both nuclear and cytoplasmic phases, budding release from cellular membrane and intracellular membrane, viromatrix and paracrystalline aggregation in cytoplasm, and its acute pathogenic effects, were observed to be similar to that of other iridoviruses. Therefore, the RGV appears to be a member of the Iridoviridae based on these studies. 3aplasma membrane 3aIridoviridae 3amorphogenesis 3avacuoles 3aRana 3asurfaces 3afish 3amitochondria 3acell lines 3avirulence 3avirus replication 0alysis 0ainteractions 0anuclei 0aanimal viruses 0apathogenicity 0acell membranes 0acytoplasm1 aLi, Z.Q.1 aGui, J.F.0 tAquaculture.g1999 May 15, v. 175, no. 3/4 p.185-197x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b20040901c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02376naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245013400125300001600259520127700275650000901552650001201561650001501573650001701588650002801605650001401633650001601647650002001663650002301683650002401706650001301730650002101743653001601764653001601780653001101796700001901807773007401826852000901900930003301909945001301942946001101955655001201966IND2201957220221119095225.0991214e19990515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220195722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, K.10aEffects of dietary tannic acid and quebracho tannin on growth performance and metabolic rates of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.)  ap. 327-335.  aThe effects of tannic acid (a hydrolysable tannin) and quebracho tannin (a condensed tannin) on common carp at a level of 2% in a soybean and fish meal-based diet containing about 40% crude protein have been studied. Quebracho tannin did not affect feed intake, body weight gain, average metabolic growth rate and oxygen consumption during the experimental period (84 days). The carp grew from an initial body weight of about 30 g to a final body weight of 150 g, and the carcass composition was also not affected by quebracho tannin. On the other hand, tannic acid produced adverse effects after day 28. The rejection of diet started on day 28 and a complete rejection of the diet was observed on day 40. The feeding of this diet was discontinued after day 42. The average metabolic growth rate for days 35-42 was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in this group. The oxygen consumption of carp fed a diet containing tannic acid also decreased although non-significantly for this period. It is concluded that the toxicity of tannic acid is higher to carp compared to that of quebracho tannin, and that protein sources of plant origin containing high amounts of tannins and in particular hydrolysable tannins should be used with caution as fish meal substitutes in carp diets. 3acarp 3atannins 3ametabolism 3asoybean meal 3aantinutritional factors 3afish meal 3afeed intake 3aliveweight gain 3aoxygen consumption 3acarcass composition 3atoxicity 3aapplication rate 0agrowth rate 0aperformance 0agrowth1 aMakkar, H.P.S.0 tAquaculture.g1999 May 15, v. 175, no. 3/4 p.327-335x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02642naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245013900130300001600269500001500285520160600300650001501906650001601921650001801937650002401955650002301979650001202002653000902014653002002023653001602043653001502059653001302074653001102087700001802098773007402116852000902190930003302199945001302232946001102245655001202256IND2201957520221119095256.0991214e19990515ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220195752DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPottinger, T.G.12aA comparison of plasma glucose and plasma cortisol as selection markers for high and low stress-responsiveness in female rainbow trout  ap. 351-363.  a2019-12-05  aTwo groups of female rainbow trout displaying consistently divergent plasma cortisol responses to a 3 h period of confinement were identified following five separate confinement episodes at monthly intervals. High-responding (HRC) and low-responding individuals. (LRC) continued to display divergent cortisol responses to confinement up to 21 months after the start of the study (342 +/- 34 and 208 +/- 21 ng ml(-1), respectively, at the final sample; p < 0.01). HRC fish were significantly larger than LRC fish throughout the study period (533 +/- 13 and 422 +/- 10 g, respectively, overall; p < 0.001), although significant differences in specific growth rate (SGR) were apparent only at the start of the study. Individual fish were also selected from the same population on the basis of their plasma glucose levels following confinement (high-responding glucose (HRG): 189 +/- 6; low-responding glucose (LRG) 121 +/- 3 mg dl(-1); p < 0.00l). However, the two selection traits (cortisol and glucose) identified separate subsets of the experimental population. HRG fish were also significantly larger than LRG fish although this difference was not so pronounced as for the cortisol-selected fish. There was no reciprocal relationship between body weight and stress responsiveness; fish selected from the population on the basis of high or low body weight displayed no divergence in either cortisol or glucose responses to confinement. Differences in size and SGR may indicate that HR fish adapted more rapidly to changes in environmental and social factors at the start of the study than LR fish did. 3abiomarkers 3abody weight 3ablood glucose 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aselection criteria 3afemales 0asize 0ablood chemistry 0agrowth rate 0aadaptation 0ahandling 0astress1 aCarrick, T.R.0 tAquaculture.g1999 May 15, v. 175, no. 3/4 p.351-363x0044-84867nnas  aDNAL  a20040830b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03827naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245013000199300001800329500002400347506007600371520156600447506003702013650002202050650001602072650001102088650001602099650002402115650001002139650002802149650002902177650001502206650001602221650001102237650001602248650001302264650004402277650002202321650005102343650003202394650003602426650002502462650004002487650004202527650005602569650004602625650003502671700003102706700002202737700001702759700002602776700002502802700002802827700002602855700003802881700001802919700002002937773010902957852000903066856007803075655001203153IND4427112520221207073214.0091012e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442711252DNAL7 a196900002pmid7 aPMC27593432pmcid7 a10.1093/pcp/pcp1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLabboun, Soraya10aResolving the Role of Plant Glutamate Dehydrogenase.

For a better understanding of the physiological function of GDH either in ammonium assimilation or in the supply of 2-oxoglutarate, we used transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants overexpressing the two genes encoding the enzyme. An in vivo real time ¹⁵N-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy approach allowed the demonstration that, when the two GDH genes were overexpressed individually or simultaneously, the transgenic plant leaves did not synthesize glutamate in the presence of ammonium when glutamine synthetase (GS) was inhibited. In contrast we confirmed that the primary function of GDH is to deaminate Glu. When the two GDH unlabeled substrates ammonium and Glu were provided simultaneously with either [¹⁵N]Glu or ¹⁵NH[Formula: see text] respectively, we found that the ammonium released from the deamination of Glu was reassimilated by the enzyme GS, suggesting the occurrence of a futile cycle recycling both ammonium and Glu. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the GDH enzyme, in conjunction with NADH-GOGAT, contributes to the control of leaf Glu homeostasis, an amino acid that plays a central signaling and metabolic role at the interface of the carbon and nitrogen assimilatory pathways. Thus, in vivo NMR spectroscopy appears to be an attractive technique to follow the flux of metabolites in both normal and genetically modified plants.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aamino acids 3acarbon 3adeamination 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3aglutamates 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3ametabolites 3anitrogen 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atransgenic plants 2aGlutamate Dehydrogenasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGlutamic Acidxbiosynthesis 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgenetics.1 aTercé-Laforgue, Thérèse1 aRoscher, Albrecht1 aBedu, Magali1 aRestivo, Francesco M.1 aVelanis, Christos N.1 aSkopelitis, Damianos S.1 aMoshou, Panagiotis N.1 aRoubelakis-Angelakis, Kalliopi A.1 aSuzuki, Akira1 aHirel, Bertrand0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2009 Oct., v. 50, no. 10 p.1761-1773dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcp1183Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle00857naa a2200229 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245014800115300001400263520015200277650002400429650001600453650001200469773007100481852000900552939003300561945000800594946001300602655001200615991588302660742620221119094601.0930812e199305  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930022522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aAdd to your baking repertoire: practice your baking skills with these recipes that offer your customers the homemade taste of fresh baked goods  ap. 40-41.  aFresh baked goods make wholesome additions to school food service menus.

With decreasing water potential caused by increasing concentrations of PEG 6000, germination percentage and germination index decreased gradually; the decrease was especially prominent under the serious water stress from PEG −0.6 MPa. In contrast, osmotic regulation substances (free proline and soluble sugar contents), lipid peroxidation (MDA), and activities of antioxidant enzyme (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, and peroxidase) increased markedly with decreased water potential. Similarly, the values in all parameters under −0.6 MPa PEG treatment were markedly higher than the control and −0.2 MPa PEG treatment. These results suggested that P. asperata seed germination was insensitive to water stress. In addition, seeds pretreated with GA had increased tolerance to water stress as measured by germination percentage and germination index, osmotic regulation substance, and antioxidant enzyme activities. 3aPicea asperata 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3acatalase 3aenzyme activity 3alipid peroxidation 3aosmoregulation 3aproline 3aseed germination 3aseeds 3asugars 3awater potential 3awater stress1 aLiu, Q.1 aWang, G.

Animal studied A total of 60 adult healthy horses were studied. Procedure Swabs of the conjunctiva were obtained from 60 horses housed in two locations within the UK. Specimens were cultured for aerobic bacteria and fungi, and sensitivity against six ophthalmic antimicrobials assessed. The effect of age, sex, location and housing on the frequency of microbial isolation was evaluated. Results Fifty-four bacterial isolates, representing thirteen genera of bacteria were cultured from 31 (52%) horses. The most frequently isolated bacterial species was Acinetobacter sp (17/32 horses). The majority of isolates (28/54: 52%) were gram-positive. Three genera of fungi (Mucor, Absidia and Aspergillus spp) were isolated from eight (13%) horses. There was no significant effect of geographic location, sex, age or housing on frequency of microbial isolation. Horses from which gram-negative bacteria were isolated were significantly older than horses from which gram-positive bacteria were isolated. High efficacy (greater than 90% of isolates sensitive in vitro) was displayed by chloramphenicol, gentamicin and tetracycline. Conclusions The microbial species isolated are comparable with studies performed in other countries, although the frequency of Acinetobacter isolation was higher which may reflect a geographic difference. The topical antimicrobials gentamicin and chloramphenicol are appropriate first line antimicrobials for empirical treatment of corneal ulcers in the UK. 3aAbsidia 3aAcinetobacter 3aAspergillus 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aMucor 3achloramphenicol 3aconjunctiva 3aflora 3afungi 3agentamicin 3ageographical variation 3ahorses 3atetracycline 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxclassificationxdrug effectsxisolation & purification. 2aConjunctivaxmicrobiology 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aFemale 2aFungixclassificationxisolation & purification. 2aHorsesxmicrobiology 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 3aUnited Kingdom 0aGreat Britain1 aBaxter, Katherine1 aBooler, Helen1 aHicks, Charlotte1 aMenzies-Gow, Nicola0 tVeterinary ophthalmology.g2011 May, v. 14, no. 3 p.195-199dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1463-52167nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-5224.2010.00867.x 7aarticle01991naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245005500206300001200261506007600273520077000349506003701119650000801156650001901164650002401183650001601207650001401223650001201237700001601249700001701265700002201282700002601304773012501330852000901455856008301464930003301547946001301580655001201593IND4415056320221207065946.0090120e20090116xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441505632DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11659212doi7 aPMC28379122pmcid7 a191508372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorrow, Thomas J.10aProgrammed Assembly of DNA-Coated Nanowire Devices  ap. 352.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCombining biomolecular function with integrated circuit technology could usher in a new era of biologically enabled electronics. A key challenge has been coupling different molecular functions to specific chip locations for communication with the circuit. We used spatially confined electric fields to assemble different populations of DNA-coated nanowires to desired positions with an accuracy that enabled postassembly fabrication of contacts to each individual nanowire, with high yield and without loss of DNA function. This combination of off-chip synthesis and biofunctionalization with high-density, heterogeneous assembly and integration at the individual nanowire level points to new ways of incorporating biological functionality with silicon electronics.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aelectric field 3aelectronic circuits 3aelectronics 3ananowires 3asilicon1 aLi, Mingwei1 aKim, Jaekyun1 aMayer, Theresa S.1 aKeating, Christine D.0 tScience.g2009 Jan. 16, v. 323, no. 5912 p.352-352dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11659213Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01449naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245004700167300001600214520069800230650001000928650001100938650002500949773007100974852000901045856008301054930003301137946001301170655001201183IND4375793820221119094645.0051106e20051104xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437579382DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11135302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakai, Kuniyoshi L.10aLanguage Acquisition and Brain Development  ap. 815-819.  aLanguage acquisition is one of the most fundamental human traits, and it is obviously the brain that undergoes the developmental changes.

Recent advances in functional neuroimaging have substantially contributed to systems-level analyses of brain development.

Recent studies have reported on indirect evidence of density fluctuations at solid-liquid interfaces on the basis of x-ray scattering methods that have been complemented by atomistic simulations. We provide evidence for ordering of liquid atoms adjacent to an interface with a crystal, based on real-time high-temperature observations of alumina-aluminum solid-liquid interfaces at the atomic-length scale. In addition, crystal growth of alumina into liquid aluminum, facilitated by interfacial transport of oxygen from the microscope column, was observed in situ with the use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. 3aX-radiation 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aoxygen 3asolidification 3atransmission electron microscopy1 aKauffmann, Y.1 aScheu, C.1 aKaplan, W.

A comparison with extensive quantitative sampling  ap. 99-112.  aIt is a fundamental tenet of Rapid Biological Assessments (RBA) that the samples collected reflect the community from which they are drawn. As with any biological sampling, RBA collections are subject to sampling error resulting in the omission of some taxa. The aim of this study is to compare the composition of RBA samples with an estimate of community structure based on extensive quantitative sampling. We used logistic regression to explore the relationships between the frequency of a taxon being collected in an RBA sample and its biological and ecological traits, namely its abundance, distribution, body size and habit. RBA samples and quantitative estimates of community structure were made in riffles in the Kangaroo and Nepean Rivers, New South Wales, Australia. Single RBA samples may collect up to 63% of the taxa that are collected by extensive quantitative sampling at a site. The frequency of a taxon being recorded in an RBA sample was significantly and positively related to all traits tested indicating a bias in the collection methods towards large, abundant and widely distributed taxa. Accordingly, taxa missed by RBA sampling were generally small, narrowly distributed or rare. These findings enhance our understanding of what RBA samples represent, and the bias and source of errors associated with RBA sampling.

Part I: overview  ap. 1-13.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOne of the most challenging analytical issues in terms of wine authenticity is the control of geographical origin. This question becomes more and more important in the current context of a global wine market. Single parameters are often not sufficient on their own to determine the product identity with respect to the wine labelling. Recent developments have shown that control is improved by application of multivariate statistical methods to a combination of composition and isotopic data. In the past years, the official European wine control bodies have been confronted with wines that have had to be judged as suspicious in terms of their sophisticated authenticity, falsifications which are not readily identifiable, especially as it regards the grape variety, and particularly highlighted here the geographical origin. To improve the measures of authenticity control, a project with the title “Establishing of a WINE Data Bank for analytical parameters for wines from Third countries (WINE-DB project, G6RD-CT-2001-00646-WINE-DB)” was initiated in 2002, funded by the European Commission within the fifth framework “Competitive and Sustainable Growth”. The project consortium of this multinational project was composed of official and private laboratories from the European Union, from new European member states and a group of university partners for the statistical evaluation. Within the framework of the WINE-DB project, commercial and authentic wines originating from new European member states (Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania) and from overseas countries (South Africa and Australia) are collected and analysed. More than 1,800 wines from three vintages were analysed. First, a sampling plan for each wine-producing country was developed for the authentic samples taking into account, the surface and the grape variety of wine in the respective country. This sampling plan was used for the commercial samples accordingly. A series of three publications was prepared covering the statistical approaches and the results obtained for authentication of wine. The actual one—Part I—provides an overview on the structure of the project, the developing of the sampling plan, the strategy of sample collection and the analytical scheme. 3awine grapes 3adeveloping countries 3awines 3acontrol methods 3aEuropean Union 3astatistical analysis 3amarkets 3adatabases 3aCzech Republic 3aRomania 3aHungary 3aSouth Australia 0alabeling1 aFauhl-Hassek, Carsten1 aForina, Michele1 aCotea, Valeriu1 aKocsi, Emilia1 aSchoula, Roman1 avan Jaarsveld, Francois1 aWittkowski, Reiner0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2009 Nov., v. 230, no. 1 p.1-13dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-009-1140-y 7aarticle02666naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245008500172300001600257500012000273520146300393650001301856650001601869650001501885650001401900650001901914650001101933650001101944650001201955650001001967650000901977650001301986650001101999700001602010700001802026700001602044773014402060856005502204852000902259655001202268IND60647372020221119094651.0190619e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064737202DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1236.172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKammhuber, K.10aAnalytical and sensorial characterization of the new Hueller Special Flavor Hops  ap. 129-134.  aPaper presented at the IV International Humulus Symposium held August 4-8, 2015 Yakima, WA United States of America  aCraft brewers ask for new types of hop aromas, which are very different from traditional hop aromas and provide more floral, fruity and citrus-like aroma impressions. The hop research center Huell has reacted on these demands and developed three new Special Flavor Hops with the names ‘Mandarina Bavaria’, ‘Hallertau Blanc’ and ‘Huell Melon’, which meet these requirements. High concentrations of low molecular esters and terpene alcohols are responsible for the described aroma impressions. A comparison of some important aroma substances to the cultivar ‘Cascade’ is shown. Studies on the biogenesis of the bitter substances and essential oils were made from 2012 to 2014. The content of the alpha-acids and the content of the total oils depends highly on the date of harvest. The oil composition is also changed during the ripening period. The myrcene content increases more than the other oil components and this has an influence on the olfactory properties. First informative investigations into sulfur compounds have shown, that 4-mercapto-4-methyl-2-pentanone (4-MMP) is present in the new Hueller Special Flavor Hops and that ‘Polaris’ seems to have a similar or even a higher content of 4-mercapto-4-methyl-2-pentanone than the cultivar ‘Cascade’. The date of harvest seems also to have a great influence on the content of sulfur compounds. But these are preliminary studies and more extensive investigations have to be made. 3aalcohols 3aalpha acids 3abiogenesis 3acultivars 3aessential oils 3aesters 3aflavor 3amyrcene 3aodors 3aoils 3aripening 3asulfur1 aSeigner, L.1 aLutz, Arthur,1 aCoelhan, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019 Apr. 3, , no. 1236 p.129-134dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1236.17  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245008300168300001600251500012000267520113400387650002001521650002101541650002201562650002301584650002001607650002001627650001801647650001101665650002101676650001801697650002501715650002001740650001801760650001401778700002101792700001701813773014401830856005501974852000902029655001202038IND60647372120221119094705.0190619e20190403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064737212DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1236.182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitra, N.10aDigital gene expression analysis of the hop (Humulus lupulus L.) transcriptome  ap. 135-144.  aPaper presented at the IV International Humulus Symposium held August 4-8, 2015 Yakima, WA United States of America  aHumulus lupulus is a specialty crop with new-use potential beyond its most common application in the brewing industry. As a medicinal plant already used in the food industgry, hop is a compelling candidate for further scientific exploration, especially biochemical and molecular genetic studies. Yet because hop is a niche crop, crop improvement studies must have superior cost efficiency. Digital gene expression (DGE) is a low-cost method which allows for deep, quantitative gene transcript analysis. DGE analyses of three hop organs, cone, leaf and trichome glandular cells, yielded about 1.5 million cDNA sequence reads (tags) of 20 bp each in length which could not be assembled into large contigs. Therefore, a protocol to annotate the DGE tags was created, applied and compared to previously produced long-read transcriptomes. In order to organize and validate the transcript quantitations, the tagged, combined sequence dataset was grouped according to a gene ontology (GO) hierarchy. The combination of these sequencing technologies produced a well annotated, accurate, gene expression profile of the hop transcriptomes. 3aHumulus lupulus 3abrewing industry 3acomplementary DNA 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3agene expression 3agene ontology 3aleaves 3amedicinal plants 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aspecialty crops 3atranscriptome 3atrichomes1 aSchwekendiek, A.1 aMatthews, P.0 tActa horticulturae.g2019 Apr. 3, , no. 1236 p.135-144dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2019.1236.18  aDNAL 7aarticle02370naa a2200745 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115245008500133300001600218500001500234520032600249650001900575650001200594650002200606650001700628650001200645650001000657650001400667650002300681650000800704650002100712650001700733650002100750650001300771650002100784650002500805650001700830650001500847650000900862650002000871650001000891650002600901650002600927650003200953650001100985650002200996650002101018650003301039650002301072650002001095650001101115650001101126650001901137650002901156650004501185650004601230650001401276650002301290651001801313653001701331653003001348653001801378653001401396653002401410773010201434852001301536939003301549945000801582946001301590852000901603655001201612991588283410742620221119094657.0930817e199306  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI930022992DNAL7 a85095972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL10aHealth care reform legislative platform: economic benefits of nutrition services  ap. 686-690.  a2019-12-04  aNutrition services in acute care play a vital role in the recovery of the patient.

We tested whether ER stress causes or exacerbates lung fibrosis by (i) conditional expression of a mutant form of surfactant protein C (L188Q SFTPC) found in familial interstitial pneumonia and (ii) intratracheal treatment with the protein misfolding agent tunicamycin. We developed transgenic mice expressing L188Q SFTPC exclusively in type II alveolar epithelium by using the Tet-On system. Expression of L188Q SFTPC induced ER stress, as determined by increased expression of heavy-chain Ig binding protein (BiP) and splicing of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) mRNA, but no lung fibrosis was identified in the absence of a second profibrotic stimulus. After intratracheal bleomycin, L188Q SFTPC-expressing mice developed exaggerated lung fibrosis and reduced static lung compliance compared with controls. Bleomycin-treated L188Q SFTPC mice also demonstrated increased apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells and greater numbers of fibroblasts in the lungs. With a complementary model, intratracheal tunicamycin treatment failed to induce lung remodeling yet resulted in augmentation of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. These data support the concept that ER stress produces a dysfunctional epithelial cell phenotype that facilitates fibrotic remodeling. ER stress pathways may serve as important therapeutic targets in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aapoptosis 3abinding proteins 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aepithelial cells 3aepithelium 3afibroblasts 3afibrosis 3alungs 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3amodels 3amutants 3apatients 3aphenotype 3apneumonia 3aprotein folding 3asurfactants 3atransgenic animals 3atunicamycin1 aCheng, Dong-Sheng1 aDegryse, Amber L.1 aTanjore, Harikrishna1 aPolosukhin, Vasiliy V.1 aXu, Xiaochuan C.1 aNewcomb, Dawn C.1 aJones, Brittany R.1 aRoldán, Juan.1 aLane, Kirk B.1 aMorrisey, Edward E.1 aBeers, Michael F.1 aYull, Fiona E.1 aBlackwell, Timothy S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10562-10567dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11075591083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle04106naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001500185245011900200300001800319500017300337500012000510500002400630520235600654650001503010650002003025650001703045650002403062650002503086650001303111650002703124650002003151650002603171650002003197650002903217650002903246650001803275651001003293700001803303700001803321773009803339852000903437856007303446930003303519945002503552946001103577655001203588IND4384444820221119094632.0061016e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438444482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.04.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF900 0aF300 0aJ200 0aJ5001 aLiao, J.D.10aStorage and dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in soil physical fractions following woody plant invasion of grassland  ap. 3184-3196.  aIn the special issue: Ecosystems in Flux: Molecular and Stable Isotope Assessments of Soil Organic Matter Storage and Dynamics / edited by T.W.

Filley.  aPaper presented at the American Geophysical Union National Meeting, 12-17 December 2004, San Francisco, California.  aIncludes references  aWoody plant invasion of grasslands is prevalent worldwide. In the Rio Grande Plains of Texas, subtropical thorn woodlands dominated by C3 trees/shrubs have been replacing C4 grasslands over the past 150 yr, resulting in increased soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and concomitant increases in soil total nitrogen (STN). To elucidate mechanisms of change in SOC and STN, we separated soil organic matter into specific size/density fractions and determined the concentration of C and N in these fractions. Soils were collected from remnant grasslands (Time 0) and woody plant stands (ages 10-130 yr). Rates of whole-soil C and N accrual in the upper 15 cm of the soil profile averaged 10-30 g C m-2 yr-1 and 1-3 g N m-2 yr-1, respectively, over the past 130 yr of woodland development. These rates of accumulation have increased soil C and N stocks in older wooded areas by 100-500% relative to remnant grasslands. Probable causes of these increased pool sizes include higher rates of organic matter production in wooded areas, greater inherent biochemical resistance of woody litter to decomposition, and protection of organic matter by stabilization within soil macro- and microaggregates. The mass proportions of the free light fraction (<1.0 g cm-3) and macroaggregate fraction (>250 micrometer) increased linearly with time following woody plant invasion of grassland. Conversely, the mass proportions of free microaggregate (53-250 micrometer) and free silt+clay (<53 micrometer) fractions decreased linearly with time after woody invasion, likely reflecting stabilization of these fractions within macroaggregate structures. Carbon and N concentrations increased in all soil fractions with time following woody invasion. Approximately half of the C and N accumulated in free particulate organic matter (POM) fractions, while the remainder accrued in stable macro- and microaggregate structures. Soil C/N ratios indicated that the organic C associated with POM and macroaggregates was of more recent origin (less decomposed) than C associated with the microaggregate and silt+clay fractions. Because grassland-to-woodland conversion has been geographically extensive in grassland ecosystems worldwide during the past century, changes in soil C and N storage and dynamics documented here could have significance for global cycles of those elements. 3agrasslands 3agrassland soils 3awoody plants 3aecological invasion 3acarbon sequestration 3anitrogen 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3asoil aggregates 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3achronosequences 3asoil physical properties 3asoil chemical properties 3afractionation 3aTexas1 aBoutton, T.W.1 aJastrow, J.D.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 Nov., v. 38, no. 11 p.3184-3196dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.04.0033electronic resource  a20061116b20061202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle03950naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001400176245017200190300001800362500017300380500012000553500002400673500001500697520202800712650001202740650001902752650002602771650001402797650001702811650001302828650002402841650001902865650001002884650001102894650001202905650001302917650003602930650001402966650002002980650002003000651001503020653001403035700001503049700001503064700001503079700001703094773009803111852000903209856007303218930003303291945002503324946001103349655001203360IND4384446020221119094803.0061016e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438444602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aJ200 0aF6001 aKrull, E.10aCompound-specific delta 13C and delta 2H analyses of plant and soil organic matter: A preliminary assessment of the effects of vegetation change on ecosystem hydrology  ap. 3211-3221.  aIn the special issue: Ecosystems in Flux: Molecular and Stable Isotope Assessments of Soil Organic Matter Storage and Dynamics / edited by T.W.

Our data show that δ13C values of the C4 grassland species were heavier relative to those of C3 tree species from the woodland (Acacia leaves) and woody grassland (Atalaya leaves). However, n-alkanes from the C4 grasses had lighter δ2H values relative to the Acacia leaves, but showed no significant difference in δ2H values when compared with C3 Atalaya leaves. These results differ from those of previous studies, showing that C4 grasses had heavier δ2H values relative to C3 grasses and trees. Those observations have been explained by C4 plants accessing the more evaporation-influenced and isotopically heavier surface water and tree roots sourcing deeper, isotopically lighter soil water (“Two-layered soil-water system”). By comparison, our data suggest that ecosystem changes (vegetation “thickening”) can significantly alter the soil hydrological characteristics. This is shown by the heavier δ2H values in the woodland soil compared with lighter δ2H values in the grassland soil, implying that the recent vegetation change (increased tree biomass) in the woodland had altered soil hydrological conditions. Estimated δ2H values of the source-water for vegetation in the grassland and woodland showed that both trees and grasses in open settings accessed water with lighter δ2H values (avg. -46 per thousand) compared with water accessed by trees in the woodland vegetation (avg. -7 per thousand). These data suggest that in semi-arid environments the “two-layer” soil water concept might not apply. Furthermore, our data indicate that compound-specific δ2H and δ13C analyses of n-alkanes from soil organic matter can be used to successfully differentiate between water sources of different vegetation types (grasses versus trees) in natural ecosystems. 3agrasses 3awoodland soils 3aplant available water 3aC4 plants 3awater supply 3aecotones 3asoil organic matter 3asemiarid zones 3atrees 3acarbon 3aalkanes 3ahydrogen 3achemical constituents of plants 3aC3 plants 3astable isotopes 3agrassland soils 3aQueensland 0ahydrology1 aSachse, D.1 aMugler, I.1 aThiele, A.1 aGleixner, G.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2006 Nov., v. 38, no. 11 p.3211-3221dPergamonx0038-07177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2006.04.0083electronic resource  a20061116b20061202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2006/11/16  aNon-US 7aarticle02550naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147072000900165100001900174245009800193300001800291500002400309520103900333650001501372650002701387650001201414650002801426650001001454650002301464650003301487650002501520650001101545650004201556650001101598650003501609650003201644650002501676651000901701700001701710700002101727700002101748773013701769852000901906856007001915930003301985945002502018946001302043655001202056IND4384442520221119094610.0061016e200610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438444252DNAL7 a170002032pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2006.07.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT0001 aBerryman, D.E.10aDietetics Students Possess Negative Attitudes toward Obesity Similar to Nondietetics Students  ap. 1678-1682.  aIncludes references  aThis study explored attitudes toward obesity between dietetics and nondietetics majors at Ohio University and their relationship with dietary intake and body composition. A convenience sample comprised of 76 female dietetics (n=38) and nondietetics (n=38) majors was assessed for attitudes toward obesity using a validated Fat Phobia Scale. Dietary intake and percent body fat were measured using a food frequency questionnaire and air displacement plethysmography, respectively. Results show that both groups were well matched with respect to age, weight, and percent body fat. The two groups were similar with respect to negative attitudes toward obesity and these perceptions were comparable to norms reported in previous studies. However, there were intriguing, but subtle, differences in the rating of adjectives comprising the Fat Phobia Scale and in dietary intake between the groups. Together, these results suggest that dietetics students are no more or less susceptible to negative attitudes toward obesity than their peers. 3adietitians 3aattitudes and opinions 3aobesity 3aperceptions (cognitive) 2aAdult 2aAttitude to Health 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aDieteticsxeducation 2aFemale 2aHealth Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice 2aHumans 2aObesityxetiologyxpsychology. 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aStudentsxpsychology 0aOhio1 aDubale, G.M.1 aManchester, D.S.1 aMittelstaedt, R.0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2006 Oct., v. 106, no. 10 p.1678-1682dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2006.07.0163electronic resource  a20061218b20070102c00000000  aINDdLDPe2006/12/18  aOther US 7aarticle03251naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245007700198300002000275506007600295520152400371506003701895650003201932650002201964650001701986650002502003650002502028650001002053650001102063650001802074650002202092650002102114650001602135650002202151650002602173650001202199650001102211700001602222700002302238700002202261700001802283700001602301700002702317700001702344700002202361773017602383852000902559856008302568939003302651946001302684655001202697IND4459341020221207063524.0110625e20110621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445934102DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11066101082doi7 aPMC31218092pmcid7 a216367842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, Chun10aStructure of the guanylyltransferase domain of human mRNA capping enzyme  ap. 10104-10108.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe enzyme guanylyltransferase (GTase) plays a central role in the three-step catalytic process of adding an m⁷GpppN cap cotranscriptionally to nascent mRNA (pre-mRNAs). The 5'-mRNA capping process is functionally and evolutionarily conserved from unicellular organisms to human. However, the GTases from viruses and yeast have low amino acid sequence identity (~25%) with GTases from mammals that, in contrast, are highly conserved (~98%). We have defined by limited proteolysis of human capping enzyme residues 229-567 as comprising the minimum enzymatically active human GTase (hGTase) domain and have determined the structure by X-ray crystallography. Seven related conformational states of hGTase exist in the crystal. The GTP-binding site is evolutionarily and structurally conserved. The positional variations of the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold lid domain over the GTP-binding site provide snapshots of the opening and closing of the active site cleft through a swivel motion. The pattern of conserved surface residues in mammals, but not in yeast, supports the finding that the recognition of the capping apparatus by RNA polymerase II and associated transcription factors is highly conserved in mammals, and the mechanism may differ somewhat from that in yeast. The hGTase structure should help in the design of biochemical and molecular biology experiments to explore the protein:protein and protein:RNA interactions that ensure regulated transcription of genes in humans and other mammals.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aX-ray diffraction 3aactive sites 3aamino acid sequences 3acarbohydrate binding 3agenes 3ahumans 3amessenger RNA 3amolecular biology 3aoligonucleotides 3aproteolysis 3asequence analysis 3atranscription factors 3aviruses 3ayeasts1 aDas, Kalyan1 aTyminski, James R.1 aBauman, Joseph D.1 aGuan, Rongjin1 aQiu, Weihua1 aMontelione, Gaetano T.1 aArnold, Eddy1 aShatkin, Aaron J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 21, v. 108, no. 25 p.10104-10108dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11066101083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aOther US 7aarticle02325naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245006300205300002000268506007600288520093500364506003701299650002101336650002701357650002201384650001701406650002701423650002201450650001501472700001801487700001701505700002401522700002001546700002301566773017601589852000901765856008301774939003301857946001301890655001201903IND4459341320221207063450.0110625e20110621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445934132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.10185321082doi7 aPMC31218522pmcid7 a215934062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLepore, Bryan W.10aLigand-gated diffusion across the bacterial outer membrane  ap. 10121-10126.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLigand-gated channels, in which a substrate transport pathway is formed as a result of the binding of a small-molecule chemical messenger, constitute a diverse class of membrane proteins with important functions in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Despite their widespread nature, no ligand-gated channels have yet been found within the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. Here we show, using in vivo transport assays, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and X-ray crystallography, that high-affinity (submicromolar) substrate binding to the OM long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL from Escherichia coli causes conformational changes in the N terminus that open up a channel for substrate diffusion. The OM long-chain fatty acid transporter FadL from E. coli is a unique paradigm for OM diffusion-driven transport, in which ligand gating within a β-barrel membrane protein is a prerequisite for channel formation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aX-ray diffraction 3afluorescence 3along chain fatty acids 3amembrane proteins 3atryptophan1 aIndic, Mridhu1 aPham, Hannah1 aHearn, Elizabeth M.1 aPatel, Dimki R.1 avan den Berg, Bert0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 21, v. 108, no. 25 p.10121-10126dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10185321083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aOther US 7aarticle01975naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002900184245008700213300002000300506007600320520064700396506003701043650001801080650002501098650001801123650002001141650001001161650001601171650002401187650001801211650001101229700002301240773017601263852000901439856008301448939003301531946001301564655001201577IND4459341220221207063450.0110625e20110621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445934122DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11014491082doi7 aPMC31218322pmcid7 a216465352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEhrensberger, Andreas H.10aIsolation of an activator-dependent, promoter-specific chromatin remodeling factor  ap. 10115-10120.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRepressed PHO5 gene chromatin, isolated from yeast in the native state, was remodeled by yeast extract in a gene activator-dependent, ATP-dependent manner.

It has been recently shown that in liver insulin resistance is not complete. This so-called selective insulin resistance is characterized by defective insulin inhibition of hepatic glucose output while insulin-induced lipogenesis is maintained. How this occurs and whether uncoupled insulin action develops in other tissues is unknown. Here we show in a model of chronic hyperinsulinemia that adipocytes develop selective insulin resistance in which translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter to the cell surface is blunted yet nuclear exclusion of the FoxO1 transcription factor is preserved, rendering uncoupled insulin-controlled carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms. We found that in adipocytes FoxO1 nuclear exclusion has a lower half-maximal insulin dose than GLUT4 translocation, and it is because of this inherent greater sensitivity that control of FoxO1 by physiological insulin concentrations is maintained in adipocytes with compromised insulin signaling. Pharmacological and genetic interventions revealed that insulin regulates GLUT4 and FoxO1 through the PI3-kinase isoform p110α, although FoxO1 showed higher sensitivity to p110α activity than GLUT4. Transient down-regulation and overexpression of Akt isoforms in adipocytes demonstrated that insulin-activated PI3-kinase signals to GLUT4 primarily through Akt2 kinase, whereas Akt1 and Akt2 signal to FoxO1. We propose that the lower threshold of insulin activity for FoxO1's nuclear exclusion is in part due to its regulation by both Akt isoforms. Identification of uncoupled insulin action in adipocytes suggests this condition might be a general phenomenon of insulin target tissues contributing to insulin resistance's pathophysiology.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadipocytes 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahyperinsulinemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin resistance 3alipids 3alipogenesis 3aliver 3ametabolic syndrome 3amodels 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apathophysiology 3atissues 3atranscription factors1 aFlier, Emily1 aMolle, Dorothee1 aAccili, Domenico1 aMcGraw, Timothy E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 21, v. 108, no. 25 p.10162-10167dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10192681083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aOther US 7aarticle02918naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245012300202300002000325506007600345520120300421506003701624650002201661650001201683650002001695650003101715650001001746650001501756650000901771650002601780650001201806650001401818650002701832650002401859650002501883650002301908650002001931700002201951700001501973700002101988700002202009700002402031700001902055773017602074852000902250856008302259939003302342946001302375655001202388IND4459342620221207045548.0110625e20110621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445934262DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11074131082doi7 aPMC31218572pmcid7 a216330122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiat, Daniel10aConcerted regulation of myofiber-specific gene expression and muscle performance by the transcriptional repressor Sox6  ap. 10196-10201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn response to physiological stimuli, skeletal muscle alters its myofiber composition to significantly affect muscle performance and metabolism. This process requires concerted regulation of myofiber-specific isoforms of sarcomeric and calcium regulatory proteins that couple action potentials to the generation of contractile force. Here, we identify Sox6 as a fast myofiber-enriched repressor of slow muscle gene expression in vivo. Mice lacking Sox6 specifically in skeletal muscle have an increased number of slow myofibers, elevated mitochondrial activity, and exhibit down-regulation of the fast myofiber gene program, resulting in enhanced muscular endurance. In addition, microarray profiling of Sox6 knockout muscle revealed extensive muscle fiber-type remodeling, and identified numerous genes that display distinctive fiber-type enrichment. Sox6 directly represses the transcription of slow myofiber-enriched genes by binding to conserved cis-regulatory elements. These results identify Sox6 as a robust regulator of muscle contractile phenotype and metabolism, and elucidate a mechanism by which functionally related muscle fiber-type specific gene isoforms are collectively controlled.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aaction potentials 3acalcium 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ametabolism 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amuscles 3aphenotype 3aphysiological response 3aregulatory proteins 3aregulatory sequences 3arepressor proteins 3askeletal muscle1 aVoelker, Kevin A.1 aPei, Jimin1 aGrishin, Nick V.1 aGrange, Robert W.1 aBassel-Duby, Rhonda1 aOlson, Eric N.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 21, v. 108, no. 25 p.10196-10201dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11074131083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aOther US 7aarticle02320naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002300184245011000207300002000317506007600337520084100413506003701254650001401291650001101305650001501316650002201331650002101353650001401374650001101388650000701399650002301406650001201429650001701441700002101458700002501479700002201504700002201526773017601548852000901724856008301733939003301816946001301849655001201862IND4459340120221207045525.0110625e20110621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445934012DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11065451082doi7 aPMC31218072pmcid7 a216465362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPijpers, Joep J.H.10aLight-induced water oxidation at silicon electrodes functionalized with a cobalt oxygen-evolving catalyst  ap. 10056-10061.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIntegrating a silicon solar cell with a recently developed cobalt-based water-splitting catalyst (Co-Pi) yields a robust, monolithic, photo-assisted anode for the solar fuels process of water splitting to O₂ at neutral pH. Deposition of the Co-Pi catalyst on the Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)-passivated p-side of a np-Si junction enables the majority of the voltage generated by the solar cell to be utilized for driving the water-splitting reaction. Operation under neutral pH conditions fosters enhanced stability of the anode as compared to operation under alkaline conditions (pH 14) for which long-term stability is much more problematic. This demonstration of a simple, robust construct for photo-assisted water splitting is an important step towards the development of inexpensive direct solar-to-fuel energy conversion technologies.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3aelectrodes 3aenergy conversion 3aindium tin oxide 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3aphotovoltaic cells 3asilicon 3asolar energy1 aWinkler, Mark T.1 aSurendranath, Yogesh1 aBuonassisi, Tonio1 aNocera, Daniel G.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 21, v. 108, no. 25 p.10056-10061dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11065451083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aOther US 7aarticle02441naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001800184245008400202300002000286506007600306520096900382506003701351650000901388650001701397650001201414650001101426650001601437650001601453651001201469700001501481700001901496700002101515700002001536700001801556700001901574700002001593700001901613700002501632773017601657852000901833856008301842939003301925946001301958655001201971IND4459530720221207065942.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11066381082doi7 aPMC31278842pmcid7 a216465212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerring, Reid10aEarliest human occupations at Dmanisi (Georgian Caucasus) dated to 1.85-1.78 Ma  ap. 10432-10436.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe early Pleistocene colonization of temperate Eurasia by Homo erectus was not only a significant biogeographic event but also a major evolutionary threshold. Dmanisi's rich collection of hominin fossils, revealing a population that was small-brained with both primitive and derived skeletal traits, has been dated to the earliest Upper Matuyama chron (ca. 1.77 Ma). Here we present archaeological and geologic evidence that push back Dmanisi's first occupations to shortly after 1.85 Ma and document repeated use of the site over the last half of the Olduvai subchron, 1.85-1.78 Ma. These discoveries show that the southern Caucasus was occupied repeatedly before Dmanisi's hominin fossil assemblage accumulated, strengthening the probability that this was part of a core area for the colonization of Eurasia. The secure age for Dmanisi's first occupations reveals that Eurasia was probably occupied before Homo erectus appears in the East African fossil record.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHomo 3abiogeography 3afossils 3ahumans 3aoccupations 3aprobability 3aEurasia1 aOms, Oriol1 aAgustí, Jordi1 aBerna, Francesco1 aNioradze, Medea1 aShelia, Teona1 aTappen, Martha1 aVekua, Abesalom1 aZhvania, David1 aLordkipanidze, David0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10432-10436dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11066381083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle01510naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245011900170300001600289520049600305653001700801653002400818653001300842653001700855653002200872653002200894700002400916773011800940852000901058856008501067930003301152946001101185655001201196IND4433955520221119095009.0100313e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443395552DNAL7 a10.1007/s00422-010-0369-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSichert, Andreas B. 10aHow stimulus shape affects lateral-line perception: analytical approach to analyze natural stimuli characteristics  ap. 177-180.  aWe revisit the method of conformal mapping and apply it to the setting found in mechanosensory detection systems such as the lateral-line system of fish.

Both BBS patients and several BBS mouse models exhibit impaired olfactory function. To explore the nature of olfactory defects in BBS, a genetic ablation of the mouse Bbs8 gene that incorporates a fluorescent reporter protein was created. The endogenous BBS8 protein and reporter are particularly abundant in olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs), and specific BBS8 antibodies reveal staining in the dendritic knob in a shell-like structure that surrounds the basal bodies. Bbs8-null mice have reduced olfactory responses to a number of odorants, and immunohistochemical analyses reveal a near-complete loss of cilia from OSNs and mislocalization of proteins normally enriched in cilia. To visualize altered protein localization in OSNs, we generated a SLP3eGFP knock-in mouse and imaged the apical epithelium, including dendritic knobs and proximal cilia, in ex vivo tissue preparations. Additionally, protein reagents that reflect the characteristic neuronal activity of each OSN revealed altered activity in Bbs8-null cells. In addition to previously known defects at the ciliary border, we also observed aberrant targeting of OSN axons to the olfactory bulb; axons expressing the same receptor display reduced fasciculation and project to multiple targets in the olfactory bulb. We suggest that loss of BBS8 leads to a dramatic and variable reduction in cilia, the essential signaling platform for olfaction, which alters the uniformity of responses in populations of OSNs expressing the same receptor, thereby contributing to the observed axon-targeting defects.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3aaxons 3acilia 3aepithelium 3aetiology 3afluorescence 3agenes 3ahuman diseases 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amice 3aodor compounds 3aolfactory bulb 3apatients 3aproteins 3asensory neurons 3asmell 3astaining1 aKulaga, Heather M.1 aMay-Simera, Helen L.1 aKelley, Matthew W.1 aKatsanis, Nicholas1 aReed, Randall R.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 21, v. 108, no. 25 p.10320-10325dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.10165311083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110625  aOther US 7aarticle02484naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245015000133300001600283520114400299650002101443650002701464650003201491650001101523650002501534650001001559650001401569650002501583650001101608650001701619650001201636650002601648650001301674650002401687650001501711650001801726653001301744653001001757653002701767700001401794700001601808700001701824700001801841773009001859852000901949939003301958946001101991655001202002IND9004945820221119094802.0901005e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900494582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstrada-Garcia, T.10aEncystment of Pythium aphanidermatum zoospores is induced by root mucilage polysaccharides, pectin and a monoclonal antibody to a surface antigen  ap. 693-699.  aThe infection of roots by the pathogenic Oomycete Pythium aphanidermatum involves interactions between the fungal zoospores and root surface mucilage polysaccharides. After initial recognition at the root surface the zoospores are triggered to encyst during which adhesive glycoproteins are secreted followed by a fibrillar cyst wall. In this paper a simple in vitro assay has been used to assess the ability of a variety of macromolecules to induce zoospore encystment. Mucilage polysaccharides of the cress root surface trigger encystment. Whole mucilage was fractionated by gel filtration and a fraction low in uronic acid, containing 5% fucose, was shown to be more effective in triggering encystment than a uronic acid-rich fraction. Encystment can also be induced by commercial pectin. The lectin Con A, and PA1, one of a range of monoclonal antibodies specific for zoospore surface antigens, also triggered encystment. In Western blotting experiments PA1 recognizes protein epitopes of a 75 kDa surface antigen. The results suggest that at least one mechanism of zoospore triggering may involve a specific zoospore surface receptor. 3aLepidium sativum 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aspores 3adevelopmental stages 3aroots 3amucilages 3achemical composition 3afucose 3auronic acids 3apectins 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aantigens 3asingle cell protein 3acell walls 3apathogenicity 0ain vitro 0acysts 0acell surface receptors1 aRay, T.C.1 aGreen, J.R.1 aCallow, J.A.1 aKennedy, J.F.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 June, v. 41, no. 227 p.693-699x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02311naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008500129300001600214520117800230650002501408650001001433650001201443650001501455650001301470650002801483650000701511650002001518650002801538650002101566650002201587653001601609653001001625653001901635653002301654653002001677653003301697700001601730773009001746852000901836939003301845946001101878655001201889IND9004946020221119094858.0901005e199006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900494602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEcheverria, E.10aSucrose breakdown in relation to fruit growth of acid lime (Citrus aurantifolia)  ap. 705-708.  aThe physiological capacity for sucrose breakdown in developing juice sac cells of acid limes was estimated by assaying the activity of the three enzymes of sucrose catabolism in addition to vacuolar acid hydrolysis. The maximum potential rates of sucrose breakdown were compared with the observed rates of carbon utilization. Highest potential rates of sucrose breakdown (28.621 mmol cm-3 per hydrated active space d-1) occurred at the initial stages of fruit development where carbon utilization was highest. As the fruit developed, the potential rates of sucrose breakdown and carbon utilization declined to very low levels. At 80% of development, vacuolar acid hydrolysis became the only physiological mechanism for sucrose breakdown. The relatively low amounts of sucrose hydrolysed by acid hydrolysis at this time were just sufficient to account for the measured carbon demands. The results suggest that carbon supplied by this distinct sucrose catabolizing system is able to provide adequate levels of carbon skeletons for the observed levels of respiration and dry weight deposition early in development, but becomes a limiting factor for growth in the later stages. 3aCitrus aurantiifolia 3acells 3asucrose 3ahydrolysis 3avacuoles 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3aenzyme activity 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3asucrose synthase 3aplant development 0agrowth rate 0afruit 0aacid invertase 0aalkaline invertase 0ajuice sac cells 0ahydrated active tissue space1 aBurns, J.K.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g1990 June, v. 41, no. 227 p.705-708x0022-09577nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02607naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002200128245010900150300001800259520130700277650002101584650000901605650001401614650001001628650001801638650005601656650002501712650001201737650004001749650002401789650001301813650004501826650005301871650000901924650006201933650004301995650001002038773008202048852000902130939003302139946001302172655001202185IND9004925320221119094743.0901004e199009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900492532DNAL7 a21689442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdwards, H.M.

The basal diet used is low in calcium, high in phosphorus and chlorine and is known to promote a high incidence of tibial dyschondroplasia. The chicks received ultraviolet radiation from fluorescent lights in addition to 1100 ICU/kg (27.5 micrograms/kg) of D3 in the basal diet. Supplementation of the diet with 10 micrograms/kg of all the metabolites except 24R,25-(OH)2D3 significantly lowered the incidence and severity of tibial dyschondroplasia and increased bone ash when compared to birds receiving the basal diet. None of the active D3 metabolites was effective when fed at 0.1 or 1.0 micrograms/kg of diet. Two active compounds tested [1,25-(OH)2D3 and 1,24R,25-(OH)3D3] and 5 micrograms/kg of diet were effective in reducing either the incidence or severity of tibial dyschondroplasia. 3abroiler chickens 3adiet 3avitamin D 3atibia 3abone diseases 2a24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3xadministration & dosage 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aCalcitriolxadministration & dosage 2aCalciumxmetabolism 2aChickens 2aCholecalciferolxadministration & dosage 2aHydroxycholecalciferolsxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aOsteochondrodysplasiasxprevention & controlxveterinary. 2aPoultry Diseasesxprevention & control 2aTibia0 tJournal of nutrition.g1990 Sept., v. 120, no. 9 p.1054-1061x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02064naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007600203300002000279506007600299520083100375506003701206650001701243650001501260650002101275650001301296650001301309700001501322700001701337700002201354773017601376852000901552856008301561939003301644946001301677655001201690IND4459531420221207064616.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953142DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11012751082doi7 aPMC31278742pmcid7 a216702602pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLim, Jung Chae10aMethionine sulfoxide reductase A is a stereospecific methionine oxidase  ap. 10472-10477.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMethionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) catalyzes the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine and is specific for the S epimer of methionine sulfoxide. The enzyme participates in defense against oxidative stresses by reducing methionine sulfoxide residues in proteins back to methionine. Because oxidation of methionine residues is reversible, this covalent modification could also function as a mechanism for cellular regulation, provided there exists a stereospecific methionine oxidase. We show that MsrA itself is a stereospecific methionine oxidase, producing S-methionine sulfoxide as its product. MsrA catalyzes its own autooxidation as well as oxidation of free methionine and methionine residues in peptides and proteins. When functioning as a reductase, MsrA fully reverses the oxidations which it catalyzes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aautoxidation 3amethionine 3aoxidative stress 3apeptides 3aproteins1 aYou, Zheng1 aKim, Geumsoo1 aLevine, Rodney L.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10472-10477dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11012751083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02905naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245007700210300002000287506007600307520137100383506003701754650002601791650001601817650001301833650002201846650001001868650001601878650001301894650001301907650001801920650001401938650002701952700002101979700002402000700002002024700001902044700002102063700002502084773017602109852000902285856008302294939003302377946001302410655001202423IND4459531820221207064613.0110701e20110628xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445953182DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.11034741082doi7 aPMC31279232pmcid7 a216702522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVázquez-Laslop, Nora10aRole of antibiotic ligand in nascent peptide-dependent ribosome stalling  ap. 10496-10501.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSpecific nascent peptides in the ribosome exit tunnel can elicit translation arrest. Such ribosome stalling is used for regulation of expression of some bacterial and eukaryotic genes. The stalling is sensitive to additional cellular cues, most commonly the binding of specific small-molecular-weight cofactors to the ribosome. The role of cofactors in programmed translation arrest is unknown. By analyzing nascent peptide- and antibiotic-dependent ribosome stalling that controls inducible expression of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria, we have found that the antibiotic is directly recognized as a part of the translation modulating signal. Even minute structural alterations preclude it from assisting in ribosome stalling, indicating the importance of precise molecular interactions of the drug with the ribosome. One of the sensors that monitor the structure of the antibiotic is the 23S rRNA residue C2610, whose mutation reduces the efficiency of nascent peptide- and antibiotic-dependent ribosome stalling. These findings establish a new paradigm of the role of the cofactor in programmed translation arrest in which a small molecule is recognized along with specific nascent peptide sequences as a composite structure that provokes arrest of translation. A similar mechanism could be used by the ribosome to sense a variety of cellular metabolites.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abacteria 3adrug interactions 3agenes 3ametabolites 3amutation 3apeptides 3aribosomal RNA 3aribosomes 3atranslation (genetics)1 aKlepacki, Dorota1 aMulhearn, Debbie C.1 aRamu, Haripriya1 aKrasnykh, Olga1 aFranzblau, Scott1 aMankin, Alexander S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 June 28, v. 108, no. 26 p.10496-10501dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11034741083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02152naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245005000166300001600216520112400232650001401356650001301370650002201383653002501405653003701430653002101467653002301488700002101511700001901532773011601551852000901667856009201676930003301768946001301801655001201814IND4395540720221119093251.0070930e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439554072DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00312.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBooth, W.10aPolyandry by wood mice in natural populations  ap. 176-182.  aMultiple paternity was investigated for the first time in natural populations of the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus. Thirteen females and their respective litters sampled within distinct habitats, seasons and years were screened for eight microsatellite loci. Allelic variation was compared with a dataset comprising 307 adult mice collected from the same source populations as pregnant females. Multiple paternity was unambiguously identified in seven litters (53.8%). In each case, a minimum of two or three male parents were involved. Populations of A. sylvaticus inhabiting the northern latitudes of the species range are characterized by annual cycles of abundance during which numbers can fluctuate by several orders of magnitude. Hence, the discovery of multiple paternity within litters sampled between May and July (high and low densities, respectively) in all years suggests that polyandry maximizes genetic diversity of the litter and, hence, survival of some of the offspring through such cycles. The results indicate that polyandry is a common mode of reproduction within wild populations of A. sylvaticus. 3apolyandry 3aApodemus 3asperm competition 0areproductive success 0amicrosatellite genetic diversity 0apopulation cycle 0amultiple paternity1 aMontgomery, W.I.1 aProdöhl, P.A.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 Oct., v. 273, no. 2 p.176-182dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00312.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02832naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245004000168300001400208520196300222653001802185653002302203653002502226653001502251653001402266773011502280852000902395856009202404930003302496946001302529655001202542IND4394778220221119093226.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439477822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00300.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBürger, M.10aSperm dumping in a haplogyne spider  ap. 74-81.  aThe present study shows that females of Silhouettella loricatula (Arachnida: Araneae: Oonopidae) manage to process sperm in an unusual and previously unknown way. The male ejaculate consisting of spermatozoa and globular secretion is enclosed in a secretory sac. This may avoid the mixing of sperm from different males and at least severely limit sperm competition. The process of sperm enclosure occurs within the female's sperm storage site (receptaculum) as the ejaculate is not surrounded by a sac inside the male's sperm-transferring organs (palpal bulbs). The secretion forming the sac is produced by glands adjoining the receptaculum. The possibility that globular secretions in the male palpal bulbs partly contribute to the sac cannot be ruled out completely. It is suggested that in S. loricatula, the main function of sperm enclosure in a sac is enabling females to dump the ejaculate of a male. The present study represents the first report on sperm dumping in the family Oonopidae. During five first and three second copulations in the laboratory, the dumping of a sac was observed. One dumped sac was sectioned and contained spermatozoa. Two couples were flash-fixed with liquid nitrogen early during copulation, which revealed the mechanism of the sac dumping. By muscle contractions, the receptaculum is bent backwards and the sac moved into the genital opening. The actual sac dumping occurs most probably in cooperation with the male, which moves his pedipalps rhythmically during the entire copulation. Extensions and furrows on the emboli suggest that they may additionally be used as copulatory courtship devices. The enclosure of sperm from the current male in secretion takes place during or immediately following copulation as all mated females sacrificed after copulation had a new sac containing spermatozoa in the receptaculum. Dumping sperm of a previous male during the next copulation may allow females to bias sperm precedence. 0asperm dumping 0agenital morphology 0acopulatory courtship 0aHaplogynae 0aOonopidae0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 Sept., v. 273, no. 1 p.74-81dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00300.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02449naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011900171300001600290520134600306650002101652650001201673653001801685653002501703653002601728653003101754653002601785653002001811700001701831773011601848852000901964856009201973930003302065946001302098655001202111IND4392597420221119093136.0070624e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439259742DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00270.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhiteman, E.A.10aNo barriers to fertilization between sympatric colour morphs in the marine species flock Hypoplectrus (Serranidae)  ap. 305-310.  aAssortative mate choice is, so far, the only demonstrated isolating barrier between colour morphs in fish species flocks, such as freshwater cichlids and marine hamlets, suggesting an important role for sexual selection in speciation. However, there has been little consideration of post-copulatory mechanisms that are known to influence reproductive isolation in other taxa. Selective pressures through a cost to hybrid matings, or genetic drift, may lead to the evolution of fertilization barriers through gamete incompatability. In cases of incipient speciation, such as the hamlets, complete fertilization blocks may not have evolved. Instead, differential fertilization between species may reduce the success of interspecific fertilizations. We examined the fertilization dynamics of sympatric Hypoplectrus nigricans (black hamlet) and Hypoplectrus puella (barred hamlet). Experimental crosses were performed to score fertilization success in within-morph and between-morph crosses. Fertilization success did not differ between self-fertilized, within-morph or between-morph crosses. We therefore found no evidence of post-mating barriers through sperm:egg incompatibilities and potential for self-fertilization. Our results are consistent with a mechanism of colour morph divergence based on sexually selected morph mating preferences. 3asexual selection 3aselfing 0acolour morphs 0asympatric speciation 0apost-zygotic barriers 0asimultaneous hermaphrodite 0afertilization success 0acoral reef fish1 aGage, M.J.G.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 July, v. 272, no. 3 p.305-310dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00270.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070624b20070702c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02325naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245005900167300001600226520127100242650000901513650001901522653003101541653002901572653001901601700001801620700001901638700001901657700002001676700001601696773011601712852000901828856009201837930003301929946001301962655001201975IND4392597620221119093211.0070624e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439259762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00273.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVitt, L.J.10aLiving with your food: geckos in termitaria of Cantão  ap. 321-328.  aWe tested three non-exclusive hypotheses that the lizard, Gymnodactylus carvalhoi, lives in termitaria to avoid thermal extremes, to avoid predators, or because of an abundance of food (dietary specialist). We first confirm that these geckos are restricted to termitaria in the region studied. Body temperatures (Tb) of geckos averaged below environmental temperatures during day outside of termitaria and above outside temperatures at night; Tb averaged only slightly higher than temperatures inside termitaria. We conclude that thermal constraints in Cerrado habitats lacking rocks restrict Gymnodactylus to termite nests. High frequencies of tail loss and the presence of many potential predators within termitaria suggest high encounter rates with predators, indicating that predation pressure does not restrict these geckos to termite nests. Dietary data indicate that G. carvalhoi is a termite specialist. Published data indicate that other Gymnodactylus species and populations are also termite specialists, even though several live primarily outside termitaria (in crevices and under rocks). An evolutionary history of termite specialization and low thermal requirements in the clade (Gymnodactylus) predispose them to feed on termites within the termitaria. 3adiet 3atermite mounds 0aectotherm thermoregulation 0amicrohabitat specificity 0alizard ecology1 aShepard, D.B.1 aCaldwell, J.P.1 aVieira, G.H.C.1 aFrança, F.G.R.1 aColli, G.R.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 July, v. 272, no. 3 p.321-328dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00273.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070624b20070702c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02813naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245010300167300001500270520179500285650002202080650002502102650002402127653002302151653002602174700001702200700001902217773011602236852000902352856009202361930003302453946001302486655001202499IND4394778620221119093317.0070906e200709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439477862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00304.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPoulin, B.14aThe invasive red swamp crayfish as a predictor of Eurasian bittern density in the Camargue, France  ap. 98-105.  aFew data exist on the relationships between food levels and breeding density of the Eurasian bittern Botaurus stellaris, a vulnerable species of high-priority concern in Europe. Concurrent data were obtained on male bittern density and relative food abundance over a 3-year period in two wetlands totalling 2500 ha of Mediterranean reed marsh enclosing 25% of the French bittern population. Food abundance was estimated by sampling up to 25 hydrological units using a beach seine in early June of 2002, 2003 and 2004. The density of booming males in each hydrological unit was obtained by point counts and acoustic triangulation in May of the same years. The impact of food abundance on male bittern density was assessed by general regression models using a forward stepwise procedure with mosquitofish Gambusia affinis, carp Cyprinus carpio, other fish species, amphibians, red swamp crayfish Procambarus clarkii and other invertebrates as prey groups. Of these, only to crayfish abundance was bittern density related, contributing to 45% of the variance observed. When the impact of water level was taken into account, the relative abundance of crayfish explained 56% of the inter-annual differences in bittern density. Because crayfish are rich in calcium and well adapted to fluctuating hydroperiods alternating with drought intervals, they provide a good food source for the bitterns throughout the breeding season at the study sites. The loss of diversity and degradation reported from macrophyte-dominated marshes following crayfish invasion does not seem to apply to reed-dominated wetlands. It is further suggested that the recent increase in bittern numbers in the Camargue, while other French populations were decreasing, could in part be related to red swamp crayfish abundance. 3afood availability 3aPhragmites australis 3aProcambarus clarkii 0aBotaurus stellaris 0aMediterranean wetland1 aLefebvre, G.1 aCrivelli, A.J.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 Sept., v. 273, no. 1 p.98-105dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00304.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02779naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245008300171300001400254520177300268650001602041653002602057653002302083653000902106653002502115700001902140700001602159773016102175852000902336856007602345930003302421946001102454655001202465IND4390487620221119093439.0070416e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439048762DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00245.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBumrungsri, S.10aReproduction in the short-nosed fruit bat in relation to environmental factors  ap. 73-81.  aThe reproductive pattern of the short-nosed fruit bat Cynopterus brachyotis in a tropical dry evergreen rainforest in Thailand (13°N) is characterized by seasonal bimodal polyoestry with postpartum oestrus. The first lactation period occurred in March-April, but the timing of the second varied between years: September-October in 1998 and July-August in 1999. Females may experience reproductive delays after the second parturition. Females attained sexual maturity at 6-7 months of age and gave birth for the first time at about 11-12 months, and are able to produce two young a year. Females born in April gave birth as early as March the following year. Those born in August-September first gave birth in July-August the following year. Males attained sexual maturity when they were a year old. Testis size was significantly positively correlated with photoperiod. The body weight of mature males varied cyclically, was higher during breeding periods and was significantly correlated with testis size. The first parturition coincided with the onset of the annual rains and the second occurred in the middle of the rainy season. Both lactation and weaning periods correspond with high food availability. A significantly higher percentage of reproductive females, earlier parturition, greater synchrony of lactation, higher body mass of lactating females, more abundant, larger and heavier juveniles, and heavier mature males were recorded in 1999 compared with 1998. The El Niño Southern Oscillation resulted in a prolonged and severe drought early in 1998, and induced mast fruiting in 1999 that led to higher reproductive success. Photoperiod may regulate the reproductive rhythm in male C. brachyotis, although experimental studies are required to verify this. 3aphotoperiod 0aCynopterus brachyotis 0abimodal polyoestry 0aENSO 0areproductive success1 aBumrungsri, W.1 aRacey, P.A.0 tJournal of zoology proceedings of the Zoological Society of London.g2007 May, v. 272, no. 1 p.73-81dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00245.x3electronic resource  a20070416b20070502c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01982naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245007900167300001600246520101200262650000901274650002701283650001901310653001301329653002601342653002301368700001401391773011601405852000901521856009201530930003301622946001301655655001201668IND4396313020221119093331.0071021e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439631302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00321.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYork, H.A.10aLimiting similarity and species assemblages in the short-tailed fruit bats  ap. 249-256.  aWe analyzed the morphometrics of seven taxa of short-tailed fruit bats Chiroptera: Phyllostomidae: Carollia, (Carollia benkeithi, Carollia brevicauda, Carollia castanea, Carollia perspicillata azteca, Carollia perspicillata perspicillata, Carollia sowelli and Carollia subrufa) to assess within-taxon variation and to address the possibility that morphological distinctions facilitate sympatry within this genus of ecologically similar bats.

Rapid sexing of sooty terns in the field could be crucial in advancing our understanding of their reproductive biology, and in promoting conservation. However, sooty tern males and females are identical in their plumage and, thus, difficult to sex in the field. Morphometric measurements were taken from 63 adult sooty terns breeding on Ascension Island in 2005. A small blood sample was taken from the brachial vein to determine the bird's sex using standard PCR-based molecular techniques. Males were consistently larger in all morphometric measurements than females but considerable overlap between the sexes resulted in no single measurement being a useful discriminator of sex. A principal components analysis on a correlation matrix of seven morphometric measurements indicated that the first principal component (PC1) was a good 'body size' axis explaining 40.5% of the variance in the original matrix. The suite of head measurements all had high character loadings on PC1 and were, therefore, good indicators of the body size of sooty terns. Tarsus length and wing length were less reliable predictors of sex. Discriminant analyses revealed that a disciminant function incorporating head measurements and wing length allowed 77.8% of sooty terns to be sexed correctly based upon morphometric measurements alone. Further morphometric approaches to sexing should be explored with sooty terns captured in subsequent years. 3asex determination analysis 0aAscension Island 0aPCR 0amorphometric 0asexing 0aseabird colony 0aOnychoprion fuscata1 aMartin, G.R.1 aWallace, L.L.1 aWearn, C.P.1 aHughes, B.J.0 tJournal of zoology.g2008 Jan., v. 274, no. 1 p.2-8dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00350.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02901naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011400172300001600286520190700302650001902209650002102228653001902249653002902268653001902297700002002316773011602336852000902452856009202461930003302553946001302586655001202599IND4395540520221119093500.0070930e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439554052DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00322.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLourenço, S.I.10aCan mite parasitism affect the condition of bat hosts? Implications for the social structure of colonial bats  ap. 161-168.  aEctoparasitism may be recognized as one of the main costs of coloniality, but little is known about how it affects the fitness and social structure of bats, the most gregarious of mammals. We studied these issues using the colonial bat Miniopterus schreibersii and its haematophagous parasitic mite Spinturnix psi as a model. Body condition is an important indicator of individual fitness that is potentially affected by ectoparasitism. Thus, we measured host body condition and mite loads in a total of 969 bats throughout the annual cycle. Mites were rare while hosts hibernated, increased in abundance in spring and peaked during nursing season of bats, when they were particularly abundant on lactating females and young bats. This strong seasonal variation in mite loads is related to the reproductive cycle of mites, which in turn appears to be synchronized with the reproductive cycle of their hosts. Mite loads and the condition of bats were negatively correlated, and information available suggests that this may be due to an effect of parasitism, although other possible causes for this trend cannot be excluded. However, a negative correlation was only observed during the bat's nursing season, when mites were most abundant, and heavily parasitized bats lost about 10% of their weight. Mite parasitism did not seem to be a significant disadvantage of coloniality, except in nurseries, where it might impose some costs. However, as females and young usually aggregate in these colonies, we presume that for them such costs are probably offset by advantages of group living. Adult males, however, are usually absent from nurseries, which may be a strategy to minimize mite parasitism. Overall, the results suggest that ectoparasitism may play a role in determining the social structure of M. schreibersii and of many other temperate bats that have similar life cycles and ectoparasitic loads. 3abody condition 3asocial structure 0aectoparasitism 0aMiniopterus schreibersii 0aSpinturnix psi1 aPalmeirim, J.M.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 Oct., v. 273, no. 2 p.161-168dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00322.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02685naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001300152245009000165300001600255520166400271650001201935651001201947653001901959653002001978653003801998653002402036653002102060700001502081773011602096852000902212856009202221930003302313946001302346655001202359IND4392596720221119093412.0070624e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439259672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00282.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRink, M.10aRadio-telemetric monitoring of dispersing stag beetles: implications for conservation  ap. 235-243.  aMigratory movements of the endangered stag beetles Lucanus cervus (18 males, 38 females) were monitored radio-telemetrically for three reproductive periods (2003-2005). The aim of the study was to estimate the migratory range of free-ranging individuals as a measure of connectivity among neighbouring populations for future conservation measures. Miniature transmitters of c. 350 mg (battery life: 10-15 days) were attached externally to the pronotum. Transmitter/beetle mass ratio was 12.8% on average (7.1-28.0%). Male dispersal behaviour consisted of frequent flights directed to sites with reproductive females and rarely of on-ground movement. Total displacement distance recorded was up to 2065 m, the maximum distance of a single flight being 1720 m. Flights always began at elevated structures such as trees and shrubs and took place in an air temperature range of 11-27°C. Within this range, temperature did not influence flight distance. Female dispersal behaviour consisted mostly of a single flight, followed by mating and consequent ground movements towards oviposition sites. Total displacement distance recorded was up to 762.6 m, the maximum distance of a single flight being 701 m. Climatic constraints of flights were the same as in males. Modelling the dispersal behaviour suggests that about 1% of males are capable of maintaining gene flux among nest sites within a radius of about 3 km. However, the colonization of new nest sites depends on the dispersal ability of females and amounts to less than 1 km. Thus, isolated populations (distance to the next population greater than 3 km) have an increased probability of local extinction. 3aweather 3aGermany 0aLucanus cervus 0aradio telemetry 0aconnectivity of local populations 0adispersal threshold 0aflight behaviour1 aSinsch, U.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 July, v. 272, no. 3 p.235-243dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00282.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070624b20070702c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02993naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245009400173300001600267520189300283650002502176653002302201653002502224653002502249653004102274653002102315653002002336653002002356700001602376773011602392852000902508856009202517930003302609946001302642655001202655IND4395541220221119093354.0070930e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439554122DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00338.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacFarlane, A.M.10aSexual segregation in western grey kangaroos: testing alternative evolutionary hypotheses  ap. 220-228.  aIn sexually dimorphic ungulates, sexual segregation is hypothesized to have evolved because of sex-specific differences in body size and/or reproductive strategies. We tested these alternative hypotheses in kangaroos, which are ecological analogues of ungulates. Kangaroos exhibit a wide range of body sizes, particularly among mature males, and so the effects of body size and sex can be distinguished. We tested predictions derived from these hypotheses by comparing the distribution of three sex-sex size classes of western grey kangaroos Macropus fuliginosus, in different habitats, and the composition of groups of kangaroos, across seasons. In accordance with the predation risk-reproductive strategy hypothesis, during the non-breeding season, females, which were more susceptible to predation than larger males, and were accompanied by vulnerable young-at-foot, were over-represented in secure habitats. Large males, which were essentially immune to predation, occurred more often than expected in nutrient-rich habitat, and small males, which faced competing demands of predator avoidance and feeding, were intermediate between females and large males in their distribution across habitats. During the breeding season, females continued to be over-represented in secure habitats when their newly emerged pouch young were most vulnerable to predation. All males occupied these same habitats to maximize their chances of securing mates. Consistent with the social hypotheses, groups composed of individuals of the same sex, irrespective of body size, were over-represented in the population during the non-breeding season, while during the breeding season all males sought females so that mixed-sex groups predominated. These results indicate that body size and reproductive strategies are both important, yet independent, factors influencing segregation in western grey kangaroos. 3apsychosocial factors 0asexual segregation 0aMacropus fuliginosus 0abody size dimorphism 0apredation risk-reproductive strategy 0aforage selection 0aactivity budget 0asocial affinity1 aCoulson, G.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 Oct., v. 273, no. 2 p.220-228dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00338.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070930b20071002c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02759naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245009300166300001600259520175400275653002102029653001102050653001202061653002502073653001702098653001602115653002502131700001402156773011602170852000902286856009202295930003302387946001302420655001202433IND4392596920221119093420.0070624e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439259692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabib, B.14aDen shifting by wolves in semi-wild landscapes in the Deccan Plateau, Maharashtra, India  ap. 259-265.  aReproductive success is crucial for the survival and persistence of any species. The Deccan Biogeographic Zone of India is the stronghold of a population of the Indian wolf Canis lupus pallipes. Gaining a better understanding of the den-use pattern of wolves in different areas in this zone is thus vital for their conservation and management. The wolves excavated multiple dens in our study sites and kept shifting their litters among them. Major disturbance factors around denning sites were active stone quarries, traffic, crop harvesting and livestock movement. One wolf pack used 14 dens in four breeding seasons. Discriminant function analysis indicated that den shifting by wolves was not entirely governed by disturbance levels at den sites. Increasing age of pups was one of the main factors associated with den shifting rather than the magnitude of disturbance (χ²=34.26, d.f.=12, P<0.001). Tolerance to disturbance around dens during the early stages of pup development was negatively correlated (r=-0.519, P<0.05) with availability of water and age of pups (r=-0.613, P<0.01). Excavation of multiple dens by wolves was apparently related to den shifting, which seemingly is a survival strategy of wolves in these semi-wild human-dominated landscapes in the Deccan Biogeographic Zone. Principal components analysis indicated that during the initial stages of pup development, nature of the land, den orientation and distance of the den from roads were important cues in addition to age category of pups for den shifting. The analysis also suggested that factors such as distance of the new den where pups are to be transferred, distance from water source and availability of fox Vulpes bengalensis holes for den use were also important. 0amultiple denning 0aDeccan 0apup age 0aCanis lupus pallipes 0aden shifting 0adisturbance 0areproductive success1 aKumar, S.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 July, v. 272, no. 3 p.259-265dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00265.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070624b20070702c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02755naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245006900169300001600238520178700254650001802041650000802059653000902067653001102076653002602087700001302113700002202126700001802148773011602166852000902282856009202291930003302383946001302416655001202429IND4393378220221119093043.0070722e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439337822DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00278.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcKenzie, J.10aGrowth strategies of New Zealand fur seals in southern Australia  ap. 377-389.  aPost-weaning growth of male and female New Zealand fur seals Arctocephalus forsteri was examined using morphometric measurements from a cross-sectional sample of 326 females and 88 males captured between 2000 and 2003 on Kangaroo Island, South Australia. The age of each animal was estimated through examination of growth layer groups in the cementum of a postcanine tooth, which was removed from each seal. Females ranged in age from 1.5 to 23.4 years and males from 1.5 to 16.7 years. Gompertz and two-component logistic growth models were used to predict sex-specific growth patterns in body length and mass and to compare growth strategies. During the non-breeding season, physically mature adult males were on average 1.2 times longer and 2.2 times heavier than adult females. Sexual size dimorphism was most apparent after the age of 5-7 years, when differences in predicted growth rates were most evident. Post-weaning growth in females was predicted to be monophasic, characterized by high growth rates in length and mass during the juvenile growth stage, followed by a gradual decline in growth rates after reproductive maturity. In contrast, growth in males was predicted to be biphasic, with an apparent secondary growth spurt in both length and mass that coincided with sexual and social maturation, followed by a rapid decline in growth rates after social maturity. However, the number of males sampled between 9 and 10 years was low and is likely to have biased growth rates for sub-adults to some degree. Females were predicted to continue to gain body mass over a number of years following reproductive maturity, whereas adult males appeared to trade off further somatic growth with a marked seasonal accumulation and loss of mass in relation to the breeding season. 3aArctocephalus 3aage 0asize 0agrowth 0areproductive maturity1 aPage, B.1 aGoldsworthy, S.D.1 aHindell, M.A.0 tJournal of zoology.g2007 Aug., v. 272, no. 4 p.377-389dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00278.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20070722b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02034naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245008200168300001600250520107800266653001601344653002101360653002201381653001401403700001701417773016401434852000901598856009301607930003301700946001101733655001201744IND4391590020221119093046.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439159002DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00249.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, C.R.10aActivity patterns of springhares from the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa  ap. 148-155.  aThe activity patterns of springhares Pedetes capensis (Rodentia: Pedetidae) from the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were investigated by counting the number of springhares active above ground at regular intervals throughout the night at different times of the year and under different weather conditions and phases of the moon. A combination of time of year, time of night and level of illumination best explained springhare activity, accounting for 43% of the variation in springhare numbers. Springhare activity generally reached its peak soon after dark, thereafter remaining fairly constant throughout most of the night and only decreasing in the 2-4-h period before sunrise. On those nights when the moon either rose or set during the night, this pattern was modified by the level of illumination. Springhares responded to moonlight by reducing above-ground activity, shifting activity to dark, moonless periods of the night, and by reducing their use of open space. Except for extremes, other weather conditions had no significant effect on springhare activity. 0aspringhares 0aPedetes capensis 0aactivity patterns 0amoonlight1 aPeinke, D.M.0 tJournal of zoology proceedings of the Zoological Society of London.g2007 June, v. 272, no. 2 p.148-155dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2006.00249.x3Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01950naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245005300123300001400176500001500190520103800205650001401243650002001257650002401277650002301301650002401324650001501348651001001363653000801373653002001381653002001401653001601421653002101437773007701458852000901535939003301544946001101577655001201588IND9105382520221119093120.0920102e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910538252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTada, M.10aEconometric analysis of expected price formation  ap. 59-73.  a2019-12-04  aThe current report analyses the process of producers' expected price formation through the estimation of supply functions, using vegetables and green tea in Japan as an example. At first, theoretical analysis shows that the factors which transform the producers' expected price formation from the lagged expectation to the rational expectation are as follows: decrease in information price, increase in managerial ability and/or organizational innovation, rightward shift of supply curve, and increase in price elasticity in supply curve. Second, supply functions are estimated by using the price expectation formation which include the rational expectation and the lagged expectation as its extreme form. Consequently, producers' price expectations were found to approach the rational expectations in the case of Chinese cabbage, lettuce and green tea, whose supply curves show high price elasticities, and whose producers' organizations gather price information and monitor the production more than other crops taken in this paper. 3agreen tea 3aeconomic theory 3ademand elasticities 3aeconometric models 3aprofits and margins 3avegetables 3aJapan 0atea 0aprice formation 0aproducer prices 0aexpectation 0asupply functions0 tAgricultural economics.g1991 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.59-73x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01983naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007300125300001400198500003600212500001500248520102300263650002601286650002201312650001401334650001901348650001401367650001201381653002001393653002801413653001501441653001701456700001801473773007701491852000901568939003301577946001101610655001201621IND9105382620221119093134.0920102e199101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910538262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVoon, J.P.14aThe calculation of returns to research in distorted markets: comment  ap. 75-82.  aReply by J.F.

In this paper, the social returns from research in the presence of the price policies considered by Oehmke are reexamined using a simple geometric approach. The analysis suggests that an output subsidy in a small importing economy, an output subsidy in a closed economy, and a target price in a large exporting economy will -- on Oehmke's assumptions -- cause only small reductions in the internal rate of return from investment in research. This implies that the apparent underinvestment by governments in agricultural research cannot be explained away by a large upward bias, known to governments, in measured rates of return due to failure to account for interactions between research and the costs of price policy measures. 3aagricultural research 3acosts and returns 3aequations 3asupply balance 3asubsidies 3amarkets 0asocial benefits 0ainternal rate of return 0ainvestment 0aprice policy1 aEdwards, G.W.0 tAgricultural economics.g1991 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.75-82x0169-51507nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02567naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013900128300001600267500001500283520146700298650002401765650001501789650002301804650001601827650001401843650002501857651001001882651001901892651001301911651001201924651001901936653002101955653002601976653001802002653002202020773007202042852000902114939003302123946001302156655001202169IND9004909320221119093116.0901004e199007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900490932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhlman, E.G.10aFrequency of single-gall isolates of Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme with virulence toward three resistant loblolly pine families  ap. 614-617.  a2019-12-04  aBasidiospores from 11 of 19 aeciospore isolates of Cronartium quercuum f. sp. fusiforme derived from single galls were highly virulent on half-sib progeny of resistant loblolly pine selection 10-5 (family 10-5). Virulence was indicated by a high frequency of seedlings with galls (68-83%) 9 mo after inoculation compared to a normal frequency of 34-50% for the other isolates of this family. The high proportion of isolates with increased virulence toward progeny of 10-5 was unexpected because seedlings of this resistant selection have been widely planted with no evidence of breakdown in resistance, and the sources of the rust isolates were geographically distant from the original source of the 10-5 ortet. These isolates with virulence toward family 10-5 were common in North Carolina and Maryland, whereas the parent, 10-5, originated 400-775 km away in South Carolina. In contrast, only one of 77 isolates had virulence toward resistant family 11-20 in a second study. The one virulent isolate was from Colleton County, SC, which was the source of another isolate highly virulent toward family 11-20 in a previous test. In a third study, increased virulence toward resistant family 29R was confirmed in three of six isolates. One of these isolates came from a gall on a half-sib offspring of 29R.

This study examined the implications of capture on the water surface of meltwater and seawater for the local and long-range dispersal of Antarctic springtails. Individuals of the maritime Antarctic collembolan Cryptopygus antarcticus, were floated on tap water and seawater at 0, 5 and 10°C. LT₅₀s on seawater were 34 (10°C), 65 (5°C) and 75 (0°C) days. On tap water, LT₅₀s were 69 (10°C), 126 (5°C) and 239 (0°C) days. Less than 20% escaped from the water surface. A significantly greater proportion of springtails moulted on tap water and viable offspring were produced on both tap water and seawater. Comparison across treatments of survival of moulting and non-moulting individuals found significantly greater survival in moulting animals for three of the treatment combinations. It is suggested that moult exuviae facilitate survival on the water film through the simultaneous provision of a flotation aid and a source of nourishment - that is, an 'edible raft'. A separate experiment measuring changes in haemolymph osmolality over time on tap water and seawater at 2 and 5°C found significant differences in all treatments. Causes of mortality are discussed in relation to osmoregulatory failure and starvation. 3aCollembola 3aseawater 3amolting 3aosmolality 0arafting 0apassive dispersal 0amaritime Antarctic1 aWorland, M.R.1 aBale, J.S.1 aConvey, P.0 tJournal of zoology.g2008 Jan., v. 274, no. 1 p.44-50dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2007.00355.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20071223b20080102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02412naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008200123300001800205500001500223520110400238650001401342650001601356650001801372650001301390650003601403650002501439650002701464650001001491650001301501650001401514650002601528650002001554650001801574653002901592653001201621653002001633653002001653653003401673653001101707700001301718700001601731773011501747852000901862930003301871945001301904946001301917655001201930IND2056802720221123001200.0970430e199612  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205680272DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRong, Y.10aGinkgo biloba modulates glutathione redox cycle in vascular endothelial cells  ap. 1913-1923.  a2019-12-05  aWe recently reported that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) suppressed oxidative burst in macrophages and protected bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC) from oxidant injury. In this study the effects of GBE on glutathione (GSH) redox cycle and activity of antioxidant enzymes were investigated. Confluent monolayers of PAEC were incubated with GBE for 8-48 h, washed, and then lysed with Triton X-100. Biochemical assays were performed with the lysate. GBE caused both dose- and time-dependent increase in GSH level and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) reductase activity while GSH peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activity remained unaffected. Exposure of PAEC to an organic oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) resulted in decreased GSH level, increased lipid peroxidation, and elevated leakage of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase. Preincubation or simultaneous treatment of PAEC with GBE prevented these changes induced by tBHP. Our data suggest that the antioxidant effect of GBE may be due to its modulation of the GSH redox cycle in PAEC as well as direct scavenging of the oxidant. 3aperoxides 3aendothelium 3adose response 3aarteries 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aglutathione peroxidase 3acells 3aduration 3aoxidation 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aenzyme activity 3aGinkgo biloba 0atert-butyl hydroperoxide 0aleakage 0aredox reactions 0aoxidoreductases 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH) 0adamage1 aGeng, Z.1 aLau, B.H.S.0 tNutrition research.g1996 , v. 16, no. 11/12 p.1913-1923aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01010naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005700128300001600185500004800201520017200249650001500421650001800436650001000454650002200464650002500486650002200511650002300533700001500556773007200571852000900643939003300652946001100685655001200696IND9201539220221123001155.0920320e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920153922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRipperger, H.10a2 alpha-hydroxysoladulcidine from Lycianthes biflora  ap. 725-726.  aPart 122 in the series 'Solanum Alkaloids'.  aAn alkaloid isolated from the roots of Lycianthes biflora has been identified as 2 alpha-hydroxysoladulcidine[(25R)-5 alpha,22 alphaN-spirosolane-2 alpha,3 beta-diol]. 3aSolanaceae 3achemotaxonomy 3aroots 3aspectral analysis 3achemical composition 3asteroid alkaloids 3achemical structure1 aPorzel, A.0 tPhytochemistry.g1992 Feb., v. 31, no. 2 p.725-726x0031-94227nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02771naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167100002500176245009100201300001600292500002400308520112600332650001201458650002701470650001701497650002701514650001801541650001101559650001501570650002901585650004701614650003701661650003801698650003401736650002201770650002401792650000901816651001101825651001101836651001801847653001901865700001901884700002101903700002001924773011901944852000902063856008802072930003302160945002502193946001102218655001202229IND4430577220221122230721.0091229e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443057722DNAL7 a182991642pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aSunderland, Elsie M.10aReconciling models and measurements to assess trends in atmospheric mercury deposition  ap. 526-535.  aIncludes references  aChanges in atmospheric mercury deposition are used to evaluate the effectiveness of regulations controlling emissions. This analysis can be complicated by seemingly incongruent data from different model runs, model types, and field measurements. Here we present a case study example that describes how to identify trends in regional scale mercury deposition using best-available information from multiple data sources. To do this, we use data from three atmospheric chemistry models (CMAQ, GEOS-Chem, HYSPLIT) and multiple sediment archives (ombrotrophic bog, headwater lake, coastal salt marsh) from the Bay of Fundy region in Canada. Combined sediment and modeling data indicate that deposition attributable to US and Canadian emissions has declined in recent years, thereby increasing the relative significance of global sources. We estimate that anthropogenic emissions in the US and Canada account for 28–33% of contemporary atmospheric deposition in this region, with the rest from natural (14–32%) and global sources (41–53%).Mercury deposition trends are estimated from sediment data and atmospheric models. 3amercury 3aatmospheric deposition 3acase studies 3asediment contamination 3aair pollution 3amodels 3aestimation 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aAir Pollutionxlegislation & jurisprudence 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aMercuryxanalysis 2aModels, Theoretical 2aTime 3aCanada 0aCanada 0aUnited States 0atrend analysis1 aCohen, Mark D.1 aSelin, Noelle E.1 aChmura, Gail L.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2008 Nov., v. 156, no. 2 p.526-535dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.0213Available from publisher's Web site  a20100119b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02652naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173072000900182072000900191100003500200245007300235300001600308500002400324500001500348520104000363650002601403650002701429650001201456650003601468650003001504650002301534650005801557650003201615650002201647650002001669651001101689653001801700700002501718700003001743773010401773852000901877856008501886856010601971930003302077945002502110946001102135655001202146IND4430577720221122230532.0091229e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443057772DNAL7 a247851762pmid7 a10.1080/194400409033303262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aH000 0aE700 0aD5001 aCiscato, Claudia Helena Pastor10aPesticide residue monitoring of Brazilian fruit for export 2006-2007  ap. 140-145.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBrazil ranks 8th in the world for tropical fresh fruit production and exports almost 60% to Europe.

Dithiocarbamates were determined through conversion into carbon disulfide (CS2). A total of 76.8% of the samples were negative, with residues below the limit of detection. With reference to Brazilian legislation, 23.2% of the samples were positive (>MRL and not permitted for the crop (NPC), but only 4.4% were contaminated with multiple residues. A total of 14.3% of samples exceeded European Union MRLs. Samples of figs and persimmons had the highest violation rates.

However, the status of mite susceptibility to other hard acaricides is still unknown. At present, high infestation levels of V. destructor are being detected in colonies of Apis mellifera after treatment with amitraz. The aim of the present study was to determine the LC₅₀ of amitraz in V. destructor from three apiaries with high mite density after treatment with the acaricide. The LC₅₀ values were 3.9, 3.5, and 3.7 μg/Petri dish for mites from three different apiaries. Significant LC₅₀ differences were detected between resistant and susceptible mites. LC₅₀ increased 35-39-fold when compared to the corresponding baseline, suggesting the development of resistance. These results are the first report of resistance to amitraz in V. destructor in Argentina and extend the knowledge according to the status of acaricides resistance in the country. 3aApis mellifera 3aVarroa destructor 3aacaricide resistance 3aamitraz 3aapiaries 3acoumaphos 3alethal concentration 50 3amites 2aAcaricidesxpharmacology 2aAnimals 2aBeesxparasitology 2aDrug Resistance 2aLethal Dose 50 2aSurvival Analysis 2aToluidinesxpharmacology 2aVarroidaexdrug effects 3aArgentina 0aArgentina1 aRuffinengo, Sergio R.1 aNegri, Pedro1 aEguaras, Martín J.0 tParasitology research.g2010 Oct., v. 107, no. 5 p.1189-1192dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-010-1986-83Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02604naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245007400126300001800200500001500218520150200233650002001735650000901755650001801764650002301782650003201805650001601837650002501853650001101878650002601889650002301915650001301938651001201951653001101963653002001974700001701994773011502011852000902126930003302135945001302168946001302181655001202194IND2056801220221122190419.0970430e199612  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205680122DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEvers, S.E.10aAnthropometric status and diet of 4 to 5 year old low income children  ap. 1847-1859.  a2019-12-05  aAs part of the longitudinal, multidisciplinary prevention project, Better Beginnings, Better Futures, we assessed the dietary and anthropometric status of 4 and 5 year old children (n = 325) in four economically disadvantaged urban communities in Ontario. Anthropometric measurements included height, weight, triceps skinfolds, mid-arm circumference and indices of body composition. Information on demographic characteristics was collected through a parent interview. We obtained a 24 hour dietary recall for each child from the respondent parent and, where appropriate, any caregivers. Height-for-age was similar to the NCHS distribution. The proportion with weight-for-height Z scores >1.645 exceeded NCHS reference data for both boys (X(2) = 25.2, p<.001) and girls (X(2) = 21.5, p<.001). One-fifth of the children were above the 90th percentile for weight-for-height and upper arm fat area. Median nutrient intakes met or exceeded Canadian Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNI); however, median energy intake was well below the RNI. Energy and macronutrient intakes were similar across Z score categories of weight-for-height, upper arm muscle area, and upper arm fat area. This is the first population-based study on the nutritional health of Canadian children in over 20 years.

This disease can be caused by two pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae: pv. morsprunorum and pv. syringae. Repetitive DNA polymerase chain reaction-based fingerprinting (rep-PCR) was investigated as a method to distinguish pathovars, races and isolates of P. syringae from sweet and wild cherry. After amplification of total genomic DNA from 87 isolates using the REP (repetitive extragenic palindromic), ERIC (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus) and BOX primers, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis, groups of isolates showed specific patterns of PCR products. Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae isolates were highly variable. The differences amongst the fingerprints of P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 1 isolates were small. The patterns of P. syringae pv. morsprunorum race 2 isolates were also very uniform, with one exception, and distinct from the race 1 isolates. rep-PCR is a rapid and simple method to identify isolates of the two races of P. syringae pv. morsprunorum; this method can also assist in the identification of P. syringae pv. syringae isolates, although it cannot replace inoculation on susceptible hosts such as cherry and lilac. 3aDNA 3aDNA-directed DNA polymerase 3aPrunus avium 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3aagarose 3abacterial canker 3acherries 3agel electrophoresis 3ahosts 3apathovars 3apolymerase chain reaction 3araces 3arepetitive sequences 0aBacterial canker1 aRoberts, Steven J. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.383-392dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9107-y3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03211naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245006300146300001600209520148700225650002101712650001301733650002601746650001601772650003701788650002601825650001201851650002201863650004801885650001601933650002701949650004701976650001902023650002902042650003102071650004002102650002702142650004002169650001702209650002302226650003302249650004602282650003002328650003502358653001802393700002002411700001802431700001602449700001702465773008302482852000902565930003302574945001302607946001302620655001202633IND2062017120221122152045.0980223e199707  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206201712DNAL7 a92418352pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHurlbut, J.A.10aColorimetric determination of selenium in mineral premixes  ap. 709-716.  aA method is described for determination of sodium selenite or sodium selenate in mineral-based premixes. It is based on the formation of intense-yellow piazselenol by Se(IV) and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine. Mineral premixes typically contain calcium carbonate as a base material and magnesium carbonate, silicon dioxide, and iron(III) oxide as minor components or additives. In this method, the premix is digested briefly in nitric acid, diluted with water, and filtered to remove any iron(III) oxide. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and HCl are added to the filtrate, which is heated to near boiling for 1 h to convert any selenate to selenite. After heating, the solution is buffered between pH 2 and 3 with NaOH and formic acid and treated with NH2OH and EDTA; any Se present forms a complex with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine at 60 degrees C. The solution is made basic with NH4OH, and the piazselenol is extracted into toluene. The absorbance of the complex in dried toluene is measured at 420 nm. The method was validated independently by 2 laboratories. Samples analyzed included calcium carbonate fortified with 100, 200, and 300 micrograms Se in the form of sodium selenite or sodium selenate, a calcium carbonate premix containing sodium selenite, a calcium carbonate premix containing sodium selenate, and a commercial premix; 5 replicates of each sample type were analyzed by each laboratory.

However, much less information is available about the effects of composts on the development of foliar diseases. Here we studied the suppressive capacity of five composts (from olive marc-cotton gin trash, grape marc, cork, spent mushroom and municipal organic and yard wastes) as growth media against Botrytis cinerea disease in cucumber plants. We also examined the putative correlations of several biotic and abiotic factors involved in disease suppression. The suppressive capacity of the growth media was studied by comparing disease incidence/severity in plants grown in composts with that occurring in plants grown in commercial peats, which are conducive to most soilborne diseases. Correlations were made between the occurrence of disease and leaf nutrient status, as well as electrical conductivity (EC) and microbial activity (measured as β-glucosidase activity) in the growth media. Cucumber plants grown in the peats showed greater severity of B. cinerea during the bioassay than those grown in composts. Mo, Ca and Si content in leaves showed negative correlations with this disease. A negative correlation with disease severity was observed for EC and microbial activity in the growth media. The noticeable reduction in B. cinerea in plants grown in composts was related to the supply of specific chemical elements, a certain degree of salt stress, and the high microbial activity of composts. 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aCucumis sativus 3abeta-glucosidase 3abioassays 3acalcium 3acomposts 3acork 3acotton gin trash 3acucumbers 3aculture media 3adisease control 3adisease incidence 3adisease occurrence 3adisease severity 3aelectrical conductivity 3afoliar diseases 3agrape pomace 3aleaves 3amicrobial activity 3amolybdenum 3amushrooms 3aolives 3apeat 3asalt stress 3asilicon 3asoil-borne diseases 3ayard wastes 0aGray mold 0aNutrient status1 aCasanova, Eva 1 aBorrero, Celia 1 aAvilés, Manuel 1 aTrillas, Isabel 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.393-402dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9108-x3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02816naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002800111040001800139100001700157245010600174300001600280500002400296520128800320650002001608650001801628650001701646650001601663650001401679650001301693650002401706650001601730650001201746650002201758650003001780650001101810650001201821650002801833650002101861650004301882650003801925650004201963650002402005650002402029700001902053700002002072700001802092773011302110852000902223856007802232655001202310IND4448176220221122152012.0110126e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444817622DNAL7 a209377292pmid7 a10.1093/jxb/erq3152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiao, Minmin10aSugar signalling is involved in the sex expression response of monoecious cucumber to low temperature  ap. 797-804.  aIncludes references  aThis study aimed to investigate how low temperature alters the sex expression of monoecious cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L.). Plants were grown under different day/night temperature regimes, 28 °C/18 °C (12 h/12 h), 18 °C/12 °C, 28 °C/12 °C, and 28 °C/(6 h 18 °C+6 h 12 °C). It was found that plant femaleness is highest in the 28 °C/(6 h 18 °C+6 h 12 °C) treatment. Analysis of endogenous phytohormones and sugars in the shoot apex revealed that plant femaleness is positively correlated with the levels of ethylene, abscisic acid (ABA), glucose, and sucrose. Exogenous application experiments suggest that ABA and ethylene biosynthesis, as well as plant femaleness, was enhanced by glucose, sucrose, and mannose, but not by 3-O-methylglucose. Exogenous ABA had no significant effect on ethylene biosynthesis and plant femaleness. Both low temperature- and sugar-induced ABA biosynthesis, ethylene evolution, and plant femaleness can be antagonized by the hexokinase inhibitor glucosamine and the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid. It is concluded that the enhancement of cucumber femaleness under various temperature regimes is induced by elevated levels of glucose and sucrose in the shoot apex through a sugar signalling pathway involving hexokinase. 3aCucumis sativus 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acorrelation 3acucumbers 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aglucosamine 3aglucose 3anight temperature 3anordihydroguaiaretic acid 3ashoots 3asucrose 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCold Temperature 2aCucumis sativusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aSpecies Specificity1 aYang, Xiaguang1 aHan, Xiaoshuang1 aWang, Kuishan0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 Jan., v. 62, no. 2 p.797-804dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erq3153Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02702naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245012100172300001600293520136400309650001601673650002501689650001201714650002301726650001401749650002301763650002001786650001201806650001801818650001701836650004501853650001301898653001201911653001001923700002601933700002501959700002801984773013402012852000902146856006902155930003302224946001102257655001202268IND4389652820221122152044.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438965282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9103-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPérez de Castro, Ana 10aIdentification of a CAPS marker tightly linked to the Tomato yellow leaf curl disease resistance gene Ty-1 in tomato  ap. 347-356.  aDuring the process of breeding programmes, several resistance genes have been introgressed into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cultivars from different wild tomato relatives. A number of these resistance genes have been mapped to chromosome 6. Among them, Ty-1 and Mi, which confer resistance to Tomato yellow leaf curl disease and to Meloidogyne spp., respectively, are in most cases incorporated in commercial hybrids. Several molecular markers tightly linked to Mi have been identified. This study was conducted in order to find an informative molecular marker linked to Ty-1. Six markers mapped in the same region as Ty-1 were analysed in plant material carrying different combinations of Ty-1 and Mi alleles. Three of the six markers revealed polymorphism among the assayed accessions. One allele of JB-1 marker showed association with Ty-1. Furthermore, the presence of Mi did not interfere with the results. The analysis of several accessions of wild tomato relatives with the three polymorphic markers allowed the establishment of the origin of the alleles found in cultivated plant material, showing that introgressions from S. lycopersicum, S. pimpinellifolium and S. habrochaites will not interfere with the results of this marker which tags Ty-1. Furthermore this analysis enabled the location of CT21, the RFLP marker from which JB-1 was designed. 3aMeloidogyne 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aalleles 3achromosome mapping 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aleaf curling 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3atomatoes 0aMi gene 0aTYLCD1 aBlanca, José Miguel 1 aDíez, María José.1 aNuez Viñals, Fernando.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.347-356dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9103-23electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03324naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011000163300001600273520196700289650002702256650002202283650002502305650002202330650002102352650001702373650001402390650001502404650001402419650003002433650002502463650001302488650001602501650001502517651001202532651001802544653001402562653001202576700002202588773013402610852000902744856006902753930003302822946001102855655001202866IND4389652520221122112552.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438965252DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-006-9099-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBouws, Heidi 10aEffects of cropping history and origin of seed potatoes on population structure of Phytophthora infestans  ap. 313-327.  aThe effects of origin of seed potatoes and the cropping history on the phenotypic structure of Phytophthora infestans populations was studied in northern Hessia, central Germany, from 2000 to 2002. Populations originating from fields with a history of potato cropping with only short or no rotation (old fields) were compared with populations from new fields, i.e., where no potatoes had been grown for at least 30 years and seed potatoes were either imported from breeders or produced on-farm (certified). The main goal was to determine the importance of seed potato infection in the establishment of new P. infestans populations. Isolates were characterized for mating type, virulences and rep- (repetitive extragenic palindromic) PCR fingerprints. Among a total of 639 isolates sampled from 31 sites, mating types A1 and A2 co-existed in all three years in 60-92% of the sites. Over all three years, 53 pathotypes were detected in a subsample of 272 isolates. Isolates originating from the new fields had significantly higher frequencies of the virulences v1, v2, v3, v6 and v7, indicating general effects of seed introduction into a new region. Thirty-six fingerprints were detected in a subsample of 281 isolates of which 22 were unique while four occurred in all three years and in many sites. Pathogen populations from potato fields that were grown from seed tubers of geographically different origin differed significantly based on χ ² tests. While the Nei genetic distances were less than .1 among the local populations, distances to the US lineages US-1, US-6, US-7 and US-8 ranged from .22 to .47; however, the bootstrap values were not significant. Populations from old fields were more diverse and 14 of the 22 rep-PCR types occurred there among 132 isolates tested in comparison to six in the new fields (n = 140 isolates) and two among six isolates from volunteers. The results also suggest that both sexual and asexual reproduction play a role. 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aasexual reproduction 3acropping sequence 3agenetic distance 3amating types 3apathogens 3apathotypes 3aphenotype 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation structure 3apotatoes 3aseed tubers 3avolunteers 3aGermany 3aUnited States 0aDiversity 0aRep-PCR1 aFinckh, Maria R. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.313-327dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-006-9099-z3electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02979naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010800168300001600276520140500292650002201697650001001719650002601729650002501755650002101780650002101801650002301822650002101845650003001866650001001896650002401906650002201930650001301952650001201965650002701977650001202004650001402016650003102030651001102061653002402072653001502096653001602111700002702127700002202154700001702176773013402193852000902327856006902336930003302405946001102438655001202449IND4389652720221122112447.0070325e200704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438965272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-007-9102-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou Al Fadil, T. 10aGenetic control of partial resistance to 'collar' and 'root' isolates of Phoma macdonaldii in sunflower  ap. 341-346.  aPhoma macdonaldii is one of the most important pathogens of sunflower (Heliantus annuus) in France. In order to determine the inheritance of resistance to the disease, five sunflower genotypes with wide genetic variability for resistance to two 'collar' and two 'root' Phoma isolates were crossed in a diallel programme. Four separate experiments were undertaken under controlled conditions. In each one, the response of parental genotypes and their F1 hybrids were evaluated with one of the four Phoma isolates. Analysis of variance was performed to determine the effects of genotype on disease severity score when inoculated with 'collar' or 'root' Phoma isolates and showed significant variability among parents and F1 hybrids for disease severity score. Diallel analysis showed that general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects for resistance to 'collar' and 'root' Phoma isolates were highly significant for each of the four isolates indicating that both kinds of gene effects were important in controlling the resistance. The GCA/SCA ratios were more than one for three out of four isolates showing that additive genetic effects were more important than non-additive effects for resistance to three of the studied Phoma isolates. Hence, conventional breeding methods could be recommended to achieve genetic improvement to such 'collar' and 'root' Phoma isolates. 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPhoma 3aadditive gene effects 3aanalysis of variance 3abreeding methods 3adiallel analysis 3adisease resistance 3adisease severity 3ageneral combining ability 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3ahybrids 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aparents 3apathogens 3aspecific combining ability 3aFrance 0aCombining abilities 0aF1 hybrids 0aInheritance1 aDechamp-Guillaume, G. 1 aDarvishzadeh, R. 1 aSarrafi, A. 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Apr., v. 117, no. 4 p.341-346dDordrecht : Kluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9102-33electronic resource  a20070325b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02109naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245010900150300001600259520093800275650001001213650001001223650001601233650001701249650001601266650001801282650001601300650002001316650002501336650001001361650003601371650002601407650003101433650003001464653001801494700002401512773008301536852000901619930003301628945001301661946001301674655001201687IND2206728920221122112508.0000905e200005  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220672892DNAL7 a108685912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNegueruela, A.I.10aColor measurement of rosemary honey in the solid state by reflectance spectroscopy with black background  ap. 669-674.  aA colorimetric method was developed to measure the color of rosemary honeys in the solid state, without liquefaction. The color of 20 solid samples of rosemary honeys was measured by reflectance spectroscopy with white and black background in cells of 1 cm pathlength. The Kulbelka-Munk theory of turbid media was applied to calculate the spectral distribution of reflectivity, internal transmittance, and coefficients of absorbance and scattering of light. From these spectral distributions, different types of honey were found. The honey colors measured from reflectivity and internal transmittance are well grouped. The colors obtained from reflectivity and those obtained from reflectance with black background show high linear correlation (r2 > 0.99). As a practical application, measurements of reflectance with black background in cells of 1 cm pathlength can be used to determine the color of these honeys in the solid state. 3ahoney 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3aspectroscopy 3areflectance 3atransmittance 2aColorimetry 2aHoneyxanalysis 2aLamiaceaexchemistry 2aLight 2aPigments, Biologicalxchemistry 2aScattering, Radiation 2aSpectrophotometryxmethods 2aSpectrophotometry, Atomic 0adetermination1 aPerez-Arquillue, C.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2000 , v. 83, no. 3 p.669-674x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03215naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100002200165245006700187300001800254500002400272520139300296650002101689650001001710650001001720650001601730650001201746650001401758650000901772650002201781650001001803650002101813650001001834650002201844650001101866650001401877650001601891650001301907650002101920650001401941650000901955650001301964650001001977650005001987650001102037650004902048650001102097650005902108650005002167650006102217650002702278650002102305650002902326650001902355650002102374773013602395852000902531856004902540655001202589IND4440570920221122112441.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444057092DNAL7 a206560952pmid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2010.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCaudill, Marie A.10aPre- and Postnatal Health: Evidence of Increased Choline Needs  ap. 1198-1206.  aIncludes references  aCholine, a micronutrient found in food, serves as the starting material for several important metabolites that play key roles in fetal development, particularly the brain. Although human beings' requirement for choline is unknown, an Adequate Intake level of 425 mg/day was established for women with upward adjustments to 450 and 550 mg/day during pregnancy and lactation, respectively. The importance of choline in human development is supported by observations that a human fetus receives a large supply of choline during gestation; pregnancy causes depletion of hepatic choline pools in rats consuming a normal diet; human neonates are born with blood levels that are three times higher than maternal blood concentrations; and large amounts of choline are present in human milk. The development of the central nervous system is particularly sensitive to choline availability with evidence of effects on neural tube closure and cognition. Existing data show that the majority of pregnant (and presumably lactating) women are not achieving the target intake levels and that certain common genetic variants may increase requirements for choline beyond current recommendations. Because choline is not found in most varieties of prenatal vitamins (or regular multivitamins), increased consumption of choline-rich foods may be needed to meet the high pre- and postnatal demands for choline. 3aAdequate Intakes 3ablood 3abrain 3abreast milk 3acholine 3acognition 3adiet 3afetal development 3afetus 3afood consumption 3afoods 3ahuman development 3ahumans 3alactation 3ametabolites 3aneonates 3aneurodevelopment 3apregnancy 3arats 3avitamins 3awomen 2aCholinexadministration & dosagexphysiology. 2aFemale 2aFetal Developmentxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aInfant Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aInfant, Newbornxbloodxgrowth & development. 2aMaternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomenaxphysiology 2aMilk, Humanxchemistry 2aNutrition Policy 2aNutritional Requirements 2aPerinatal Care 2aPregnancyxblood0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2010 Aug., v. 110, no. 8 p.1198-1206dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2010.05.009 7aarticle02830naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002300194245012200217300001600339500002400355520115800379650001701537650001901554650001901573650001301592650001301605650002001618650001801638650002401656650001501680650001401695650003801709650003901747650002301786650002401809650002301833650002001856650003001876650001001906651001101916651001101927700002201938700001901960773011901979852000902098856008802107930003302195945002502228946001102253655001202264IND4430580020221122112537.0091229e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443058002DNAL7 a182915652pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aJ200 0aX1001 aRothwell, James J.12aA classification and regression tree model of controls on dissolved inorganic nitrogen leaching from European forests  ap. 544-552.  aIncludes references  aOften, there is a non-linear relationship between atmospheric dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) input and DIN leaching that is poorly captured by existing models. We present the first application of the non-parametric classification and regression tree approach to evaluate the key environmental drivers controlling DIN leaching from European forests. DIN leaching was classified as low (<3), medium (3–15) or high (>15 kg N ha−1 year−1) at 215 sites across Europe. The analysis identified throughfall NO3− deposition, acid deposition, hydrology, soil type, the carbon content of the soil, and the legacy of historic N deposition as the dominant drivers of DIN leaching for these forests. Ninety four percent of sites were successfully classified into the appropriate leaching category. This approach shows promise for understanding complex ecosystem responses to a wide range of anthropogenic stressors as well as an improved method for identifying risk and targeting pollution mitigation strategies in forest ecosystems. Classification and regression trees provide new insights into the non-linear behaviour of nitrogen leaching from forests. 3aforest soils 3asoil pollution 3apolluted soils 3anitrogen 3aleaching 3awater pollution 3alinear models 3aregression analysis 2aAdsorption 2aEcosystem 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxanalysis 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Statistical 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Pollutantsxanalysis 2aTrees 3aEurope 0aEurope1 aFutter, Martyn N.1 aDise, Nancy B.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2008 Nov., v. 156, no. 2 p.544-552dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100119b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle01014naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245004300123300001600166520017900182650001100361650002100372650001000393650002200403650002500425650001900450650002300469653001900492653001300511700001300524700001400537773007200551852000900623939003300632946001100665655001200676IND9201538420221122112458.0920320e199202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920153842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, X.Z.10aAnthraquinones from Salvia przewalskii  ap. 708-709.  aOne new anthraquinone, przewalskinone B and a known compound, ziganein, were isolated from Salvia przewalskii.

Claims for this type of application are being made on dishwashing detergents throughout the world. In this evaluation, commercially available kitchen sponges were stripped of antimicrobial compounds. Sponges were then inoculated with a pool of 7 microorganisms which consisted of Gram positives, Gram negatives, and yeast. Inoculated sponges were treated with the detergent as recommended by the manufacturer and allowed to incubate for 16 h at ambient temperature. Surviving microorganisms were then quantitated using either the spiral or pour plate method. Tests were run using both clean sponges and sponges soiled with 0.5% nonfat dry milk (NFDM). Untreated sponges showed stasis or slightly increased bacterial populations after the incubation period in the absence of NFDM. Significant increases of up to 3 log cfu/mL were observed for untreated sponges when soiled with NFDM. Statistically significant reductions were observed for clean sponges (99.8-99.9998%) and sponges soiled with NFDM (87.6-99.9%) when detergents making "antibacterial sponge" claims were added to the inoculated sponges. Statistically significant differences between detergents making "antibacterial sponge" claims were also observed. 3aproducts and commodities 3acellulose 3adetergents 3aantibacterial properties 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aGram-negative bacteria 2aBacteriaxdrug effects 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDetergentsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectantsxpharmacology 2aDisinfectionxmethods 0aplastic foam 0aplastic foam sponges 0acelulosic viscose sponges1 aBrumbaugh, E.1 aKananen, L.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g2002 , v. 85, no. 1 p.107-112x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle03094naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245011000200300001600310500002400326500001500350520136500365650003401730650001701764650001201781650005801793650000901851650001701860650002601877650002601903650001201929650001601941650001701957650001701974650001801991650001902009650002202028650001302050650002302063650001802086650001902104650001702123653001502140773010402155852000902259856008502268856010602353930003302459945002502492946001102517655001202528IND4430579020221122090459.0091229e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443057902DNAL7 a247851812pmid7 a10.1080/194400409032805212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ205 0aE7001 aBircan, Cavit10aComparison of homogenization techniques and incidence of aflatoxin contamination in dried figs for export  ap. 171-177.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo determine differences in mean aflatoxin contamination and subsample variance from dry and slurry homogenizations, 10 kg of six different, naturally contaminated dried fig samples were collected from various exporting companies in accordance with the EU Commission Directive. The samples were first dry-mixed for 5 min using a blender and sub-sampled seven times; the remainder was slurry homogenized (1 : 1, v/v) and sub-sampled seven times. Aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin levels were recorded and coefficient of variations (CV) computed for all sub-samples. Only a small reduction in sub-sample variations, indicated by the lower CV values, and slight differences in mean aflatoxin B1 and total aflatoxin levels were observed when slurry homogenization was applied. Therefore, 7326 dried figs, destined for export from Turkey to the EU and collected during the 2008 crop year, were dry-homogenized and tested for aflatoxins (B1, B2, G1 and G2) by immunoaffinity column clean-up using RP-HPLC. While 34% of the samples contained detectable levels of total aflatoxins (0.20-208.75 µg kg-1), only 9% of them exceeded the EU limit of 4 µg kg-1 in the range 2.0-208.75 µg kg-1, respectively. A substantial increase in the incidence of aflatoxins was observed in 2008, most likely due to the drought stress experienced in Aydin province as occurred in 2007. 3aimmunoaffinity chromatography 3aaflatoxin B1 3adrought 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3afigs 3awater stress 3asecondary metabolites 3aquantitative analysis 3aexports 3adried fruit 3aaflatoxin G1 3aaflatoxin B2 3amolds (fungi) 3ahomogenization 3atoxigenic strains 3aslurries 3afood contamination 3arapid methods 3afood pathogens 3aaflatoxin G2 0aaflatoxins0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2009 Nov., v. 2, no. 2 p.171-177dTaylor & Francisx1939-32107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/194400409032805213Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.informaworld.com/smpp/title~content=t783462596~db=all3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100123b20100205c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/01/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03399naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245010900142300001800251500001500269520161800284650001401902650001801916650001101934650002301945650002301968650002201991650001402013650001502027650001902042650002102061650001202082650003602094650003602130650005202166650002502218650002802243650003502271650002102306650002702327650002502354650003202379650001702411653001502428653003202443653001502475653001102490653001202501653001502513700001402528700001702542700001602559700001702575700001602592773008502608852000902693930003302702945001302735946001302748655001202761IND2206361820221122090451.0000810e199912  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220636182DNAL7 a105894942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoi, J.10aDetermination of fluoroquinolone residues in animal tissues using Escherichia coli as indicator organism  ap. 1407-1412.  a2019-12-05  aThree strains of Escherichia coli (ATCC 128, 10536, and 25922) and one strain of Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 3491) were compared as indicator microorganisms in microbial inhibition tests for their ability to detect fluoroquinolone residues. E. coli strains 128 and 10536 were most susceptible to fluoroquinolone residues, with detection limits of 30-50 micrograms/kg for enrofloxacin. Of the 2 strains, E. coli 10536 was slightly less susceptible. Ciprofloxacin was detected consistently by E. coli 128 at 30 micrograms/kg. Other fluoroquinolone drugs of veterinary interest detected by E. coli 128 were sarafloxacin and difloxacin at 100-250 micrograms/kg concentration. E. coli 25922 yielded 100% sensitivity in detection of enrofloxacin only at the 250 micrograms/kg concentration, and ciprofloxacin and sarafloxacin at 200 micrograms/kg. B. subtilis detected only enrofloxacin 100% of the time at 250 micrograms/kg. The E. coli strains tested were insensitive to other antibacterials commonly used in animals, with the exception of ceftiofur which was detected by E. coli 128 and 10536 at 500 micrograms/kg. The B. subtilis strain was not effective in detecting the fluoroquinolone drugs, whereas the E. coli strains were selective for the fluoroquinolones. E. coli 128 was 100% effective in detecting enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin in spiked diaphragm homogenate samples at 50 micrograms/kg. Of the microorganisms tested, E. coli strain ATCC 128 was highly suitable as an indicator microorganism in a microbial inhibition assay for selective detection of fluoroquinolone antibacterial residues in animal tissues. 3ascreening 3adrug residues 3aassays 3afood contamination 3astrain differences 3aBacillus subtilis 3adetection 3aquinolones 3aanimal tissues 3aEscherichia coli 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxanalysis 2aBacillus subtilisxdrug effects 2aCiprofloxacinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aDiaphragmxchemistry 2aDrug Residuesxanalysis 2aEscherichia colixdrug effects 2aFluoroquinolones 2aQuinolizinesxanalysis 2aQuinolonesxanalysis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aevaluation 0amicrobial inhibition assays 0aindicators 0agrowth 0astrains 0ainhibition1 aYee, A.J.1 aThompson, D.1 aSamoluk, J.1 aMitchell, M.1 aBlack, W.D.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1999 , v. 82, no. 6 p.1407-1412x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03119naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176072000900185100002200194245013400216300001600350500002400366500001500390520104700405650001901452650001701471650002501488650001701513650001001530650001001540650003101550650001901581650001401600650002701614650001201641650001801653650002901671650002501700650002901725650002101754650002201775650001201797650002001809650001901829650004501848650002401893651001201917653001801929653002201947653001101969653002801980700002202008700001802030700001702048700001902065700001802084700002202102773011902124852000902243856008802252930003302340945002502373946001102398655001202409IND4430579920221122090515.0091229e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443057992DNAL7 a182897502pmid7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF600 0aF8311 aRiikonen, Johanna10aStomatal characteristics and infection biology of Pyrenopeziza betulicola in Betula pendula trees grown under elevated CO2 and O3  ap. 536-543.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTwo silver birch clones were exposed to ambient and elevated concentrations of CO2 and O3, and their combination for 3 years, using open-top chambers. We evaluated the effects of elevated CO2 and O3 on stomatal conductance (gs), density (SD) and index (SI), length of the guard cells, and epidermal cell size and number, with respect to crown position and leaf type. The relationship between the infection biology of the fungus (Pyrenopeziza betulicola) causing leaf spot disease and stomatal characteristics was also studied. Leaf type was an important determinant of O3 response in silver birch, while crown position and clone played only a minor role. Elevated CO2 reduced the gs, but had otherwise no significant effect on the parameters studied. No significant interactions between elevated CO2 and O3 were found. The infection biology of P. betulicola was not correlated with SD or gs, but it did occasionally correlate positively with the length of the guard cells. Leaf type is an important determinant of O3 response in silver birch. 3acarbon dioxide 3aplant growth 3astomatal conductance 3aPyrenopeziza 3aozone 3atrees 3aelevated atmospheric gases 3aBetula pendula 3aleaf spot 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3astomata 3aair pollution 2aAir Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aBetulaxmicrobiology 2aCarbon Dioxidextoxicity 2aEcologyxmethods 2aGreenhouse Effect 2aMycoses 2aOzonextoxicity 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Epidermisxcytologyxdrug effects. 2aPlant Transpiration 0aFinland 0aleaf spotting 0aepidermis (plant) 0aleaves 0aPyrenopeziza betulicola1 aSyrjälä, Leena.1 aTulva, Ingmar1 aMänd, Pille1 aOksanen, Elina1 aPoteri, Marja1 aVapaavuori, Elina0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2008 Nov., v. 156, no. 2 p.536-543dElsevier Applied Science Publishersx0269-74917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2008.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100119b20100205c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/01/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02498naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245006200184300001800246500002400264520077100288650001501059650001201074650001901086650001101105650001201116650002801128650001301156650001501169650001401184650002701198650001101225650002501236650001701261650001901278650002801297650002201325650004401347650006001391650003501451700002301486700002301509700002201532700002201554700002601576700002501602700002001627700002101647700002001668700002101688773011701709852000901826856008501835655001201920IND4443208620221122050400.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444320862DNAL7 a205443042pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-010-8966-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRigo, Elisandra10aEsterification Activity of Novel Fungal and Yeast Lipases  ap. 1881-1888.  aIncludes references  aThe main objective of this work was the isolation and screening of microorganisms with potential for producing lipases for the synthesis of fatty esters as well as evaluating the specificity of the enzymes produced, using different alcohols (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and butanol) and fatty acids (oleic and lauric acids) as substrates. Promising biocatalysts for organic synthesis were obtained in this work. The isolated strains 69F and 161Y showed ability to efficiently catalyze the reaction for production of n-propyl oleate.

Results showed that mycelial growth of Ss was reduced by 41.6 and 84.5% on 3 day-old cultures grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 10% (v v-¹) of cultural filtrates of Cm grown in MCD (MCDcm) after incubation for 6 and 15 days, respectively, and by 2.7 and 15.7% on PDA amended with 10% (v v-¹) of cultural filtrates of Cm grown in PDB for 6 and 15 days, respectively. In addition to retardation of mycelial growth, morphological abnormality of Ss such as hyphal swellings and cytoplasm granulation were also observed in colonies grown on PDA amended with cultural filtrates of MCDcm. Sclerotia of Ss soaked in the filtrates of MCDcm for 24 h remained viable, but their ability to undergo myceliogenic germination on PDA was delayed, compared to sclerotia treated with MCD. Germination of ascospores of Ss was unaffected on PDA amended with 10% of the filtrates of MCDcm. However, germ tubes of Ss were shortened and deformed by the formation of hyphal swellings in the treatment of MCDcm. Treatment of leaves of oilseed rape with cultural filtrates of MCDcm reduced incidence of leaf blight caused by Ss, compared to the controls (water or MCD). This study suggests that AFS produced by Cm plays an important role in the suppression of mycelial growth and germ-tube development of ascospores of Ss and that there is potential for using AFS of Cm to control leaf blight of oilseed rape caused by ascospores of Ss. 3aBrassica napus 3aConiothyrium minitans 3aSclerotinia sclerotiorum 3aantifungal properties 3aascospores 3acytoplasm 3afiltrates 3agerm tube 3agermination 3aleaf blight 3aleaves 3amycelium 3asclerotia 0aMycoparasite 0aAntifungal substances1 aHan, Yong Chao 1 aLi, Guo Qing 1 aJiang, Dao Hong 1 aHuang, Hung-Chang.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Dec., v. 119, no. 4 p.411-420dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-007-9174-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20071104b20071210c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03178naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014400126300001600270520187100286650002302157650002002180650002302200650001702223650003002240650002502270650001102295650003202306650002202338650002002360650000802380650001002388650001302398651001102411653001602422653001402438653003702452700001602489700001602505700001802521773011302539852000902652930003302661945001302694946001302707655001202720IND2057648920221122032227.0970612e199604  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205764892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLafleur, M.10aNutritional assessment in chronic liver disease patients: a comparison between skeletal muscle function and standard nutritional parameters  ap. 545-553.  aTo determine the validity of skeletal muscle function as a functional marker of nutritional status in patients with liver cirrhosis, 133 subjects were studied. Seventy-four of them suffered from liver cirrhosis; 17 were malnourished patients with gastrointestinal diseases, and 42 constituted normal controls. Adductor pollicis function was assessed. The force developed by this muscle at 10 Hz was expressed as the percentage of the force at 20 Hz (F10/F20). Standard nutritional assessment was also performed and included the measurement of serum transport proteins and of anthropometric parameters. Cirrhotic patients with normal lean body mass, as measured either by arm muscle area or creatinine height index, had F10/F20 values which were not significantly different from those measured in normal controls. Cirrhotic patients with reduced lean body mass had F10/F20 values which were not significantly different from those observed in malnourished patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Finally cirrhotic patients with normal arm muscle area had F10/F20 values which were significantly different from those in malnourished patients with gastrointestinal diseases. Mean serum levels of total proteins, albumin, and transferrin were not correlated with any of the anthropometric measurements nor with skeletal muscle function. Indeed, we observed a decrease in the mean serum levels of albumin and transferrin which was related to the severity of liver disease. This trend between the severity of liver disease and nutritional markers has not been observed with triceps skinfold thickness, arm muscle area or circumference, and skeletal muscle function. We conclude that, unlike serum transport proteins, skeletal muscle function is not affected by chronic liver disease. Thus, it can be used as a functional measurement of nutritional status in such patients. 3anutritional status 3askeletal muscle 3amuscle contraction 3amalnutrition 3adigestive system diseases 3anutrition assessment 3aheight 3aanthropometric measurements 3aindicator species 3ablood chemistry 3amen 3awomen 3apatients 3aQuebec 0acomparisons 0acirrhosis 0askeletal muscle function testing1 aLabelle, F.1 aLemoyne, M.1 aGelinas, M.D.0 tNutrition research.g1996 Apr., v. 16, no. 4 p.545-553aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02465naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014100127300001800268500009000286500001500376520096500391650001701356650002001373650001601393650001001409650001601419650001501435650000801450650001601458650001101474650002301485650001601508650002601524650000901550650001401559650001401573651001301587653001601600653002301616653002001639653002001659653002501679653001601704653001501720700001701735773011501752852000901867930003301876945001301909946001301922655001201935IND2056799020221121224553.0970429e199612  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205679902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPongpaew, P.10aEndogeneous increase of proteinase inhibitors as a possible mechanism of adaptation and subclinical undernutrition resulting in stunting  ap. 1839-1845.  aPaper presented at the 15th International Congress of Nutrition, Adelaide, Australia.  a2019-12-05  aThere is evidence that the organism tries to keep an optimal relationship of weight to a given height in the case of subclinical undernutrition. The underlying mechanism seems to regulate the growth spurt so that a beneficial relationship of weight on cost of the height spurt can be maintained. Proteinase inhibitors might be involved in such an adaptation process. In children from the rural sector of Thailand the serum proteinase inhibitor alpha2-macroglobulin was found to be elevated above well-nourished children from the urban area. 3-Methylhistidine excretion in the urine was lower in the village children compared with those of the children from Bangkok. Similar observations were made in rat experiments. It is hypothesized that alpha2-macroglobulin elevation during nutritional stress might be one of the mechanism which causes the children's organism to try and find an optimal relationship between catabolism and synthesis resulting in stunting. 3amalnutrition 3aschool children 3ablood serum 3aurine 3abody weight 3aprealbumin 3aage 3aurban areas 3aheight 3agrowth retardation 3arural areas 3aproteinase inhibitors 3arats 3aglobulins 3aexcretion 3aThailand 0acomparisons 0aalpha1-antitrypsin 0amethylhistidine 0aalpha1-cysteine 0aalpha2-macroglobulin 0aantitrypsin 0aadaptation1 aSchelp, F.P.0 tNutrition research.g1996 , v. 16, no. 11/12 p.1839-1845aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02082naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001700161245013000178300001800308500002400326520117400350650001601524650001101540650001601551650001301567700001301580773010801593852000901701856008201710655001201792IND4443269920221121224731.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444326992DNAL7 a208062362pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2010002102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLao, Wenjian10aTemperature effects on a doubly tethered diproline chiral stationary phase: Hold-up volume, enantioselectivity and robustness  ap. 3052-3059.  aIncludes references  aEffect of temperature on hold-up volume, enantioselectivity and robustness of a novel doubly tethered diproline chiral stationary phase (CSP1) was studied. In-column end-capping of residual silanol was utilized as a tool to exhibit in situ change of CSP1. The hold-up volume marker, 1,3,5-tri-tert-butylbenzene, was observed to be weakly retained (<1 s ) on a 5 cmx4.6 mm chiral column, and its retention time was changed with the carrier solvent and column temperature. The apparent thermodynamic parameters of 1,3,5-tri-tert-butylbenzene indicated an enthalpy-driven retention process with the hexane/isopropanol mobile phase, while an entropy-driven process with the hexane/methyl tert-butyl ether mobile phase. The ΔΔH and ΔΔS values of chiral separation for the four probes including 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol and warfarin were negative on CSP1. Nonlinear van't Hoff plots were observed for some analytes before and after the end-capping treatment. Depending on compound, end-capping strengthened or weakened the enantioseparation. Moreover, the enantioselectivity of CSP1 was shown to be robust by testing with heating-cooling cycles and step-temperature programs. 3aenantiomers 3ahexane 3atemperature 3awarfarin1 aGan, Jay0 tJournal of separation science.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 19 p.3052-3059dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2010002103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02051naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245008900173300001400262500002400276520109100300650001301391650001301404650001201417650001101429650002401440650001601464700002501480700002601505773014201531852000901673856005501682655001201737IND4448882720221121224717.0110204e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444888272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7976.2010.01191.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDonnet, M.

We model the roaster's optimal choice of procurement strategies using an extended newsvendor model. By comparing the optimal strategies in a benchmark case solely based on relationships to a case in which auctions can be utilized, we derive the impact of e-auctions on the procurement quantity and profit under conditions of demand uncertainty. The two-stage model predicts that the adjustment of procurement using e-auctions is most beneficial under market circumstances of high demand variability and small firm size. We use industry data to illustrate the market conditions for specialty coffee and discuss the potential impact of e-auctions on procurement strategies for specialty coffee based on our model.

Both methods showed enough sensitivity to allow for an accurate determination of enzyme kinetic parameters according to Michaelis–Menten plots and the results were: Km = 0.23 ± 0.051 μM, Vmax = 0.488 ± 0.035 nmol/min/mg protein for EROD activity, and Km = 10(10) ± 155.7 μM, Vmax = 0.089 ± 0.006 nmol/min/mg protein for TMH activity. An Eadie–Hofstee plot analysis showed that in bovine liver microsomes, EROD and TMH activities followed a monophasic kinetic pattern. α-Naphthoflavone, a cytochrome P450 1A1/2 (CYP1A1/2) inhibitor, and sulfaphenazole, a cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) inhibitor, decreased EROD and TMH activities, respectively. The sensitivity of the methods allowed the use of microsomes with low enzyme activity, such as those from veal calf liver. Thus, EROD and TMH activities may be adopted as markers for the evaluation of CYP1A and CYP2C9-like activities in liver microsomes from veal and beef cattle. 3acattle 3aliver microsomes 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3adetection 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCalibration 2aCattle 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethodsxstandardsxveterinary. 2aCytochrome P-450 CYP1A1xmetabolism 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMicrosomes, Liverxenzymology 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrometry, Fluorescencexveterinary 0aethoxyresorufin O-deethylase 0atolbutamide methylhydroxylase1 aMerlanti, Roberta1 aGiantin, Mery1 aDacasto, Mauro1 aMontesissa, Clara1 aCapolongo, Francesca0 tVeterinary journal.g2010 Jan., v. 183, no. 1 p.81-88dHarcourtx1090-02337nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.08.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100317b20100403c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/02/15  aNon-US 7aarticle01737naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001500161245011300176300001800289500002400307520058000331650001400911650004400925650003700969650006801006650002401074650002501098700001701123700001701140700001201157700001901169773010801188852000901296856008201305655001201387IND4443269420221121224757.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444326942DNAL7 a208122282pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2010000562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yingyu10aPreparation of a stationary phase with s-triazine ring embedded group for reversed phase high-performance LC  ap. 2998-3004.  aIncludes references  aThis paper describes the synthesis and chromatographic evaluation of a new polar-embedded stationary phase, which utilized 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine as the spacer.

Methods We examined 59 diabetic patients with different degrees of retinopathy using stereo fundus photography in accordance with the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) and fluorescein angiography. Conventional white-on-white perimetry (WWP) and short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) were performed and analysed with reference to normal values. Visual acuity was measured with ETDRS charts. Results Regression analysis revealed that visual acuity was significantly associated with increasing severity of retinopathy according to the ETDRS scale when visual acuity was estimated by counting logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (LogMar) scores, but not when visual acuity was measured by the conventional reading of the smallest line that could be seen. Visual acuity decreased by 0.02 LogMar per ETDRS step (p=0.03). The degree of visual field loss was significantly associated with increasing severity of retinopathy according to the ETDRS scale, perimetric sensitivity decreasing by 0.44 dB per ETDRS step (p=0.0001) using WWP, and by 0.40 dB per ETDRS step (p=0.04) with SWAP. The size of the area of the foveal avascular zone and adjacent perifoveal intercapillary areas (PIAs) also affected the central visual field as obtained both by WWP (-2.6 dB/mm², p=0.03), and by SWAP (-7.9 dB/mm², p=0.002), but did not affect visual acuity. The regression model fit for peripheral retinopathy according to the ETDRS scale was better using WWP than SWAP or visual acuity, while SWAP testing was superior to both WWP and visual acuity when measuring effects caused by enlarged foveal avascular zones and PIAs. Conclusions/interpretation Perimetry can provide more useful information than visual acuity on functional loss in diabetic retinopathy, particularly when the perifoveal capillary network is damaged. 3adiabetic retinopathy 0aFoveal avascular zone 0aPerimetry 0aVisual acuity 0aVisual fields1 aHeijl, A. 1 aAgardh, E. 0 tDiabetologia.g2005 Dec., v. 48, no. 12 p.2494-2500dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0012-186X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00125-005-0001-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080210b20080301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02613naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245010800190300001600298500002400314520114600338650002501484650001601509650001801525650000901543650001801552650002201570650001001592650001601602650001801618650001301636650001201649650002801661650001901689650002601708650004701734650001201781650002301793650002101816650001001837650002301847650000901870650001201879700001901891773013301910852000902043856005502052655001202107IND4444896620221121071240.0101105e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444489662DNAL7 a199124272pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00947.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRagnarsson, S.10aORIGINAL ARTICLE: Impact of feeding level on digestibility of a haylage‐only diet in Icelandic horses  ap. 623-627.  aIncludes references  aEight mature Icelandic geldings were used in an experiment arranged as a change‐over design to evaluate the effect of feeding level on the digestibility of a high‐energy haylage‐only diet. The horses were fed a low feeding level 10.7 g dry matter (DM)/kg body weight (BW) (maintenance) and a high feeding level 18.1 g DM/kg BW (1.5 × maintenance) during two 23 days experimental periods. Total collection of faeces was performed for 6 days at the end of each period to determine the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility (CTTAD). The CTTAD for DM, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre and energy was higher in horses fed at the low level of feed intake, while feeding level did not affect the CTTAD of crude protein. The largest difference in CTTAD between feeding levels was found for NDF. The content (/kg DM) of digestible energy in the haylage was 11.3 MJ at the low level of feed intake and 10.6 MJ at the high level of feed intake. It can be concluded that feeding level has a large impact on the digestibility and energy value of early cut haylage in Icelandic horses. 3aacid detergent fiber 3abody weight 3acrude protein 3adiet 3adigestibility 3adigestible energy 3afeces 3afeed intake 3afeeding level 3ageldings 3ahaylage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3aorganic matter 2aAnimal Feedxanalysis 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietxveterinary 2aFeces 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aMale 2aPoaceae1 aLindberg, J.E.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2010 Oct., v. 94, no. 5 p.623-627dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2009.00947.x 7aarticle02700naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002400171245006900195300001600264500002400280520166300304650001301967650001301980650002301993650002702016650001102043650001002054650002902064650001402093650002002107650001702127651001302144651001302157773009202170852000902262856005502271655001202326IND4425503120221121071232.0090905e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442550312DNAL7 a194861682pmid7 a10.1111/j.1745-6584.2009.00577.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerbovšek, Timotej10aInfluences of Aquifer Properties on Flow Dimensions in Dolomites  ap. 660-668.  aIncludes references  aThe paper focuses on analyses and correlations of flow dimensions in different dolomite aquifers in Slovenia. Flow dimensions are obtained through the reinterpretation of 72 pumping tests with the generalized radial flow model, based on the fractional flow dimension. The average value of flow dimensions is 2.16 for all dolomites. A study of flow dimensions in individual aquifers categorized according to their lithological properties shows that higher dimensions occur in massive late-diagenetic Cordevolian and Anisian dolomites compared with bedded Main, Bača, and especially Lower Triassic dolomites, which contain a greater proportion of noncarbonate minerals. Partially penetrating wells have higher flow dimensions than fully penetrating wells. Flow dimensions are poorly correlated with hydraulic conductivities of fractures. When comparing the quantities of major dissolved minerals, obtained by hydrogeochemical inverse modeling, with the values of flow dimensions, the Cordevolian and Anisian dolomites are found to exhibit the highest values of both dissolved dolomite and flow dimensions, indicating that greater dissolution occurs at higher flow dimensions. For other aquifers, data points are more scattered and the correlation is mostly poor. When compared with three-dimensional fractal dimensions of fracture networks, there is no correlation with flow dimensions. However, almost all the values of flow dimensions are lower than the corresponding fractal dimensions in dolomites (average D= 2.77), possibly indicating the channeling of flow within the available space of the fracture networks, consequently reducing the flow dimensions. 3aaquifers 3adolomite 3afractal dimensions 3ahydraulic conductivity 3amodels 3awells 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aGeography 2aWater Movements 2aWater Supply 3aSlovenia 0aSlovenia0 tGround water.g2009 , v. 47, no. 5 p.660-668dBlackwell Publishing Incx0017-467X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-6584.2009.00577.x 7aarticle02626naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011000124300001400234500001500248520147800263650001801741650001001759650002301769650002301792650001201815650001901827650002201846650000901868650002101877650001501898653001601913653000901929653001401938653001101952700001601963700001401979700002001993773011102013852000902124930003302133945001302166946001302179655001202192IND2057958320221121071228.0970624e199701  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205795832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeber, N.10aMetabolism of dietary petroselinic acid: a dead-end metabolite of desaturation/chain elongation reactions  ap. 89-97.  a2019-12-05  aThe role of the position of the cis-double bond in monounsaturated fatty acids on their metabolic behavior was studied by feeding rats triacylglycerols containing high levels of petroselinic (delta 6-cis-octadecenoic acid, n-12 18:1) or oleic acid (delta 9-cis- octadecenoic acid, n-9 18:1). Petroselinic acid from dietary triacylglycerols (coriander oil) was extensively esterified into lipids of rat liver. Chain elongation of petroselinic acid to delta 8-cis-eicosenoic acid (n-12 20:1) as well as chain shortening to delta 4-cis-hexadecenoic acid (n-12 16:1) were the major metabolic reactions, whereas products resulting from desaturation/chain elongation of petroselinic acid were not detectable, suggesting that this fatty acid is a dead-end metabolite of this pathway. In contrast, distinctly detectable proportions of desaturation/chain elongation products of oleic acid, e.g. delta 5,8,11,-all cis-eicosatrienoic acid (n-9 20:3, Mead's acid) were found in the liver lipids of rats fed a high-oleic sunflower oil. Dietary petroselinic acid inhibited desaturation/chain elongation reactions of linoleic acid (delta 9,12-cis,cis-octadecadienoic acid, n-6 18:2) which resulted in reduced levels of arachidonic acid (delta 5,8,11,14-all cis-eicosatetraenoic acid, n-6 20:4) in liver lipids. It is envisaged that petroselinic acid having a delta 6-double bond mimics a product of delta 6 desaturase and thus induces pseudo-product mediated inhibition of the desaturase. 3asunflower oil 3aliver 3aCoriandrum sativum 3aexperimental diets 3aisomers 3aesterification 3afatty acid esters 3arats 3alipid metabolism 3aoleic acid 0afatty acids 0adiet 0aseed oils 0alipids1 aVosmann, K.1 aBruhl, L.1 aMukherjee, K.D.0 tNutrition research.g1997 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.89-97aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01369naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245005500164300001800219500001500237520026300252650002300515650001400538650002300552650001300575650001800588650001200606650001800618650001600636650001700652650001100669653001300680700001400693700001400707700002000721700001700741700001400758773007100772852000900843930003300852945002500885946001300910655001200923IND4401155220221121055507.0080208e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440115522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Since 1990, the FDA has approved several health claims, but has also denied claims that did not meet this standard. The purpose of The Nutrient Disease Relationships: Closing the Scientific Knowledge Gap symposium was to provide researchers with perspectives to keep in mind when designing studies that examine the relationship between a nutrient and a disease or health-related condition, to help close the scientific knowledge gap for nutrient-disease relationships of scientific, consumer, and public health interest. 3aFood and Drug Administration 3aNutrition Labeling and Education Act of 1990 3aexperimental design 3afood labeling 3ahealth claims 3apublic health 2aHealth Education 2aHumans 2aNutrition Disordersxepidemiologyxprevention & control. 2aUnited States Food and Drug Administration 3aUnited States 0aUnited States1 aJohnson, M.A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2005 Feb., v. 135, no. 2 p.338-339dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02071naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007000173300001600243500002400259520119800283650001401481650001001495650001601505650000901521651001701530651001301547700002101560773012401581852000901705856005501714655001201769IND4380993020221121044229.0060613e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438099302DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.2006.00530.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernal, Rodrigo.10aEndangerment of Colombian Palms (Arecaceae): change over 18 years  ap. 151-163.  aIncludes references  aWe compare an assessment of the conservation status of Colombian palms made in 1987 with the current situation in 2005. The number of species considered as threatened (critically endangered + endangered + vulnerable) in 2005 is the same (39) as the number in 1987 (endangered + vulnerable), although both the circumscription of categories and the total species counts for the country have changed between both assessments. Only 16 of the 39 species considered as threatened in 1987 are currently treated as such. The remaining 23 species are now treated as synonyms or have proved to be more widespread than previously known. On the other hand, 23 species have been newly added to the 'threatened' categories. Ten of them are new species, new records or new segregates. We predict that any new species discovered in the Andes of Colombia will prove to be threatened. We estimate that up to 12 species that may potentially become segregated from currently recognized species or species complexes might also be at risk. However, the proportion of threatened palms in the flora is not expected to change considerably as a result of improved understanding of the species' taxonomy or distribution. 3aArecaceae 3aflora 3anew species 3arisk 3aAndes region 3aColombia1 aGaleano, Gloria.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g2006 May, v. 151, no. 1 p.151-163dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.2006.00530.x 7aarticle02725naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245014500182300001800327500002400345520113200369650002101501650001601522650002301538650001301561650002501574650002301599650002201622650001301644650001101657650002001668650002701688650001401715650003601729650002001765650005301785650001301838650002601851650002101877650002401898650003701922700001501959700001701974700001701991773011702008852000902125856008502134655001202219IND4443210420221121025434.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444321042DNAL7 a204737222pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-010-8984-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xiaoyan10aEffects of Surfactant and Salt Species in Reverse Micellar Forward Extraction Efficiency of Isoflavones with Enriched Protein from Soy Flour  ap. 2087-2097.  aIncludes references  aSuitability of reverse micelles of anionic surfactant sodium bis(2-ethyl hexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cationic surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and nonionic surfactant polyoxyethylene p-t-octylphenol (TritonX-100) in organic solvent isooctane for extraction of soy isoflavone-enriching proteins was investigated. The results showed that the order of combined isoflavone contents was SDS>CTAB>Triton X-100>AOT, while the order of protein recovery was SDS>AOT>TritonX-100>CTAB. As compared with ACN-HCl extraction, the total amount of isoflavones was lower than reverse micellar extraction. Ion strength was one of the important conditions to control extraction of isoflavone-enriching proteins with AOT reversed micelles. For the six salt systems, KNO₃, KCl, MgCl₂, CaCl₂, NaCl, and Na₂SO₄, extracted fraction of isoflavone-enriching proteins was measured.

Heterotrophic growth of microalgae is superior due to its high final product concentration; however, the cost of the raw materials is unacceptable if sugar is utilized as the carbon source. The aim of this study is to optimize the lipid accumulation of Chlorella protothecoides by using carbon sources other than glucose in heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures. Different factors such as different carbon sources, carbon to nitrogen ratio, initial pH level, salinity, and rotational speed are studied in affecting the cell growth and the oil accumulation. Our experiments revealed that the heterotrophic and mixotrophic cultures of C. protothecoides grew better than autotrophic cultures. C. protothecoides can grow on glycerol or acetate, as well as on glucose. Several stress factors were confirmed or discovered to significantly increase the lipid content of microalgae cells. The replacement of glycerol and acetate as carbon sources for microalgae cultivations provides potential for waste utilization: glycerol from biodiesel industry and acetate from biohydrogen production. 3aChlorella 3aacetates 3aanimals 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acell growth 3afatty acids 3aglucose 3aglycerol 3ahydrogen production 3alipid content 3amicroalgae 3apH 3araw materials 3asalinity 3awaste utilization 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aChlorellaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCulture Mediaxmetabolism 2aHeterotrophic Processes 2aLipids 2aMicroalgaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aOilsxmetabolism1 aWei, Wei1 aHu, Bo0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 Nov., v. 162, no. 7 p.1978-1995dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-8974-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02883naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245011900163300001600282500002400298520177600322650001502098650002102113650001402134650002002148650001302168650001902181650001402200650001502214650001902229650002102248650000902269651001102278700002002289700001702309700001702326773008502343852000902428856004802437655001202485IND4408477120221120232131.0080801e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440847712DNAL7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1076-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Tim R.10aLitter decomposition and nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics in peatlands and uplands over 12 years in central Canada  ap. 317-325.  aIncludes references  aThe large accumulation of organic matter in peatlands has been partially attributed to litter decomposition rates, which are slowed by a high water table. To test this, we examined whether there were significant differences in the decomposition and N and P dynamics of ten foliar litters and wood blocks at three pairs of upland forest and peatland sites in the transitional grassland, high boreal and low subarctic regions of central Canada, using litterbags collected over a 12-year period. At two of the three pairs, the decomposition rate, as determined by proportion of the original mass remaining after 12 years and by the exponential decay coefficient (k), was faster overall at the upland than at the peatland. In the third pair, there was no significant difference, despite the water table being close to the peat surface; warmer soil temperatures in the peatland than the upland may be the cause. In general, there were small losses or gains of N in the litters after 12 years, compared to the original litter, though there were some differences among litter types and sites, net gains in N likely reflecting the higher exogenous N availability. P was lost from most litters at the two northern pairs of sites, but at the transitional grassland pair, there were large net gains in P and greater variation among litters. The N:P ratio in the original litters ranged from 5 to 26 and after 12 years the ratio narrowed, with the site average of the ten litters ranging from 13 to 22, varying with the soil ratio. Decomposition rates and N and P dynamics after 12 years are different between upland and peatland sites: although the water table is a primary control on these differences, other factors such as temperature and soil nutrient status are also important. 3agrasslands 3ahigh water table 3ahighlands 3amontane forests 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apeatlands 3aphosphorus 3asoil nutrients 3asoil temperature 3awood 3aCanada1 aTrofymow, J.

The karyotypic evolution of Indian muntjac via extensive tandem fusions and several centric fusions are well documented by molecular cytogenetic studies mainly utilizing chromosome paints. To achieve higher resolution mapping, a set of 42 different genomic clones coding for 37 genes and the nucleolar organizer region were used to examine homologies between the cattle (2n = 60), human (2n = 46), Indian muntjac (2n = 6/7) and Chinese muntjac (2n = 46) karyotypes. These genomic clones were mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Localization of genes on all three pairs of M. m. vaginalis chromosomes and on the acrocentric chromosomes of M. reevesi allowed not only the analysis of the evolution of syntenic regions within the muntjac genus but also allowed a broader comparison of synteny with more distantly related species, such as cattle and human, to shed more light onto the evolving genome organization. 3aMuntiacus 3aacrocentric chromosomes 3acattle 3achromosome mapping 3aclones 3aevolution 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenes 3ahumans 3akaryotyping 3anucleolus organizer region 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes 2aChromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aIn Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence 2aKaryotyping 2aMale 2aMuntjacsxclassificationxgenetics.1 aMincheva, Antoaneta1 aScheuermann, Markus O.1 aGautier, Mathieu1 aYang, Fentang1 aBuitkamp, Johannes1 aStrissel, Pamela L.1 aStrick, Reiner1 aRowley, Janet D.1 aLichter, Peter0 tGenetica.g2008 Nov., v. 134, no. 3 p.345-351dSpringer Netherlandsx0016-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-008-9242-1 7aarticle01830naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001800218520076700236650001101003650001901014650002601033650001601059650001801075650001401093650001401107650001601121650001001137653001701147653001101164653001501175653001501190653002301205700002001228773011601248852000901364930003301373945001301406946001301419655001201432IND2057101920221120232218.0970514e199410  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205710192DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadek, I.A.10aEffect of diallyl sulfide on toad liver tumor induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene  ap. 1513-1521.  aHepatocellular carcinoma were recognized in the toad, Bufo viridis, in 18 cases out of 50 cases by administration of 1 mg of 7,12- dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/toad, once/week for 12 weeks.

It is concluded that DAS have inhibitory effect on toad liver tumor during initiation. 3aAllium 3aplant extracts 3aantineoplastic agents 3acarcinogens 3adose response 3acarcinoma 3aincidence 3ahepatocytes 3atoads 0abufo viridis 0atiming 0ainitiation 0ainhibition 0asulfides (organic)1 aAbdul-Salam, F.0 tNutrition research.g1994 Oct., v. 14, no. 10 p.1513-1521aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19970602b19970606c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02285naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245008900197300001600286500002400302520099700326650001301323650001101336650001201347650001301359650001301372650001301385650000901398650002501407650002501432650002301457650001401480650002501494650002501519650003901544650002001583650002201603700002501625700002501650773010001675852000901775856005501784655001201839IND4461439320221120223706.0110812e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446143932DNAL7 a217495972pmid7 a10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01650.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTreseder, Kathleen K.10aEvolutionary trade-offs among decomposers determine responses to nitrogen enrichment  ap. 933-938.  aIncludes references  aEcology Letters (2011) 14: 933-938 ABSTRACT: Evolutionary trade-offs among ecological traits are one mechanism that could determine the responses of functional groups of decomposers to global changes such as nitrogen (N) enrichment. We hypothesised that bacteria targeting recalcitrant carbon compounds require relatively high levels of N availability to support the construction costs of requisite extracellular and transport enzymes. Indeed, we found that taxa that used more recalcitrant (i.e. larger and cyclic) carbon compounds were more prevalent in ocean waters with higher nitrate concentrations. Compared to recalcitrant carbon users, labile carbon users targeted more organic N compounds, were found in relatively nitrate-poor waters, and were more common in higher latitude soils, which is consistent with the paradigm that N-limitation is stronger at higher latitudes. Altogether, evolutionary trade-offs may limit recalcitrant carbon users to habitats with higher N availability. 3abacteria 3acarbon 3aenzymes 3ahabitats 3alatitude 3anitrogen 3asoil 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiological Evolution 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aNitratesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aSeawaterxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aSoilxchemistry 2aSoil Microbiology1 aKivlin, Stephanie N.1 aHawkes, Christine V.0 tEcology letters.g2011 Sept., v. 14, no. 9 p.933-938dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01650.x 7aarticle02490naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010500181300001800286500002400304520103400328650003201362650001901394650001901413650002201432650001201454650002001466650001001486650002801496650001101524650001801535650001501553650001301568650004201581650002001623650004301643650003901686650002301725650005301748700002001801773011701821852000901938856008501947655001202032IND4443209320221120213154.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444320932DNAL7 a204678322pmid7 a10.1007/s12010-010-8973-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Jin-Ming10aGene Expression in Secondary Metabolism and Metabolic Switching Phase of Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 1961-1977.  aIncludes references  aLigninolytic enzymes are well-known to play the crucial roles in lignin biodegradation and have potential applications in industrial processes. The filamentous white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, has been widely used as a model organism for studying these ligninolytic enzymes that are able to degrade the lignin during the secondary metabolism. To study the gene expression in secondary metabolism and metabolic switching phase of P. chrysosporium, we constructed a metabolic-switching phase suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library and a secondary metabolic phase SSH cDNA library to compare their mRNA expression profiles. We isolated the genes that are specially expressed and subsequently identified four genes that specially expressed during metabolic-switching phase while 22 genes in secondary metabolic phase. Accordingly, these specially expressed genes might play key roles in different metabolic stages, which would offer more new insights into the shift from nitrogen to lignin metabolism. 3aPhanerochaete chrysosporium 3abiodegradation 3acDNA libraries 3acomplementary DNA 3aenzymes 3agene expression 3agenes 3aindustrial applications 3alignin 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3asuppression subtractive hybridization 3awhite-rot fungi 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aPhanerochaetexenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aZhang, Yi-zheng0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2010 Nov., v. 162, no. 7 p.1961-1977dHumana Press Incx0273-22897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-010-8973-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03669naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002100171245012700192300001400319500002400333500001500357520198500372650003802357650001302395650002602408650001802434650002602452650001702478650001702495650002102512650002502533650001002558650001802568650001702586650004402603650002302647650003102670650003802701653001002739700002402749700002302773700002302796700002202819700002202841700002202863700002102885700002102906700002102927773010302948852000903051856005503060655001203115IND4404226120221120200615.0080412e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440422612DNAL7 a182485102pmid7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.01030.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFathinejad, Sara12aA carboxysomal carbon-concentrating mechanism in the cyanelles of the 'coelacanth' of the algal world, Cyanophora paradoxa  ap. 27-32.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aCyanelles are the peculiar plastids of glaucocystophyte algae that retained a peptidoglycan wall from the ancestral cyanobacterial endosymbiont. All cyanobacteria and most algae possess an inorganic carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM) that involves a microcompartment - carboxysomes in prokaryotes and pyrenoids in eukaryotes - harboring the bulk of cellular (plastidic) Rubisco. In the case of the living fossil, Cyanophora paradoxa, the existence of a CCM was a matter of debate. Microarray data revealing 142 CO₂-responsive genes (induced or repressed through a shift from high to low CO₂ conditions), gas exchange measurements and measurements of photosynthetic affinity provided strong support for a CCM. We favor a recent hypothesis that glaucocystophyte cyanelles as the closest cousins to cyanobacteria among plastids contain 'eukaryotic carboxysomes': bicarbonate enrichment within cyanelles should be considerably higher than in chloroplasts with their pyrenoid-based CCM. Thus, the stress-bearing function of the peptidoglycan layer, the other unique heritage, would be indispensable. An isolation method for cyanelle 'carboxysomes' was developed and the protein components other than Rubisco analyzed by MS. Rubisco activase was identified and corroborated by western blotting. The well-established cyanelle in vitro import system allows to use them as 'honorary cyanobacteria': assembly processes of supramolecular structures as phycobilisomes and carboxysomes thus can be studied after import of nucleus-encoded precursor proteins and subsequent fractionation. Even minor components can easily be tracked and a surprisingly dynamic view is obtained. Labeled pre-activase was imported into isolated cyanelles and 30% of the mature protein was found to be incorporated into the carboxysome fraction. A final decision between carboxysome or pyrenoid must await the identification of cyanelle carbonic anhydrase and, especially, the demonstration of shell proteins. 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aproteins 3acarbonate dehydratase 3afractionation 3amicroarray technology 3agas exchange 3abicarbonates 3aWestern blotting 3aisolation techniques 3agenes 3aCyanobacteria 3achloroplasts 2aAlgal Proteinsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCyanophoraxcytologyxmetabolism. 0aAlgae1 aSteiner, Jürgen M.1 aReipert, Siegfried1 aMarchetti, Martina1 aAllmaier, Günter1 aBurey, Suzanne C.1 aOhnishi, Norikazu1 aFukuzawa, Hideya1 aLöffelhardt, W.1 aBohnert, Hans J.0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2008 May, v. 133, no. 1 p.27-32dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.01030.x 7aarticle03121naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245010800186300001600294500002400310520168000334650002002014650002602034650001002060650001302070650001102083650002602094650001602120650007602136650001402212650003002226650007702256651001202333651004502345651001602390653002602406653002802432653001702460653002002477653002402497773008502521852000902606856004802615655001202663IND4450762720221120191528.0110316e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445076272DNAL7 a206288872pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-010-0328-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewsham, Kevin K.10aStructural changes to a mycothallus along a latitudinal transect through the maritime and sub-Antarctic  ap. 231-236.  aIncludes references  aPrevious studies have shown the leafy liverwort Cephaloziella varians to associate consistently with fungi, typically the ericoid mycorrhizal symbiont Rhizoscyphus ericae, across a wide latitudinal gradient in the maritime and sub-Antarctic. Hitherto, however, there are no quantitative data on the intensity of colonisation of C. varians by fungal structures in the natural environment and how colonisation might vary with changing environmental conditions. A study is hence reported showing that the frequency of colonisation by fungal structures of C. varians alters along a latitudinal transect from South Georgia (54° S, 38° W) to Moutonnée Valley on Alexander Island (71° S, 68° W). The percentage of stem length colonised by dark septate (DS) hyphae increased significantly along the transect, from 30% at South Georgia to 97% at Moutonnée Valley. In contrast, the percentage of stem length colonised by hyaline hyphae decreased significantly, from 85% at South Georgia to 13% at Moutonnée Valley, and that colonised by hyphal coils similarly decreased from 71% at the former location to 15% at the latter. The frequencies of DS hyphae were negatively associated with mean annual and seasonal air temperatures, whereas those of hyaline septate hyphae and hyphal coils were positively associated with air temperatures. Coils at northerly locations were more convoluted than those at southerly locations. The data indicate that hyphal coils, usually associated with nutrient exchange between partners in ericoid mycorrhizas, do form in C. varians tissues in the maritime and sub-Antarctic, but that the frequency of these structures diminishes in colder habitats. 3aair temperature 3aenvironmental factors 3afungi 3ahabitats 3ahyphae 3amosses and liverworts 3amycorrhizae 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aEcosystem 2aHepatophytaxmicrobiology 2aMycorrhizaexgrowth & developmentxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 3aGeorgia 3aSouth Georgia and South Sandwich Islands 0aAntarctica. 0aCephaloziella varians 0aDark septate endophytes 0aHyphal coils 0aLeafy liverwort 0aRhizoscyphus ericae0 tMycorrhiza.g2011 Apr., v. 21, no. 3 p.231-236dSpringer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-010-0328-0 7aarticle03389naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001700181245011900198300001800317500002400335506007600359520163800435506003702073650002102110650002202131650002502153650002502178650002402203650000902227650002102236650001102257650001702268650002202285650001102307650001702318650001102335650001502346650002002361650001602381651001002397700002102407700001902428700002202447700001702469700002302486700002102509700002202530700001702552700001702569773013602586852000902722856008002731655001202811IND4419024420221207131420.0090410e20090415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441902442DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02387-082doi7 aPMC26751962pmcid7 a192339502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoi, Katsumi10aStimulation of Expression of a Silica-Induced Protein (Sip) in Thermus thermophilus by Supersaturated Silicic Acid  ap. 2406-2413.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe effects of silicic acid on the growth of Thermus thermophilus TMY, an extreme thermophile isolated from a siliceous deposit formed from geothermal water at a geothermal power plant in Japan, were examined at 75°C. At concentrations higher than the solubility of amorphous silica (400 to 700 ppm SiO₂), a silica-induced protein (Sip) was isolated from the cell envelope fraction of log-phase TMY cells grown in the presence of supersaturated silicic acid. Two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the molecular mass and pI of Sip to be about 35 kDa and 9.5, respectively. Induction of Sip expression occurred within 1 h after the addition of a supersaturating concentration of silicic acid to TM broth. Expression of Sip-like proteins was also observed in other thermophiles, including T. thermophilus HB8 and Thermus aquaticus YT-1. The amino acid sequence of Sip was similar to that of the predicted solute-binding protein of the Fe³⁺ ABC transporter in T. thermophilus HB8 (locus tag, TTHA1628; GenBank accession no. NC_006461; GeneID, 3169376). The sip gene (987-bp) product showed 87% identity with the TTHA1628 product and the presumed Fe³⁺-binding protein of T. thermophilus HB27 (locus tag TTC1264; GenBank accession no. NC_005835; GeneID, 2774619). Within the genome, sip is situated as a component of the Fbp-type ABC transporter operon, which contains a palindromic structure immediately downstream of sip. This structure is conserved in other T. thermophilus genomes and may function as a terminator that causes definitive Sip expression in response to silica stress.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aABC transporters 3aThermus aquaticus 3aThermus thermophilus 3aamino acid sequences 3agel electrophoresis 3aloci 3amolecular weight 3aoperon 3apower plants 3aprotein synthesis 3asilica 3asilicic acid 3asodium 3asolubility 3astress response 3awater power 3aJapan1 aFujino, Yasuhiro1 aInagaki, Fumio1 aKawatsu, Ryouichi1 aTahara, Miki1 aOhshima, Toshihisa1 aOkaue, Yoshihiro1 aYokoyama, Takushi1 aIwai, Satoru1 aOgata, Seiya0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2009 Apr. 15, v. 75, no. 8 p.2406-2413dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02387-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02471naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245008900134300001600223500001500239520108000254650001601334650001201350650001001362650002501372650002001397650001501417650001901432650002401451650002601475650001001501650001501511650002201526650001601548650001201564650001401576650001301590650001401603650001701617650001701634650002501651653002401676653001101700653001601711700001601727700001701743773011301760852000901873930003301882945001301915946001301928655001201941IND2060208320221120164959.0971021e199503  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206020832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Papendorp, D.H.10aBiochemical profile of osteoporotic patients on essential fatty acid supplementation  ap. 325-334.  a2019-12-05  aOsteoporosis is the most frequent metabolic bone disorder in developed communities. No single mechanism can adequately explain the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. Recently new biochemical markers for metabolic bone disease, such as osteocalcin and procollagen have been identified and these parameters have been proven to be indicative of bone turnover. In this study, markers of bone turnover were monitored in 40 osteoporotic patients. Patients were divided into four groups to receive one of the following dietary supplements: evening primrose oil; fish oil; a mixture of evening primrose and fish oil or olive oil (placebo), for 16 weeks. Patients supplemented with fish oil showed an increase in serum calcium and an increase in urinary calcium clearance (p < 0.05). Osteocalcin as well as procollagen increased in the fish oil and the fish oil/evening primrose oil supplemented groups (p < 0.05). Increased unsaturation of membranes seems to improve calcium absorption while changes in biochemical bone parameters is indicative of stimulation of osteoblastic activity. 3aosteocalcin 3aelderly 3aurine 3aphosphatidylcholines 3arenal clearance 3acreatinine 3acell membranes 3adietary supplements 3aessential fatty acids 3awomen 3aphosphates 3aOenothera biennis 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3aolive oil 3acollagen 3afish oils 3aosteoporosis 3aerythrocytes 3aalkaline phosphatase 0aplant fats and oils 0aratios 0aprocollagen1 aCoetzer, H.1 aKruger, M.C.0 tNutrition research.g1995 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.325-334aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01620naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009300165300001600258500002400274520061900298650002000917650001900937650001200956650001100968650001600979650001200995650001301007700002401020700001901044700002101063700001801084773011101102852000901213856004801222655001201270IND4385646220221120164758.0061203e200611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438564622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10725-006-9112-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBačkor, Martin10aCadmium-induced stimulation of stress-protein hsp70 in lichen photobiont Trebouxia erici  ap. 159-164.  aIncludes references  aThe expression of stress protein 70 (hsp70) was studied in lichen photobiont Trebouxia erici during short-term exposition to cadmium and copper (0.0, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 μM). We found two isoforms of hsp70 in the untreated as well as in heavy metal-treated cells due to the maintenance of protein homeostasis. Cu-treated cells had a relatively constant amount of hsp70 over all the tested concentrations. However, Cd caused an increase in hsp70 expression, especially at the lowest concentration (1.0 μM). Higher Cd concentrations were associated with acute toxicity and a reduced expression of hsp70 in the cells. 3aTrebouxia erici 3aacute toxicity 3acadmium 3acopper 3ahomeostasis 3alichens 3aproteins1 aGibalová, Antónia1 aBud'ová, Jana1 aMikeš, Jaromír1 aSolár, Peter0 tPlant growth regulation.g2006 Nov., v. 50, no. 2-3 p.159-164dKluwer Academic Publishersx0167-69037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-006-9112-8 7aarticle02097naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245013300169300001800302500002400320520097100344650001301315650001601328650001101344650002301355650001201378650001001390650001201400650001301412650001801425650001001443650001101453650003001464650001301494700001701507700001601524773009701540852000901637856005301646655001201699IND4432009220221120164812.0100129e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443200922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.0982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Yang-Guo10aEffect of carbon sources on sulfidogenic bacterial communities during the starting-up of acidogenic sulfate-reducing bioreactors  ap. 2952-2959.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of different carbon sources on the starting-up duration of sulfidogenic bioreactor and corresponding bacterial communities were investigated. The bioreactor starting-up duration was closely dependent on the complexity and availability of the carbon sources. 16S rRNA gene diversity of climax bacterial communities developed in each bioreactor had an increasing tendency for the carbon resource of lactate, acetate/ethanol, glucose and molasses. At the steady stage of bioreactors, the molasses-fed bacterial community pattern grouped with that of glucose-fed and acetate/ethanol-fed grouped with that of lactate-fed, both of which separated each other and departed further from the seed sludge. The present study concludes that utilization of simple carbon sources that are readily utilized by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can not only increase the fraction of SRB and thus improve sulfate removal efficiency, but also shorten the starting-up duration. 3aacetates 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3aclimax communities 3aethanol 3agenes 3aglucose 3amolasses 3aribosomal RNA 3aseeds 3asludge 3asulfate-reducing bacteria 3asulfates1 aWang, Ai-Jie1 aRen, Nan-Qi0 tBioresource technology.g2010 May, v. 101, no. 9 p.2952-2959dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.11.098 7aarticle01526naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002300181245009400204300001800298500002400316506007600340520039200416506003700808650004000845650001500885650001000900650001300910700002100923700002100944773013400965852000901099856008001108655001201188IND4457096320221207131419.0110423e20110501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445709632DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02764-102doi7 aPMC31263982pmcid7 a213780382pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParsons, Sandra K.10aSubstructure within Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica Isolates from Australian Wildlife  ap. 3151-3153.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMultilocus sequence typing of 56 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica strains isolated from Australian wildlife hosts was performed.

Thirty (27 Thai and 3 Malaysian) and 37 (32 Thai and 5 Malaysian) colonies of A. andreniformis were sampled for morphometric and genetic analysis, respectively. For morphometric analysis, 20 informative characters were used to determine the variation. After plotting the factor scores, A. andreniformis from across Thailand were found to belong to one group, a notion further supported by a cluster analysis generated dendrogram. However, clinal patterns in groups of bee morphometric characters were revealed by linear regression analysis. The body size of bees increases from South to North but decreases from West to East, although this may reflect altitude rather than longitude. Genetic variation was determined by sequence analysis of a 520 bp fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit b (cytb). DNA polymorphism among bees from the mainland of Thailand is lower than that from Phuket Island and Chiang Mai. Although two main different groups of bees were obtained from phylogenetic trees constructed by neighbor-joining and unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages programs, no clear geographic signal was present. Thus, while the minor group (B) contained all of the samples from the only island sampled (Phuket in the south), but not the southern mainland colonies, it also contained samples from the far northern inland region of Chiang Mai, other samples of which were firmly rooted in the major group (A). 3aApis florea 3abody size 3acluster analysis 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenetic variation 3ahoney bees 3alinear models 3amorphometry 3aphylogeny 3aregression analysis 3asequence analysis 3aThailand1 aCHANCHAO, CHANPEN1 aWongsiri, Siriwat.0 tInsect science.g2007 Dec., v. 14, no. 6 p.451-460dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1672-96097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2007.00173.x 7aarticle02787naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012000127300001600247500001500263520130600278650002501584650002301609650002501632650001101657650001601668650001801684650001701702650002601719650001201745650001201757650000901769650002101778650002001799650002001819650001001839650002301849650003301872650002801905650001901933650002401952653001601976653000901992700001602001700001502017700001702032700001502049773011302064852000902177930003302186945001302219946001302232655001202245IND2057961120221120041713.0970624e199701  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205796112DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoundras, C.10aLipid metabolism and lipoprotein susceptibility to peroxidation are affected by a protein-deficient diet in the rat  ap. 125-135.  a2019-12-05  aTo investigate the influence of the dietary protein level on plasma cholesterol homeostasis and lipoprotein susceptibility to peroxidation, rats were adapted to semipurified diets with different levels of casein (8, 16, or 32%). Increasing the dietary protein level had a positive influence on the plasma and liver availability of sulfur amino acids, as well as on taurine and glutathione concentrations. Rats fed the protein-deficient diet (8%) exhibited a slight hypercholesterolemia, together with an induction of liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase and a low activity of fatty acid synthase, compared with controls (16% casein diet). In contrast, feeding high-protein diets resulted in a cholesterol-lowering effect together with a lowered activity of liver HMG CoA reductase. The susceptibility of isolated lipoprotein (VLDL + LDL) fractions to copper-induced oxidation was also investigated: there was a shortened lag time period for conjugated diene production in rats fed the 8% casein diet. Thus, with a protein-deficient diet, a slight hypercholesterolemia could be aggravated by a high susceptibility of lipoprotein to peroxidation, probably because of a limiting bioavailability of sulfur amino acids in plasma and a depletion of intracellular glutathione and taurine. 3aprotein deficiencies 3alipid peroxidation 3ahypercholesterolemia 3asulfur 3aglutathione 3adose response 3ablood plasma 3abiological resistance 3ataurine 3aligases 3arats 3alipid metabolism 3aenzyme activity 3adietary protein 3aliver 3aexperimental diets 3avery low density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3aprotein intake 3afatty-acid synthase 0aamino acids 0adiet1 aDemigne, C.1 aMorand, C.1 aLevrat, M.A.1 aRemesy, C.0 tNutrition research.g1997 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.125-135aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle02902naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007200131300001800203500001500221520122500236650000901461650001301470650002301483650001301506650002201519650001001541650002001551650001101571650001501582650001101597650001701608650000801625650001801633650000901651650001301660650001201673650001501685650000901700650001901709650001001728650002701738650001201765650001801777651001101795653001001806653002101816653001001837653001001847653000901857653001401866653001201880653001801892653002301910653001201933653001701945653003301962700001701995700002102012773011502033852000902148930003302157945001302190946001302203655001202216IND2059781620221120041808.0970919e199608  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205978162DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenezes, E.W. de10aStarch availability in Brazilian foods.

The digestion of these starch samples was also followed by an "in vitro" hydrolysis technique. In animals the glycemic response of polenta, sandwich loaf and white rice was significantly different from beans (Carioca and Fradinho) and wheat bran (p<0.05). For extruded corn, white bread, curau, potato, corn flour, beiju macaroni, canjica, raw manioc flour and manioc the glycemic response was similar. In humans, beans with and without hull produced a significantly lower glycemic response compared to polenta, rice and rice with beans. Plasma insulin levels were significantly lower in individuals fed all diets containing beans compared to others test diets. The secretion of glucagon like peptide-1 7-36 (GLP-1 7-36) was the same for polenta or bean diets. The hull of the bean had no effect on the glucose and insulin responses. The positive correlation between "in vitro" digestibility and glycemic response in animals (y = 721 + 3.7x; r = 0.824, p < 0.01) and humans (y = 787 + 3.9x; r = 0.935, p < 0.01) allowed the use of the "in vitro" technique for screening starchy foods. 3arice 3apeptides 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3apotatoes 3atraditional foods 3apasta 3abioavailability 3astarch 3acorn flour 3abreads 3ablood plasma 3amen 3ablood glucose 3acorn 3aduration 3ainsulin 3ahydrolysis 3arats 3aextruded foods 3ahulls 3ain vitro digestibility 3acassava 3aanimal models 3aBrazil 0afoods 0astarch digestion 0aflour 0acurau 0abeju 0aresponses 0acanjica 0afradinho bean 0aphaseolus sinensis 0apolenta 0acarioca bean 0aglucagon like peptide-1 7-361 aLajolo, F.M.1 aServalli, E.A.G.0 tNutrition research.g1996 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.1425-1436aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle03432naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010100125300001800226500001500244520207000259650001602329650001002345650001002355650001102365650001402376650001702390650001602407650002502423650001602448650002102464650002402485650001702509650002902526650001002555650002302565650003302588650001602621650002802637650001802665653000902683653001402692653002002706700001702726773011502743852000902858930003302867945001302900946001302913655001202926IND2059780620221120032124.0970919e199608  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205978062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhor, H.T.10aEffect of dietary supplementation of tocotrienols and tocopherols on serum lipids in the hamster  ap. 1391-1401.  a2019-12-05  aMale Syrian Golden hamsters were fed on semi-synthetic diets containing palm olein triglycerides (POTG) as the source of dietary lipid. The POTG isolated from commercial palm olein were supplemented with 72 ppm of tocopherols (T) or 162 or 1000 ppm of tocotrienols (T3) isolated from palm fatty acid distillate for 45 days. The animals grew well and healthy. There were no significant difference in body weight gains. At the end of the experiments, the hamsters were fasted overnight and blood was taken by cardiac puncture. Serum was prepared by centrifugation at room temperature. Blood lipids were assayed by Sigma enzyme kits and serum vitamin E levels were analyzed by normal phase HPLC with a fluorescent detector. Our results show that supplementation of POTG with 72 ppm of tocopherols (POTG-T) raised the serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C levels and lowered the serum TG level as compared to that of the POTG but the differences were not statistically significant. Supplementation of POTG with 162 ppm of tocotrienols (POTG-T3L) lowered the serum TC level significantly (P<0.05), but it did not significantly lower the LDL-C, HDL-C and serum TG levels as compared with the POTG group Supplementation of POTG with higher amounts of tocotrienols i.e. 1000 ppm did not result in further reduction in serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels as compared to the POTG-T3L group; on the contrary, the POTG-T3H group raised LDL-C level significantly when compared to the POTG-T3L group. Analysis of the serum and liver vitamin E levels show that alpha-T was the main vitamin E in the serum and liver irrespective of whether tocopherols or tocotrienols were supplemented to the oils. Small amounts of tocotrienols appeared in the serum and liver only when tocotrienols were supplemented at high level, 1000 ppm. These results indicate that tocotrienols possess hypocholesterolemic effect and tocopherols may have slight hypercholesterolemic effect in the hamster. Supplementation with high level of tocotrienols did not increase the hypocholesterolemic effect of the tocotrienols. 3atocopherols 3aheart 3aolein 3aweight 3apalm oils 3ablood lipids 3ablood serum 3aMesocricetus auratus 3abody weight 3atriacylglycerols 3avitamin supplements 3atocotrienols 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aliver 3aexperimental diets 3avery low density lipoprotein 3acholesterol 3alow density lipoprotein 3aanimal models 0adiet 0avitamin E 0agolden hamsters1 aChieng, D.Y.0 tNutrition research.g1996 Aug., v. 16, no. 8 p.1391-1401aNutrition research (New York, N.Y.)x0271-53177nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdHBI  aOther US 7aarticle01739naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008000125300001600205520056500221650002700786650001000813650001800823650002500841650002100866650002200887650002000909650001200929650002300941650002700964650001700991650001701008650000901025650001301034653002301047653001601070653001901086700001901105773011301124852000901237930003301246945001301279946001301292655001201305IND2057652120221120023518.0970612e199604  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205765212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPond, W.G.10aGenetically diverse pig models for neonatal cholesterol nutrition: a review  ap. 707-721.  aLipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis in swine are reviewed in relation to the use of the pig as a model for studying neonatal cholesterol nutrition.

  1 aKallsen, D.E.10aEarly Differences in the Intensity of Alternate Bearing Among Selected Pistachio Genotypes  ap. 1740-1743.  aAlternate bearing (alternating years with high and low yields) is a prominent characteristic of 'Kerman' pistachio (Pistacia vera L.), the primary California cultivar. The degree of alternate bearing is described by alternate bearing index values from 0 (identical yields every year) to 1 (complete alternate bearing). Two separate and replicated trials designed to evaluate selections from a breeding program were conducted in the southwest (Kern County) and northeast (Madera County) areas of the San Joaquin Valley of California. Yields from the scion genotypes 'Kerman', 'Golden Hills', 'Lost Hills', 'B5-8', and 'B19-1' on PG1 rootstock were measured from 5- to 9-year-old trees in Kern County and from 5- to 7-year-old 'Kerman', 'Golden Hills', 'Lost Hills', and 'B5-8' trees on PG1 and UCB1 rootstock in Madera County. In Kern County, average annual yields among genotypes varied from a low of 208 to a high of 5273 kg.ha(-1). Differences in the alternate bearing indices among genotypes were significant and ranged from 0.10 for 'Lost Hills' to 0.80 for 'B19-1'. A similar pattern was observed for alternate bearing indices at the Madera County trial. In this younger trial, scion genotype had more influence on alternate bearing indices than did rootstock. Marked differences in the intensity of alternate bearing of young trees in these two trials suggest that alternate bearing might be amenable to selection in breeding programs. However, the observation that 'B5-8', with an alternate bearing index of 0.74, varied significantly from its female parent 'Kerman' at 0.36 suggests that inheritance is complex. 3aPistacia vera 3apistachios 3aalternate bearing 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3aplant genetic resources 3acrop yield 3acultivars 3ageographical variation 3ascions 3arootstocks 3aplant age 3aartificial selection 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aCalifornia1 aHoltz, B.0 tHortScience.g2007 Dec., v. 42, no. 7 p.1740-1743x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL  a20080522b20080606c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/15  aOther US 7aarticle01813naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009800165300001600263500002400279520095100303650001601254650001301270650001701283650001101300700001801311773011201329852000901441856008501450655001201535IND4420959320221117171042.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442095932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00449-008-0263-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwon, Kyung Han10aOptimal microbial adaptation routes for the rapid degradation of high concentration of phenol  ap. 435-442.  aIncludes references  aPseudomonas fluorescence KNU417 was able to degrade up to 700 mg/L of phenol in 65 h but could not degrade 1,000 mg/L of phenol. Phenol degradation rate was noticeably enhanced by pre-adaptation. In addition, the cell was able to degrade up to 1,300 mg/L of phenol by pre-adapting to 700 mg/L of phenol. Repeated adaptations to the same concentration of phenol showed negligible increase in degradation rate. Also, relatively low concentration of phenol (100-700 mg/L) required only one pre-adaptation while high concentration (1,000 mg/L) did two consecutive stepwise pre-adaptations for rapid degradation. Optimal adaptation routes were suggested for the fast phenol degradation. For example, 1,000 mg/L of phenol was degraded as fast as in 48 h when the cell was pre-adapted to 100 and 300 mg/L of phenol sequentially. The mechanism of adaptation was explained in terms of catechol 1,2-dioxygenase induction, related to aromatic ring cleavage. 3aPseudomonas 3acatechol 3afluorescence 3aphenol1 aYeom, Sung Ho0 tBioprocess and biosystems engineering.g2009 June, v. 32, no. 4 p.435-442dSpringer-Verlagx1615-75917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00449-008-0263-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02437naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008000163300001400243500002400257520139500281650001901676650001801695650001101713650000901724651001701733653002601750653001101776653002101787653001801808653002301826700002201849700002101871773008901892852000901981856008501990655001202075IND4420929420221117171018.0090522s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442092942DNAL7 a10.1007/s00382-008-0411-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSahlée, Erik10aInfluence of the boundary layer height on the global air-sea surface fluxes  ap. 33-44.  aIncludes references  aResults from large-eddy simulations and field measurements have previously shown that the velocity field is influenced by the boundary layer height, z i , during close to neutral, slightly unstable, atmospheric stratification. During such conditions the non-dimensional wind profile, φ m , has been found to be a function of both z/L and z i /L. At constant z/L, φ m decreases with decreasing boundary layer height. Since φ m is directly related to the parameterizations of the air-sea surface fluxes, these results will have an influence when calculating the surface fluxes in weather and climate models. The global impact of this was estimated using re-analysis data from 1979 to 2001 and bulk parameterizations. The results show that the sum of the global latent and sensible mean heat fluxes increase by 0.77 W m⁻² or about 1% and the mean surface stress increase by 1.4 mN m⁻² or 1.8% when including the effects of the boundary layer height in the parameterizations. However, some regions show a larger response. The greatest impact is found over the tropical oceans between 30°S and 30°N. In this region the boundary layer height influences the non-dimensional wind profile during extended periods of time. In the mid Indian Ocean this results in an increase of the mean annual heat fluxes by 2.0 W m⁻² and an increase of the mean annual surface stress by 2.6 mN m⁻². 3aclimate models 3aheat transfer 3aoceans 3awind 3aIndian Ocean 0aBoundary layer height 0aERA-40 0aLatent heat flux 0aMomentum flux 0aSensible heat flux1 aSmedman, Ann-Sofi1 aHögström, Ulf.0 tClimate dynamics.g2009 July, v. 33, no. 1 p.33-44dSpringer-Verlagx0930-75757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00382-008-0411-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01989naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245014000144300001600284520070200300650001201002650001901014650002501033650002601058650002601084650002201110650003601132650002701168650002201195650003301217650002301250650002801273650003101301653001801332700001901350700001801369700001701387773008301404852000901487930003301496945001301529946001301542655001201555IND2046674620221123033905.0950630e199505  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204667462DNAL7 a77569022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStout, S.J.10aDetermination of hydramethylnon residues in grass by liquid chromatography with confirmation by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry  ap. 862-867.  aAn improved method for determination of hydramethylnon residues in pasture grass is described.

To improve spawning conditions, projects involving reintroduction of spawning gravel have recently been conducted in many streams and rivers. However, systematic monitoring of these spawning gravel restoration projects is limited.The overall aim of this paper was to evaluate gravel reintroduction as a long-term salmonid rehabilitation method in 32 lowland streams. Displacement of gravel and abundance of original gravel was assessed on each site along with spawning activity and density of fry. In three streams, Gels Å, Stensbæk and Ryds Å, intensive studies of spawning activity, nursery habitat development and densities of trout fry and young-of-the-year (YOY), were performed the following year, including both restored reaches and upstream control reaches.Downstream displacement of gravel was most common at sites where gravel was reintroduced without further improvement, although these sites exhibited the highest density of YOY brown trout (Salmo trutta), evidencing that the remaining gravel is still functional. The intensive study of three streams showed that spawning was enhanced by the introduction of spawning gravel at the restored sites compared to control sites and that habitat quality generally were improved. Our results also suggest complex interactions exist between spawning activity, migrating trout and the emergence and survival of fry and YOY trout and the habitat conditions provided in regulated lowland Danish streams.Our results clearly indicate that reintroduction of spawning gravel to restore fish populations in river systems warrants consideration of the differences in habitat quality that may occur among the reaches within a river system. Furthermore, spawning and nursery habitats should be present in all reaches to enhance survival of trout on re-instated gravel. To increase our knowledge of spawning gravel restoration systematic monitoring and assessment out of projects are required following project implementation.

Nevertheless, the effects on both shoot and root characteristics for deciduous woody species received little attention so far. In this study, the objective was to understand the effect of aboveground flexing treatments on the development of structural, mechanical and physiological root and shoot characteristics for two deciduous tree species, Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and English oak (Quercus robur L.). Flexing treatments were performed using an electromechanical device with a rotating arm touching and bending the plants at regular intervals. A wide range of stem, shoot as well as root system characteristics was measured. The different flexing treatments altered above- and belowground plant development for both species, with strongest effects on Quercus and most significant differences between the control and the unidirectional flexing treatment. Some responses are in accordance with previous findings, such as stem eccentricity and reduced shoot elongation under unidirectional flexing, but others are renewing, such as the lower stomatal density and larger epidermal cell surface for the Quercus plants under variable flexing direction. Despite some common responses, both species frequently differed in the way they were affected. Belowground, Quercus plants under unidirectional flexing invested relatively more in their first order root and deeper second order roots, whereas Robinia plants allocated relatively more to fine root biomass and horizontal shallow roots. Both strategies potentially increased pull-out as well as overturning resistance in their own way. The presented findings are valid for young trees grown in small containers. Based on practical know-how and shortcomings experienced in the course of this experiment, methodological recommendations are formulated. We finally stress the complex variability in growth responses, especially for root systems, observed in different studies and related to dissimilarity in species, soil conditions, plant history or type of mechanical perturbation. 3aQuercus robur 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3abiomass 3aconifers 3acontainers 3aplant development 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil 3atrees 3awoody plants1 aPannemans, Barbara1 aDanjon, Frédéric1 aDe Proft, Maurice1 aDe Baets, Sarah1 aDe Baerdemaeker, Josse1 aPoesen, Jean1 aMuys, Bart0 tTrees.g2009 Dec., v. 23, no. 6 p.1213-1228dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-009-0360-x 7aarticle01744naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001600221500002400237520094500261650002301206650001401229650001301243650001301256650001601269651001001285700001301295700001501308773012201323852000901445655001201454IND4365182520221123030220.0041025e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND436518252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLindner, R.10aExtended genetic resources of Dactylis glomerata subsp. izcoi in Galicia (northwest Spain)  ap. 437-442.  aIncludes references  aDactylis glomerata subsp. izcoi, endemic to Galicia (NW Spain), includes diploid and tetraploid cytotypes.

After intensive exploration carried out by the Mision Biologica de Galicia, dealing with diploid populations of subspecies izcoi, 13 new diploid localities were recently detected along the ridge called "Macizo Galaico Duriense" three on the west side of the ridge and the remainder on the east, persisting in ancient habitats in the following communities: Quercetea robori-petrea, Erico-Ulicetalia, Ericion australis and Ulicion nanae. Two diploid populations have been detected for the first time in Coruna Province. However, no diploids were found on the west side (near the coast) of Coruna and Pontevedra Provinces, probably due to Atlantic influence. 3aDactylis glomerata 3acytotypes 3adiploidy 3ahabitats 3atetraploidy 3aSpain1 aLema, M.1 aGarcia, A.0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2004 June, v. 51, no. 4 p.437-442dKluwer Academic Publishersx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02671naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245019000172300001800362500002400380520145500404650002201859650002001881650004301901650002201944650003301966650001101999650000702010650002102017650001302038650001602051700002302067700002102090773010102111852000902212856008802221655001202309IND4421413020221123030352.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442141302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYazdi, Ali Sarafraz10aDetermination of 3-nitroaniline in water samples by directly suspended droplet three-phase liquid-phase microextraction using 18-crown-6 ether and high-performance liquid chromatography  ap. 5086-5091.  aIncludes references  aLiquid-liquid-liquid microextraction (LLLME) with directly suspended droplet in high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been applied as a new, rapid and easy method for the determination of 3-nitroaniline in environmental water samples. The target compound was extracted from the aqueous sample solution (donor phase, pH 13) into an organic phase and then was back-extracted into a directly suspended droplet of an acidic aqueous solution (acceptor phase, pH 0.3). In this method, without using a microsyringe as supporting device, an aqueous large droplet is freely suspended at the top-center position of an immiscible organic solvent, which is laid over the aqueous sample solution while being agitated. Then, the droplet was withdrawn into the microsyringe and directly was injected into the HPLC system with UV detection at 227nm. Up to 148-fold enrichment of the analyte could be obtained under the optimal conditions [i.e. donor phase: 0.1M sodium hydroxide solution (4.5mL); organic phase: o-xylene/1-octanol (90:10, v/v; 250μL); acceptor phase: 0.5M hydrochloric acid and 500mM 18-crown-6 ether (6μL); extraction time: 60s; back-extraction time: 6min and stirring rate: 600rpm]. The limit of detection was 1μg/L (n =7) and the relative standard deviation (RSD, n =5) was 4.9 at S/N=3. The calibration graph was linear in the range of 5-1500μg/L with r =0.9983.

As a consequence, the Basin Authority of Magra River has recently implemented a new river management policy based on an understanding and analysis of geomorphic processes. This paper describes and illustrates a methodology that defines a scientifically-based strategy for promoting future sustainable management of sediment and channel processes within this catchment. The methodology is based on a diagnosis which incorporates retrospective analyses of channel geometry, causes of changes and hydraulic sediment budgets to evaluate potential sediment transport. All these data are summarized using a multi-criteria approach to develop an overall design strategy for medium-term (i.e. some decades) bed sediment management. A practical methodology to identify potential sources of sediment at the catchment scale and to promote sediment delivery is also described. Finally, a 'map of strategies for sediment management' is presented, which synthesises all the aspects studied (morphological evolution, sediment budgets and considerations of potential sediment recharge). 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3amining 3arivers 3asediment transport 3asediments 3awatersheds 3aItaly1 aSimoncini, Cristina1 aPiégay, Hervé.0 tRiver research and applications.g2009 June, v. 25, no. 5 p.607-625dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.12433Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01734naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245011600177300001300293500002400306520064700330650001900977650001100996650001501007650001501022653004301037653001901080653002401099700002201123700002001145700002401165773010601189852000901295856009201304655001201396IND4421374520221123030355.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442137452DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6941.2009.00698.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aForbes, Christina M.14aThe contribution of 'omic'-based approaches to the study of enhanced biological phosphorus removal microbiology  ap. 1-15.  aIncludes references  aThe role that microorganisms play in the biological removal of phosphate from wastewater streams has received sustained interest since its initial observation over 30 years ago.

The methyl groups are installed by a two-step sequence involving initial methylation of a conserved Cys residue (RlmN Cys³⁵⁵) by SAM. Methyl transfer to the substrate requires reductive cleavage of a second equivalent of SAM. Crystal structures of RlmN and RlmN with SAM show that a single molecule of SAM coordinates the [4Fe-4S] cluster. Residue Cys³⁵⁵ is S-methylated and located proximal to the SAM methyl group, suggesting the SAM that is involved in the initial methyl transfer binds at the same site. Thus, RlmN accomplishes its complex reaction with structural economy, harnessing the two most important reactivities of SAM within a single site.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3acrystal structure 3aenzymes 3amethylation 3aribosomal RNA1 aGrove, Tyler L.1 aMcLaughlin, Monica I.1 aYennawar, Neela H.1 aBooker, Squire J.1 aRosenzweig, Amy C.0 tScience.g2011 May 27, v. 332, no. 6033 p.1089-1092dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12053583Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110527  aOther US 7aarticle02800naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245010400168300001600272500002400288500001500312520148300327650001901810650002101829650002101850650002201871650003801893650001101931650001601942650001101958650002301969650002601992650001002018650001002028650001202038650001802050650001202068650001902080650001102099653002302110700001502133700001902148773009902167852000902266856005502275655001202330IND4460385420221122230153.0110722e201108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446038542DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7917.2011.01419.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJi, Lan-Zhu10aGrowth responses of gypsy moth larvae to elevated CO₂: the influence of methods of insect rearing  ap. 409-418.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of elevated CO₂ on foliar chemistry of two tree species (Populus pseudo-simonii Kitag. and Betula platyphylla) and on growth of gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) larvae were examined. Furthermore, we focused on the comparison of results on the growth responses of larvae obtained from two methods of insect rearing, the no-choice feeding trial performed in the laboratory or in situ in open-top chambers. On the whole, both primary and secondary metabolites in the leaves of the two tree species were significantly affected by main effects of time (sampling date), CO₂ and species. Elevated CO₂ significantly increased the C : N ratio and concentrations of the soluble sugar, starch, total nonstructural carbohydrates, total phenolics and condensed tannins, but significantly decreased the concentration of nitrogen. Higher contents of total phenolics and condensed tannins were detected in the frass of larvae reared in elevated CO₂ treatments. Overall, the growth of gypsy moth larvae were significantly inhibited by elevated CO₂ and CO₂-induced changes in leaf quality. Our study did not indicate the two methods of insect rearing could influence the direction of effects of elevated CO₂ on the growth of individual insects; however, the magnitude of negative effects of elevated CO₂ on larval growth did differ between the two insect rearing methods, and it seems that the response magnitude was also mediated by larval age and host plant species. 3acarbon dioxide 3anitrogen content 3aLymantria dispar 3aproanthocyanidins 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3asugars 3ahost plants 3astarch 3alarval development 3asecondary metabolites 3atrees 3afrass 3aPopulus 3ainsect larvae 3ainsects 3ainsect rearing 3aleaves 0aBetula platyphylla1 aAn, Lin-Li1 aWang, Xiao-Wei0 tInsect science.g2011 Aug., v. 18, no. 4 p.409-418dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-96097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7917.2011.01419.x 7aarticle02862naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245007600172300001400248500002400262520175300286650002202039650001602061650001502077650001002092650001202102650002102114650001002135650001302145650000902158650001702167650001102184651001202195651001302207651001702220700002902237773013702266852000902403856005202412655001202464IND4463122820221122151039.0120502e20030830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446312282DNAL7 a10.1016/S0168-1923(03)00072-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQuiring, Steven M.13aAn evaluation of agricultural drought indices for the Canadian prairies  ap. 49-62.  aIncludes references  aA comparative performance analysis was carried out on four agricultural drought indices to determine the most appropriate index for monitoring agricultural drought and predicting Canada Western Red Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield on the Canadian prairies.

The yield models were evaluated by comparing the model predicted yields to the observed yields (1961-1999) using four goodness-of-fit measures: the coefficient of determination (R2), the index of agreement (d), the root mean square error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). The analysis indicated that Palmer’s Z-index is the most appropriate index for measuring agricultural drought in the Canadian prairies. The model evaluation indicated that the Z-index is best suited for predicting yield when there is significant moisture stress. There is a statistically significant relationship between the Z-index and Red Spring wheat yield in all crop districts, but the strength of the relationship varies significantly by crop district due to the influence of factors other than moisture availability (e.g. disease, pests, storm damage, and soil characteristics). The significant variations in model performance between the four agricultural drought indices underscores the necessity of carrying out a performance evaluation prior to selecting the most appropriate agricultural drought index for a particular application. 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrop models 3acrop yield 3acrops 3adrought 3amodel validation 3apests 3aprairies 3asoil 3aspring wheat 3astorms 3aAlberta 3aManitoba 3aSaskatchewan1 aPapakryiakou, Timothy N.0 tAgricultural and forest meteorology.g2003 Aug. 30, v. 118, no. 1-2 p.49-62dElsevier Science LtdwJournal:jnl43250x0168-19237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1923(03)00072-8 7aarticle03480naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100001700183245012500200300001800325500002400343500001500367506007600382520135700458506003701815650002601852650001601878650001401894650002401908650001301932650002201945650002601967650001001993650001202003650001902015650001902034650001802053650001102071650003002082650002402112650006002136650004802196650003702244650003802281650001702319650002802336650004002364650005602404650003602460650002602496650004902522653001502571700001802586700002002604700001902624773010802643852000902751856008202760655001202842IND4460534320221207134811.0110729e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446053432DNAL7 a216730782pmid7 aPMC31600322pmcid7 a10.1105/tpc.111.0849132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, So-Dam14aThe Arabidopsis NAC Transcription Factor VNI2 Integrates Abscisic Acid Signals into Leaf Senescence via the COR/RD Genes  ap. 2155-2168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeaf aging is a highly regulated developmental process, which is also influenced profoundly by diverse environmental conditions. Accumulating evidence in recent years supports that plant responsiveness to abiotic stress is intimately related with leaf longevity. However, molecular mechanisms underlying the signaling crosstalks and regulatory schemes are yet unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that an abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive NAC transcription factor VND-INTERACTING2 (VNI2) integrates ABA-mediated abiotic stress signals into leaf aging by regulating a subset of COLD-REGULATED (COR) and RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION (RD) genes. The VNI2 gene was induced by high salinity in an ABA-dependent manner. In addition, spatial and temporal expression patterns of the VNI2 gene are correlated with leaf aging and senescence. Accordingly, leaf aging was delayed in transgenic plants overexpressing the VNI2 gene but significantly accelerated in a VNI2-deficient mutant. The VNI2 transcription factor regulates the COR and RD genes by binding directly to their promoters. Notably, transgenic plants overexpressing the COR or RD genes exhibited prolonged leaf longevity. These observations indicate that the VNI2 transcription factor serves as a molecular link that integrates plant responses to environmental stresses into modulation of leaf longevity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3atranscription factors 3aArabidopsis 3alongevity 3agene overexpression 3asalinity 3atransgenic plants 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3amutants 3aplant response 3aabiotic stress 3aabscisic acid 3aleaves 2aAbscisic Acidxmetabolism 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCellular Senescencexphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aStress, Physiological 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0asenescence1 aSeo, Pil Joon1 aYoon, Hye-Kyung1 aPark, Chung-Mo0 tplant cell.g2011 June, v. 23, no. 6 p.2155-2168dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx1040-46517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.111.0849133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03258naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245013200142300001800274500012400292500001500416520157900431650004502010650002802055650001802083650000802101650000902109650003002118650001202148650001802160650003302178650002202211650002302233650003202256650002802288650003002316650004602346650002602392650002402418653001802442653002402460653001902484653001202503700001702515700001402532700001702546773008502563852000902648930003302657945001302690946001302703655001202716IND2049826820221122120934.0960212e199512  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204982682DNAL7 a86645952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeyer, R.10aPolymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis: a simple method for species identification in food  ap. 1542-1551.  aPaper presented at the fourth international symposium of AOAC Europe section, September 29-30, 1994, Nyon, Switzerland.  a2019-12-05  aThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was applied to meat species identification in marinated and heat-treated or fermented products and to the differentiation of closely related species. DNA was isolated from meat samples by using a DNA-binding resin and was subjected to PCR analysis. Primers used were complementary to conserved areas of the vertebrate mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene and yielded a 359 base-pair (bp) fragment, including a variable 307 bp region. Restriction endonuclease analysis based on sequence data of those fragments was used for differentiation among species. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were detected when pig, cattle, wild boar, buffalo, sheep, goat, horse, chicken, and turkey amplicons were cut with AluI, RsaI, TaqI, and HinfI. Analysis of sausages indicates the applicability of this approach to food products containing meat from 3 different species. The PCR-RFLP analytical method detected pork in heated meat mixtures with beef at levels below 1%, and the method was confirmed with porcine- and bovine-specific PCR assays by amplifying fragments of their growth hormone genes. Inter- and intraspecific differences of more than 22 animal species with nearly unknown cytb DNA sequences, including hoofed mammals (ungulates), and poultry were determined with PCR-RFLP typing by using 20 different endonucleases. This typing method allowed the discrimination of game meats including stag, roe deer, chamois, moose, reindeer, kangaroo, springbok, and other antelopes in marinated and heat-treated products. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ainterspecific variation 3afood analysis 3aDNA 3ameat 3apolymerase chain reaction 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCytochrome b Groupxgenetics 2aFood Microbiology 2aMeatxmicrobiology 2aMeat Productsxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aPoultryxmicrobiology 2aSpecies Specificity 0ameat products 0aspecies differences 0aidentification 0aspecies1 aHofelein, C.1 aLuthy, J.1 aCandrian, U.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1995 , v. 78, no. 6 p.1542-1551x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle02302naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245011800186300001600304500002400320520088600344650000901230650001301239650001201252650002701264650001501291650002501306650001401331650001801345650001401363650006601377650003801443650003001481650003101511650001401542650002701556650005601583700001501639700002301654700001801677773009201695852000901787856004801796655001201844IND4385092020221122085225.0061112e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438509202DNAL7 a168973072pmid7 a10.1007/s00248-006-9060-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarshall, Katrina10aEffect of Marine Bacterial Isolates on the Growth and Morphology of Axenic Plantlets of the Green Alga Ulva linza  ap. 302-310.  aIncludes references  aThe green marine macroalga, Ulva linza, adopts an “atypical” form when grown in the absence of bacteria.

Results showed that the effect of bacterial strains was strain- but not taxon-specific. Thirteen isolates returned the aberrant morphology to normal and of these, five also significantly increased growth rate. One isolate increased growth, but had no effect on morphology. Biofilms of some of these isolates stimulated the settlement of Ulva zoospores but there was no correlation between bacterial isolates that stimulated zoospore settlement and those that initiated changes in morphology and/or growth of the cultured alga. 3aUlva 3abacteria 3abiofilm 3agrowth and development 3amacroalgae 3anucleotide sequences 3aplantlets 3aribosomal DNA 3azoospores 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aBacterial Physiological Phenomena 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistry 2aGerm-Free Lifexphysiology 2aPhylogeny 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aUlvaxcytologyxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology.1 aJoint, Ian1 aCallow, Maureen E.1 aCallow, J.

Assessment of pitting with a visual scale after 2 weeks of 1 degrees C storage was found to be in close agreement with measurements of pit diameter. Using this method 'Bing' showed the greatest susceptibility to pitting in both years of the study and 'Bing', 'Lapins', and 'Sweetheart' cherries showed a decline in susceptibility as fruit matured. The predictive value of fruit firmness at harvest, fruit respiration at harvest, and weight loss in storage was assessed in relation to the severity of pitting. The model to best describe pitting was found to include all three physiological variables (firmness, respiration, and weight loss). While an acceptable model was obtained when combining all three cultivars, the best models were achieved when each cultivar was considered separately. It was concluded that there are likely unmeasured variables involved in determining susceptibility to pitting. Hence the best approach to predicting pitting susceptibility is the application of the pit-induction method described in this work. 3aPrunus avium 3acarbon sequestration 3acell respiration 3acherries 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afruit maturity 3amodels 3aprediction 3aweight loss1 aKappel, F.1 aStan, S.1 aMcKenzie, D.-L.1 aHocking, R.0 tHortScience.g2004 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.1066-1069x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02420naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002000148245015200168300001800320500002400338520122800362650002301590650002201613650001901635650001201654650000901666650001701675650001501692650002201707650001301729650001601742700002201758700001601780700002301796700001801819773010001837852000901937856008801946655001202034IND4421710020221122085232.0090612s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442171002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuzawa, Tetsuro10aRapid estimation of trace organophosphonate used as a scale inhibitor in aqueous systems by reactive pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  ap. 5292-5295.  aIncludes references  aThe determination of trace organophosphonates which are used in cooling towers as a scale inhibitor usually involves extraction and/or concentration of the target components prior to analysis. The extracts are analyzed using chromatographic or spectroscopic methods. This methodology is not only cumbersome but also results in poor data quality. This work presents a novel approach for the rapid and sensitive determination of trace amounts of an organophosphonate: 1-hydroxyethylidene-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP) in aqueous solution. This method is based upon reactive pyrolysis-GC/MS in the presence of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH). Approximately 10μL of the aqueous sample containing a trace amount of HEDP and 1μL of 25% a methanol TMAH solution was placed in the sample cup. The cup was then dropped into the furnace which was at 350°C. The heat initiated the hydrolysis of the organophosphonate followed by the methylation of the hydrolysates. Trimethylphosphate (TMP) was detected by GC/MS. The level of TMP is related to the level of the phosphonate, HEDP in the aqueous sample. Using an external standard calibration curve, it was possible to make a rapid estimation of mg/L levels of organophosphate. 3aammonium hydroxide 3aaqueous solutions 3achromatography 3acooling 3aheat 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3amass spectrometry 3amethanol 3amethylation1 aWatanabe, Chuichi1 aTsuge, Shin1 aFreeman, Robert R.1 aMatherly, Ron0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 July 3, v. 1216, no. 27 p.5292-5295dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0953Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03922naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008700185300001600272500002400288520200900312650001502321650001602336650001902352650001502371650002002386650002002406650002002426650002602446650002602472650002402498650001302522650002102535650001302556650003302569650002402602650002402626650001202650650001302662650002502675650002502700650001202725650002302737650001402760650002402774650002502798650003402823650002002857650002202877651001502899651001702914651001102931651001502942651001702957653003402974653001603008700002203024700002603046700002203072773008503094852000903179856004803188655001203236IND4397683820221122085240.0071111e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439768382DNAL7 a177246172pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-007-0836-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeglin, Lydia H.10aMicrobial responses to nitrogen addition in three contrasting grassland ecosystems  ap. 349-359.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of global N enrichment on soil processes in grassland ecosystems have received relatively little study. We assessed microbial community response to experimental increases in N availability by measuring extracellular enzyme activity (EEA) in soils from three grasslands with contrasting edaphic and climatic characteristics: a semiarid grassland at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, USA (SEV), and mesic grasslands at Konza Prairie, Kansas, USA (KNZ) and Ukulinga Research Farm, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (SAF). We hypothesized that, with N enrichment, soil microbial communities would increase C and P acquisition activity, decrease N acquisition activity, and reduce oxidative enzyme production (leading to recalcitrant soil organic matter [SOM] accumulation), and that the magnitude of response would decrease with soil age (due to higher stabilization of enzyme pools and P limitation of response). Cellulolytic activities followed the pattern predicted, increasing 35-52% in the youngest soil (SEV), 10-14% in the intermediate soil (KNZ) and remaining constant in the oldest soil (SAF). The magnitude of phosphatase response did not vary among sites. N acquisition activity response was driven by the enzyme closest to its pH optimum in each soil: i.e., leucine aminopeptidase in alkaline soil, β-N-acetylglucosaminidase in acidic soil. Oxidative enzyme activity varied widely across ecosystems, but did not decrease with N amendment at any site. Likewise, SOM and %C pools did not respond to N enrichment. Between-site variation in both soil properties and EEA exceeded any treatment response, and a large portion of EEA variability (leucine aminopeptidase and oxidative enzymes), 68% as shown by principal components analysis, was strongly related to soil pH (r = 0.91, P < 0.001). In these grassland ecosystems, soil microbial responses appear constrained by a molecular-scale (pH) edaphic factor, making potential breakdown rates of SOM resistant to N enrichment. 3aacid soils 3aage of soil 3aalkaline soils 3aecosystems 3aedaphic factors 3aenzyme activity 3agrassland soils 3aleucyl aminopeptidase 3amicrobial communities 3anational grasslands 3anitrogen 3aon-farm research 3aprairies 3aprincipal component analysis 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil organic matter 3asoil pH 3awildlife 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aBiomass 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aEcosystem 2aEnzymesxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexgrowth & development 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSoil Microbiology 3aNew Mexico 3aSouth Africa 0aKansas 0aNew Mexico 0aSouth Africa 0aExtracellular enzyme activity 0aSoil carbon1 aStursova, Martina1 aSinsabaugh, Robert L.1 aCollins, Scott L.0 tOecologia.g2007 Nov., v. 154, no. 2 p.349-359dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-007-0836-6 7aarticle02570naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002200148245010900170300001800279500002400297520158000321650001101901650001501912650004101927650001201968700002001980700001902000700001902019700002102038773010002059852000902159856008802168655001202256IND4421709120221122085238.0090612s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442170912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLázaro, Elisabet10aPrediction of retention in reversed-phase liquid chromatography by means of the polarity parameter model  ap. 5214-5227.  aIncludes references  aThe polarity parameter model previously developed: log k =(log k)₀ + p( P m N - P s N ) has been successfully applied to study several chromatographic systems involving new generation RPLC columns (Luna C18, Resolve C18, XTerra MSC18, and XTerra RP18). In this model the retention of the solutes (log k) is related to a solute parameter (p), a mobile phase parameter ( P m N ) and two chromatographic system parameters [ P s N and (log k)₀]. The studied systems have been characterized with different acetonitrile-water and methanol-water mobile phases, using a set of 12 neutral solutes of different chemical nature. The polarity parameter model allows prediction of retention of any solute in any mobile phase composition just using the retention data obtained in one percentage of organic modifier and the polarity parameters established in the characterization of the chromatographic systems. This model also allows the solute polarity data transference between RPLC characterized systems, so it is possible to predict the retention in various RPLC systems working experimentally with just one of them. Moreover, the global solvation parameter model has also been applied to the same chromatographic systems using a wide set of solutes in order to compare its predictive ability with the one of the polarity parameter model. The results clearly show that both models predict retention with very similar accuracy but the polarity parameter model requires much less preliminary experimental measurements to achieve equivalent results than the global solvation approach. 3amodels 3aprediction 3areversed-phase liquid chromatography 3asolutes1 aIzquierdo, Pere1 aRàfols, Clara1 aRosés, Martí1 aBosch, Elisabeth0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 July 3, v. 1216, no. 27 p.5214-5227dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.05.0063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02378naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245014700169300001800316500002400334520114700358650001601505650001201521650002001533650002001553650001201573650002201585650001901607650001801626650002601644650002701670650001301697650004401710700002001754700002101774773010001795852000901895856008801904655001201992IND4421708620221122061322.0090612s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442170862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAznar, Margarita10aQuantitative determination of 22 primary aromatic amines by cation-exchange solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  ap. 5176-5181.  aIncludes references  aPrimary aromatic amines (PAAs) have been broadly studied due to their high toxicity. In this work a method for the analysis of 22 PAAs in aqueous simulants has been developed. The method is based on a solid-phase extraction step using cation-exchange cartridges and the subsequent analysis of the extracts by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection. The recoveries obtained for all the amines analyzed ranged between 81 and 109%, linear range was between 0.03 and 75μgL⁻¹, with the RSD values between 4.5 and 13.4% and an average value of 7.5% and limits of detection at μgL⁻¹ level. The method has been applied to two real samples obtained from migration experiments of polyurethane based laminates to simulant B (water with 3% (w/v) acetic acid) which represents the worst case for the migration of aromatic amines. The main amines found in both samples were methylenedianiline isomers, obtained from the corresponding residual diisocyanates used during polyurethane adhesive polymerization. The total amine concentration found was 26 and 6.3μg of aniline equivalents per kg of food simulant. 3aacetic acid 3aaniline 3acation exchange 3adetection limit 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3apolymerization 3apolyurethanes 3aquantitative analysis 3asolid phase extraction 3atoxicity 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography1 aCanellas, Elena1 aNerín, Cristina0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 July 3, v. 1216, no. 27 p.5176-5181dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0963Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02577naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100003000164245011400194300001400308500002400322520114000346650001501486650001601501650002001517650001201537650002301549650001501572650002401587650001401611650002601625650006501651650006501716650004501781651001401826700002301840700002401863700002501887700002901912773010801941852000902049856008502058655001202143IND4421485420221122061410.0090605s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442148542DNAL7 a191722312pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-009-8316-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarcano, Letty Beatriz C.10aEffect of Cadmium on Cellular Viability in Two Species of Microalgae (Scenedesmus sp. and Dunaliella viridis)  ap. 86-93.  aIncludes references  aWe determined the effect of several concentrations of cadmium (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg/l) on cellular viability in the microalgae Scenedesmus sp. and Dunaliella viridis, by measuring growth at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h and pigment production at 10 days. Algae were obtained from the Nonvascular Plant Laboratory collection, in the Facultad Experimental de Ciencias, Universidad del Zulia, Venezuela. Growth was measured by cellular counting, while pigment content was evaluated using conventional spectrophotometric techniques. Growth of both species decreased in the exposed cultures comparing with the control, but its behavior was similar, because in both control and exposed cultures, its was observed an adaptive phase in the first hours, as well as a growth phase after 72 h. Cadmium concentrations above 10 μg/l produced an adverse effect on pigment production, depending on the concentration and/or exhibition time. However, even though cadmium inhibited growth and pigment production, levels of both parameters indicated cellular viability, demonstrating the adaptability of the algae cultures when they were exposed to the metal. 3aDunaliella 3aScenedesmus 3aadverse effects 3acadmium 3agrowth retardation 3amicroalgae 3anon-vascular plants 3aviability 2aCadmiumxpharmacology 2aChlorophytaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aScenedesmusxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxpharmacology 3aVenezuela1 aCarruyo, Ingrid M.1 aMontiel, Xiomara M.1 aMorales, Carolina B.1 ade Soto, Patricia Moreno0 tBiological trace element research.g2009 July, v. 130, no. 1 p.86-93dHumana Press Incx0163-49847nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-009-8316-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02402naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245020900128300001800337500002400355520127000379650004701649650004201696650002201738650004101760650002101801650002001822650001301842650002401855650001301879650001501892650001801907650003201925700001501957773007101972852000902043655001202052IND4372703020221122051653.0050726s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437270302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhowmik, P.K.10aChanges in the activity and expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase, ACC oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in asparagus spears in response to wound-induced ethylene synthesis  ap. 1074-1078.  aIncludes references  aThe molecular and enzymatic changes that follow harvesting of asparagus are important aspects for postharvest deterioration. To define the factors contributing to postharvest deterioration, the early changes in ethylene production and the activities and expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthase, ACC oxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) were studied in whole spears and in excised top and bottom portions. As a result of wounding, ethylene production was found higher in both top and bottom portions compared with whole spears but followed the same trend reaching the peak at 16 hours after harvest. ACC synthase was rapidly induced in excised top portions but no significant ACC synthase activity was observed in excised bottom portions. In top portions, ACC synthase reached a peak 8 hours after harvest and thereafter started to decline. In contrast to ACC synthase, ACC oxidase was induced markedly in both top and bottom portions and remained high until 16 hours after excision. On the other hand, PAL greatly increased in activity in bottom portions but not in excised tops. Northern blot analysis showed that increased mRNA levels coincided well with the excision-promoted increases in enzyme activity and ethylene production. 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase 3a1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid 3aNorthern blotting 3aaminocyclopropanecarboxylate oxidase 3aasparagus spears 3aenzyme activity 3aethylene 3aethylene production 3aexcision 3aharvesting 3amessenger RNA 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase1 aMatsui, T.0 tHortScience.g2004 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.1074-1078x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02889naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245010600210300001600316500002400332506007600356520156600432506003701998650000902035650001702044650002202061650001202083650002102095650001102116650004402127650001202171650002102183700003002204700001902234700001902253700002002272773008102292852000902373856008502382655001202467IND4421155820221207121450.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442115582DNAL7 a10.1007/s11745-009-3296-42doi7 aPMC54593582pmcid7 a193735032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagana Gowda, G.

Investigations of bile acids have garnered increased interest owing to their recently discovered additional biological functions including their role as signaling molecules that govern glucose, fat and energy metabolism. Recent NMR methodological developments have enabled single-step analysis of several highly abundant and common glycine- and taurine- conjugated bile acids, such as glycocholic acid, glycodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, taurocholic acid, taurodeoxycholic acid, and taurochenodeoxycholic acid. Investigation of these conjugated bile acids in human bile employing high field (800 MHz) ¹H-NMR spectroscopy reveals that the ratios between two glycine-conjugated bile acids and their taurine counterparts correlate positively (R ² = 0.83-0.97; p = 0.001 x 10⁻²-0.006 x 10⁻⁷) as do the ratios between a glycine-conjugated bile acid and its taurine counterpart (R ² = 0.92-0.95; p = 0.004 x 10⁻³-0.002 x 10⁻¹⁰). Using such correlations, concentration of individual bile acids in each sample could be predicted in good agreement with the experimentally determined values. These insights into the pattern of bile acid conjugation in human bile between glycine and taurine promise useful clues to the mechanism of bile acids' biosynthesis, conjugation and enterohepatic circulation, and may improve our understanding of the role of individual conjugated bile acids in health and disease.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abile 3abiosynthesis 3aenergy metabolism 3aglucose 3aglycocholic acid 3ahumans 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ataurine 3ataurocholic acid1 aShanaiah, Narasimhamurthy1 aCooper, Amanda1 aMaluccio, Mary1 aRaftery, Daniel0 tLipids.g2009 June, v. 44, no. 6 p.527-535dSpringer-Verlagx0024-42017nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11745-009-3296-43Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02404naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002200136245006600158300001600224500002400240520125700264650002201521650001101543650001401554650002201568650002101590650001101611650001101622650001901633650001001652650001601662650001401678651002001692700002301712700001701735700002301752700002001775773011401795852000901909856007601918655001201994IND4421248020221122051821.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442124802DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.12292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroves, Jeremy H.10aModelling of floating seed dispersal in a fluvial environment  ap. 582-592.  aIncludes references  aRiparian revegetation is an important component of river restoration. The success of restoration efforts may be affected by outside sources of propagules (e.g. seeds dispersed by water). Water can be an important transport vector for many native and alien riparian species. However, there is limited understanding of the dynamics of seed distribution in river systems. Accordingly, we have developed a semi-empirical model of seed dispersal by water, which predicts the parameters of the dispersal kernel. The model is based on aerial dispersal and hydrological approaches, with the core parameters as a function of flow velocity. Development and calibration of the model has been carried out in the Wingecarribee River and two of its tributaries, in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales, Australia, through releases of Helianthus annus (sunflower) achenes. The model, of skewed Gaussian form with stream flow and channel dimensions as core parameters, showed good overall fit to be observed (R² ranging from 0.61 to 0.98) for the main river and its tributaries. This model increases our fundamental understanding of seed dispersal along rivers and is a tool that can help predict seed dispersal of native and alien plant species along waterways. 3aHelianthus annuus 3afruits 3ahighlands 3aintroduced plants 3aland restoration 3amodels 3arivers 3aseed dispersal 3aseeds 3astream flow 3awaterways 3aNew South Wales1 aWilliams, David G.1 aCaley, Peter1 aNorris, Richard H.1 aCaitcheon, Gary0 tRiver research and applications.g2009 June, v. 25, no. 5 p.582-592dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.12293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01028naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001500115245008000130300001600210520033500226650002000561650002000581650002700601773008300628852000900711939003300720945000800753946001300761655001200774991613340730742620221122051727.0851121e198510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859261972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKerr, P.M.10aTurnover statistics and federal government balances in money supply targets  ap. 344-350.  aExtract: This study began with the question, "Can we identify a particular conception of 'money' with sufficient precision to allow its use as a proxy for economic performance?"

The global net impact of this process on carbon flux to the atmosphere is negligible, but impact on the spatial distribution of carbon dioxide uptake and release across regions and continents is significant. To estimate the consumption and release of carbon by humans over the landscape, we developed a carbon budget for humans in the United States. The budget was derived from food commodity intake data for the US and from algorithms representing the metabolic processing of carbon by humans. Data on consumption, respiration, and waste of carbon by humans were distributed over the US using geospatial population data with a resolution of ~450 x 450 m. The average adult in the US contains about 21 kg C and consumes about 67 kg C year⁻¹ which is balanced by the annual release of about 59 kg C as expired CO₂, 7 kg C as feces and urine, and less than 1 kg C as flatus, sweat, and aromatic compounds. In 2000, an estimated 17.2 Tg C were consumed by the US population and 15.2 Tg C were expired to the atmosphere as CO₂. Historically, carbon stock in the US human population has increased between 1790 and 2006 from 0.06 Tg to 5.37 Tg. Displacement and release of total harvested carbon per capita in the US is nearly 12% of per capita fossil fuel emissions. Humans are using, storing, and transporting carbon about the Earth's surface. Inclusion of these carbon dynamics in regional carbon budgets can improve our understanding of carbon sources and sinks. 3aadults 3aalgorithms 3aaromatic compounds 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3acommodity foods 3acrops 3aemissions 3afeces 3afossil fuels 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3asweat 3aurine 3awastes 3aUnited States1 aMarland, Gregg1 aSingh, Nagendra1 aBhaduri, Budhendra L.1 aRoddy, Adam B.0 tBiogeochemistry.g2009 May, v. 94, no. 1 p.29-41dSpringer Netherlandsx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-009-9306-z3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02632naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007300125300001800198500002400216520162800240650004001868650002101908650001601929650001001945650001101955650001301966650002501979650001102004650000902015650001702024650001502041650001602056700001702072700001802089700001502107700001602122700001602138773007102154852000902225655001202234IND4372738620221122043121.0050727s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437273862DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBell, G.E.10aOptical sensing of turfgrass chlorophyll content and tissue nitrogen  ap. 1130-1132.  aIncludes references  aDifferences in soil microenvironment affect the availability of N in small areas of large turfgrass stands. Optical sensing may provide a method for assessing plant N needs among these small areas and could help improve turfgrass uniformity. The purpose of this study was to determine if optical sensing was useful for measuring turfgrass responses stimulated by N fertilization. Areas of 'U3' bermudagrass Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers., 'Midfield' bermudagrass C. dactylon (L.) Pers. x C. transvaalensis Burtt-Davy, and 'SR1020' creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris Huds.) were divided into randomized complete blocks and fertilized with different N rates. A spectrometer was used to measure energy reflected from the turfgrass within the experimental units at 350 to 1100 nm wavelengths. This spectral information was used to calculate normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI). These spectral indices were regressed with tissue N and chlorophyll content determined from turfgrass clippings collected immediately following optical sensing. The coefficients of determination for NDVI and GNDVI regressed with tissue N averaged r2 = 0.76 and r2 = 0.81, respectively. The coefficients of determination for NDVI and GNDVI regressed with chlorophyll averaged r2 = 0.70 and r2 = 0.75, respectively. Optical sensing was equally effective for estimating turfgrass responses to N fertilization as more commonly used evaluations such as shoot growth rate (SGR regressed with tissue N; r2 = 0.81) and visual color evaluation (color regressed with chlorophyll; r2 = 0.64). 3aAgrostis stolonifera var. palustris 3aCynodon dactylon 3achlorophyll 3acolor 3aenergy 3anitrogen 3anitrogen fertilizers 3ashoots 3asoil 3aturf grasses 3avegetation 3awavelengths1 aHowell, B.M.1 aJohnson, G.V.1 aRaun, W.R.1 aSolie, J.B.1 aStone, M.L.0 tHortScience.g2004 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.1130-1132x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011900144300001800263520158500281650000901866650001001875650001101885650000901896650000901905650000801914650001301922650002301935650001401958650002501972650002601997650001902023650001502042650002302057650002902080650002802109650001602137650003302153650003702186650003702223650003202260650002402292653001502316653001902331653001502350653001802365700001902383773008502402852000902487930003302496945001302529946001302542655001202555IND2198062220221122043224.0990409e199812  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219806222DNAL7 a98505822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarlson, M.10aDetermination of phosphine residues in whole grains and soybeans by ion chromatography via conversion to phosphate  ap. 1190-1201.  aAn ion chromatographic (IC) method was developed for determining phosphine (PH3) in whole grains (barley, corn, oats, rice, rye, and wheat) and soybeans. The method converts phosphine to phosphate (i.e., orthophosphate) and isolates the phosphate by IC with eluent-suppressed conductivity detection. Recoveries of unbound phosphine by the method were similar to those obtained by an established colorimetric method for 7 different products fortified at 3 levels. Mean recoveries were low (i.e., 30-60%) and varied with product type and level of fortification. Recoveries of PH3 from previously fumigated products fortified with aluminum phosphide ranged from 19.0% for barley fortified at 0.734 ppm to 88.3% for corn fortified at 1.691 ppm. Precision data from 3 products based on replicate analyses (n = 4 or 5) gave relative standard deviations of 1.78-4.66% for mean laboratory-fumigated PH3 levels of 0.679-1.309 ppm. Estimated limits of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) for PH3 were 0.010 microgram/g (10 ppb) and 0.0275 microgram/g (27.5 ppb) at signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) of 4:1 and 10:1, respectively. These values were also determined for a nonchemically suppressed IC system with LOD of 0.02 microgram/g (20 ppb) and LOQ of 0.055 microgram/g (55 ppb) at S/N of 4:1 and 10:1, respectively. Phosphate response was linear over the concentration range equivalent to 0.30-10.0 microgram P/mL, with a mean correlation coefficient of 0.9988 based on replicate standard curves. The relationship of product composition to recovery from various products was also examined. 3arice 3awheat 3abarley 3acorn 3aoats 3arye 3asoybeans 3afood contamination 3aphosphine 3ainsecticide residues 3aquantitative analysis 3achromatography 3aphosphates 2aAluminum Compounds 2aEdible Grainxchemistry. 2aChromatographyxmethods 2aColorimetry 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 2aPhosphatesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aPhosphinesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSoybeansxchemistry 0aevaluation 0atest procedure 0aconversion 0adetermination1 aThompson, R.D.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1998 , v. 81, no. 6 p.1190-1201x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03646naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245011500122300001800237500002400255520255100279650002102830650002302851650001402874650001002888650001302898650002802911650001402939650001602953650002302969650001502992650001003007650001603017650001603033650001903049650000903068650001703077650001603094700001703110700001703127773007103144852000903215655001203224IND4372738920221122043206.0050727s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437273892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, G.10aSalinity tolerance of selected seashore paspalums and bermundagrasses: root and verdure responses and criteria  ap. 1143-1147.  aIncludes references  aSeashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz) is a warm season turfgrass that survives in sand dunes along coastal sites and around brackish ponds or estuaries. The first exposure to salt stress normally occurs in the rhizosphere for persistent turfgrass. Information on diversity in salinity tolerance of seashore paspalums is limited. From Apr. to Oct. 1997, eight seashore paspalum ecotypes (SI 94-1, SI 92, SI 94-2, 'Sea Isle 1', 'Excalibur', 'Sea Isle 2000', 'Salam', 'Adalayd') and four bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon x C. transvaalensis Butt-Davy) cultivars ('Tifgreen', 'Tifway', 'TifSport', 'TifEagle') were investigated for levels of salinity tolerance based on root and verdure responses in nutrient/sand culture under greenhouse conditions. Different salt levels (1.1 to 41.1 dS.m(-1)) were created with sea salt. Measurements were taken for absolute growth at 1.1 (EC(w)0; electrical conductivity of water), 24.8 (EC(w)24), 33.1 (EC(w)32), and 41.1 dS.m(-1) (EC(w)40), threshold EC(w), and EC(w) for 25% growth reduction from EC(w)0 growth (EC(w)25%). Varying levels of salinity tolerance among the 12 entries were observed based on root, verdure, and total plant yield. Ranges of root characteristics were inherent growth (EC(w)0) = 0.20 to 0.61 g dry weight (DW); growth at EC(w)24 = 0.11 to 0.47 g; growth at EC(w)32 = 0.13 to 0.50 g; growth at EC(w)40 = 0.13 to 0.50 g; threshold EC(w) = 3.1 to 9.9 dS.m(-1); and EC(w)25% = 23 to 39 dS.m(-1). For verdure, ranges were inherent growth at EC(w)0 = 0.40 to 1.07 g DW; growth at EC(w)40 = 0.31 to 0.84 g; and ratio of yields at EC(w)40 to EC(w)0 = 0.54 to 1.03. Ranges for total growth were inherent growth at EC(w)0 = 0.72 to 2.66 g DW; growth at EC(w)24 = 0.55 to 2.23 g; growth at EC(w)32 = 0.54 to 2.08 g; growth at EC(w)40 = 0.52 to 1.66 g; threshold EC(w) = 2.3 to 12.8 dS.m(-1); and EC(w)25% = 16 to 38 dS.m(-1). Significant salinity tolerance differences existed among seashore paspalums and bermudagrasses as demonstrated by root, verdure, and total growth measurements. When grasses were ranked across all criteria exhibiting a significant F test based on root, verdure, and total growth, the most tolerant ecotypes were SI 94-1 and SI 92. Salinity tolerance of bermudagrass cultivars was relatively lower than SI 94-1 and SI 92. For assessing salinity tolerance, minimum evaluation criteria must include absolute growth at EC(w)0 and EC(w)40 dS.m(-1) for halophytes, but using all significant parameters of root and total yield is recommended for comprehensive evaluation. 3aCynodon dactylon 3aPaspalum vaginatum 3acultivars 3adunes 3aecotypes 3aelectrical conductivity 3aestuaries 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3ahalophytes 3aponds 3arhizosphere 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asand 3aturf grasses 3awarm season1 aCarrow, R.N.1 aDuncan, R.R.0 tHortScience.g2004 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.1143-1147x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02035naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011300126300001800239500002400257520102800281650002101309650002401330650001901354650001601373650001101389650002401400650001701424650001401441650002001455650000701475650001901482650001401501650000901515700001501524700001501539700001501554773007101569852000901640655001201649IND4372738420221122031109.0050727s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437273842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCregg, B.M.10aChlorophyll fluorescence and needle chlorophyll concentration of fir (Abies sp.) seedlings in response to pH  ap. 1121-1125.  aIncludes references  aWe assessed variable chlorophyll fluorescence (F(v)/F(m)) and needle chlorophyll concentration of seedlings of Maccedonia fir (Abies borisii regis Mattfeld), subalpine fir A. lasiocarpa (Hooker) Nuttall, Sakhalin fir A. sachalinensis (Schmidt) Mast., Siberian fir A. sibirica (Lebed.), and Veitch fir (A. veitchii Lindl.) grown under varying soil media pH.

Increasing media pH significantly reduced F(v)/F(m) and needle chlorophyll concentration in all of the species tested. The effect of pH on photochemistry was due to depressed nutrient uptake of P, Mn, B, and Cu. Because photosynthetic quantum yield may be related to deficiencies of several elements affected by pH, F(v)/F(m) may serve as a criterion to select for improved pH tolerance.

The industry is usually assumed to have progressed from a rather specialized structure in 1825 to a highly integrated structure in 1850; much of the literature is devoted to explaining this trend. No such trend occurred, however, and the explanations are incorrect. An alternative view, focusing on technical change and profitability in spinning and weaving, is outlined briefly. 3acotton industry 3avertical integration 3aUnited Kingdom0 tJournal of economic history.g1985 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.419-425x0022-05077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19851114c00000000  aAGE  aOther US 7aarticle02429naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002400148245018600172300001800358500002400376520110300400650001701503650001301520650001201533650002301545650000901568650004301577650002401620650001301644650001701657650001301674650002001687700003201707700001901739700001501758700002401773700002401797773010101821852000901922856008801931655001202019IND4421087220221121233341.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442108722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWong, William M.

In one example, in which Bio-Beads (S-X1) were used as the packing material for the preparative SEC column, CdSe QDs treated with a functional coumarin dye could be separated from the excess free dye by using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the mobile phase. This column was unable to separate polymer-coated QDs from free polymer (M ~8000) because of the relatively low cutoff mass of the column. Here a preparative HPLC column packed with TOYOPEARL gel allowed the effective separation of polymer-bound QDs from the excess free polymer by using N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) as the mobile phase. When other solvents such as absolute ethanol, acetonitrile, THF, and THF-triethylamine mixtures were used as the eluent, QDs stuck to the column. While NMP was an effective medium to remove excess free polymer from the QDs, it was difficult to transfer the purified QDs to more volatile solvents and maintain colloidal stability. 3aacetonitrile 3acoumarin 3aethanol 3agel chromatography 3agels 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3apackaging materials 3apolymers 3aquantum dots 3asolvents 3atetrahydrofuran1 aBardajee, Ghasem Rezanejade1 aKumar, Sandeep1 aNitz, Mark1 aScholes, Gregory D.1 aWinnik, Mitchell A.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 June 19, v. 1216, no. 25 p.5011-5019dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.04.0603Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03649naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245016100164300001600325500002400341520192800365650001502293650003002308650002702338650001902365650001902384650002202403650004302425650001102468650001102479650001502490650001302505650001802518650001902536650002202555650001202577650002802589650001102617650002702628650001402655650001302669650001202682650002602694650001602720650001102736700002402747700002402771700001902795700002002814700002302834700001802857700001902875773010802894852000903002856004803011655001203059IND4402156020221121233310.0080302e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440215602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0702-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThieme, Ramona10aNovel somatic hybrids (Solanum tuberosum L. + Solanum tarnii) and their fertile BC₁ progenies express extreme resistance to potato virus Y and late blight  ap. 691-700.  aIncludes references  aSolanum tarnii, a wild diploid, tuber-bearing Mexican species belonging to the series Pinnatisecta is highly resistant to Potato virus Y (PVY) and Colorado potato beetle and shows a strong hypersensitive reaction to Phytophthora infestans. Therefore, it could be a potential source of resistance to pathogens for potato breeders. S. tarnii (2n = 2x = 24) is reproductively isolated from tetraploid Solanum tuberosum and hence difficult to include in potato breeding programmes. In this study, interspecific somatic hybrids were produced for the first time by protoplast electrofusion of the cells of potato cv. Delikat (Solanum tuberosum L.) and Solanum tarnii. The hybrid nature of the regenerants was confirmed by simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers and by morphological analysis and flow cytometry. Selected somatic hybrids were successfully backcrossed with cv. Delikat. Parental lines, primary somatic hybrids and BC₁ progeny were assessed for resistance to PVY by mechanical inoculation, grafting and exposure to viruliferous aphid vectors in the field, and resistance to late blight (P. infestans) by detached leaflet and whole tuber tests. The somatic hybrids showed no symptoms of viral infection and most of them displayed high levels of resistance to foliage blight. The BC₁ progenies were highly resistant to PVY and a few were resistant to foliage blight. Selected hybrids and BC₁ clones were evaluated in the field for tuber quality and tuber yield. Some BC₁ clones produced yields of good quality tubers. The results confirm that both the resistance to PVY and to late blight of S. tarnii is expressed in somatic hybrids, and PVY resistance is transferred to BC₁ progeny, whereas blight resistance is harder to transfer. Somatic hybridization again proved to be a valuable tool for producing pre-breeding material with increased genetic diversity. 3aAphidoidea 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aPotato virus Y 3aSolanum tarnii 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3ablight 3aclones 3acrop yield 3adiploidy 3aelectrofusion 3aflow cytometry 3agenetic variation 3ahybrids 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apathogens 3apotatoes 3aprogeny 3asomatic hybridization 3atetraploidy 3atubers1 aRakosy-Tican, Elena1 aGavrilenko, Tatjana1 aAntonova, Olga1 aSchubert, Jörg1 aNachtigall, Marion1 aHeimbach, Udo1 aThieme, Thomas0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2008 Mar., v. 116, no. 5 p.691-700dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-007-0702-2 7aarticle02824naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245023400143300001600377500001500393520121000408650002201618650002601640650001101666650002101677650002401698650001401722650002601736650002701762650003101789650002401820650003101844650002001875650001601895650004801911650004801959650004402007653001802051653002202069653001602091653002302107700002202130700001502152773008302167852000902250930003302259945001302292946001302305655001202318IND2199387320221121233329.0990621e199901  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219938732DNAL7 a100286782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChase, G.12aA liquid chromatographic method for analysis of all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate and retinyl palmitate in medical food using matrix solid-phase dispersion in conjunction with a zero reference material as a method development tool  ap. 107-111.  a2019-12-05  aA liquid chromatographic method is described for analysis of all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate and retinyl palmitate in medical food. The vitamins are extracted from medical food without saponification by matrix solid-phase dispersion and chromatographed by normal-phase chromatography with fluorescence detection. Retinyl palmitate and all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate are quantitated isocratically with a mobile phase of 0.125% (v/v) and 0.5% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol in hexane, respectively. Results compared favorably with label declarations on retail medical foods. Recoveries determined on an analyte-fortified zero reference material for a milk-based medical food averaged 98.3% (n = 25) for retinyl palmitate spikes and 95.7% (n = 25) for all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate spikes. Five concentrations were examined for each analyte, and results were linear (r2 = 0.995 for retinyl palmitate and 0.9998 for all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) over the concentration range examined, with coefficients of variation in the range 0.81-4.22%. The method provides a rapid, specific, and easily controlled assay for analysis of retinyl palmitate and all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate in fortified medical foods. 3aretinyl palmitate 3aquantitative analysis 3aassays 3afood composition 3adietary supplements 3adetection 3aliquid chromatography 2aChromatography, Liquid 2aFood, Formulatedxanalysis 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aStereoisomerism 2aTocopherols 2aVitamin Axanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aVitamin Exanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aalpha-Tocopherolxanalogs & derivatives 0afortification 0avitamin e acetate 0amethodology 0aanalytical methods1 aEitenmiller, R.R.1 aLong, A.R.0 tJournal of AOAC International.g1999 , v. 82, no. 1 p.107-111x1060-32717nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdCMS  aOther US 7aarticle03572naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002700181245013600208300001800344500002400362506007600386520188400462506003702346650002702383650002002410650001502430650002002445650002202465650001902487650001102506650001602517650002202533650001902555650003702574650001802611650002302629650001402652650001302666700001802679700002002697700002202717700001702739700001802756700002402774700001802798773013702816852000902953856008002962655001203042IND4409630920221207121316.0080829e20080901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440963092DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.02689-072doi7 aPMC25466412pmcid7 a186067882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbuddhe, Sukhadeo B.10aRapid Identification and Typing of Listeria Species by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry  ap. 5402-5407.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aListeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen that is the causative agent of human listeriosis, an opportunistic infection that primarily infects pregnant women and immunologically compromised individuals. Rapid, accurate discrimination between Listeria strains is essential for appropriate therapeutic management and timely intervention for infection control. A rapid method involving matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) that shows promise for identification of Listeria species and typing and even allows for differentiation at the level of clonal lineages among pathogenic strains of L. monocytogenes is presented. A total of 146 strains of different Listeria species and serotypes as well as clinical isolates were analyzed. The method was compared with the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of 48 Listeria strains comprising L. monocytogenes strains isolated from food-borne epidemics and sporadic cases, isolates representing different serotypes, and a number of Listeria strains whose genomes have been completely sequenced. Following a short inactivation/extraction procedure, cell material from a bacterial colony was deposited on a sample target, dried, overlaid with a matrix necessary for the MALDI process, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. This technique examines the chemistry of major proteins, yielding profile spectra consisting of a series of peaks, a characteristic "fingerprint" mainly derived from ribosomal proteins. Specimens can be prepared in a few minutes from plate or liquid cultures, and a spectrum can be obtained within 1 minute. Mass spectra derived from Listeria isolates showed characteristic peaks, conserved at both the species and lineage levels. MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting may have potential for Listeria identification and subtyping and may improve infection control measures.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acontrol methods 3adesorption 3adisease control 3adisease outbreaks 3afood pathogens 3alasers 3alisteriosis 3amass spectrometry 3apregnant women 3apulsed-field gel electrophoresis 3arapid methods 3aribosomal proteins 3aserotypes 3ataxonomy1 aMaier, Thomas1 aSchwarz, Gerold1 aKostrzewa, Markus1 aHof, Herbert1 aDomann, Eugen1 aChakraborty, Trinad1 aHain, Torsten0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2008 Sept. 1, v. 74, no. 17 p.5402-5407dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02689-073Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02526naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100003200135245010700167300001400274500002400288520133400312650001201646650000901658650001001667650001201677650001401689650002501703650001101728650000901739650001301748650001301761650002101774650003401795650002001829650003301849650001401882650001401896650001001910700002801920773009701948852000902045856003802054655001202092IND4449040220221121225008.0110211s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444904022DNAL7 a10.1071/BT101942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaiva, Elder Antônio Sousa10aCalycinal trichomes in Ipomoea cairica (Convolvulaceae): ontogenesis, structure and functional aspects  ap. 91-98.  aIncludes references  aThe presence of calycinal trichomes in Ipomoea has been neglected, which renders the interpretation of their functions difficult. The present work aims to characterise the structure, as well as the composition of the secretion of calycinal trichomes in Ipomoea cairica, in order to establish a relationship between their structure and function. Samples of floral buds at different developmental stages and sepals from fruits were collected and fixed for study under light as well as under scanning and transmission electron microscopy. The calyx of I. cairica is persistent and presents glandular trichomes which produce acidic polysaccharides. The trichomes are peltate and consist of a short stalk and a pluricellular secretory portion. The cells from the secretory portion contain a dense and organelle-rich cytoplasm. The fresh secretion is hyaline and fluid, but solidifies when exposed to low humidity, taking on a crystalline and fragile aspect, and they return to a gel state when in the presence of water. The calycinal trichomes in I. cairica show great structural and ultrastructural similarities to colleters and can be considered functionally analogous. The secretion, which is highly hygroscopic, spreads along the surface of the corolla and of the fruit, apparently protecting these structures against desiccation. 3aIpomoea 3abuds 3acalyx 3acorolla 3acytoplasm 3adevelopmental stages 3afruits 3agels 3ahumidity 3aontogeny 3aplant morphology 3aplant secretions and exudates 3apolysaccharides 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asecretion 3atrichomes 3awater1 aMartins, Luiza Coutinho0 tAustralian journal of botany.g2011, v. 59, no. 1 p.91-98dCSIRO Publishingx0067-19247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT10194 7aarticle02375naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011100144300001600255520101400271650001601285650002301301650002101324650001201345650002601357650002601383650002201409650002301431650001401454650002701468650003301495650005001528650005001578650002301628650002201651650003101673650002301704653001801727700002101745773008301766852000901849930003301858945001301891946001301904655001201917IND2206727420221121225133.0000905e200005  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220672742DNAL7 a108685842pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRupp, H.S.10aConfirmation of patulin and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in apple juice by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry  ap. 612-620.  aA gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method was developed for the confirmation of patulin and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) extracted from apple juice. The extraction is based on the official AOAC method for liquid chromatographic analysis. Juice extracts are quickly and easily derivatized with bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoracetamide under mild conditions, and the trimethylsilyl ethers of the analytes are stable for at least several hours. The analytes are determined by GC/MS using an electron-impact source and selected ion monitoring of characteristic ions. For both analytes, the interassay differences between base-peak ratios for samples and standards were all <7.1% (absolute). The presence of patulin was confirmed at fortification levels of about 30-400 micrograms/L and naturally occurring levels of about 80-400 micrograms/L.

Many photoelectric sensors or 1-m-long line sensors that integrate individual interception points for spatial averaging were replaced with fiberoptics, which integrate interception points. Depending on the positioning of optical fibers and the amount of fibers terminated at a PAR sensor, whole-plant, canopy layer, and individual leaf light interception can be determined. The use of fiberoptics has the added advantage of being very small in comparison to the bulk of a typical quantum sensor. The fiberoptic-based system potentially is a more accurate, less expensive method to integrate PAR throughout plant canopies than PAR sensors. 3acanopy 3aleaves 3aphotosynthetically active radiation1 aBowden, J.D.0 tHortScience.g2004 Aug., v. 39, no. 5 p.1027-1029x0018-53457nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03090naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002500111040001800136100001700154245010300171300001600274500002400290520114300314650000801457650001201465650001601477650001401493650000901507650001101516650003901527650001101566650001101577650001501588650001501603650001601618650001101634650001201645650002901657650003301686650004401719650003001763650005001793650004501843650001101888650003001899650001101929650000901940650001901949650002301968650004101991650002702032650004002059650004502099650001902144700002002163700001902183700002202202700002102224773011102245852000902356856007502365655001202440IND4421079020221121225013.0090529s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442107902DNAL7 a194866032pmid7 a10.1071/RD082692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMudrak, Olga10aReorganisation of human sperm nuclear architecture during formation of pronuclei in a model system  ap. 665-671.  aIncludes references  aBy fertilisation, two terminally differentiated cells, namely the egg and spermatozoon, are combined to create a totipotent zygote. During this process, the inactive sperm nucleus is transformed into a functional male pronucleus. Recent studies demonstrate that human sperm chromatin has an elaborate multilevel organisation, but almost nothing is known about how sperm chromosomes are transformed during fertilisation. Because of ethical reasons and technical complications, experimentation with human embryos is generally unworkable and adequate model systems are necessary to study the formation of male pronuclei. Here, we analyse remodelling of human sperm chromatin and chromosome architecture in Xenopus egg extracts using immunofluorescent localisation of protamines and centromere protein A, as well as fluorescence in situ hybridisation localisation of major α-satellite DNA and whole chromosome territory (CT). We demonstrate noticeable relocalisation of centromeres and remodelling of CT during the decondensation-recondensation cycle, mimicking cellular events that occur in the paternal genome in vivo during fertilisation. 3aDNA 3aXenopus 3acentromeres 3achromatin 3aeggs 3aethics 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3agenome 3ahumans 3apronucleus 3aprotamines 3aspermatozoa 3azygote 2aAnimals 2aAutoantigensxmetabolism 2aCell Nucleusxultrastructure 2aCentromerexmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aChromatinxultrastructure 2aChromosomal Proteins, Non-Histonexmetabolism 2aChromosomesxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aFertilizationxphysiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aModels, Animal 2aModels, Biological 2aOocytesxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aProtaminesxmetabolism 2aSperm-Ovum Interactionsxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aXenopus laevis1 aChandra, Rajeev1 aJones, Estella1 aGodfrey, W.

Despite its easy handling, there is no detailed description of its metabolic performance. This work developed a novel mathematical model for L. vannamei growth based on mass conservation and chemical equations for feed oxidation, allowing to calculate shrimp specific growth rate, specific rate of feed consumption, specific rate of ammonia nitrogen excretion, and oxygen specific consumption rate. Results, when compared to literature data, indicate a correlation higher than 99%, demonstrating that the proposed approach can successfully predict the growth based on the assessed parameters. Through this strategy it is possible to optimize the management of shrimp cultivation, especially in relation to dissolved oxygen, availability of feed and ammonia excretion, according to each stage of shrimp growth. Based on the environmental conditions maintained during the present study, the result of the present mathematical model can be a potential tool for reducing costs and environmental impacts in aquaculture shrimp farm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3adissolved oxygen 3aempirical models 3aenvironmental factors 3aenvironmental impact 3aequations 3aexcretion 3afarms 3afeed conversion 3afeed intake 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3ashrimp 3ashrimp culture 3aspecific growth rate 0aStoichiometric equation 0aOxygen consumption 0aAmmonia excretion 0aStatistical model1 aOwatari, Marco Shizuo1 aMouriño, José Luiz Pedreira1 aCarciofi, Bruno Augusto Mattar1 aSoares, Hugo Moreira0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 437 p.109291-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1092913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009500128300001300223500013300236520134600369592002801715650001201743650002401755650002101779650002101800650001801821650001301839650001601852650001901868650001301887700001701900773010601917939003302023852000902056655001202065IND9104704820221119121820.0181002e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910470482DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWARMAN, P.

Soil organic constituents were separated into various molecular weight fractions by gel permeation chromatography. Molecular weight fractions were analyzed for peptide content using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography; isolated peptide fractions were acid hydrolyzed and analyzed in this manner for their amino acid content. Peptide amino acid composition of corresponding size fractions often differed between uncultivated and cultivated soils of the same series, but cultivation did not consistently influence the content or composition of soil peptides in molecular weight fractions. The contributions of peptide amino acid N to the total N pool of Queens sandy loam were 16.01% and 3.82% for the cultivated and uncultivated soil, respectively. The contributions of peptide amino acid N to the total N pool of a Pugwash sandy loam were 2.38% and 7.55% for the cultivated and uncultivated soil, respectively. Fifteen different amino acids were recovered from hydrolyzed peptides of the Queens soil whereas 16 different amino acids were recovered from the Pugwash soil. Some amino acids, notably serine and glycine, were more common in Queens than in Pugwash peptide fractions.  aPublisher supplied data 3atillage 3asoil organic matter 3asandy loam soils 3amolecular weight 3afractionation 3apeptides 3aamino acids 3aamino nitrogen 3anitrogen1 aISNOR, R.

Changes in physiological systems are frequent, including inflammation and psychobiological declines such as mood and cognition worsening, resulting in increased reaction time, difficulty solving problems, reduced memory and concentration. The paper discusses the possible relationship between glutamine supplementation and worsening cognition mediated by inflammation induced by high altitude hypoxia. The paper is a narrative literature review conducted to verify the effects of glutamine supplementation on psychobiological aspects. We searched MEDLINE/PubMed and Web of Science databases and gray literature by Google Scholar for English articles. Mechanistic pathways mediated by glutamine suggest potential positive effects of its supplementation on mood and cognition, mainly its potential effect on inflammation. However, clinical studies are scarce, making any conclusions impossible. Although glutamine plays an important role and seems to mitigate inflammation, clinical studies should test this hypothesis, which will contribute to a better mood and cognition state for several people who suffer from problems mediated by hypoxia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3acognition 3aemotions 3aglutamine 3ahypoxia 3ainflammation 3aliterature 3amemory 3apaper 3apeople 3apressure1 aSouza, WYG 1 aLemos, VA 1 aCaris, AV 1 aThomatieli-Santos, RV 0 tNutrients.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121236273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02738naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011800169300001600287520145800303592002801761650002401789650001801813650001501831650002001846650002301866650001201889650002201901650002101923650001001944650001501954650001301969650001001982650002001992650001402012700002102026700002002047700001802067700002002085773010902105856008102214852000902295655001202304IND60575875720221122003223.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057587572DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-016-0798-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSepúlveda, D.

Host fidelity provides an adaptive advantage to aphid parasitoids, allowing females to find their aphid host more quickly in heterogeneous environments. This trait is mediated by the learning of signals, mainly chemical cues emitted from the host in which parasitoids developed (natal). This article is aimed at studying whether host fidelity can be altered after many generations of inbreeding reproduction in caged laboratory populations, for which host preference and fitness parameters were measured in the parasitoid wasp Aphidius ervi. Also, the effect of the natal/non-natal hosts was studied, using parasitoids originated from the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) and the grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). We observed a loss of host fidelity in the studied A. ervi populations, irrespective of their natal aphid host, which contrasts with previous reports showing preference for natal hosts in outbred laboratory populations. The loss of host fidelity is discussed in terms of the origin of populations; the sex ratio was strongly biased toward males and long-time maintenance under laboratory conditions. Our results highlight the need for controlling the genetic diversity of caged parasitoids before they are released into fields, as a long period of inbreeding could negatively affect the biological control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcyrthosiphon pisum 3aAphidius ervi 3aBraconidae 3aSitobion avenae 3abiological control 3afemales 3agenetic variation 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3ainbreeding 3alearning 3amales 3aparasitic wasps 3asex ratio1 aZepeda-Paulo, F.1 aRamírez, C.

Currently, the technique most commonly used to obtain LST is thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing (RS). However, this technique is affected by clouds and cannot obtain complete spatiotemporal LST images. To solve this problem, RS and weather research and forecasting (WRF) coupled model (RS-WRF coupled model) was developed to produce cloud-free MODIS-like LST data. (i) The WRF model is used to simulate the cloud-free LST with a 1 km resolution. (ii) The optimal machine learning model is utilized to fit the simulated LSTs and produce cloud-free MODIS-like LSTs. (iii) Combined with a median filtering algorithm, the salt and pepper noise in the fitted image is optimized. Taking Beijing as a test site. Under relatively little cloud cover and greater cloud contamination, the root mean square error of the LST constructed by the RS-WRF coupled model is approximately 1.2 and 1.8 K, respectively. The correlation coefficients under both conditions exceed 0.9. Overall, the RS-WRF coupled model can provide cloud-free time series MODIS-like LST images in areas with frequent cloud cover, thereby compensating for the disadvantage that satellite TIR images contaminated by clouds cannot obtain complete LST estimates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acloud cover 3aenvironment 3apepper 3asatellites 3asurface temperature 3atime series analysis 3aweather research and forecasting model 3aChina 0aLand surface temperature 0aWRF 0aCloud contamination 0aMachine learning 0aMODIS1 aChen, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2585-99841 aChen, Zhenting1 aYang, Fan1 aMeng, Chunchun1 aGou, Peng1 aZhang, Fengjiao1 aFeng, Junning1 aLi, Guangchao1 aWang, Zhe0 tAtmospheric environment.g2022 Aug. 15, v. 283 p.119190-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2022.1191903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04456naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016500169300001800334520287900352592002803231596007303259650001403332650002303346650001903369650001703388650002803405650001103433650002103444650002403465650002303489650001303512650001503525700001803540700002403558700002003582700002103602700003003623700001703653700002103670700001803691700002003709773016603729856008203895852000903977655001203986IND60590310620221121105747.0190522e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059031062DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-016-8166-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrantl, Eva-Maria10aComparison of in vitro test systems using bacterial and mammalian cells for genotoxicity assessment within the “health-related indication value (HRIV) concept  ap. 3996-4010.  aIn numerous cases, the German health-related indication value (HRIV) concept has proved its practicability for the assessment of drinking water relevant trace substances (Umweltbundesamt 2003). The HRIV is based on the toxicological profile of a substance. An open point of the HRIV concept has been the assignment of standardized test procedures to be used for the assessment. The level of the HRIV is at its lowest as soon as the genotoxicity of the substance is detected. As a single test on its own, it is not sufficient enough to assess the human toxicological relevance of a genotoxic effect or exclude it in the case of a negative result; a reasonable test battery was required, technically oriented towards the already harmonized international, hierarchical evaluation for toxicological assessment of chemicals. Therefore, an important aim of this project was to define a strategy for the genotoxicological assessment of anthropogenic trace substances. The basic test battery for genotoxicity of micropollutants in drinking water needs to fulfill several requirements. Although quick test results are needed for the determination of HRIV, a high degree of transferability to human genotoxicity should be ensured. Therefore, an in vitro genotoxicity test battery consisting of the Ames fluctuation test with two tester strains (ISO 11350), the umu test and the micronucleus test, or from the Ames test with five tester strains (OECD 471) and the micronucleus test is proposed. On the basis of selected test substances, it could be shown that the test battery leads to positive, indifferent, and negative results. Given indifferent results, the health authority and the water supplier must assume that it is a genotoxic substance. Genetically modified tester strains are being sensitive to different chemical classes by expression of selected mammalian key enzymes for example nitroreductase, acetyltransferase, and glutathione-S-transferase. These strains may provide valuable additional information and may give a first indication of the mechanism of action. To check this hypothesis, various additional strains expressing specific human-relevant enzymes were investigated. It could be shown that the additional use of genetically modified tester strains can enhance the detectable substance spectrum with the bacterial genotoxicological standard procedures or increase the sensitivity. The additional use provides orienting information at this level as a lot of data can be obtained quite quickly and with little effort. These indications of the mechanism of action should be however verified with a test system that uses mammalian cells, better human cells, to check their actual relevance. The selection of appropriate additional tester strains has to be defined from case to case depending on the molecular structure and also still requires some major expertise.  aPublisher supplied data  a02WRS1282IcGerman Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) 3aAmes test 3achemical structure 3adrinking water 3agenotoxicity 3aglutathione transferase 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3amechanism of action 3amicronucleus tests 3amutagens 3apollutants1 aKramer, Meike1 aSchmidt, Carsten K.1 aKnauer, Martina1 aGartiser, Stefan1 aShuliakevich, Aliaksandra1 aMilas, Julia1 aGlatt, Hansruedi1 aMeinl, Walter1 aHollert, Henner0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Feb., v. 25, no. 5 p.3996-4010dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-8166-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02638naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008400127300001400211500020100225500001500426520128300441592002801724650002701752650001401779650001501793650001501808650002301823650001801846650001301864650001601877650001801893650001301911650001301924650001401937650001501951650001201966650001301978653002301991700001402014700001502028773010702043939003302150852000902183655001202192IND9104705020221119121738.0181002e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910470502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZHANG, F.

The H ion concentration: dropped sharply within 5 s and then remained practically unchanged for goethite; showed a marked decrease after the rapid reaction stage for gibbsite; and changed only very slowly for kaolinite. For soils, there were also a rapid reaction stage and a slow reaction stage. The magnitude of the increase in positive surface charge was of the order Hapludox > Kanhapludult > Paleudult, while that of the increase in soluble aluminum was of the order Paleudult > Hapludox > Kanhapludult. These phenomena were interpreted in terms of the protonation of surface -Fe-OH groups (a rapid reaction) and the dissolution of aluminum-containing minerals (a slow reaction). The addition of iron oxides to the soil or the removal of free iron oxides from the soil affected the reaction kinetics markedly. The reaction kinetics can be described by parabolic diffusion equation, Elovich equation, and two-constant rate equation fairly well, with the degree of fitness depending on the initial concentration of H ions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acharge characteristics 3akaolinite 3aPaleudults 3amonitoring 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen ions 3agibbsite 3airon oxides 3aKanhapludults 3aHapludox 3aaluminum 3adiffusion 3akinematics 3asoil pH 3akinetics 0agenetic soil types1 aLI, G.

Herein, molecularly imprinted polymers were grown on Fe₃O₄ nanozymes with peroxidase-like activity to create substrate binding pockets. Electron microscopy confirmed a shell of nanogel. By imprinting with an adsorbed substrate, moderate specificity was achieved with neutral monomers. Further introducing charged monomers led to nearly 100-fold specificity for the imprinted substrate over the nonimprinted compared to that of bare Fe₃O₄. Selective substrate binding was further confirmed by isothermal titration calorimetry. The same method was also successfully applied for imprinting on gold nanoparticles (peroxidase mimics) and nanoceria (oxidase mimics). Molecular imprinting furthers the functional enzyme mimicking aspect of nanozymes, and such hybrid materials will find applications in biosensor development, separation, environmental remediation, and drug delivery.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3acalorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3adrugs 3aelectron microscopy 3airon oxides 3amolecular imprinting 3ananogold 3aperoxidase 3apolymers 3aremediation 3atitration1 aZhang, Xiaohan1 aLiu, Biwu1 aLiu, Juewen0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Apr. 19, v. 139, no. 15 p.5412-5419dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b006013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03404naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245009300128300001400221500001500235520197900250592002802229650001402257650002302271650001302294650001502307650001802322650000902340650001902349650001202368650001502380650002002395650002002415650001902435650001202454650002302466650001302489650002002502650001602522650001402538650001502552650002602567650001402593650001302607651001202620653002302632653002302655700001802678700001702696773010702713939003302820852000902853655001202862IND9104705120221119121742.0181002e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910470512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLARSON, K.

Redox potential and pH of Krome very gravelly loam and Chekika very gravelly loam soils were monitored over a 5-week submergence period. Within 2 days of flooding, redox potential decreased to −150 mV and −300 mV for the Krome and Chekika soils, respectively, and by day 21 it had stabilized at about −165 mV for all treatments. The initial pH values of the Chekika and Krome soils was 7.9 and 7.5, respectively, but after 3 weeks of flooding the pH of both soils had stabilized at about 7.25. Samples of both soils were subjected to aerobic (field capacity moisture content, nonflooded) or anaerobic (submerged in water under N atmosphere, flooded) incubation in serum bottles. After 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 weeks of incubation, concentrations of K, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, NH4, NO3 and P were determined. Before incubation, concentrations of Mn and Fe were about 1–2 μg/g soil for both soils. After 7 weeks of flooding, extractable Mn and Fe increased 50-fold and 30-fold, respectively, for the Krome soil and 7-fold and 15-fold, respectively, for the Chekika soil. With aerobic incubation, Mn decreased and Fe increased slightly in both soils. Extractable Mg and Ca increased in both soils regardless of incubation treatment, but flooding resulted in higher concentrations of Mg and lower concentrations of Ca than aerobic incubation by week 7. For both soils, K increased regardless of incubation treatment, whereas P decreased, but decreased more rapidly with flooding. Extractable NO3 decreased with flooding but increased with aerobic incubation, where NH4 decreased with aerobic incubation but increased with flooding. The data obtained from this study indicate that annual, cyclical flooding may have potential for alleviating crop deficiencies of minor elements which is a major production expense in these soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3amanganese 3aagricultural soils 3aEntisols 3aphosphorus 3asoil solution 3airon 3asoil fertility 3asoil pH 3aloam soils 3alimestone soils 3aredox potential 3agravelly soils 3acalcium 3aammonium compounds 3aleaching 3acation exchange 3afloodplains 3apotassium 3asolubility 3anutrient availability 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3aFlorida 0achemical reactions 0agenetic soil types1 aGRAETZ, D.

However, simultaneously ensuring healthy trees with high habitat diversity can be challenging in a harsh urban environment. We compared health, microhabitats, and bat activities between native (Quercus robur L.) and non-native (Quercus rubra L.) oaks growing in different urban habitats (street vs. park) in Karlsruhe, southwestern Germany. We randomly selected 167 oak trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >20 cm across the city from Urban Tree Registrar. We performed tree health assessment, dendrometric, and microhabitat inventory. We recorded the four-day bat activities on 45 native and non-native oaks with acoustic loggers installed on the trees. We found that non-native oaks were healthier than native oaks but provided less abundance and richness of microhabitats. Tree size (positive effect) and pruning (negative effect) strongly influence microhabitat richness and abundance. In addition, park trees hosted significantly more microhabitats than street trees. We recorded the activities of 9 bat species from 4 genera. Pipistrellus bats were more active in park trees than street trees. Long-eared bats (Plecotus) were more active near the native than non-native oaks. Bats are likely favored by microhabitats such as fork split, lightning scar, and woodpecker “flute” that are more common in less healthy trees. We conclude that non-native red oak can be planted alongside streets, where the conditions are harsher than in parks to better adapt to climatic changes and stay healthy with less maintenance. The preservation of native pedunculate oak trees, especially within parks, is paramount for urban biodiversity conservation because of their potential to provide microhabitats and supporting bats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPipistrellus 3aPlecotus 3aQuercus robur 3aQuercus rubra 3aacoustics 3abiodiversity 3abiodiversity conservation 3aecosystems 3aenvironment 3ahealth effects assessments 3ainventories 3alightning 3amicrohabitats 3atree and stand measurements 3atree health 3aurban areas 3awoodpeckers 3aGermany 0aTree health 0aTree microhabitats 0aBat activity 0aNative oaks 0aStreet trees1 aLv, Hailiang1 aEntling, Martin H.1 aSchirmel, Jens1 aNarang, Aditya1 aKöhler, Mario1 aSaha, Somidh0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 20, v. 853 p.158603-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1586033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245008600161500001400247520136300261592002801624650001401652650002301666650001201689650001601701650001401717650002601731650001501757650001801772700002001790700002701810700002501837700001801862773012301880856007402003852000902077655001202086IND60721736920221119100945.0201224e20201219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072173692DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121238882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrada, Marília 10aKnowledge about Sugar Sources and Sugar Intake Guidelines in Portuguese Consumers  aNAL-light  aIn this work, we examined knowledge about sugars and guidelines for its consumption and explored the relationship between knowledge and measures related to nutritional information processing as well as sugar consumption. Specifically, we asked participants (n = 1010 Portuguese) to categorize a set of ingredients (e.g., glucose, aspartame) regarding their composition (i.e., intrinsic vs. added/free sugars) and origin (e.g., natural vs. artificial) and if they were aware of the WHO guidelines for sugar intake. Overall, despite using information about sugar frequently and considering attending to such information as very important to stay healthy, most participants were unaware of the WHO guidelines and revealed difficulties in the categorization task. Women, participants with a higher level of education, and those with children in the household reported higher use of sugar content information present in nutritional labels, higher perceived knowledge of nutritional guidelines, and higher hit rates in categorizing sugar sources. Almost one-fourth of the population exceeds the daily limit recommended by the WHO. Therefore, characterizing the knowledge of a Portuguese sample regarding sugar sources and sugar intake guidelines is particularly relevant, and our results emphasize the need to implement effective strategies to reduce sugar intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaspartame 3aeducational status 3aglucose 3ainformation 3aknowledge 3anutrition information 3apopulation 3asugar content1 aSaraiva, Magda 1 aGarrido, Margarida  V.1 aRodrigues, David  L.1 aLopes, Diniz 0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 19, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121238883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010100162300001800263520145400281592002801735596007001763650001101833650001501844650001301859650001601872650002101888650001901909650001301928650001601941650001101957650001501968650001401983650001201997650001202009651001002021700005902031700001602090700002302106700001902129700001502148773016602163856008202329852000902411655001202420IND60590310920221121130810.0190522e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059031092DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0722-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Jibin10aHydraulic connection affects uranium distribution in the Gas Hure salt lake, Qaidam Basin, China  ap. 4881-4895.  aThe widespread hydraulic connection is necessary for the formation of a salt lake. However, only limited studies have ever been carried out to investigate the influence of the hydraulic connection on the distribution of elements around certain salt lake. In this study, a total of 66 water samples (including river water, stream water, spring water, brine, intercrystalline brine, well water, and drilling brine) were collected around the Gas Hure salt lake (GSKLH) to investigate the relationship between hydraulic connection and uranium (U) distribution via hydrochemistry and isotope (²³⁴U/²³⁸U, δ¹¹B) techniques. The results suggested that the GSKLH was recharged by water from the Kulamulekesay and Atetikan rivers, groundwater (borehole brine and some intercrystalline brine), and deep fluid (some intercrystalline brine), with each contributing 44.03%, 14.95%, and 41.02% of total recharge, respectively. The U-bearing rock was dominated mainly by silicates, carbonates, and evaporites in the high mountain area (region 1), overflow area (region 2), and plain area (region 3) of the GSKLH, respectively. In the GSKLH, the U distribution was strongly correlated with hydraulic connection and the U concentration was influenced by both groundwater flow system and flow velocity (represented by the γCl⁻/γCa²⁺ ratio). Thus, U was enriched under the conditions of regional groundwater flow system and slow velocity in the GSKLH.  aPublisher supplied data  a41521001 & 41422208cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3abasins 3acarbonates 3adrilling 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3ahydrochemistry 3aisotopes 3ariver water 3arivers 3asalt lakes 3asilicates 3astreams 3auranium 3aChina1 aJiang, Hongchen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1271-70281 aXu, Jianxin1 aHussain, Syed Asim1 aYuan, Xiaolong1 aQin, Xiwei0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Feb., v. 25, no. 5 p.4881-4895dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0722-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02042naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001600149245010600165300001500271520109800286592002801384650001501412650001701427650002001444650001101464650001401475650001601489700001801505700001801523773009301541856008501634852000901719655001201728IND4465740220221119094741.0141110e20120327xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446574022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKisi, Ozgur10aModeling discharge–sediment relationship using neural networks with artificial bee colony algorithm  ap. 94-103.  aEstimation of suspended sediment concentration carried by a river is very important for many water resources projects. The accuracy of artificial neural networks (ANN) with artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is investigated in this paper for modeling discharge-suspended sediment relationship. The ANN–ABC was compared with those of the neural differential evolution, adaptive neuro-fuzzy, neural networks and rating curve models. The daily stream flow and suspended sediment concentration data from two stations, Rio Valenciano Station and Quebrada Blanca Station, were used as case studies. For evaluating the ability of the models, mean square error and determination coefficient criteria were used. Comparison results showed that the ANN–ABC was able to produce better results than the neural differential evolution, neuro-fuzzy, neural networks and rating curve models. The logarithm transformed data were also used as input to the proposed ANN–ABC models. It was found that the logarithm transform significantly increased accuracy of the models in suspended sediment estimation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aneural networks 3arivers 3asediments 3astream flow1 aOzkan, Coskun1 aAkay, Bahriye0 tJournal of hydrology.g2012 Mar. 27, v. 428-429 p.94-103dElsevier B.V.x0022-16947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2012.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100002100147245005900168300001600227520055900243592002800802650002900830650001000859650001600869650001500885650001600900650001600916700002000932700002200952773008000974856008301054852000901137655001201146IND4470967020221123012002.0150812e201204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447096702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2011.12.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenschow, Oliver14aThe color red reduces snack food and soft drink intake  ap. 699-702.  aBased on evidence that the color red elicits avoidance motivation across contexts (Mehta & Zhu, 2009), two studies investigated the effect of the color red on snack food and soft drink consumption.

In using industrially relevant reaction conditions the dominant influence of the solvent on the MW energy dissipation is avoided. Below the boiling point, the effect of MWs on the activation energy Eₐ and k₀ is found nonexistent. Interestingly, under reflux conditions, the microwave-heated (MWH) reaction displays very pronounced zero-order kinetics, displaying a much higher reaction rate than observed for the conventionally thermal-heated (CTH) reaction. This is related to a different gas product (methyl bromide, MeBr) removal mechanism, changing from classic nucleation into gaseous bubbles to a facilitated removal through escaping gases/vapors. Additionally, the use of MWs compensates better for the strong heat losses in this reaction, associated with the boiling of HBr/water and the loss of MeBr, than under CTH. Through modeling, MWH was shown to occur inhomogeneously around gas/liquid interfaces, resulting in localized overheating in the very near vicinity of the bubbles, overall increasing the average heating rate in the bubble vicinity vis-à-vis the bulk of the liquid. Based on these observations and findings, a novel continuous reactor concept is proposed in which the escaping MeBr and the generated HBr/water vapors are the main driving forces for circulation. This reactor concept is generic in that it offers a viable and low cost option for the use of very strong acids and the managed removal/quenching of gaseous byproducts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3aactivation energy 3aboiling 3aboiling point 3abubbles 3abyproducts 3aenergy 3aheat 3amethyl bromide 3amodels 3asolvents 3awater vapor1 aBudarin, Vitaliy L.1 aSturm, Guido S.

In butterflies, Wolbachia sp. is the most frequent endosymbiont from this group, occurring in about 30 % of species tested to date. In this report, the presence of Wolbachia-specific DNA has been detected in apollo butterfly (Parnassius apollo). In the isolated population of this insect occurring in Pieniny National Park (Poland), malformed individuals with deformed or reduced wings appear with an exceptionally high frequency. Interestingly, while total DNA isolated from most (about 85 %) normal insects contained Wolbachia-specific sequences detected by PCR, such sequences were absent in a large fraction (70 %) of individuals with deformed wings and in all tested individuals with reduced wings. These results indicate for the first time the correlation between malformation of wings and the absence of Wolbachia sp. in insects. Although the lack of the endosymbiotic bacteria cannot be considered as the sole cause of the deformation or reduction of wings, one might suggest that Wolbachia sp. could play a protective role in the ontogenetic development of apollo butterfly.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aParnassius apollo 3aWolbachia 3aabnormal development 3abacteria 3abutterflies 3adeformation 3aendosymbionts 3aheat shock response 3aimmunity 3anational parks 3aontogeny 3aoxidative stress 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aprotective effect 3awings 3aPoland1 aSanak, Marek1 aWęgrzyn, Grzegorz,0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2016 May, v. 57, no. 2 p.271-274dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-015-0318-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245005700165520162100222592002801843650000901871650002001880650001101900650001301911650001201924650001901936650002101955651001001976653001401986653002202000653002102022653002202043653001902065700001402084700001702098700001602115700001502131700001502146773010502161856008502266852000902351655001202360IND60783672020221121162845.0220830e20220920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078367202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enggeo.2022.1067942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Lixin10aGeotechnical characterization of deep Shanghai clays  aTo date, investigations of soils in Shanghai have mainly focused on upper clays, namely, Layer 2–6, generally within 30–40 m depth. Knowledge of the deep clays of Layer 8 and 10, at depths of approximately 50 m and 100 m, respectively, is very limited. In this study, the detailed geotechnical properties of the deep Shanghai clays of these two layers were investigated through a series of field and laboratory tests. Physical property tests showed that both clays can be classified as low-plasticity silty clay. For the first time in Shanghai, high-quality intact clay samples were retrieved from the deep soil using a double-tube rotary sampler. High-pressure oedometer tests and consolidated undrained (CU) triaxial tests were conducted to evaluate the compressibility and shear strength of intact samples. The oedometer tests indicate that Layer 8 is an overconsolidated clay with an overconsolidation ratio (OCR) of 2–3, and Layer 10 is a normally consolidated clay with a light degree of structure. CU triaxial tests further confirmed the above findings. The compressibility of the Layer 8 clay is lower, and its undrained shear strength and effective friction angle are larger than those of Layer 10, with the latter being deeper. The sensitivity framework, based on Burland's intrinsic compression line (ICL) and sedimentary compression line (SCL), can be used to characterize the overconsolidation/structure nature of the deep Shanghai clays. The strain energy method was found to be more suitable than the Casagrande method for determining the preconsolidation pressure of the deep Shanghai clays.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3acompressibility 3aenergy 3afriction 3ageology 3ashear strength 3asilty clay soils 3aChina 0aDeep clay 0aPhysical property 0aLaboratory tests 0aOverconsolidation 0aSoil structure1 aZhang, Qi1 aZhu, Wenxuan1 aYe, Guanlin1 aShi, Yujin1 aZhu, Hehua0 tEngineering geology.g2022 Sept. 20, v. 307 p.106794-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12441x0013-79527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enggeo.2022.1067943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245014000157300002000297520168600317592002802003650002302031650001502054650001102069650001702080650001602097650001302113650001102126650002402137700001702161700001202178700001302190700001202203700001802215700001802233773013402251856007502385852000902460655001202469IND60538746020221123033840.0160815e20121219xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053874602DNAL7 a10.1021/ja30909342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYin, An-Xiang10aRu Nanocrystals with Shape-Dependent Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectra and Catalytic Properties: Controlled Synthesis and DFT Calculations  ap. 20479-20489.  aDespite its multidisciplinary interests and technological importance, the shape control of Ru nanocrystals still remains a great challenge. In this article, we demonstrated a facile hydrothermal approach toward the controlled synthesis of Ru nanocrystals with the assistance of first-principles calculations. For the first time, Ru triangular and irregular nanoplates as well as capped columns with tunable sizes were prepared with high shape selectivity. In consistency with the experimental observations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed that both the intrinsic characteristics of Ru crystals and the adsorption of certain reaction species were responsible for the shape control of Ru nanocrystals. Ultrathin Ru nanoplates exposed a large portion of (0001) facets due to the lower surface energy of Ru(0001). The selective adsorption of oxalate species on Ru(10–10) would retard the growth of the side planes of the Ru nanocrystals, while the gradual thermolysis of the oxalate species would eliminate their adsorption effects, leading to the shape evolution of Ru nanocrystals from prisms to capped columns. The surface-enhanced Raman spectra (SERS) signals of these Ru nanocrystals with 4-mercaptopyridine as molecular probes showed an enhancement sequence of capped columns > triangle nanoplates > nanospheres, probably due to the sharp corners and edges in the capped columns and nanoplates as well as the shrunk interparticle distance in their assemblies. CO-selective methanation tests on these Ru nanocrystals indicated that the nanoplates and nanospheres had comparable activities, but the former has much better CO selectivity than the latter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aenergy 3ananocrystals 3ananospheres 3aoxalates 3aprisms 3athermal degradation1 aLiu, Wen-Chi1 aKe, Jun1 aZhu, Wei1 aGu, Jun1 aZhang, Ya-Wen1 aYan, Chun-Hua0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Dec. 19, v. 134, no. 50 p.20479-20489dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja30909343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03306naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245012100168300001300289520196100302592002802263650002602291650001102317650001102328650001702339650001202356650002002368650001902388650001102407650001102418650001702429651001002446653001602456653001902472653002102491653001302512653001202525700001202537700001502549700001802564700001202582700001802594700001502612773010102627856008702728852000902815655001202824IND60583062320221120150009.0180904e201704  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058306232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Junwen10aOptimizing isolation protocol of organic carbon and elemental carbon for 14C analysis using fine particulate samples  ap. 9-19.  aRadiocarbon (¹⁴C) analysis is a unique tool that can be used to directly apportion organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) into fossil and non-fossil fractions. In this study, a coupled carbon analyzer and high-vacuum setup was established to collect atmospheric OC and EC. We thoroughly investigated the correlations between ¹⁴C levels and mass recoveries of OC and EC using urban PM2.5 samples collected from a city in central China and found that: (1) the ¹⁴C signal of the OC fraction collected in the helium phase of the EUSSAR_2 protocol (200 °C for 120 s, 300 °C for 150 s, 450 °C for 180 s, and 650 °C for 180 s) was representative of the entire OC fraction, with a relative error of approximately 6%, and (2) after thermal treatments of 120 s at 200 °C, 150 s at 300 °C, and 180 s at 475 °C in an oxidative atmosphere (10% oxygen, 90% helium) and 180 s at 650 °C in helium, the remaining EC fraction sufficiently represented the ¹⁴C level of the entire EC, with a relative error of <10%. The average recovery of the OC and EC fractions for ¹⁴C analysis was 64± 7% (n = 5) and 87 ± 5% (n = 5), respectively. The fraction of modern carbon in the OC and EC of reference material (RM) 8785 was 0.564 ± 0.013 and 0.238 ± 0.006, respectively. Analysis of ¹⁴C levels in four selected PM2.5 samples in Xinxiang, China revealed that the relative contribution of fossil sources in OC and EC in the PM2.5 samples were 50.5± 5.8% and 81.4± 2.6%, respectively, which are comparable to findings in previous studies conducted in other Chinese cities. We confirmed that most urban EC derives from fossil fuel combustion processes, whereas both fossil and non-fossil sources have comparable and important impacts on OC. Our results suggested that water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and its pyrolytic carbon can be completely removed before EC collection via the method employed in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric chemistry 3acarbon 3acities 3afossil fuels 3afossils 3afuel combustion 3aheat treatment 3ahelium 3aoxygen 3aparticulates 3aChina 0aRadiocarbon 0aOrganic carbon 0aElemental carbon 0aAerosols 0aRM 87851 aLi, Jun1 aDing, Ping1 aZhang, Yanlin1 aLiu, Di1 aShen, Chengde1 aZhang, Gan0 tAtmospheric environment.g2017 Apr., v. 154 p.9-19dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2017.01.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03272naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245010400169520157800273592002801851650002101879650002801900650001901928650001301947650001501960650001401975650001201989650001902001650001702020650001302037650001702050650002702067650002202094650001602116651001002132653002702142653002102169653002002190653002402210653002302234653002402257700001502281700003002296700002802326700003302354700002202387700002502409700002802434700005802462773010402520856008502624852000902709655001202718IND60783672120221121162911.0221004e202211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078367212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2022.1138642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrabhu, Paresh10aSynthesis, characterization and anticancer activity of the green-synthesized hematite nanoparticles  aThe conventional synthesis of hematite nanoparticles (HNPs) is expensive and creates secondary contaminants. Therefore, to combat these issues, there is a requirement for a cheap, effective, and eco-friendly technique. Herein, HNPs were prepared using the fruit extract of Spondias pinnata – an abundant source available in Western-coastal India. The polyphenolic compounds aided the synthesis process and the entire procedure was very rapid. The obtained HNPs had needle-like morphology with agglomerations due to the magnetic interactions as seen in FESEM and HRTEM images. Fe and O elements were noticed in EDS results. The crystalline nature and crystal phase were confirmed from XRD and SAED patterns. The lattice parameters of HNPs were in tandem with the literature. Fe–O crystalline vibrations were noticed in FTIR studies. VSM results portrayed the superparamagnetic nature of HNPs with a high magnetic saturation value of 8.949 emu/g and a negligible hysteresis loop. Thermal stability was ascertained using TGA results with 32% overall weight loss. XPS studies revealed the existence of pure HNPs with signature peaks. Raman spectrum showed the bands specific for HNPs, comparable to the commercial one. In addition, the HNPs were mesoporous with a high surface area (72.04 m²/g) – higher than the commercial one. The anticancer potential of the HNPs was successfully demonstrated against two mammalian cancer cell lines. Therefore, the HNPs synthesized in this study could be applied in various biomedical fields, especially for anticancer formulations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpondias pinnata 3aantineoplastic activity 3afruit extracts 3ahematite 3ahysteresis 3amagnetism 3amammals 3aneoplasm cells 3aporous media 3aresearch 3asurface area 3asustainable technology 3athermal stability 3aweight loss 3aIndia 0aHematite nanoparticles 0aSpondias pinnata 0aGreen synthesis 0aAnticancer activity 0aSuperparamagnetism 0aCancer therapeutics1 aRao, Medha1 aMurugesan, Gokulakrishnan1 aNarasimhan, Manoj Kumar1 aVaradavenkatesan, Thivaharan1 aVinayagam, Ramesh1 aLan Chi, Nguyen Thuy1 aPugazhendhi, Arivalagan1 aSelvaraj, Raja1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3170-78990 tEnvironmental research.g2022 Nov., v. 214 p.113864-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.1138643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245007800178520146000256592002801716650002201744650003001766650001501796650002301811650002201834650002101856650001601877650002001893650002201913650001501935650001101950650002301961653003101984653003302015653002702048653003002075653003202105700002302137700001902160773010702179856008802286852000902374655001202383IND60713487520221120222457.0201104e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071348752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1093122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengochea Paz, Diego10aAgricultural land use and the sustainability of social-ecological systems  aAgricultural land expansion and intensification, driven by human consumption of agricultural goods, are among the major threats to environmental degradation and biodiversity conservation. Land degradation can ultimately hamper agricultural production through a decrease in ecosystem services. Thus, designing viable land use policies is a key sustainability challenge. We develop a model describing the coupled dynamics of human demography and landscape composition, while imposing a trade-off between agricultural expansion and intensification. We model land use strategies spanning from low-intensity agriculture and high land conversion rates per person to high-intensity agriculture and low land conversion rates per person; and explore their consequences on the long-term dynamics of the coupled human-land system. We seek to characterise the strategies’ viability in the long run; and understand the mechanisms that potentially lead to large-scale land degradation and population collapse due to resource scarcity. We show that the viability of land use strategies strongly depends on the land’s intrinsic recovery rate. We also find that socio-ecological collapses occur when agricultural intensification is not accompanied by a sufficient decrease in land conversion. Based on these findings we stress the dangers of uninformed land use planning and the importance of precautionary behaviour for land use management and land use policy design.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3abiodiversity conservation 3ademography 3aecosystem services 3aintensive farming 3aland degradation 3aland policy 3aland use change 3aland use planning 3alandscapes 3amodels 3asocial environment 0aSocio-ecological modelling 0aAgricultural intensification 0aAgricultural expansion 0aSocio-ecological collapse 0aPolicies for sustainability1 aHenderson, Kirsten1 aLoreau, Michel0 tEcological modelling.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 437 p.109312-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl6191x0304-38007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1093123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01603naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002300094040001800117100002600135245007900161300001500240520057100255592002800826650001300854650001600867650001400883650002800897700002200925700001900947773015200966856007001118856010401188852000901292655001201301IND60766719520221119025814.0220211e20210309xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076671952DNAL7 a10.3791/622482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisgerber, Daniel W.10aParticle templated emulsification enables microfluidic-free droplet assays  ap. e62248.  aReactions performed in monodispersed droplets afford enhanced accuracy and sensitivity compared to equivalent ones performed in bulk.

Wild tomato species are native to diverse habitats in South America and show great morphological and ecological diversity that has proven useful in breeding programs. However, relatively little is known about nucleotide diversity between tomato species. Until recently limited sequence information was available for tomato, preventing genome-wide evolutionary analyses. Now, an extensive collection of tomato expressed sequence tags (ESTs) is available at the SOL Genomics Network (SGN). This database holds sequences from several species, annotated with quality values, assembled into unigenes, and tested for homology against other genomes. Despite the importance of polymorphism detection for breeding and natural variation studies, such analyses in tomato have mostly been restricted to cultivated accessions. Importantly, previous polymorphisms surveys mostly ignored the linked meta-information, limiting functional and evolutionary analyses. The current data in SGN is thus an under-exploited resource. Here we describe a cross-species analysis taking full-advantage of available information. RESULTS: We mined 20,000 interspecific polymorphisms between Solanum lycopersicum and S. habrochaites or S. pennellii and 28,800 intraspecific polymorphisms within S. lycopersicum. Using the available meta-information we classified genes into functional categories and obtained estimations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) quality, position in the gene, and effect on the encoded proteins, allowing us to perform evolutionary analyses. Finally, we developed a set of more than 10,000 between-species molecular markers optimized by sequence quality and predicted intron position. Experimental validation of 491 of these molecular markers resulted in confirmation of 413 polymorphisms. CONCLUSION: We present a new analysis of the extensive tomato EST sequences available that represents the most comprehensive survey of sequence diversity across Solanum species to date. These SNPs, plus thousands of molecular makers designed to detect the polymorphisms are available to the community via a website.

Soc. 2014, 136, 17601−17615) revealed that nucleation in this system is an apparent second-order in the precatalyst, A = (COD)Ir·POM⁸–, not the higher order implied by classic nucleation theory and its nA ⇌ Aₙ, “critical nucleus”, Aₙ concept. Herein, the three most reasonable more intimate mechanisms of nucleation are tested: bimolecular nucleation, termolecular nucleation, and a mechanism termed “alternative termolecular nucleation” in which 2(COD)Ir⁺ and 1(COD)Ir·POM⁸– yield the transition state of the rate-determining step of nucleation. The results obtained definitively rule out a simple bimolecular nucleation mechanism and provide evidence for the alternative termolecular mechanism with a KEN of 3, Ir₃. All higher molecularity nucleation mechanisms were also ruled out. Further insights into the KEN and its more detailed composition involving hydrogen, {Ir₃H₂ₓPOM}⁶–, are also obtained from the established role of H₂ in the Ir(0)∼₃₀₀ formation balanced reaction stoichiometry, from the p(H₂) dependence of the kinetics, and from a D₂/H₂ kinetic isotope effect of 1.2(±0.3). Eight insights and conclusions are presented. A section covering caveats in the current work, and thus needed future studies, is also included.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrogen 3aisotopes 3ananoparticles 3astoichiometry1 aFinke, Richard G.0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2017 Apr. 19, v. 139, no. 15 p.5444-5457dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fjacs.7b009583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02903naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002700183245015800210506007600368520144800444592002801892506003701920650001701957650001801974650002101992650001002013650002102023650001802044650001602062650001702078650002102095650001602116650002602132650001902158650001402177651001502191700002202206700002502228773011902253856007602372852000902448655001202457IND60647951520221207093832.0190624e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064795152DNAL7 a10.3390/foods50300642doi7 aPMC53024022pmcid7 a282311592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlam, Mohammad Khairul10aComparison of the Proximate Composition, Total Carotenoids and Total Polyphenol Content of Nine Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato Varieties Grown in Bangladesh  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn an attempt to develop the food composition table for Bangladesh, the nutritional composition of nine varieties of orange-fleshed sweet potato was analyzed together with total carotenoids (TCC) and total polyphenol content (TPC). Each variety showed significant variation in different nutrient contents. The quantification of the TCC and TPC was done by spectrophotometric measurement, and the proximate composition was done by the AOAC method. The obtained results showed that total polyphenol content varied from 94.63 to 136.05 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/100 g fresh weight. Among the selected sweet potatoes, Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) Sweet Potato 7 (SP7) contained the highest, whereas BARI SP6 contained the lowest amount of total polyphenol content. The obtained results also revealed that total carotenoids content ranged from 0.38 to 7.24 mg/100 g fresh weight. BARI SP8 showed the highest total carotenoids content, whereas BARI SP6 showed the lowest. Total carotenoids content was found to be higher in dark orange-colored flesh varieties than their light-colored counterparts. The results of the study indicated that selected sweet potato varieties are rich in protein and carbohydrate, low in fat, high in polyphenol and carotenoids and, thus, could be a good source of dietary antioxidants to prevent free radical damage, which leads to chronic diseases, and also to prevent vitamin A malnutrition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantioxidants 3acarbohydrates 3achronic diseases 3acolor 3afood composition 3afree radicals 3agallic acid 3amalnutrition 3anutrient content 3apolyphenols 3aproximate composition 3asweet potatoes 3avitamin A 3aBangladesh1 aRana, Ziaul Hasan1 aIslam, Sheikh Nazrul0 tFoods.g2016 Sept. 14, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods50300643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01854naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010400163300001800267520092100285592002801206650002101234650002101255650001301276650001101289650001701300700002401317700002301341773010401364856007501468852000901543655001201552IND60577911020221118052500.0170810e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057791102DNAL7 a10.1021/ma40015942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDiLauro, Anthony

The procedure (i) is reproducible and scalable over various batches of commercially available monomer, (ii) requires only 4 h to prepare the polymer, (iii) enables functionalized end-caps to be appended to both ends of the linear polymer, and (iv) provides control over the molecular weight of the polymer. This article also (i) provides spectroscopic and experimental evidence that depolymerization of end-capped poly(phthalaldehydes) is mediated by cleavage of the end-cap from the terminus of the polymer in response to a specific applied signal and (ii) shows that plastics made from poly(phthalaldehyde) containing a photoresponsive end-cap can be converted to monomers in the solid state.  aPublisher supplied data 3adepolymerization 3amolecular weight 3aplastics 3asolids 3aspectroscopy1 aRobbins, Jessica S.1 aPhillips, Scott T.0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Apr. 23, v. 46, no. 8 p.2963-2968dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma40015943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245008600164300001600250520145900266592002801725650001701753650001201770650001901782650001401801650000901815650001601824650001901840650001201859650002101871650001001892650001201902650001901914650002001933650001901953650000901972651001001981700001901991700001902010700001502029700001802044700001802062700001702080700001902097773010402116856008202220852000902302655001202311IND60637070820221118015927.0190415e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063707082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2015.05.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan-fu, Fu10aMale Parent Plays More Important Role in Heat Tolerance in Three-Line Hybrid Rice  ap. 116-122.  aTen F1 combinations with their male and female parents were employed to evaluate their heat tolerance during the flowering and early grain filling stages. The rice plants were subjected to heat stress (39°C–43°C) for 1–15 d during flowering. Based on the heat stress index, heat tolerance was only observed in the F1 combinations H2 (K22A × R207), H3 (Bobai A × R207) and H4 (Bobai A × Minghui 63), whereas the others received above 0.5000 of heat stress index. Both parents of the tolerant combination (heat-tolerant × heat-tolerant) possessed heat tolerance, whereas the susceptible combinations were crossed by heat-tolerant (sterile lines) × heat-susceptible (restorer lines), heat-susceptible × heat-tolerant, or heat-susceptible × heat-susceptible parents. This result indicated that heat tolerance in rice was controlled by recessive genes. Thus, both parents should possess high temperature tolerance to develop heat-tolerant F1 combinations. Furthermore, the heat stress index of F1 combinations was significantly correlated with the heat stress index of restorer lines but not with the heat stress index of maintainer lines. This result suggested that male parents play a more important role in heat-tolerant combinations than female parents. Therefore, the heat susceptibility of the hybrid rice in China is mainly due to the wide application of low-heat-tolerant restorer lines with high yield in three-line hybrid rice breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3afemales 3afilling period 3aflowering 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ahybrids 3amaintainer lines 3amales 3aparents 3aplant breeding 3arecessive genes 3arestorer lines 3arice 3aChina1 aCai-xia, Zhang1 aYong-jie, Yang1 aJie, Xiong1 aXue-qin, Yang1 aXiu-fu, Zhang1 aQian-yu, Jin1 aLong-xing, Tao0 tRice science.g2015 May, v. 22, no. 3 p.116-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:J000000149x1672-63087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsci.2015.05.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02141naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245006900178520101800247592002801265650001101293650001801304650001201322650001301334650001101347650001901358653002301377653003101400653001301431653001701444653000901461700001801470700001801488700002101506700002201527773011201549856008501661852000901746655001201755IND60779332420221119052829.0220914e20221105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077933242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1206772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZebarjad, Fatemeh Sadat10aSimulation of methanol synthesis in a membrane-contactor reactor  aIn a recent paper [1] we investigated experimentally in the laboratory the methanol synthesis (MeS) reaction in a novel high-pressure membrane reactor (MR) using tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TGDE) and an ionic liquid (IL) as the sweep liquids. We reported significantly higher carbon conversion (per single-pass) compared to a traditional packed-bed reactor (PBR), as a result of the in-situ removal of methanol by the sweep liquid. In this paper, a steady-state model is developed to simulate the MR behavior during MeS and is validated by the experimental data. The model is then used to study the reactor behavior for a broader range of operating conditions beyond those that can be accessed and studied experimentally in the laboratory-scale reactor. Converting the model equations into their dimensionless form helps to identify the key dimensionless groups determining reactor performance, enables one to better evaluate the efficacy of the MR system, and guides further process design and scale-up.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3amethanol 3amodels 3aprocess design 0aMethanol synthesis 0aMembrane contactor reactor 0aModeling 0aIonic liquid 0aTGDE1 aGong, Jingwen1 aLi, Zhongtang1 aJessen, Kristian1 aTsotsis, Theodore0 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Nov. 05, v. 661 p.120677-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1206773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03137naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245025200164300001600416520102400432592002801456650001801484650001901502650002401521650001701545650001401562650002501576650002001601650001601621650002101637650001501658650001001673650001101683650001501694650001701709650001901726650002101745650001401766650002401780653002601804653002801830653002401858653002001882653002701902700003301929700002201962700002601984700002002010700002002030700001802050700003402068700006402102700002202166700002202188700002502210700006102235773011202296856008202408852000902490655001202499IND60638106320221121033152.0190516e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063810632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2019.04.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAfrin, Sadia10aStrawberry tree honey as a new potential functional food.

Significant oxidative stress was observed through the increase of intracellular ROS generation, lipid and protein damage and reduction of antioxidant enzyme activities in colon cancer cells; in HDF these effects were limited or none. The expression of NF-кB, p-IкBα, Nrf2 was suppressed after STH treatment in colon cancer cells. All the parameters of mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were reduced after STH treatment in cancer cells, while they were unchanged in HDF. Wound-closure percentages and the expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, N-cadherin, β-catenin decreased, while those of E-cadherin increased after STH treatment in colon cancer cells.

In a chicken pasta meal, salt concentrations included 100% (full salt) and reduced salt variations (75%, 50%, and 25% of the original salt concentration) and for each meal, a version with and without herb addition. The influence of storage time on sensory perception and acceptance was investigated, along with the odor‐induced saltiness enhancement (OISE). Trained sensory panel results showed that the addition of herbs to the chicken pasta meal increased the intensity of many flavors and led to an increased saltiness perception, demonstrating their congruency with salty taste. The addition of herbs allowed for a 50% salt reduction in a processed prepared meal while maintaining the same intensity of saltiness perception as determined by a trained panel and overall meal acceptance by consumers. The OISE was only significant for the 25% salt meal (P < 0.05) suggesting that the influence of herb addition on saltiness perception at lower salt concentrations was more influential than at higher salt concentrations. Over longer storage times, meals processed by MATS and stored at ambient temperature increased in aroma, taste, and flavor intensities as well as in acceptance of many meal attributes. This study contributed an additional strategy of product reformulation, specifically herb addition, to the portfolio of salt‐reduction strategies for prepared meals using MATS. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The addition of herbs to prepared meals (chicken pasta) may allow for up to a 50% reduction in salt content while maintaining the same saltiness intensity perception and overall consumer acceptance. This has important implications for the food industry as sodium reduction is a complex task. Furthermore, the additional herbs utilized in this study increased the intensity of certain aromas and flavors, and led to increased saltiness perception; these herbs could be considered in future salt reduction applications as this study demonstrates their congruency with salty taste.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDA AFRI  c2016‐68003‐24840  cWSU School of Food Science  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculture 3aambient temperature 3achickens 3aconsumer acceptance 3afood industry 3afood matrix 3aherbs 3amicrowave treatment 3aodors 3apasta 3asalt concentration 3asalt content 3asaltiness 3asensory evaluation 3asodium 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3ataste1 aSablani, Shyam S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5602-38321 aTang, Juming1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9449-10041 aRoss, Carolyn F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5319-19500 tJournal of food science.g2019 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.2313-2324dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.147363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245015000178300001600328520104600344592002801390596008301418650002501501650001801526650001101544650001701555650002201572650003201594650001301626650002301639650003001662650001801692650001001710650002101720700003201741700003301773700003001806700003001836700004001866700006601906773012001972856008102092852000902173655001202182IND60633239320221121142908.0190319e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063323932DNAL7 a10.1007/s11130-019-0712-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaludo, Michelly Cristiane10aExtracts of Peels and Seeds of Five Varieties of Brazilian Jabuticaba Present High Capacity to Deactivate Reactive Species of Oxygen and Nitrogen  ap. 135-140.  aJabuticaba has a high concentration of phenolic compounds, which have a significant antioxidant capacity. Methodologies have been developed to evaluate the ability of plant extracts to fight free radicals such as H₂O₂, O₂•ˉ, HOCl, ONOOˉ and ROO•. Thus, the capacity of deactivation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in peel and seed extracts of five varieties of jabuticaba was evaluated. Sabará peel (SFP) deactivated HOCl with IC₅₀ 9.24 μg. mL⁻¹; Paulista seed (PF) deactivated O₂•ˉ with IC₅₀ 16.15 μg. mL⁻¹; Coroada seed (CFP) deactivated ONOOˉ with IC₅₀ 3.84 μg. mL⁻¹; the peel of CFP deactivated ONOOˉ with IC₅₀ 5.88 μg. mL⁻¹; the peel of SFP deactivated the ROO• at 918.16 μmol TE. g⁻¹; and Sabará seed deactivated H₂O₂ with 49.11% inhibition at a concentration of 125 μg. mL⁻¹ of extract. These results demonstrate the high antioxidant potential of this fruit, indicating that it could be extremely beneficial to human health.  aPublisher supplied data  a145652/2014-9cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radicals 3afruits 3ahuman health 3ahydrogen peroxide 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3anitrogen 3aphenolic compounds 3areactive nitrogen species 3aseed extracts 3aseeds 3asuperoxide anion1 ade Oliveira, Luciana Fontes1 aHermosín-Gutiérrez, Isidro1 aBallus, Cristiano Augusto1 aRibeiro, Alessandra Braga1 ade Oliveira, Silvia Borges Pimentel1 aGodoy, Helena Teixeira1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4339-54630 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2019 Mar., v. 74, no. 1 p.135-140dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-0712-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02975naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245017000153300001800323520133500341592002801676650002001704650001001724650001201734650002301746650001301769650001501782650002601797650001501823650001701838650001401855650001701869650001201886650001101898650001301909650002101922653001901943653002401962653002301986653002102009653002602030700001602056700002102072700001402093700001302107700001702120700001702137700001702154700001702171700001302188773012602201856007302327852000902400655001202409IND60528195520221122181858.0160716e20140409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052819552DNAL7 a10.1021/am405680d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Rui10aStructure, MC3T3-E1 Cell Response, and Osseointegration of Macroporous Titanium Implants Covered by a Bioactive Microarc Oxidation Coating with Microporous Structure  ap. 4797-4811.  aMacroporous Ti with macropores of 50–400 μm size is prepared by sintering Ti microbeads with different diameters of 100, 200, 400, and 600 μm. Bioactive microarc oxidation (MAO) coatings with micropores of 2–5 μm size are prepared on the macroporous Ti. The MAO coatings are composed of a few TiO₂ nanocrystals and lots of amorphous phases with Si, Ca, Ti, Na, and O elements. Compared to compact Ti, the MC3T3-E1 cell attachment is prolonged on macroporous Ti without and with MAO coatings; however, the cell proliferation number increases. These results are contributed to the effects of the space structure of macroporous Ti and the surface chemical feature and element dissolution of the MAO coatings during the cell culture. Macroporous Ti both without and with MAO coatings does not cause any adverse effects in vivo. The new bone grows well into the macropores and micropores of macroporous Ti with MAO coatings, showing good mechanical properties in vivo compared to Ti, MAO-treated Ti, and macroporous Ti because of its excellent osseointegration. Moreover, the MAO coatings not only show a high interface bonding strength with new bones but also connect well with macroporous Ti. Furthermore, the pushing out force for macroporous Ti with MAO coatings increases significantly with increasing microbead diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abones 3acalcium 3acell proliferation 3acoatings 3amacropores 3amechanical properties 3amicropores 3ananocrystals 3aoxidation 3aporous media 3asilicon 3asodium 3atitanium 3atitanium dioxide 0amacroporous Ti 0aMC3T3-E1 osteoblast 0amicroarc oxidation 0aosseointegration 0amechanical properties1 aWei, Daqing1 aZheng, Yuanchun,1 aFeng, Wei1 aDu, Qing1 aYang, Haoyue1 aLi, Baoqiang1 aWang, Yaming1 aJia, Dechang1 aZhou, Yu0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Apr. 09, v. 6, no. 7 p.4797-4811dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am405680d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02981naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012100172300001400293520135600307592002801663650002801691650003801719650001301757650001701770650002001787650001101807650002001818650003501838650001701873650001401890650001301904650001101917650001401928650002001942650001401962650002401976650002202000650001602022650001002038653002102048653003702069653002802106653002302134653004402157653004102201700001602242773009502258856008902353852000902442655001202451IND60598366520221120092048.0180629e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059836652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.actatropica.2014.03.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeldmann, U.10aApplying GIS and population genetics for managing livestock insect pests: Case studies of tsetse and screwworm flies  ap. S1-S5.  aThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have supported a Co-ordinated Research Project (CRP) on ‘Applying GIS and population genetics for managing livestock insect pests’. This six-year CRP (2008–2013) focused on research aimed at under-pinning the Area-Wide Integrated Pest Management (AW-IPM) of populations of tsetse and screwworm flies, and this introductory paper to the Special Issue integrates the findings of the CRP participants and discusses them in a broader context. The tools and techniques for mapping and modelling the distributions of genetically-characterised populations of tsetse and screwworm flies are increasingly used by researchers and managers for more effective decision-making in AW-IPM programmes, as illustrated by the reports in this Special Issue. Currently, the insect pests are often characterized only by neutral genetic markers suitable for recognizing spatially isolated populations that are sometimes associated with specific environments. Two challenges for those involved in AW-IPM are the standardization of best practice to permit the efficient application of GIS and genetic tools by regional teams, and the need to develop further the mapping and modelling of parasite and pest phenotypes that are epidemiologically important.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCochliomyia hominivorax 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3aGlossina 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenergy 3agenetic markers 3ageographic information systems 3ainsect pests 3alivestock 3amanagers 3amodels 3aparasites 3apest management 3aphenotype 3apopulation genetics 3aresearch projects 3aresearchers 3ateams 0aGlossina species 0aAnimal and human trypanosomiasis 0aCochliomyia hominivorax 0aChrysomya bezziana 0aNew World and Old World screwworm flies 0aArea-Wide Integrated Pest Management1 aReady, P.D.0 tActa tropica.g2014 Oct., v. 138 p.S1-S5dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2014.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245012300171520148400294592002801778650002301806650001701829650001901846650001501865650002201880650001701902650003401919650001601953650001601969653002301985653002502008653003102033653001902064653002702083700001602110700001902126700001402145700002002159700002302179700006102202773011302263856008502376852000902461655001202470IND60779332620221119052754.0220621e20220905xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077933262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1206792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Qiangqiang12aA zwitterionic copolymer-interlayered ultrathin nanofilm with ridge-shaped structure for ultrapermeable nanofiltration  aInterlayered thin-film composite (TFC) membranes have a great potential for enhancing salt separation in wastewater reclamation, because of the highly permeable and selective properties. However, mechanistic insights regarding the structural features of the surface nanofilms and their corresponding interlayers, which lead to enhanced separation efficiency, remain poorly understood. Herein, we report a zwitterionic copolymer 2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) and 2-amino-ethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (AEMA) (P[MPC-co-AEMA]) interlayered TFC membrane that exhibits an ultrahigh water permeance of 20.4 L m⁻² h⁻¹ bar⁻¹ (almost three folds higher water permeance than that of the pristine PA membrane), together with a simultaneously enhanced rejection of inorganic salts (96.8% against Na₂SO₄). Detailed mechanistic investigations revealed that the promoted membrane separation property was mainly explained as the enriched amine monomer diffusion-driven instability induced by the P[MPC-co-AEMA] interlayer. This triggers membrane sealing and inhibits its growth, leading to the formation of an ultrathin PA nanofilm with a thickness of 12 nm, a ridge-shaped surface structure with enhanced specific surface area, and enhanced crosslinking. The fundamental mechanism revealed in this study lays a solid foundation for the engineering of the high-performance TFC membrane, which is appealing for the energy-efficient water remediation industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acrosslinking 3ananofiltration 3ananosheets 3aphosphorylcholine 3asurface area 3athin film composite membranes 3awater reuse 3azwitterions 0aUltrathin nanofilm 0aRidge-shaped surface 0aInterfacial polymerization 0aNanofiltration 0aZwitterionic copolymer1 aLin, Yuqing1 aUeda, Takafumi1 aShen, Qin1 aLee, Kueir-Rarn1 aYoshioka, Tomohisa1 aMatsuyama, Hideto1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2468-49050 tJournal of membrane science.g2022 Sept. 05, v. 657 p.120679-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2022.1206793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012900167300001800296500002000314520196800334592002802302596003802330650001502368650000902383650002002392650002902412650001602441650002602457650002702483650002502510650002502535700006002560700001902620773012502639856007902764852000902843655001202852IND60656394620221120083723.0190813e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065639462DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.147072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSparkman, Kristen10aUnderstanding How High‐Protein Bar Formulations Impact Their Mechanical and Wear Behaviors Using Response Surface Analysis  ap. 2209-2221.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHigh‐protein bars are popular snack items that can have significant processing issues like sticking, clogging, and cold flow. These issues are primarily problematic during formulation development because current predictive testing is reliant on highly empirical bench tests or pilot plant testing, which is expensive and time‐consuming. Wear testing, which has been used in the medical field to evaluate the lifetime of soft materials used in joint replacements, may have promise in evaluating food processing ability. Wear and rheological testing were used to better understand high‐protein bar processing ability. The objective of this study was to determine bench‐level instrumental tests that would be able to predict processing ability for a given formulation. Two response surface designs were used for formulations of model bar systems comprising whey protein isolate (WPI), high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), and either canola oil or vegetable shortening. Ingredient formulation affected processing ability, wear behaviors, and rheological behaviors. Formulations with high ratios of WPI to HFCS and either shortening or oil exhibited good processing ability, lower wear rates, and increased elastic‐type behavior, indicating that processing ability is related to formulation. The results of this study indicated that material mechanical and wear behaviors were related to processing ability; both were controlled by formulation. Because it was shown to be a good indicator of high‐protein bar processing ability, wear testing of food has potential significance in benchtop testing. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Understanding of how high‐protein bar formulations impact their mechanical behaviors can help streamline their formulation development and scaling from bench to industrial production. Processing ability may be predicted with a quick wear test, providing a rapid testing method that requires little sample for evaluating bar formulations.  aPublisher supplied data  cWestern Dairy Center: BUILD Dairy 3acanola oil 3acold 3afood processing 3ahigh fructose corn syrup 3aingredients 3amechanical properties 3arheological properties 3avegetable shortening 3awhey protein isolate1 aJoyner, Helen S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5452-08831 aSmith, Brennan0 tJournal of food science.g2019 Aug., v. 84, no. 8 p.2209-2221dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.147073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01436naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300002000288520027900308592002800587650001400615650001100629650002300640650002300663650002100686650002200707700001400729700001800743700001700761700001600778700001800794700001500812700001600827773013600843856007400979852000901053655001201062IND60661171720221119113509.0190828e20151124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066117172DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc07052j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLou, Shuaifeng10aFacile synthesis of nanostructured TiNb₂O₇ anode materials with superior performance for high-rate lithium ion batteries  ap. 17293-17296.  aOne-dimensional nanostructured TiNb₂O₇ was prepared by a simple solution-based process and subsequent thermal annealing.

We compared the effects of polyphenol-enriched and standard tomato juice on parameters of lipid and oxidative status and blood pressure in subjects with stage 1 hypertension. The experimental group (n = 13) was supplemented with 200 g of tomato fruit juice enriched with 1 g of ethanolic extract of whole tomato fruit, while the control group (n = 13) was consuming 200 g tomato fruit juice. Before and after the treatment, blood samples were collected, and blood pressure was measured. Markers of oxidative stress and antioxidative defense: paraoxonase (PON1), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance (PAB) and C reactive protein (CRP) were determined in serum. Prothrombin time (PT) was measured in the whole blood samples. Parameters of lipid status, as well as susceptibility to copper-induced oxidation of LDL particles in vitro were also determined. There was a significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C only in the control group at the end of the study. No significant differences were observed in the remainder of the assessed parameters along the study. In conclusion, tomato juice may have favorable effects on lipid metabolism, but polyphenol fortification does not constitute additional beneficial cardiovascular effects.  aPublisher supplied data  aProject No. III 46001cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  aProject No. III 175035cMinistarstvo Prosvete, Nauke i Tehnološkog Razvoja  aCharles University Project Progress Q25.cUniverzita Karlova v Praze 3aantihypertensive effect 3aantioxidants 3aaryldialkylphosphatase 3ablood pressure 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acholesterol 3acopper 3afruit juices 3afruits 3ahypertension 3alipid metabolism 3alow density lipoprotein 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3apolyphenols 3aprothrombin 3arisk reduction 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 3atomato juice 3atomatoes 3avegetable consumption1 aBelović, Miona1 aIlić, Nebojša1 aKotur-Stevuljević, Jelena1 aSlanař, Ondřej1 aŠobajić, Sladjana0 tPlant foods for human nutrition.g2019 Mar., v. 74, no. 1 p.122-127dSpringer USwJournal:jnl42388x0921-96687nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11130-019-0714-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011700210300001400327520100200341592002801343650001701371650001101388650003101399650001001430650002201440650001301462650001101475650001101486650001601497650001901513650002901532650001801561650002001579651001001599653001201609653001601621653001001637653001801647653002801665700007301693773009401766856008501860852000901945655001201954IND60544359620221119053022.0190415e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054435962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2015.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTapia, Fabian J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9661-606910aSpatio-temporal transcriptome analysis in the marine snail Tegula atra along central-northern Chile (28–31°S)  ap. 61-65.  aThis study describes the results from transcriptomes sequenced by illumina technology from four populations in the marine snail Tegula atra along central-northern Chile (28–31°S) during summer and winter 2014. In silico differential expression of transcripts annotated to known proteins revealed several local patterns associated to the environmental thermal variability. Herein, northern populations evidenced lower number of genes highly regulated, while southern populations displayed opposite patterns. This relationship could suggest that northern snail populations are more adapted to high temperature variations, enabling specific genes (e.g. HSPs and antioxidant system) to maintain high transcriptional activity under controlled physiological conditions. This transcriptome response or “frontloading” strategy can significantly increase the speed of response to thermal stress, and also be a relevant molecular underpinning to explain the genomic diversity along the Chilean coast.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acoasts 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3aproteins 3asnails 3asummer 3atemperature 3athermal stress 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3aChile 0aRNA-Seq 0aTegula atra 0aSnail 0aTranscriptome 0aSequencing by synthesis1 aGallardo Escárate, Cristian,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7094-67020 tMarine genomics.g2015 Oct., v. 23 p.61-65dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12137x1874-77877nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.margen.2015.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100003300183245020500216506007600421520141200497592002801909506003701937650001201974650001701986650000902003650001302012650000902025650001502034650002402049650002102073650001102094650001102105650001602116650001602132651000902148700001902157700001902176700002202195773011802217856007602335852000902411655001202420IND60647952320221207091250.0190624e20160723xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064795232DNAL7 a10.3390/foods50300522doi7 aPMC53023962pmcid7 a282311472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarami Milani, Mohammad Reza10aApplying Least Absolute Shrinkage Selection Operator and Akaike Information Criterion Analysis to Find the Best Multiple Linear Regression Models between Climate Indices and Components of Cow’s Milk  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study focuses on multiple linear regression models relating six climate indices (temperature humidity THI, environmental stress ESI, equivalent temperature index ETI, heat load HLI, modified HLI (HLI <inf>new</inf>), and respiratory rate predictor RRP) with three main components of cow’s milk (yield, fat, and protein) for cows in Iran. The least absolute shrinkage selection operator (LASSO) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) techniques are applied to select the best model for milk predictands with the smallest number of climate predictors. Uncertainty estimation is employed by applying bootstrapping through resampling. Cross validation is used to avoid over-fitting. Climatic parameters are calculated from the NASA-MERRA global atmospheric reanalysis. Milk data for the months from April to September, 2002 to 2010 are used. The best linear regression models are found in spring between milk yield as the predictand and THI, ESI, ETI, HLI, and RRP as predictors with p-value < 0.001 and R2 (0.50, 0.49) respectively. In summer, milk yield with independent variables of THI, ETI, and ESI show the highest relation (p-value < 0.001) with R2 (0.69). For fat and protein the results are only marginal. This method is suggested for the impact studies of climate variability/change on agriculture and food science fields when short-time series or data with large uncertainty are available.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate 3afood science 3aheat 3ahumidity 3amilk 3amilk yield 3aregression analysis 3arespiratory rate 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3auncertainty 3aIran1 aHense, Andreas1 aRahmani, Elham1 aPloeger, Angelika0 tFoods.g2016 July 23, v. 5, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods50300523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02808naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245004900183300001600232520126200248536014901510592002801659596008001687596005701767650001001824650002001834650001401854650001801868650003301886650003301919650001601952650001101968653003401979653001502013653001902028653001902047700002502066700004102091700004002132773010802172856008502280852000902365655001202374IND60619971420221117202419.0200514e20181002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061997142DNAL7 a10.1080/01916122.2017.14033902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinho, Elysiane de Barros10aPollen morphology of Mourera (Podostemaceae)  ap. 553-559.  aThe pollen morphology of Mourera (Podostemaceae) was analysed with the aim of providing detailed descriptions of pollen for all species of the genus. Pollen grains were obtained from anthers of flower buds, acetolysed, and examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. The pollen grains are monads, small or medium sized, prolate in shape, with a circular or subcircular amb. Pollen grains are tricolpate, and the colpus was variously ornate and has distinctive ornamentation between apertural and non-apertural regions. The exine is thin and microechinate with supratectal spines in all species. In M. fluviatilis, M. monadelpha and M. schwackeana the surface has inconspicuous spines without delimited basis; in M. alcicornis, M. aspera, M. elegans and M. weddelliana, the surface has spines at the apices of ‘mamiloid elements’, with a wide base of spines individualised and well defined. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to divide the main pollen taxa into three groups based on pollen morphology.

S.10aRegular Mixing Thermodynamics of Hydrogenated Styrene–Isoprene Block–Random Copolymers  ap. 3084-3091.  aRandom copolymerization of A and B monomers represents a versatile method to tune interaction strengths between polymers, as ArB random copolymers will exhibit a smaller effective Flory interaction parameter χ (or interaction energy density X) upon mixing with A or B homopolymers than upon mixing A and B homopolymers with each other, and the ArB composition can be tuned continuously. This approach can also be used to tune the segregation strength in A–ArB “block–random” copolymers. Simple models of polymer mixing thermodynamics suggest that the effective interaction energy density in such block–random copolymers should follow XA–AᵣB = fB²XA–B, but this prediction has not been tested quantitatively. The present work systematically assesses the validity of this rule for thermally stable hydrogenated derivatives of styrene–isoprene block copolymers, through measurements of the order–disorder transition (ODT) temperature on near-symmetric diblock and diblock–random copolymers of varying composition and suitable molecular weight (M). Both hydrogenated derivatives wherein the styrene aromaticity is retained, and derivatives wherein the styrene units are saturated to vinylcyclohexane, are examined, and both are found to closely obey the XA–AᵣB = fB²XA–B prediction, thereby confirming the utility of this simple relationship in designing block copolymers with targeted interaction strengths using only these two common monomers. The reduction in XA–AᵣB over XA–B permits the synthesis of polymers having much larger M and domain spacing d while maintaining a thermally accessible ODT; measured domain spacings are found to closely follow the expected scaling, d ∼ X¹/⁶M²/³.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3aenergy density 3amixing 3amodels 3amolecular weight 3aprediction 3astyrene 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aRegister, Richard A.0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Apr. 23, v. 46, no. 8 p.3084-3091dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma40025123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02398naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148245012400170300001600294520104000310592002801350650001001378650001801388650002301406650002001429650001501449650001801464650001101482650002701493650001401520650002101534650001401555700002001569700001701589700002001606700001601626700002301642700001701665700002201682700002301704700001701727773010501744856008201849852000901931655001201940IND60637071820221118014632.0190415e201511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063707182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsci.2015.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDEVI, S.J.S.

Stringent phenotyping coupled with genotyping using gene based markers led to the identification of four resistant introgression lines, which showed promising resistance and do not possess any of the tested genes. Furthermore, multi-location screening confirmed the field resistance of the four introgression lines to both leaf and neck blast. Molecular characterization of these introgression lines using genome-wide simple sequence repeat markers revealed the presence of small percentage of wild Oryza genome introgrssion. So these lines can be used for mapping and identification of novel leaf and neck blast resistance genes. Thus, these four introgression lines can be considered as new genetic resources for blast resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza 3ablast disease 3agenetic background 3agenetic markers 3agenotyping 3aintrogression 3aleaves 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aphenotype 3aresistance genes 3ascreening1 aSingh, Kuldeep,1 aUMAKANTH, B.1 aVISHALAKSHI, B.1 aRenuka, P.,1 aSUDHAKAR, K.

These forms occur mainly from the Middle Ordovician to Early Devonian. They were first recognised in 1971, but it was not until 1979 that the process of formal description commenced. In 1984 they were included in a newly created higher taxonomic grouping called ‘cryptospores’, the term reflecting their complex morphology and then the ongoing debate regarding their affinities. Subsequently the exact definition of the term cryptospore has been debated, with some preferring a wide definition encompassing all non-marine palynomorphs produced by algae and early land plants, but others confining inclusion to spores deriving from early embryophytes. Since their recognition, numerous ‘cryptospore’ taxa have been described. However, their complex morphologies are difficult to interpret and numerous taxonomic debates have confused the delineation of genera and their classification into higher ranks. Here we present a key for the identification of ‘cryptospore’ taxa with the aim of clarifying some of this confusion.  aPS is a Senior Researcher of the Belgium National Fund for Scientific Research (NFSR).

A single nucleotide polymorphism in the P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (Pfcrt) gene at position 76 resulting in a change in coding from lysine to threonine (K76T) has been implicated to be the corner stone of chloroquine resistance. Widespread resistance to chloroquine in endemic regions led to its replacement with other antimalarials. In some areas this replacement resulted in a reversion of the mutant T76 allele to the wild-type K76 allele. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of the K76T mutation of the Pfcrt gene eight years after the ban on chloroquine sales and use. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 6 regional hospitals in Ghana. PCR-RFLP was used to analyse samples collected to determine the prevalence of Pfcrt K76T mutation. Of the 1318 participants recruited for this study, 246 were found to harbour the P. falciparum parasites, of which 60.98% (150/246) showed symptoms for malaria. The prevalence of the Pfcrt T76 mutant allele was 58.54% (144/246) and that of the K76 wild-type allele was 41.46% (102/246). No difference of statistical significance was observed in the distribution of the alleles in the symptomatic and asymptomatic participants (P=0.632). No significant association was, again, observed between the alleles and parasite density (P=0.314), as well as between the alleles and Hb levels of the participants (P=0.254). Notwithstanding the decline in the prevalence of the Pfcrt T76 mutation since the antimalarial policy change in 2004, the 58.54% prevalence recorded in this study is considered high after eight years of the abolishment of chloroquine usage in Ghana. This is in contrast to findings from other endemic areas where the mutant allele significantly reduced in the population after a reduction chloroquine use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPlasmodium falciparum 3aalleles 3achloroquine 3across-sectional studies 3ahospitals 3aissues and policy 3alysine 3amalaria 3amutants 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3asales 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3athreonine 3aGhana 0aPlasmodium falciparum 0aMalaria 0aMutation 0aChloroquine1 aBoampong, Johnson N.1 aEgyir-Yawson, Alexander1 aNwaefuna, Ekene K.1 aVerner, Orish N.1 aAsare, Kwame K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1430-289X0 tActa tropica.g2014 Aug., v. 136 p.32-36dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44799x0001-706X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actatropica.2014.03.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005500111040001800166072000900184072000900193072000900202100001600211245022200227300001400449500002400463520102700487650002601514650003101540650001901571650003301590650001001623650002101633650002301654650002501677650002701702650002301729650003001752650001901782650001201801650004401813650002101857650003301878650002501911650002901936650002301965653001701988653002302005653002202028653002202050653002602072700001102098700001602109773012102125852000902246856010502255930003302360945002502393946001302418655001202431IND4393005620221121050848.0070713e200702  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439300562DNAL7 a173708082pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493(2007)100[49:MFATOB]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF822 0aK001 0aF8211 aMaehara, N.10aMaturation Feeding and Transmission of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Nematoda: Parasitaphelenchidae) by Monochamus alternatus (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) Inoculated with Beauveria bassiana (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes)  ap. 49-53.  aIncludes references  aWe examined the amount of maturation feeding and transmission of pinewood nematodes, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus (Steiner et Buhrer) Nickle (Nematoda: Parasitaphelenchidae), to healthy pine (Pinus spp.) trees by pine sawyer Monochamus alternatus Hope (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) adults infected with Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuill. (Deuteromycotina: Hyphomycetes). Inoculated beetles fed less than noninoculated beetles, probably because feeding by inoculated beetles began to decrease at about 4 d postinoculation and inoculated beetles ceased to feed for several days before their death. In inoculated beetles carrying >1,000 nematodes, some beetles died before nematode departure. The remaining heavily nematode-infested beetles lived until the beginning of nematode departure, but they had stopped feeding, preventing the nematodes from entering pine twigs. We suggest that microbial control of pine sawyer adults by B. bassiana may be effective in preventing transmission of pine wilt disease to healthy pine trees. 3aMonochamus alternatus 3aBursaphelenchus xylophilus 3ainsect vectors 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aPinus 3afeeding behavior 3avectorial capacity 3adisease transmission 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aBeauveria bassiana 3abiological control agents 3avector control 2aAnimals 2aColeopteraxmicrobiologyxparasitology. 2aFeeding Behavior 2aMitosporic Fungixphysiology 2aNematodaxphysiology 2aPest Control, Biological 2aPopulation Density 0apine sawyers 0apinewood nematodes 0apine wilt disease 0amicrobial control 0anematode transmission1 aHe, X.1 aShimazu, M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2007 Feb., v. 100, no. 1 p.49-53dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2007)100[49:MFATOB]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20070806b20070902c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/08/02  aOther US 7aarticle02958naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245022800155300001800383520171300401592002802114650002202142650002202164650001302186650003302199650002602232650001302258650004402271650001302315650002102328700001702349700001902366700002302385773010402408856007502512852000902587655001202596IND60577911920221120103819.0170810e20130423xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057791192DNAL7 a10.1021/ma400254d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOzaki, Anri10aSynthesis of Poly(decahydro-2-naphthyl methacrylate)s with Different Geometric Structures and Effects of Side-Group Dynamics on Polymer Properties Investigated by Thermal and Dynamic Mechanical Analyses and DFT Calculations  ap. 2941-2950.  aWe prepared the geometric isomers of decahydro-2-naphthols as the source materials for the synthesis of poly(decahydro-2-naphthyl methacrylate)s [poly(DNMA)-I, -II, -III, and -IV] including alicyclic ester groups with different geometric structures. The geometry and conformational dynamics of the decahydro-2-naphthyl moieties were investigated by NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. We synthesized each isomer of the methacrylic monomers, polymerized them, and investigated the optical, thermal, and mechanical properties of poly(DNMA)s with different isomer compositions. The Tg values of the poly(DNMA)s were in the following order: 139.3 °C for poly(DNMA)-II < 142.7 °C for poly(DNMA)-I < 146.2 °C for poly(DNMA)-III < 152.9 °C for poly(DNMA)-III/IV. On the basis of the dynamic motion of the alicyclic substituents determined by dynamic mechanical analysis, the tan δ peaks due to the β-relaxation for the a conformation change of the side group were observed for poly(DNMA)-I, while no peak was observed for poly(DNMA)-III. The activation energies for the β-relaxation were 65 kJ/mol for poly(DNMA)-I and 56–63 kJ/mol for the poly(DNMA)s including the four isomeric ester groups with various compositions. An increase in the DNMA-II content in the repeating units accelerated a dynamic conformation change, resulting in a decrease in the tan δ peak temperature and the activation energy value, as well as the glass transition temperature of the polymers. The optical property of the resulting polymers as the transparent polymer materials was also investigated. The density, refractive index value, and Abbe number of poly(DNMA)s were 1.04–1.10 cm³/g, 1.489, and 42–44, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3ageometric isomers 3ageometry 3aglass transition temperature 3amechanical properties 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolymers 3arefractive index1 aSumita, Koha1 aGoto, Kunihiro1 aMatsumoto, Akikazu0 tMacromolecules.g2013 Apr. 23, v. 46, no. 8 p.2941-2950dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma400254d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245013700167300001800304520138500322592002801707650001501735650000801750650001101758650001401769650001601783650001201799650001501811650001701826650001301843650001301856650001801869650001401887650002001901650001901921650001101940650001401951650001101965650001801976650002901994653001302023653002102036653002602057653002502083653001002108700001602118700001902134700001802153773009902171856008502270852000902355655001202364IND60573477220221117160955.0200210e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057347722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.1022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Lishuai13aDe/hydrogenation kinetics against air exposure and microstructure evolution during hydrogen absorption/desorption of Mg-Ni-Ce alloys  ap. 1399-1407.  aAiming at elucidating the positive effects of Ce element on the oxidation resistance of Mg-based hydrogen storage alloys, Mg-Ni-Ce alloys with different Ce contents have been prepared in a resistance furnace with furnace cooling. The mass fraction of Mg in each sample is 80% to maintain high and consistent hydrogen storage capacity. An 18R-type long-period stacking ordered phase (LPSO) is observed within the Mg₁₂Ce matrix in Mg-Ni-Ce alloys. A two-step activation process is observed in Ce containing alloys. Detailed microstructural characterization of activated samples during air exposure and in-depth analysis of absorption/desorption kinetics on air-exposed samples based on Johnson-Mehl-Avrami (JMA) model are performed to discuss the mechanism underlying improved anti-oxidation properties. CeH₂.₇₃ forms after activation and transforms to CeO₂ during air exposure, which is earlier and faster than the MgO formation during initial air contact preventing forming a compact and uniform MgO layer on the surface. The formed CeH₂.₇₃/CeO₂ particles with average particle size less than 60 nm act as catalysts accelerating the hydrogen dissociation and nucleation sites for the MgH₂ formation during hydrogenation. After de-/hydrogenation cycles, CeO₂ turns back to CeH₂.₇₃, which can react with oxygen again when the sample is exposed to air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3aceric oxide 3acooling 3adesorption 3adissociation 3afurnaces 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3amagnesium 3amagnesium oxide 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3arenewable energy sources 0aMg alloy 0aHydrogen storage 0aNucleation and growth 0aOxidation resistance 0aCeria1 aLi, Jinshan1 aZhang, Tiebang1 aKou, Hongchao0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Dec., v. 113 p.1399-1407dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.1023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04309naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245012800172300001600300520260100316592002802917650001502945650002502960650001702985650002403002650001703026650001403043650002103057650002103078650001003099650002303109650001003132650001203142650001103154650002003165650001003185650002303195650002003218650000903238650002203247650001303269650001703282650001603299651001103315651001103326700002303337700002703360700001903387700001803406700002603424700003203450700002203482773012503504856008103629852000903710655001203719IND60439318520221119043638.0151024e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043931852DNAL7 a10.1007/s10493-015-9913-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastilho, Raphael C.10aTwo-spotted spider mite and its natural enemies on strawberry grown as protected and unprotected crops in Norway and Brazil  ap. 509-528.  aCultivation of strawberry in plastic tunnels has increased considerably in Norway and in southeastern Brazil, mainly in an attempt to protect the crop from unsuitable climatic factors and some diseases as well as to allow growers to expand the traditional production season. It has been hypothesized that cultivation under tunnels could increase the incidence of one of its major pests in many countries where strawberry is cultivated, including Norway and Brazil, the two spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the use of tunnels on the incidence of T. urticae and on its natural enemies on strawberry in two ecologically contrasting regions, Norway (temperate) and southeastern Brazil (subtropical). In both countries, peak densities of T. urticae in tunnels and in the open fields were lower than economic thresholds reported in the literature. Factors determining that systematically seem to be the prevailing relatively low temperature in Norway and high relative humidity in both countries. The levels of occurrence in Norway and Brazil in 2010 were so low that regardless of any potential effect of the use of tunnel, no major differences were observed between the two cropping systems in relation to T. urticae densities. In 2009 in Norway and in 2011 in Brazil, increase in T. urticae population seemed to have been restrained mainly by rainfall in the open field and by predatory mites in the tunnels. Phytoseiids were the most numerous predatory mite group of natural occurrence on strawberry, and the prevalence was higher in Brazil, where the most abundant species on strawberry leaves were Neoseiulus anonymus and Phytoseiulus macropilis. In Norway, the most abundant naturally occurring phytoseiids on strawberry leaves were Typhlodromus (Anthoseius) rhenanus and Typhlodromus (Typhlodromus) pyri. Predatory mites were very rare in the litter samples collected in Norway. Infection rate of the pest by the fungus Neozygites floridana (Neozygitaceae) was low. The results of this work suggest that in Norway the use of tunnels might not affect the population densities of T. urticae on strawberry in years of lower temperatures. When temperature is not a limiting factor for the development of T. urticae in that country (apparently always the case in southern Brazil), strawberry cultivation in the tunnels may allow T. urticae to reach higher population levels than in open fields (because of the provided protection from the direct impact of rainfall), but natural enemies may prevent higher levels from being reached.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNeoseiulus 3aNeozygites floridana 3aPhytoseiulus 3aTetranychus urticae 3aTyphlodromus 3aacarology 3aclimatic factors 3acropping systems 3acrops 3aeconomic threshold 3afungi 3agrowers 3aleaves 3anatural enemies 3apests 3apopulation density 3apredatory mites 3arain 3arelative humidity 3asampling 3astrawberries 3atemperature 3aBrazil 3aNorway1 aDuarte, Vanessa S.1 ade Moraes, Gilberto J.1 aWestrum, Karin1 aTrandem, Nina1 aRocha, Luiz Carlos D.1 aDelalibera, Italo, Jr.cJr.1 aKlingen, Ingeborg0 tExperimental & applied acarology.g2015 Aug., v. 66, no. 4 p.509-528dSpringer International Publishingx0168-81627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10493-015-9913-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02777naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245011900208300001800327500001900345520159200364592002801956650002501984650002502009650002102034650000902055650001702064650001502081650001802096650001402114700002002128700005802148773012802206856008402334852000902418655001202427IND60728670720210421000000.0210223e20210209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072867072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c053962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTiwari, Prince1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5870-281210aFluorescence-Based Detection of the Desolvation Process of Protein Ions Generated in an Aqueous Electrospray Plume  ap. 3635-3642.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA new experimental setup to study laser-induced fluorescence from analytes at different locations in an electrospray plume has been developed. The high fluorescence collection efficiency (∼2%) of the setup, along with a sensitive charge coupled device (CCD) detector, enabled the study of low ion concentrations (down to ∼fM) in the plume. The use of small electrospray tip inner diameters (<1 μm) facilitated the fast desolvation of gaseous protein ions in an aqueous electrospray plume. Fluorescence spectra were acquired from specific locations along the plume axis in different aqueous electrospray plumes with three different analytes: a rhodamine dye and two proteins (ubiquitin and apomyoglobin) labeled with rhodamine dyes. To confirm the presence of gaseous ions, pure gas-phase fluorescence spectra were acquired in the vacuum of a modified ion trap mass spectrometer. These spectra were used to fit to confirm the presence of gaseous species in the corresponding spectra obtained from the electrospray plume. This study shows that with small inner diameter spray capillaries, gaseous protein ions generated at atmospheric pressure in an electrospray plume can be detected with fluorescence-based techniques. Fluorescence measurements can be used to study their structure in the electrospray plume, and the dynamics as they transition from solution to the gas phase and in the early stages after desolvation from charged droplets. Other techniques can also be applied to further study gaseous biomolecular structures under ambient conditions immediately after desolvation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aatmospheric pressure 3achemical species 3adyes 3afluorescence 3arhodamines 3aspectrometers 3aubiquitin1 aCzar, Martin F.1 aZenobi, Renato1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5211-43580 tAnalytical chemistry.g2021 Feb. 09, v. 93, no. 7 p.3635-3642dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c053963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003000150245019600180300001800376520151700394592002801911650001301939650001201952650001401964650001201978650001801990650002002008650002902028650002102057650002402078650000902102650001702111650001102128650001102139650002102150650002102171650001602192653002202208653001602230653001802246653003002264653002902294653002402323700002002347700002002367773009902387856008502486852000902571655001202580IND60573477420221117160957.0200210e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057347742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.1042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTzanetis, Konstantinos F.10aAnalysis of biomass hydrothermal liquefaction and biocrude-oil upgrading for renewable jet fuel production: The impact of reaction conditions on production costs and GHG emissions performance  ap. 1388-1398.  aThis paper shows a detailed analysis of a biomass HTL process by considering changes in three main reaction variables (i.e. catalysts (water, Na₂CO₃(aq.), and Fe(aq.)), temperature (280–340 °C), and catalysts/biomass mass ratio (0–0.33 kg catalysts/kg biomass)), and by assessing their influence on the techno-economic and GHG emissions performance. This analysis is based on Aspen Plus® simulations, process economics and life-cycle GHG assessment on SimaPro (using Ecoinvent 2.2). Results showed that the lowest production cost for biocrude oil is achieved when HTL is performed at 340 °C with Fe as catalyst (450 €/tbᵢₒcᵣᵤdₑ₋ₒᵢₗ or 13.6 €/GJbᵢₒcᵣᵤdₑ₋ₒᵢₗ). At these conditions, the biocrude oil produced has an oxygen content of 16.6 wt% and a LHV of 33.1 MJ/kgbᵢₒcᵣᵤdₑ₋ₒᵢₗ. When the hydrotreatment and hydrogen generation units are included, the total production costs was 1040 €/tᵤₚgᵣₐdₑd₋ₒᵢₗ or 0.8 €/Lᵤₚgᵣₐdₑd₋ₒᵢₗ. After fractionation, the estimated production cost was 1086 €/tbᵢₒⱼₑₜ₋fᵤₑₗ or 25.1 €/GJbᵢₒⱼₑₜ₋fᵤₑₗ. This value is twice the commercial price of fossil jet fuel. However, the allocated life cycle GHG emissions for renewable jet fuel were estimated at 13.1 kgCO₂₋ₑq./GJbᵢₒⱼₑₜ₋fᵤₑₗ, representing only 15% the GHG emission of fossil jet fuel and therefore, indicating a significant potential on GHG emission reduction.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acatalysts 3afossils 3afractionation 3afuel production 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3ahydrogen production 3airon 3aliquefaction 3aoxygen 3aprices 3aproduction costs 3asodium carbonate 3atemperature 0aBio-oil upgrading 0aJet biofuel 0aGHG emissions 0aHydrothermal liquefaction 0aLignocellulosic biofuels 0aEconomic evaluation1 aPosada, John A.1 aRamirez, Andrea0 tRenewable energy.g2017 Dec., v. 113 p.1388-1398dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2017.06.1043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02169naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245014000208300001800348520106100366592002801427650001701455650001801472650002201490650001601512650002301528650001901551650002301570650001301593650001201606773013601618856008001754852000901834655001201843IND60605151820221122113106.0180720e20180320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060515182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b010722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParson, William W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1805-800010aElectron-Transfer Dynamics in a Zn-Porphyrin-Quinone Cyclophane: Effects of Solvent, Vibrational Relaxations, and Conical Intersections  ap. 3854-3863.  aRate constants for photochemical charge separation and recombination in a zinc-porphyrin-benzoquinone cyclophane are calculated by an approach that was developed recently to include effects of vibrational dephasing and relaxation and to reduce the dependence on freely adjustable parameters. The theory is extended to treat the rate of vibrational relaxation individually for each vibrational sublevel of the initial charge-transfer product. Quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical simulations of the reactions in iso-octane, toluene, dichloromethane, and acetonitrile suggest that charge separation occurs at conical intersections in the two more polar solvents, but at avoided crossings in the nonpolar solvents. In agreement with experimental measurements, however, the calculated rate constants for charge separation are similar in polar and nonpolar solvents. Charge recombination to the ground state is found to have electronic coupling factors smaller than that of charge separation and to be affected more strongly by interactions with the solvent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetonitrile 3abenzoquinones 3aelectron transfer 3aiso-octanes 3amethylene chloride 3aphotochemistry 3aphysical chemistry 3asolvents 3atoluene0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Mar. 20, v. 122, no. 14 p.3854-3863dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19284x1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.8b010723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01533naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245010500153300002000258520037300278592002800651650002300679650001100702650001500713650001000728650001900738650001900757650001700776650001600793700001200809700001700821700001200838700001600850700001700866700001900883700001400902773013600916856007401052852000901126655001201135IND60661172520221119113610.0190828e20151029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066117252DNAL7 a10.1039/c5cc07094e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Xin10aElectricity-induced switchable wettability and controllable water permeation based on 3D copper foam  ap. 16237-16240.  aA novel and simple method to realize the switch between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity on a (N-dodecyltrimethoxysilane)-modified 3D copper foam by electrode processes is reported.

A total of 216 weaned pigs (initial BW:6.69 ± 0.99 kg) were blocked by BW and sex, and randomly assigned to 6 dietary treatments. Each treatment had 6 replicate pens with 6 pigs (3 barrows and 3 gilts) per pen. The experimental period was divided into 2 stages: phase 1 (d 0 to 14) and phase 2 (d 14 to 28). During d 0 to 14, pigs in ESBM-1 or ESBM-2 had greater (P < 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) than those in CON, SPC or FSBM. On d 14, the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP) and gross energy (GE) in pigs fed FM, ESBM-1 and ESBM-2 were greater (P < 0.05) than pigs fed the CON. Pigs fed FM, ESBM-1 and ESBM-2 had higher (P < 0.05) concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and had lower (P < 0.05) concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) compared with CON. The concentrations of immunoglobulins G (IgG) and immunoglobulins M (IgM) were higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed the ESBM-1 and ESBM-2 than pigs fed the CON, SPC and FSBM. On d 28, pigs in ESBM-2 had greater (P < 0.05) ATTD of CP and GE than those in CON, SPC and FSBM. Compared with the CON, SPC and FSBM, pigs in ESBM-2 had higher (P < 0.05) activity of SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and T-AOC. But the MDA concentration was lower (P < 0.05) in FM, ESBM-1 and ESBM-2 than in CON. The villus height of duodenum was greater (P < 0.05) in ESBM-2 than in other treatments, and the villus height to crypt depth ratio of duodenum was greater (P < 0.05) in ESBM-2 than in CON, SPC and FSBM. In conclusion, enzyme-treated soybean meal can replace soybean meal, soy protein concentrate soy protein concentrate, fermented soybean meal or fish meal in weaned pig diets by improving the growth performance, nutrient digestibility, antioxidant capacity, immunity and intestinal morphology of weaned pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aaverage daily gain 3abarrows 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3aduodenum 3aenergy 3afish meal 3agilts 3aglutathione peroxidase 3agrowth performance 3aimmunity 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3amalondialdehyde 3aorganic matter 3asoy protein concentrate 3asoybean meal 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aswine feeding 3avilli 0aEnzyme-treated soybean meal 0aNutrient digestibility 0aPerformance 0aAntioxidant capacity 0aIntestinal morphology 0aWeaned pigs1 aShang, Qinghui1 aHu, Jiangxu1 aLiu, Hansuo1 aBrøkner, C.1 aPiao, Xiangshu0 tLivestock science.g2019 July, v. 225 p.39-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2019.04.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245006300203506007600266520073300342592002801075506003701103650001401140650001101154650001101165650004101176650002301217650001201240650001101252650000901263650003201272650001501304650002301319700002201342700002301364700003201387700004101419773011801460856007601578852000901654655001201663IND60647953120221207093828.0190624e20161130xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064795312DNAL7 a10.3390/foods50400812doi7 aPMC53024232pmcid7 a282311762pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipan, Leontina10aVolatile Composition of Smoked and Non-Smoked Iranian Rice  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn this work, the volatile profiles of smoked and non-smoked Iranian rice were identified, and their relative abundance was calculated and compared.

In this article, the development of a ReaxFF force field (CHON-2017_weak) on the basis of protein-2013 is presented that improves the weak interaction description for atom pairs of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. To examine the quality of the force field, we performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations with model systems. These simulations, describing density trends for pure and mixture compound systems, demonstrate that CHON-2017_weak force field predictions are in good agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, ReaxFF can also describe the phase separation in hexane–water mixture and dissolution of ethanol or tetramethylammonium (TMA) in liquid water. To validate it in the application of membrane fuel cells, we studied structural property and degradation mechanism of TMA in alkaline aqueous solution, as well as some typical chemical reactions for small compounds. On the basis of our results, an additional reaction pathway is proposed for the degradation of TMA, which seems to be more energetically favorable compared to the main mechanism predicted from quantum mechanics calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochemical compounds 3acarbon 3achemical reactions 3aethanol 3afuel cells 3ahydrogen 3aliquids 3amolecular dynamics 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3aseparation 3asimulation models 3atetramethylammonium compounds1 avan Duin, Adri C.

Vegetative propagules (including stems, rhizomes, tubers, bulbs, stolons, creeping roots, etc.) contain axillary and adventitious buds capable of producing new stems/branches under permissive environments. Axillary and adventitious buds are distinct in that axillary buds are formed in the axil of leaves and are responsible for production of lateral shoots (branches). Adventitious buds refer to buds that arise on the plant at places (stems, roots, or leaves) other than leaf axils. Both axillary and adventitious buds generally undergo periods of dormancy. Dormancy has been described as a temporary suspension of visible growth of any plant structure containing a meristem (Lang et al. 1987). Dormancy can be subdivided into three categories: (1) ecodormancy-arrest is under the control of external environmental factors; (2) paradormancy-arrest is under the control of external physiological factors within the plant; and (3) endodormancy-arrest is under the control of internal physiological factors. One common feature in all of these processes is prevention of growth under conditions where growth should otherwise continue. There is growing evidence that lack of growth is due to blockage of cell division resulting from interactions between the signaling pathways controlling dormancy and those controlling the cell cycle.Nomenclature: Abscisic acid, ABA; CDK-activating kinase, CAK; cyclin-dependent protein kinase, CDK; extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, ERK; gibberellic acid, GA; growth factor receptor, GFR; mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAPK; underground adventitious buds, UABs; nuclear export signal, NES; nuclear localization signal, NLS; retinoblastoma, RB; virus-induced gene silencing, VIGS.  aPublisher supplied data 3alaws and regulations 3abuds 3astolons 3ameristems 3acell division 3atubers 3abulbs 3adormancy breaking 3adormancy 3abranches 3arhizomes 3aroots 3aleaves 3ashoots 0asignal transduction 0aperennial weeds 0astems 0aEuphorbia esula L. 0aEPHES; cell cycle 0aplants 0aLeafy spurge1 aChao, Wun S.1 aHorvath, David P.0 tWeed science.g2001 Sept., v. 49, no. 5 p.581-589dWeed Science Society of America]x0043-17457nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/266203Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1614%2F0043-1745%282001%29049%5B0581%3ARCROTR%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03563naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245003400165300001300199520232500212592002802537650001802565650001502583650002502598650001702623650001502640650001602655650001502671650002502686650001802711650001302729650001102742650001202753650002302765650001902788700002202807700002002829700002002849700002202869700002002891773011602911856008103027852000903108655001203117IND60575873320221122025027.0170728e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057587332DNAL7 a10.1134/S10623604170101062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafei, R.

The release of the embryo from the zona pellucida is carried out at the stage of the blastocyst and called zona hatching. During zona hatching the blastocyst breaks the zona pellucida and performs active movements to escape through a gap formed in the zona. While microscopic description of zone hatching is well known, biochemical and cytological basis of zone hatching remains poorly understood. The break of the zona pellucida occurs under the influence of two forces: mechanical pressure of the growing blastocyst on the zone and chemical dissolution of the zone material with secreted lytic enzymes. There is only one paper (Sathananthan et al., 2003), which describes the specialized cells in the trophectoderm that locally dissolve the zona pellucida, promoting the emergence of the hole for blastocyst release. Taking into account the singleness of the paper and the absence of further development of this subject by the authors in the following decade, the existence of specialized cells for zone hatching should be assumed with great care. Lytic enzymes, secreted by cells of the trophectoderm for dissolving the zona pellucida, are different. Depending on the species of the mammal, different classes of proteases participate in the zone hatching process: serine proteases, cysteine proteases, metal-loproteinases. Proteases, secreted by human trophectoderm, are not described. The mechanisms of the active movement during blastocyst hatching are investigated to a lesser degree. Only the involvement of the cytoskeleton of trophectoderm cells in the mechanism of blastocyst compression was shown, and the participation of desmosomes in the coordinated change in the form of trophectoderm cells during compression is suggested. This review summarizes literature data on the possible mechanisms of zone hatching in the development of human embryos, obtained in experiments in vitro, as well as in animal models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal models 3ablastocyst 3acysteine proteinases 3acytoskeleton 3adesmosomes 3aendometrium 3aepithelium 3aextracellular matrix 3aglycoproteins 3ahatching 3ahumans 3aoocytes 3aserine proteinases 3azona pellucida1 aSyrkasheva, A.

Rheology, small-angle light scattering (SALS), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques enable us to analyze the microstructure at broad length scale from single particle size to the size of a cluster of aggregated particles. As PVA concentration increases, the microstructure evolves from bridging flocculation, steric stabilization, depletion flocculation to depletion stabilization. To our surprise, when depletion stabilization occurs, the suspension shows the stabilization at the cluster length scale, while maintaining fractal aggregates at the particle length scale. This sharply contrasts previously reported studies on the depletion stabilization of microsized particle and polymer suspensions, which exhibits the stabilization at the particle length scale. On the basis of the evaluation of depletion interaction, we propose that the depletion energy barrier exists between clusters rather than particles due to the comparable size of silica particle and the radius gyration of PVA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aalcohols 3aenergy 3aflocculation 3alight scattering 3amicrostructure 3aparticle size 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3arheology 3asilica1 aHyun, Kyu1 aMoon, Joo Yong1 aClasen, Christian1 aAhn, Kyung Hyun0 tLangmuir.g2015 Feb. 17, v. 31, no. 6 p.1892-1900dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla504578x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03665naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001900159245010700178300001600285500000900301520186300310592002802173650002802201650002402229650002102253650001202274650001902286650002002305650001602325650002102341650001802362650001802380650001302398650001902411650001702430650002302447650001602470650002902486650001602515650003302531650002402564650001202588650001702600650002102617650004202638650005202680651001302732651001302745700002602758700002602784773019102810852000903001856007703010655001203087IND4399623120221118011907.0191028e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439962312DNAL7 a174129032pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2006.00842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBohlke, J.

Aquifer characteristics including sediment stratigraphy, geochemistry, and hydraulic properties were examined in combination with chemical and isotopic analyses of ground water, macropore discharge, and stream water. The ground water flow system exhibits vertical stratification of hydraulic properties and redox conditions, with sub-horizontal boundaries that extend beneath the field and adjacent riparian forest. Below the minimum water table position, ground water age gradients indicate low recharge rates (2–5 cm yr⁻¹) and long residence times (years to decades), whereas the transient ground water wedge between the maximum and minimum water table positions has a relatively short residence time (months to years), partly because of an upward increase in hydraulic conductivity. Oxygen reduction and denitrification in recharging ground waters are coupled with pyrite oxidation near the minimum water table elevation in a mottled weathering zone in Tertiary marine glauconitic sediments. The incised stream had high nitrate concentrations during high flow conditions when much of the ground water was transmitted rapidly across the riparian zone in a shallow oxic aquifer wedge with abundant outflow macropores, and low nitrate concentrations during low flow conditions when the oxic wedge was smaller and stream discharge was dominated by upwelling from the deeper denitrified parts of the aquifer. Results from this and similar studies illustrate the importance of near-stream geomorphology and subsurface geology as controls of riparian zone function and delivery of nitrate to streams in agricultural watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aagricultural runoff 3ariparian forests 3astreams 3acoastal plains 3awater pollution 3astream flow 3agroundwater flow 3asurface water 3awater quality 3anitrates 3ahydrochemistry 3ageochemistry 3aseasonal variation 2aAgriculture 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFertilizers 2aGeologic Sedimentsxanalysis 2aNitratesxchemistry 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 2aWaterxchemistry 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistry 2aWater Pollution, Chemicalxprevention & control 3aMaryland 0aMaryland1 aO'Connell, Michael E.1 aPrestegaard, Karen L.0 tJournal of environmental quality.g2007 May, v. 36, no. 3 p.664-680dAmerican Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, Soil Science SocietywJournal:jnl1642x1537-25377nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/jeq2006.00843Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03634naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245010700165520211200272592002802384650001402412650001602426650001602442650001602458650002102474650000902495650001702504650001002521650001402531650001802545650001502563650002302578650001102601650001802612650001502630650001502645651001002660653002402670653004302694653002102737653001802758653002302776653002702799700001702826700001702843700001502860700001802875700001702893773011902910856005403029852000903083655001203092IND60793047520221116183733.0220914e20221220xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079304752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Bo10aUnderstanding groundwater behaviors and exchange dynamics in a linked catchment-floodplain-lake system  aGroundwater and surface water are hydrologically interconnected systems that exhibit dynamic water, heat and mass exchanges. In this study, a conceptual framework was used to investigate groundwater behaviors and associated hydrological exchanges by combining field measurements, digital filtering and analytical approaches, exemplified by a linked catchment-floodplain-lake system (Poyang Lake, China). The results show that the hydrological regime for both groundwater and surface water exhibit a seasonal variability in the lake catchment. Topographically, the lake catchment can be divided into the mountainous baseflow, ungauged lateral groundwater and floodplain groundwater that contribute to the lake storage changes. Although groundwater flow is generally from the mountainous catchment to the lake floodplain areas due to topographic effects, precipitation provides an additional input for the shallow groundwater and is expected to enhance the groundwater dynamics in terms of spatially heterogeneous responses. The estimation indicates that about 40 % of the catchment river discharge may be coming from the mountainous baseflow (~290 × 10⁸ m³/yr) and discharged into the lake through a surface flow pathway. The ungauged groundwater-lake interaction shows the annual discharge volume is up to 10 × 10⁸ m³/yr and associated exchange fluxes tend to be stronger during spring-summer months (23–45 m³/s) than those of autumn-winter months (9–22 m³/s). Additionally, the floodplain groundwater-lake exchange (~9.5 × 10⁸ m³/yr) indicates that groundwater generally receives the lake water during summer months (mean flux = 110 m³/s) and discharges into the lake during other months (90 m³/s) through a subsurface pathway. This study highlights the importance of groundwater's contributions to the surface river-lake system in terms of the flux variability and different transport pathways. The outcomes of this work will benefit future water resources management and applications by providing a methodology for predicting the groundwater hydrology of large lake-catchment systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abase flow 3aenvironment 3afloodplains 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aheat 3ahydrogeology 3alakes 3amountains 3aoverland flow 3ariver flow 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3asurface water 3atopography 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aBaseflow estimation 0aGroundwater-surface water interactions 0aAnalytical model 0aExchange flux 0aUngauged catchment 0aPoyang Lake floodplain1 aLi, Yunliang1 aJiang, Wenyu1 aChen, Jing1 aShu, Longcang1 aLiu, Jianxin0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 20, v. 853 p.158558-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158558  aDNAL 7aarticle04241naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024003800129040001800167100001900185245010700204300001600311520220500327592002802532650001402560650002202574650002102596650001202617650001502629650001502644650001202659650002302671650001502694650001702709650002302726650001102749650002502760650003802785650001502823650003502838650002602873650002702899650004302926650001202969650001502981650001502996650002103011650001103032650001903043650001703062650005203079650001703131650001203148650001403160650001603174650001203190650001503202650001003217650001403227700001603241700001803257700001903275700002203294700002003316773010503336856008103441852000903522655001203531IND60575873420221122003205.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057587342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-016-0573-52doi7 a10.1007/s11103-016-0573-52chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Chae-yun,10aIn planta production and characterization of a hyperthermostable GH10 xylanase in transgenic sugarcane  ap. 465-478.  aSugarcane (Saccharum sp. hybrids) is one of the most efficient and sustainable feedstocks for commercial production of fuel ethanol. Recent efforts focus on the integration of first and second generation bioethanol conversion technologies for sugarcane to increase biofuel yields. This integrated process will utilize both the cell wall bound sugars of the abundant lignocellulosic sugarcane residues in addition to the sucrose from stem internodes. Enzymatic hydrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass into its component sugars requires significant amounts of cell wall degrading enzymes. In planta production of xylanases has the potential to reduce costs associated with enzymatic hydrolysis but has been reported to compromise plant growth and development. To address this problem, we expressed a hyperthermostable GH10 xylanase, xyl10B in transgenic sugarcane which displays optimal catalytic activity at 105 °C and only residual catalytic activity at temperatures below 70 °C. Transgene integration and expression in sugarcane were confirmed by Southern blot, RT-PCR, ELISA and western blot following biolistic co-transfer of minimal expression cassettes of xyl10B and the selectable neomycin phosphotransferase II. Xylanase activity was detected in 17 transgenic lines with a fluorogenic xylanase activity assay. Up to 1.2% of the total soluble protein fraction of vegetative progenies with integration of chloroplast targeted expression represented the recombinant Xyl10B protein. Xyl10B activity was stable in vegetative progenies. Tissues retained 75% of the xylanase activity after drying of leaves at 35 °C and a 2 month storage period. Transgenic sugarcane plants producing Xyl10B did not differ from non-transgenic sugarcane in growth and development under greenhouse conditions. Sugarcane xylan and bagasse were used as substrate for enzymatic hydrolysis with the in planta produced Xyl10B. TLC and HPLC analysis of hydrolysis products confirmed the superior catalytic activity and stability of the in planta produced Xyl10B with xylobiose as a prominent degradation product. These findings will contribute to advancing consolidated processing of lignocellulosic sugarcane biomass.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharum 3aSouthern blotting 3aWestern blotting 3abagasse 3abioethanol 3abiolistics 3abiomass 3acatalytic activity 3acell walls 3achloroplasts 3acost effectiveness 3adrying 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afeedstocks 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreenhouse production 3agrowth and development 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahybrids 3ahydrolysis 3ainternodes 3akanamycin kinase 3aleaves 3alignocellulose 3aplant growth 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astorage time 3asucrose 3asugarcane 3atemperature 3atissues 3atransgenes 3axylan 3axylanases1 aNong, Guang1 aRice, John D.1 aGallo, María,1 aPreston, James F.1 aAltpeter, Fredy0 tPlant molecular biology.g2017 Mar., v. 93, no. 4-5 p.465-478dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-016-0573-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02566naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245013400212300001400346520124300360592002801603650001301631650001501644650001501659650001301674650002701687650001601714650002001730650001301750653002001763653001901783653001601802653001701818653001801835653002201853700002801875700002401903773013701927856008302064852000902147655001202156IND60783669220221122041050.0220824e20221008xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078366922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.07.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurakova, Ludmila P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2548-983710aRecombinant light-sensitive photoprotein berovin from ctenophore Beroe abyssicola: Bioluminescence and absorbance characteristics  ap. 23-27.  aThe bright bioluminescence of ctenophores inhabiting the oceans worldwide is caused by light-sensitive Ca²⁺-regulated photoproteins. By now, the cDNAs encoding photoproteins from the four different ctenophore species have been cloned and the recombinant proteins have been characterized to some extent. In this work, we report on the specific activity and the quantum yield of bioluminescence reaction as well as the absorbance characteristics of high-purity recombinant berovin. To determine those, we applied the amino acid composition analysis to accurately measure berovin concentration and the recombinant aequorin as a light standard to convert relative light units to quanta. The extinction coefficient of 1% berovin solution at 435 nm was found to be 1.82. The one can be employed to precisely determine the protein concentration of active photoproteins from other ctenophore species. The specific activity and the bioluminescence quantum yield were respectively found to be 1.98 × 10¹⁵ quanta/mg and 0.083. These values appeared to be several times lower than those of the cnidarian photoproteins, which is obviously due to differences in amino acid environments of the substrate in active sites of these photoproteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCnidaria 3aCtenophora 3aabsorbance 3aaequorin 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3abioluminescence 3aresearch 0aBioluminescence 0aCoelenterazine 0aCtenophores 0aPhotoprotein 0aQuantum yield 0aSpecific activity1 aKolmakova, Anzhelika A.1 aVysotski, Eugene S.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2022 Oct. 08, v. 624 p.23-27dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2022.07.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02396naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245002800157300001800185520131800203592002801521650001201549650001301561650001101574650004401585650001401629650003301643650003401676650002101710700002401731700002501755700002001780700001901800773013101819856007501950852000902025655001202034IND60538743520221123033747.0160815e20120208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053874352DNAL7 a10.1021/ja211531y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimiev, Ayrat10aPristine Graphite Oxide  ap. 2815-2822.  aGraphite oxide (GO) is a lamellar substance with an ambiguous structure due to material complexity. Recently published GO-related studies employ only one out of several existing models to interpret the experimental data. Because the models are different, this leads to confusion in understanding the nature of the observed phenomena. Lessening the structural ambiguity would lead to further developments in functionalization and use of GO. Here, we show that the structure and properties of GO depend significantly on the quenching and purification procedures, rather than, as is commonly thought, on the type of graphite used or oxidation protocol. We introduce a new purification protocol that produces a product that we refer to as pristine GO (pGO) in contrast to the commonly known material that we will refer to as conventional GO (cGO). We explain the differences between pGO and cGO by transformations caused by reaction with water. We produce ultraviolet–visible spectroscopic, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic, thermogravimetric, and scanning electron microscopic analytical evidence for the structure of pGO. This work provides a new explanation for the acidity of GO solutions and allows us to add critical details to existing GO models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3agraphene 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxidation 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astandard operating procedures 3athermogravimetry1 aKosynkin, Dmitry

UV spectral analysis showed peak at 430nm with special reference to the excitation of surfaces plasmon vibration by silver nanoparticles. FT-IR studies reveal the presence of bioactive functional groups such as phenolic compounds, amines and aromatic ring are found to be the capping and stabilizing agents of nanoparticles. The morphology of silver nanoparticles was found to be spherical and ranges about 48.59nm as confirmed by HR-SEM. Negative zeta potential value of −34mV suggests that the nanoparticles are highly stable in colloidal solution. XRD patterns also suggest the occurrence of spherical shaped particles due to the presence of silver ions. Further, photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange was measured spectrophotometrically by using silver as nanocatalyst under visible light illumination. The results revealed that biosynthesized silver nanoparticles using U. lactuca was found to be impressive in degrading methyl orange.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aUlva lactuca 3aX-ray diffraction 3aambient temperature 3aaromatic amines 3abioactive properties 3abiosynthesis 3acolloids 3aions 3alighting 3amacroalgae 3amethyl orange 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3aphenolic compounds 3aphotocatalysis 3asilver 3aspectral analysis 3avibration 3azeta potential 0aUlva lactuca 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aHR-SEM 0aMethyl orange 0aPhotocatalytic degradation1 aGovindaraju, M.1 aSenthamilselvi, S.1 aPremkumar, K.0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2013 Mar. 01, v. 103 p.658-661dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03195naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245013200165300001600297520145700313592002801770650001601798650002001814650002301834650001501857650002301872650001301895650001901908650002301927650001601950650002801966650001101994650002102005650002802026650002102054650001402075650001402089650001102103650002602114650001902140650001902159650002202178650001402200700001702214700001602231700001802247700001802265700001802283700002002301700002102321700001902342700001702361700002002378773010502398856008102503852000902584655001202593IND60575873520221122003125.0170728e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057587352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-016-0575-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHong, Chi Eun10aSilencing of an α-dioxygenase gene, Ca-DOX, retards growth and suppresses basal disease resistance responses in Capsicum annum  ap. 497-509.  aAlpha-dioxygenases (α-DOX) catalyzing the primary oxygenation of fatty acids to oxylipins were recently found in plants. Here, the biological roles of the pepper α-DOX (Ca-DOX) gene, which is strongly induced during non-host pathogen infection in chili pepper, were examined. Virus-induced gene silencing demonstrated that down-regulation of Ca-DOX enhanced susceptibility to bacterial pathogens and suppressed the hypersensitive response via the suppression of pathogenesis-related genes such as PR4, proteinase inhibitor II and lipid transfer protein (PR14). Ca-DOX-silenced pepper plants also exhibited more retarded growth with lower epidermal cell numbers and reduced cell wall thickness than control plants. To better understand regulation of Ca-DOX, transgenic Arabidopsis plants harboring the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene driven from a putative Ca-DOX promoter were generated. GUS expression was significantly induced upon avirulent pathogen infection in transgenic Arabidopsis leaves, whereas GUS induction was relatively weak upon virulent pathogen treatment. After treatment with plant hormones, early and strong GUS expression was seen after treatment of salicylic acid, whereas ethylene and methyl jasmonate treatments produced relatively weak and late GUS signals. These results will enable us to further understand the role of α-DOX, which is important in lipid metabolism, defense responses, and growth development in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aCapsicum annuum 3abeta-glucuronidase 3acell walls 3adisease resistance 3aethylene 3agene silencing 3agrowth retardation 3ahot peppers 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 3alipid metabolism 3alipid transfer proteins 3amethyl jasmonate 3aoxylipins 3apathogens 3apepper 3aproteinase inhibitors 3areporter genes 3asalicylic acid 3atransgenic plants 3avirulence1 aHa, Young-Im1 aChoi, Hyoju1 aMoon, Ju Yeon1 aLee, JiYoung,1 aSin, A-yŏng,1 aPark, Chang Jin1 aYoon, Gyeong Mee1 aKwon, Suk-Yoon1 aJo, Ick-Hyun1 aPark, Jeong Mee0 tPlant molecular biology.g2017 Mar., v. 93, no. 4-5 p.497-509dSpringer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-016-0575-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02359naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011400158300001800272520133400290592002801624650002301652650001201675650001701687650001401704650001201718650001701730650001301747650001101760650001301771700002201784773013101806856007501937852000902012655001202021IND60538743620221123033752.0160815e20120208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053874362DNAL7 a10.1021/ja211547s2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hyun Sung10aIncrease of Third-Order Nonlinear Optical Activity of PbS Quantum Dots in Zeolite Y by Increasing Cation Size  ap. 2539-2542.  aThe third-order nonlinear optical (3NLO) activity of PbS quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated in zeolite Y has been expected to depend sensitively on the countercation of the zeolite host. However, ion exchange of the pristine countercation, H⁺, with other cations has not been possible because the framework decomposes and the QDs aggregate immediately when the PbS QD-incorporating zeolite Y with H⁺ as the countercation is exposed to the atmosphere. We now report that when H⁺ is transformed to NH₄⁺, the framework of PbS QD-containing zeolite Y does not undergo decomposition and the PbS QDs do not undergo aggregation to form larger QDs during the aqueous ion exchange of NH₄⁺ with alkali-metal ions (MA⁺ = Li, Na⁺, K⁺, Rb⁺). The 3NLO activity of the MA⁺-exchanged PbS QD-incorporating zeolite Y film increases with increasing size of MA⁺. The stabilization of the surface-bound exciton by the electron-rich framework oxide and electron-poor cation is proposed to be responsible for the increase. This is the first example of a method for systematically increasing the 3NLO activity of QDs dispersed in a dielectric matrix by systematically changing its properties. These results will serve as a guideline for future research and also promote applications of QD-incorporating zeolites in various fields.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium compounds 3acations 3aion exchange 3apotassium 3aprotons 3aquantum dots 3arubidium 3asodium 3azeolites1 aYoon, Kyung Byung0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2012 Feb. 08, v. 134, no. 5 p.2539-2542dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fja211547s3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02856naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010400159500001400263520152000277592002801797650001701825650001401842650001901856650001601875650002001891650002401911650001701935650001701952650002001969650001101989650002102000650001402021650001402035650002802049700001902077700001802096700002102114700001702135700002002152700002002172773012302192856007402315852000902389655001202398IND60721734620221119101126.0201224e20201217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072173462DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121238672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yun-Chin 10aBaicalein, 7,8-Dihydroxyflavone and Myricetin as Potent Inhibitors of Human Ornithine Decarboxylase  aNAL-light  aBackground: Human ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) is a well-known oncogene, and the discovery of ODC enzyme inhibitors is a beneficial strategy for cancer therapy and prevention. Methods: We examined the inhibitory effects of a variety of flavone and flavonol derivatives on ODC enzymatic activity, and performed in silico molecular docking of baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and myricetin to the whole dimer of human ODC to investigate the possible binding site of these compounds on ODC. We also examined the cytotoxic effects of these compounds with cell-based studies. Results: Baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone and myricetin exhibited significant ODC suppression activity with IC₅₀ values of 0.88 µM, 2.54 µM, and 7.3 µM, respectively, which were much lower than that of the active-site irreversible inhibitor α-DL-difluoromethylornithine (IC₅₀, the half maximal inhibitory concentration, of approximately 100 µM). Kinetic studies and molecular docking simulations suggested that baicalein, and 7,8-dihydroxyflavone act as noncompetitive inhibitors that are hydrogen-bonded to the region near the active site pocket in the dimer interface of the enzyme. Baicalein and myricetin suppress cell growth and induce cellular apoptosis, and both of these compounds suppress the ODC-evoked anti-apoptosis of cells. Conclusions: Therefore, we suggest that the flavone or flavonol derivatives baicalein, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone, and myricetin are potent chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents that target ODC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive sites 3aapoptosis 3acancer therapy 3acell growth 3achemoprevention 3acomputer simulation 3acytotoxicity 3adrug therapy 3aenzyme activity 3ahumans 3ahydrogen bonding 3amyricetin 3aoncogenes 3aornithine decarboxylase1 aLiu, Yi-Liang 1 aHsieh, Ju-Yi 1 aWang, Chang-Hsu 1 aLin, Chi-Li 1 aLiu, Guang-Yaw 1 aHung, Hui-Chih 0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 17, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121238673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01261naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245008600130300001400216500001500230520049000245592002800735650002200763650002400785653002400809773010700833852000900940939003300949946001300982655001200995IND9102599720221120144301.0181002e197907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910259972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBUSSCHER, W.

This study aimed to estimate impacts of FAW on yield and farmers' livelihoods in Botswana, and to obtain data that could be extrapolated to national level. Further, farmer knowledge of the pest, management practices and pesticide use for FAW management were assessed. RESULTS: In fact, 76% of the 220 respondents had seen FAW in their farms in the 2018/2019 cropping season, affecting almost the entire and about half of cultivated area for maize and sorghum, respectively. Thus, 51% of the respondents implemented FAW control measures, with chemical pesticides (27%) being the most common management against FAW. Only 33% of respondents in 2018/2019 were food self‐sufficient, as opposed to 80% in an ordinary year, with farmers who reported not to have been affected by FAW more likely to be insufficient with food (88%) compared to 60% of the farmers who reported FAW attack. Drought was ranked the major stress experienced by the famers (35%), and also showed significant yield reducing effects on maize yield with pest and diseases reported second most important. Pesticides (20%) and training on pest management (18%) were the top ranked needs by farmers interviewed. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the impact and threat of FAW to crop production in Botswana. Chemicals remain the go‐to control option by a majority of the farmers. Other low‐risk technologies exist and are proposed for adoption in the management of FAW. Of note is the acknowledgement that a single control strategy will not be effective against FAW and as such integrated pest management (IPM) on an area‐wide scale is needed to achieve best results. Mass awareness, training and demonstration will be required to achieve this.  aPublisher supplied data  cthe Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC)  cthe UK Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO)  cthe European Commission Directorate General for International Partnerships (INTPA, EU)  cDirectorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS, The Netherlands)  cCABIs PlantwisePlus programme  cFood and Agriculture Organization 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3acorn 3acultivation area 3adrought 3afarmers 3apesticides 3apests 3aBotswana1 aMugambi, Idah1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9895-06181 aKansiime, Monica K1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1036-84691 aYuka, Irie1 aAbang, Mathew1 aLechina, Bonolo S1 aRampeba, Mosimanegape1 aRwomushana, Ivan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5840-80580 tPest management science.g2022 Mar., v. 78, no. 3 p.1060-1070dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.67173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03577naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245010700180300001800287520187400305592002802179596007502207596007502282650002402357650001302381650001502394650001202409650001102421650001902432650001402451650001302465650001702478650002702495650001602522650001102538650001402549650002102563650002502584650002102609650001202630650001802642650002002660650001502680651001102695700003002706700002902736700002502765773016602790856008202956852000903038655001203047IND60590308220221122035335.0190522e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059030822DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-0767-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Sousa, Diana Nara Ribeiro10aSpatio-temporal evaluation of emerging contaminants and their partitioning along a Brazilian watershed  ap. 4607-4620.  aThe occurrence, partitioning, and spatio-temporal distribution of seven pharmaceuticals for human use, three steroid hormones and one personal care product were determined in surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment of Piraí Creek and Jundiaí River (Jundiaí River Basin, São Paulo, Brazil). The maximum average detected concentrations of the compounds in the Piraí River samples were < 30 ng L⁻¹, except for caffeine (222 ng L⁻¹). In Jundiaí River samples, most of the compounds were frequently detected, wherein caffeine had the highest concentration, with maximum average concentrations of 14,050 ng L⁻¹, followed by atenolol (431 ng L⁻¹), ibuprofen (268 ng L⁻¹) and diclofenac (214 ng L⁻¹). Atenolol, propranolol, estrone, and triclosan were the contaminants most frequently detected in sediment and SPM samples. Triclosan had the highest average proportion of SPM as opposed to in the aqueous phase (> 75%). Contaminants with acid functional groups showed, in general, a lower tendency to bind to particulate matter and sediments. In addition, hydrophobicity had an important effect on their environmental partitioning. The spatial distribution of contaminants along the Jundiaí River was mainly affected by the higher concentration of contaminants in water samples collected downstream from a sewage treatment plant (STP). The results obtained here clearly showed the importance of the analysis of some contaminants in the whole water, meaning both dissolved and particulate compartments in the water, and that the partitioning is ruled by a set of parameters associated to the physicochemical characteristics of contaminants and the matrix properties of the studied, which need be considered in an integrated approach to understand the fate of emerging chemical contaminants in aquatic environments.  aPublisher supplied data  a2014/21871-2cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo  a2010/01731-0cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aaquatic environment 3acaffeine 3adiclofenac 3aestrone 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3aibuprofen 3amoieties 3aparticulates 3apersonal care products 3apropranolol 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage treatment 3aspatial distribution 3asteroid hormones 3astreams 3asurface water 3awater pollution 3awatersheds 3aBrazil1 aMozeto, Antonio Aparecido1 aCarneiro, Renato Lajarim1 aFadini, Pedro Sergio0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2018 Feb., v. 25, no. 5 p.4607-4620dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4122550x0944-13447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-0767-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245015400159300002000313520034900333592002800682650001400710650001100724650002600735650001200761650002200773650001400795700002000809700001500829700001700844700001800861700001900879700002000898773013600918856007401054852000901128655001201137IND60638956720221122045042.0190501e20160816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063895672DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc05745d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHua, Hui-Liang10aCopper-catalyzed difluoromethylation of propargylamide-substituted indoles: synthesis of mono- and bis-difluoromethylated indoloazepinone derivatives  ap. 10396-10399.  aA novel copper-catalyzed difluoromethylation of 2- or 3-propargylamide-substituted indoles with ICF₂CO₂Et via a radical cascade cyclization process is described.

Inorganic sulfur constituted 14 to 30% of the total sulfur pool, with HCl-soluble sulfur present as the largest portion (77–94%). AVS sulfur accounted for <1% of total soil sulfur. No clear pattern of pyrite sulfur formation was observed in the upper 20 cm of the soil profile; however, concentration tended to increase with depth below this zone. Pyrite sulfur represented <3% of total sulfur and together with elemental sulfur accounted for 6 to 21% of the inorganic sulfur fraction. Elemental sulfur concentration was highest in the plant root zone (<20-cm). Organic sulfur in the forms of ester-sulfate sulfur and carbon-bonded sulfur was a major constituent (70–86%) of total sulfur. Ester sulfate represented between 15 and 34% of the organic sulfur fraction.  aPublisher supplied data 3awetland soils 3asoil profiles 3asulfur 3asampling 3asoil analysis 3acoasts 3aLouisiana1 aDeLaune, R.

Viruses are of great significance in ecological interactions such as MSW decomposition and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) transmission. In this study, the viral community structure and the associated driver, the linkage of viruses and their bacterial hosts, the virus-associated ARG dissemination and virtual community function on MSW decomposition were investigated in landfill leachate from seven cities, China. The seven cities include four megacities, two large-scale cities and one small-scale city, representing the leachate characters of China. The results showed that the leachates were dominated by the phage families Siphoviridae, Myoviridae and Podoviridae (91.7 ± 3.6) %. Their putative hosts were the important MSW decomposers Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Proteiniphilum, and Bacteroides. The structure of the viral community was significantly affected by pH (P = 0.007, analyzed by RDA) and the bacterial community (R = 0.83, P < 0.001, analyzed by Mantel test). The relative abundance of ARGs showed a strong correlation (R > 0.8, P < 0.01) with viral family, suggesting that viruses play an important role in ARGs dissemination. Phage regulate bacterial population abundance through top-down effects, thus participating in MSW decomposition. These results demonstrate that viral community are involve in ARGs transmission and dissemination and mediate MSW decomposition in landfill.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroides 3aClostridium 3aLactobacillus 3aMyoviridae 3aPodoviridae 3aPseudomonas 3aSiphoviridae 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3abacterial communities 3abacteriophages 3acommunity structure 3aenvironment 3ahabitats 3alandfill leachates 3alandfills 3amunicipal solid waste 3apH 3aspecies abundance 3aChina 0aLandfill leachate 0aViral community 0aHost 0aAntibiotic resistance gene 0aEcological interaction1 aYang, Shu1 aGong, Zhourui1 aNi, Renjie1 aShi, Xianyang1 aSong, Liyan0 tScience of the total environment.g2022 Dec. 20, v. 853 p.158561-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158561  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245006800163500001400231520134700245592002801592650002201620650002101642650001801663650001901681650001901700650003101719650001201750650001301762650001601775650001201791650002501803650001501828650000901843650001101852700002201863700002301885773012301908856007402031852000902105655001202114IND60721734820221119101141.0201224e20201218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072173482DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121238692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinowiecka, Kinga 10aVitamin C Transporters and Their Implications in Carcinogenesis  aNAL-light  aVitamin C is implicated in various bodily functions due to its unique properties in redox homeostasis. Moreover, vitamin C also plays a great role in restoring the activity of 2-oxoglutarate and Fe²⁺ dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDD), which are involved in active DNA demethylation (TET proteins), the demethylation of histones, and hypoxia processes. Therefore, vitamin C may be engaged in the regulation of gene expression or in a hypoxic state. Hence, vitamin C has acquired great interest for its plausible effects on cancer treatment. Since its conceptualization, the role of vitamin C in cancer therapy has been a controversial and disputed issue. Vitamin C is transferred to the cells with sodium dependent transporters (SVCTs) and glucose transporters (GLUT). However, it is unknown whether the impaired function of these transporters may lead to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Notably, previous studies have identified SVCTs’ polymorphisms or their altered expression in some types of cancer. This review discusses the potential effects of vitamin C and the impaired SVCT function in cancers. The variations in vitamin C transporter genes may regulate the active transport of vitamin C, and therefore have an impact on cancer risk, but further studies are needed to thoroughly elucidate their involvement in cancer biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA demethylation 3aactive transport 3aascorbic acid 3acancer therapy 3acarcinogenesis 3agene expression regulation 3aglucose 3ahistones 3ahomeostasis 3ahypoxia 3aneoplasm progression 3aoxygenases 3arisk 3asodium1 aFoksinski, Marek 1 aBrożyna, Anna  A.0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121238693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02820naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002300188245012400211300001200335506007600347520121000423592002801633506003701661650002801698650002801726650001501754650001001769650001001779650001701789650001601806650001901822650001001841650002101851650001101872650001801883650002101901650001101922650001801933650001801951700002601969700002601995700002002021700002002041700002002061700002502081773009402106856008102200852000902281655001202290IND60518379520221207080403.0160623e201606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051837952DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-016-0414-x2doi7 aPMC48308032pmcid7 a283301722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemédios, Marlene10aEffects of Penicillium chrysogenum var. halophenolicum on kraft lignin: color stabilization and cytotoxicity evaluation  ap. 102.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWood industries and agricultural crops generate an inexhaustible supply of by-products like lignin, which constitutes an environmental problem. Increasing efforts have been done to find new applications for lignin. One of them is as a food additive, but its chemical nature makes it sensitive to browning which constitutes a major drawback for this type of lignin application. In the present study we are documenting how color stabilization of a commercial kraft lignin was achieved after the treatment with Penicillium chrysogenum var. halophenolicum. In addition the fungal capacity to remove lignin is studied together with the effect of its treatment on cytotoxicity of lignin. P. chrysogenum var. halophenolicum was able to transform lignin, ensuring its color stability for more than 24 months. Dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy showed that the fungus contributed to homogenize particle size and hydrodynamic properties in lignin suspensions without increase the toxicity over HeLa cells and human primary fibroblasts.

Each wear trial involves a two-day wear test, of which one day workers wore the HCV (denoted as VEST) during resting, and another day they wore traditional workwear (denoted as CON). Subjects were asked to rate their perceived exertion (RPE), thermal sensations (TS) and 7 other subjective attributes. There were significant differences in the effectiveness on reducing workers’ heat strain between VEST and CON in terms of alleviations of heart rate (ΔHR), ΔTS, ΔRPE as well as ΔPeSI (p < 0.001). The practicality of HCV is evidenced by a significant improvement by 0.93–1.34 on the rating scores of perceived cooling effect, sensations of comfort and skin dryness during rest and fatigue recovery in VEST at the level of 0.05, and high ratings of 4.85–5 (rating scale from 1 to 7, and the higher the better) by subjects on the preference, fitness as well as effectiveness to combat heat stress. In addition, a remarkable proportion of 91 per cent of subjects prefer to use this newly designed HCV as a cooling measure during rest. The power to alleviate perceptual heat stain (PeSA) in VEST is about twice of that by rest, which means HCV can notably improve the workers’ perceptual heat strain in a limited resting duration. However, the strain alleviation power of HCV nearly remains unchanged with the prolonged rest duration. Thus, the optimal work-rest schedule needs to be investigated in a further study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconstruction industry 3afans (equipment) 3aheart rate 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aphase transition 3asummer 3aChina 0aHybrid cooling vest 0aField study 0aPerceptual heat stress 0aConstruction industry 0aEffectiveness and practicality1 aZhang, Ying1 aWang, Faming1 aWong, Francis F.K.1 aChan, Daniel W.M.0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2017 Dec., v. 70 p.21-27dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03595naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001400144245012500158300001100283520222300294592002802517650002902545650001702574650001802591650001402609650001202623650002102635650001302656650001102669650002002680650001002700650000902710650001902719650001602738650002102754650001302775650001902788700002202807700002002829700001502849700001602864700001602880700002702896773010202923856007903025852000903104655001203113IND60766756320221120110311.0220211e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076675632DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-9-492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiao, Han10aIntegration of tomato reproductive developmental landmarks and expression profiles, and the effect of SUN on fruit shape  ap. 49.  aBACKGROUND: Universally accepted landmark stages are necessary to highlight key events in plant reproductive development and to facilitate comparisons among species. Domestication and selection of tomato resulted in many varieties that differ in fruit shape and size. This diversity is useful to unravel underlying molecular and developmental mechanisms that control organ morphology and patterning. The tomato fruit shape gene SUN controls fruit elongation. The most dramatic effect of SUN on fruit shape occurs after pollination and fertilization although a detailed investigation into the timing of the fruit shape change as well as gene expression profiles during critical developmental stages has not been conducted. RESULTS: We provide a description of floral and fruit development in a red-fruited closely related wild relative of tomato, Solanum pimpinellifolium accession LA1589. We use established and propose new floral and fruit landmarks to present a framework for tomato developmental studies. In addition, gene expression profiles of three key stages in floral and fruit development are presented, namely floral buds 10 days before anthesis (floral landmark 7), anthesis-stage flowers (floral landmark 10 and fruit landmark 1), and 5 days post anthesis fruit (fruit landmark 3). To demonstrate the utility of the landmarks, we characterize the tomato shape gene SUN in fruit development. SUN controls fruit shape predominantly after fertilization and its effect reaches a maximum at 8 days post-anthesis coinciding with fruit landmark 4 representing the globular embryo stage of seed development. The expression profiles of the NILs that differ at sun show that only 34 genes were differentially expressed and most of them at a less than 2-fold difference. CONCLUSION: The landmarks for flower and fruit development in tomato were outlined and integrated with the effect of SUN on fruit shape. Although we did not identify many genes differentially expressed in the NILs that differ at the sun locus, higher or lower transcript levels for many genes involved in phytohormone biosynthesis or signaling as well as organ identity and patterning of tomato fruit were found between developmental time points.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolanum pimpinellifolium 3abiosynthesis 3adomestication 3aflowering 3aflowers 3afruit morphology 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression 3agenes 3aloci 3aplant hormones 3apollination 3aseed development 3atomatoes 3awild relatives1 aRadovich, Cheryll1 aWelty, Nicholas1 aHsu, Jason1 aLi, Dongmei1 aMeulia, Tea1 aVan der Knaap, Esther,0 tBMC plant biology.g2009 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.49-49dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-9-493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01441naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245013200128300001600260520054700276592002800823650001900851650001200870650002400882650003200906650001700938700003200955773010900987852000901096939003301105946001301138655001201151IND9102651320221120144253.0181002e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910265132DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKATASE, TAKAO10aTransformation of trans-4-hydroxycinnamic acid by a laccase of the fungus trametes versicolor: its significance in humification  ap. 291-296.  aA lignin precursor, trans-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, was incubated with an extracellular laccase from the fungus Trametes versicolor.

CMC induced the production of endoglucanase (EG) and filter-paperase while the levels of β-glucosidase (BGL) were increased when salicin was present in the medium. Nature of production medium influenced the duration of lag- and log-phase of the growth, rate of fungal dry-mass and enzyme production. The volumetric and specific productivity of cellulase under submerged fermentation of grass were 1.7–20-folds higher than sugarcane-bagasse, corncob and commercially available purified substrates. Nonetheless, solid state fermentation (SSF) of crude substrates also yielded high volumetric productivity of EG and BGL. The studies on characterization of enzymes showed that EG was more thermostable than BGL with an optimum activity at 70 °C and a melting temperature of 76 °C. A 1.2–1.5-folds increase in EG activity was observed in the presence of K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, whereas, the EG and BGL activities remained unaffected in the presence of EDTA. Both the enzyme activities performed optimally under acidic range of pH.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAspergillus terreus 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3abeta-glucosidase 3acalcium 3acarbon 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acorn cobs 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3aenzyme activity 3afungi 3agrasses 3amagnesium 3amelting point 3apH 3apotassium 3asoil 3asolid state fermentation 3asubmerged fermentation 3asugarcane bagasse 3athermal stability1 aAhmad, Aqeel1 aKhan, Shakeel Ahmed0 t3 Biotech.g2016 June, v. 6, no. 1 p.103-103dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-016-0420-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02817naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245012800132300001600260500013600276520162700412592002802039650001702067650001802084650001402102650001302116650002202129650001102151650001902162650001202181650001802193650001302211650001402224651001002238700001902248773010902267852000902376939003302385946001302418655001202431IND9102651420221120144355.0181002e199104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND910265142DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVance, George F.,10aForest soil response to acid and salt additions-of sulfate: iii. solubilization and composition of dissolved organic carbon  ap. 297-305.  aAffiliations: 1Dept. of Plant, Soil, and Insect Sciences, Univ. of Wyoming, Laramie. 2Dept. of Forestry, Univ. of Illinois, Urbana.  aA year-long experiment, using reconstructed Spodosol and intact Alfisol soil columns, was conducted to examine the effects of various simulated throughfall solutions on soil C dynamics. Soil organic C solubilization, dissolved organic C fractions, and decomposition rates were studied using simulated acidic and salt throughfall solutions. Few effects were found on organic C solubility and movement, or on dissolved organic C fractions until after week 40. No effects were observed with acid inputs as low as pH 3.7 during weeks 21–40. When input solution pH was decreased to 3.0, organic C solubilization from the forest floor of the Spodosol columns was reduced as was adsorption in forest floor plus mineral soil columns; retention of dissolved organic C was 90 and 83% in control and acid-treated columns, respectively. Addition of sulfate salt resulted in a slight increase in dissolved organic C movement through the mineral horizons, which was due to higher solution pH and possibly competition with SO4. No treatment effects were observed with the Alfisol column leachates which had lower concentrations of dissolved organic C compared to Spodosol leachates. Soil respiration appeared to be unaffected by simulated throughfall solutions containing either acid or salt. Based on the results of this study we propose that throughfall solutions of pH above 3.7 will have little or no influences on dissolved organic C cycling in the types of Spodosol and Alfisol forest soils used here. However, at pH 3.0 some alterations in organic C solubilization, dissolved organic C fractions, and mobility could be expected.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforest soils 3aforest litter 3aSpodosols 3aAlfisols 3aorganic compounds 3acarbon 3asolubilization 3asoil pH 3amineral soils 3asulfates 3aleachates 3aMaine1 aDAVID, MARK B.0 tSoil science.g1991 Apr., v. 151, no. 4 p.297-305dWilliams & WilkinswJournal:jnl44572x0038-075X7nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02307naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245012900174300001500303520081400318592002801132650002201160650001801182650001301200650003801213650001801251650000901269650001401278650002201292650001101314650000701325650002401332650001201356650002101368650001801389653001401407653003201421653001601453653003201469653002201501653002001523700002501543700002001568700002301588773010701611856008601718852000901804655001201813IND60095713620221122053148.0161021e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009571362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.10.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKianfar, Farnoosh10aLyophilized wafers comprising carrageenan and pluronic acid for buccal drug delivery using model soluble and insoluble drugs  ap. 99-106.  aLyophilized muco-adhesive wafers with optimum drug loading for potential buccal delivery have been developed.

H.10aDeveloping a General Interaction Potential for Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions  ap. 2051-2064.  aWe review direct force measurements on a broad class of hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. These measurements have enabled the development of a general interaction potential per unit area, W(D) = −2γᵢHy exp(−D/DH) in terms of a nondimensional Hydra parameter, Hy, that applies to both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between extended surfaces. This potential allows one to quantitatively account for additional attractions and repulsions not included in the well-known combination of electrostatic double layer and van der Waals theories, the so-called Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. The interaction energy is exponentially decaying with decay length DH ≈ 0.3–2 nm for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions, with the exact value of DH depending on the precise system and conditions. The pre-exponential factor depends on the interfacial tension, γᵢ, of the interacting surfaces and Hy. For Hy > 0, the interaction potential describes interactions between partially hydrophobic surfaces, with the maximum hydrophobic interaction (i.e., two fully hydrophobic surfaces) corresponding to Hy = 1. Hydrophobic interactions between hydrophobic monolayer surfaces measured with the surface forces apparatus (SFA) are shown to be well described by the proposed interaction potential. The potential becomes repulsive for Hy < 0, corresponding to partially hydrophilic (hydrated) interfaces. Hydrated surfaces such as mica, silica, and lipid bilayers are discussed and reviewed in the context of the values of Hy appropriate for each system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHydra 3aenergy 3ahydrophilic interactions 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid bilayers 3amica 3asilica 3asurface tension 3avan der Waals forces1 aRøyne, Anja1 aKristiansen, Kai1 aRapp, Michael V.1 aDas, Saurabh1 aGebbie, Matthew A.1 aLee, Dong Woog1 aStock, Philipp1 aValtiner, Markus1 aIsraelachvili, Jacob0 tLangmuir.g2015 Feb. 24, v. 31, no. 7 p.2051-2064dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla502115g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02403naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002700153245005800180520118000238592002801418650002301446650001201469650001101481650002101492650001301513650001801526650001101544650001301555650002501568653000801593653001201601653001201613653001401625653001601639653002301655700002601678700002001704700002201724700001901746773010701765856008801872852000901960655001201969IND60713485320221121174142.0220314e20201115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071348532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2020.1092612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfab, F.q(Ferdinand),10aEnergy budgets for tadpoles approaching metamorphosis  aWe describe a dynamic energy budget (DEB) model for tadpoles over the course of metamorphosis. The model accounts for details in the tadpoles feeding behavior, as feeding and indirectly respiration are reduced in the late developmental stages preceding metamorphosis to an immature froglet. We propose two versions of our DEB model, one where the energy reserves of the organism are accounted for explicitly (a variant on Kooijman’s ”standard” DEB model), and one where reserves and structural biomass are lumped together so that only the size of the organism is tracked (a variant on DEBkiss). Both models are parameterized using a time series of measurements on a cohort of tadpoles of the Pacific tree frog, Pseudacris regilla. The models describe tadpoles from the middle of their development as tadpoles until they emerge as froglets. Visually, both models fit the growth and respiration empirical data reasonably well; statistically the fit to the full DEB model is slightly better. The models highlight the metabolic changes during the life of a tadpole and demonstrate how morphological changes in developing organisms can be accomodated in the DEB framework.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudacris regilla 3abiomass 3aenergy 3afeeding behavior 3afroglets 3ametamorphosis 3amodels 3atadpoles 3atime series analysis 0aDEB 0aDEBkiss 0aTadpole 0aAmphibian 0aDevelopment 0aPseudacris regilla1 aDiRenzo, Graziella V.1 aGershman, Ariel1 aBriggs, Cheryl J.1 aNisbet, R.

The microstructure of these systems was revealed by confocal and cryo-scanning electron microscopy, and the effect of biopolymer concentrations on the consistency of emulsions as well as the dried product was evaluated using a combination of small-amplitude oscillatory shear rheometry and large deformation fracture studies. The oleogel prepared by shearing the dried product showed a high gel strength as well as a certain degree of thixotropic recovery even at high temperatures. Moreover, the reversibility of the process was demonstrated by shearing the dried product in the presence of water to obtain reconstituted emulsions with rheological properties comparable to those of the fresh emulsion.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3adeformation 3aelectron microscopy 3aemulsions 3agel strength 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3alow temperature drying 3amicrostructure 3aoils 3apolysaccharides 3arheological properties 3arheometry 3atemperature1 aRajarethinem, Pravin

We aimed to assess the agreement of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration, and its three analytes (25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (25(OH)D₃), 25-hydroxyvitamin D₂ (25(OH)D₂) and Epi-25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ (Epi-25(OH)D₃)), in plasma and serum samples collected during pregnancy, and to examine the proportion of women who change vitamin D status category based on sample type. Matching samples were collected from n = 114 non-fasting women between 12–25 weeks gestation in a clinical trial in Newcastle, Australia. Samples were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass-spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to quantify total 25(OH)D and its analytes and examined using Bland-Altman plots, Pearson correlation (r), intraclass correlation coefficient and Cohen’s Kappa test. Serum total 25(OH)D ranged from 33.8–169.8 nmol/L and plasma ranged from 28.6–211.2 nmol/L. There was a significant difference for total 25(OH)D based on sample type (measurement bias 7.63 nmol/L for serum vs plasma (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 5.36, 9.90, p ≤ 0.001). The mean difference between serum and plasma concentrations was statistically significant for 25(OH)D₃ (7.38 nmol/L; 95% CI 5.28, 9.48, p ≤ 0.001) and Epi-25(OH)D₃ (0.39 nmol/L; 95% CI 0.14, 0.64, p = 0.014). Of 114 participants, 28% were classified as vitamin D deficient (<50 nmol/L) or insufficient (<75 nmol/L) based on plasma sample and 36% based on serum sample. Nineteen (16.7%) participants changed vitamin D status category based on sample type. 25-hydroxyvitamin D quantification using LC-MS/MS methodology differed significantly between serum and plasma, yielding a higher value in plasma; this influenced vitamin D status based on accepted cut-points, which may have implications in clinical and research settings.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood serum 3achemical species 3aclassification 3aclinical trials 3aconfidence interval 3acorrelation 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ameasurement 3apregnancy 3aresearch 3aAustralia1 aMurphy, Vanessa  E.1 aGibson, Peter G.,1 aClarke, Michael 1 aJensen, Megan  E.0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121238723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03741naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014600163500002200309506011700331506007600448520174300524592002802267506003702295650002602332650001002358650002502368650001302393650001802406650001002424650002502434650001002459650002002469650001602489650001302505650001702518653002602535653001902561653002602580653002702606653001302633653000802646653000902654653000902663653000902672653000902681653001002690653000802700653000802708653000902716653000802725653001202733653001002745653001102755653000902766700001702775700002002792700001402812700001802826700005902844773009502903856004802998852000903046655001203055IND60778203620221207115930.0220523e20220512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077820362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2022.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chunxue10a20(S)- Protopanaxadiol suppresses hepatic stellate cell activation via WIF1 demethylation-mediated inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  a20(S)-protopanaxadiol (PPD), one of the main components of ginseng, has anti-inflammatory, anti-estrogenic, and anti-tumor activities. It is known that activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are the primary producers of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the liver, and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway participates in the activation of HSCs. We aimed to explore whether PPD inhibits liver fibrosis is associated with the Wnt/β-catenin pathway inactivation. The anti-fibrotic roles of PPD were examined both in vitro and in vivo. We also examined the levels of Wnt inhibitory factor 1 (WIF1), DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and WIF1 methylation. PPD obviously ameliorated liver fibrosis in carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-treated mice and reduced collagen deposition. PPD also suppressed the activation and proliferation of primary HSCs. Notably, PPD inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, reduced TCF activity, and increased P-β-catenin and GSK-3β levels. Interestingly, WIF1 was found to mediate the inactivation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in PPD-treated HSCs. WIF1 silencing suppressed the inhibitory effects of PPD on HSC activation and also restored α-SMA and type I collagen levels. The downregulation of WIF1 expression was associated with the methylation of its promoter. PPD induced WIF1 demethylation and restored WIF1 expression. Further experiments confirmed that DNMT1 overexpression blocked the effects of PPD on WIF1 expression and demethylation and enhanced HSC activation. PPD up-regulates WIF1 levels and impairs Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation via the down-regulation of DNMT1-mediated WIF1 methylation, leading to HSC inactivation. Therefore, PPD may be a promising therapeutic drug for patients with liver fibrosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methyltransferase 3aPanax 3acarbon tetrachloride 3acollagen 3ademethylation 3adrugs 3aextracellular matrix 3aliver 3aliver cirrhosis 3amethylation 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 0a20(S)-Protopanaxadiol 0aLiver fibrosis 0aHepatic stellate cell 0aWnt/β-catenin pathway 0aAd-DNMT1 0aBSP 0aCCK8 0aCCl4 0aDAPI 0aDKK1 0aDNMTs 0aECM 0aHCC 0aHSCs 0aPPD 0aqRT-PCR 0asFRP1 0asiWIF1 0aWIF11 aZhan, Yating1 aZhang, Rongrong1 aTao, Qiqi1 aLang, Zhichao1 aZheng, Jianjian1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0563-22290 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2022 May 12, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2022.05.005  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245010500168300001600273520121000289592002801499650002801527650003701555650002801592650001301620650001101633650001301644650002001657650000701677650002001684650001501704650001701719653000801736653000801744653000801752653000801760653001001768653000801778653001401786653001701800653001801817653001301835700001501848700001701863700002501880700002401905700001501929700001901944700002101963700002601984773010802010856008602118852000902204655001202213IND60095713820221122053151.0161021e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009571382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.11.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurgain, J.10aIn vitro interactions between probiotic bacteria and milk proteins probed by atomic force microscopy  ap. 153-162.  aInteractions between microbial cells and milk proteins are important for cell location into dairy matrices. In this study, interactions between two probiotic strains, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, and milk proteins (micellar casein, native and denatured whey proteins) were studied. The bacterial surface characterization was realized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to evaluate surface composition (in terms of proteins, polysaccharides and lipid-like compounds) and electrophoretic mobility that provide information on surface charge of both bacteria and proteins along the 3–7 pH range. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) enabled the identification of specific interactions between bacteria and whey proteins, in contrast to the observed nonspecific interactions with micellar casein. These specific events appeared to be more important for the GG strain than for the GR-1 strain, showing that matrix interaction is strain-specific. Furthermore, our study highlighted that in addition to the nature of the strains, many other factors influence the bacterial interaction with dairy matrix including the nature of the proteins and the pH of the media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aatomic force microscopy 3abacteria 3acasein 3acolloids 3aelectrophoresis 3apH 3apolysaccharides 3aprobiotics 3awhey protein 0aAFM 0aEPS 0aIEP 0aLGG 0aLGR-1 0aXPS 0aProbiotic 0aInteractions 0aMilk proteins 0aAdhesion1 aGaiani, C.1 aFrancius, G.1 aRevol-Junelles, A.M.1 aCailliez-Grimal, C.1 aLebeer, S.1 aTytgat, H.L.P.1 aVanderleyden, J.1 aScher, Jeffrey Noyes,0 tColloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 104 p.153-162dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.11.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03596naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014200163500002200305506011700327506007600444520172600520592002802246506003702274650001002311650001502321650001602336650001602352650001402368650001202382650001002394650001902404650001802423650001602441650001402457650001602471650001702487650003302504650001602537650001802553650002002571650001202591650002402603650002102627650001302648650001302661650001502674653001502689653002502704653002302729653002302752700001502775700001802790773009502808856008202903852000902985655001202994IND60778203820221207115929.0220720e20220517xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077820382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jgr.2022.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOh, Hyun-Ji14aThe non-saponin fraction of Korean Red Ginseng ameliorates sarcopenia by regulating immune homeostasis in 22–26-month-old C57BL/6J mice  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe non-saponin fraction (NSF) of Korean red ginseng is a powder in which saponin is eliminated from red ginseng concentrate by fractionation. In this study, we examined the effect of NSF on age-associated sarcopenia in old mice. NSF (50 or 200 mg/kg/day) was administered orally daily to young (3–6-month-old) and old (20–24-month-old) C57BL/6 J mice for 6 weeks. Body weight and grip strength were assessed once a week during the oral administration period. The gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscle were excised, and the muscle fiber size was compared through hematoxylin and eosin staining. In addition, the effect of NSF on sarcopenia and inflammation/oxidative stress-related factors in hindlimb muscles was investigated by western blotting. Flow cytometry analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of NSF on immune homeostasis. Blood samples were collected by cardiac puncture, and the serum levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and glutathione were evaluated. NSF significantly alleviated muscle strength, mass, and also fiber size in old mice. Age-associated impairment of immune homeostasis was recovered by NSF through retaining CD11b⁺F4/80⁺ macrophages and regulating inflammatory biomarkers. NSF also decreased the age-induced expression of oxidative stress factors. Taken together, NSF showed the effect of improving sarcopenia by inhibiting low-grade chronic inflammatory/oxidative stress factors. NSF exhibited anti-sarcopenia effects by regulating chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in old mice. Thus, we suggest that NSF is a promising restorative agent that can be used to improve sarcopenia in the elderly as well as maintain immune homeostasis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPanax 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acytokines 3aelderly 3aeosin 3aflow cytometry 3afractionation 3aglutathione 3ahindlimbs 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amacrophages 3amuscle fibers 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3aoral administration 3aoxidative stress 3aresearch 3asaponins 3asarcopenia 0aSarcopenia 0aNon-saponin fraction 0aKorean red ginseng 0aImmune homeostasis1 aJin, Heegu1 aLee, Boo-Yong0 tJournal of Ginseng Research.g2022 May 17, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27195x1226-84537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgr.2022.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100007200147245005800219500002200277520139500299592002801694650002101722650002501743650001701768650001801785650001401803650001401817650001101831650001501842650002001857651001101877653001701888653002601905653002701931653003801958653002701996653004002023653001002063653001702073653001902090653001702109653001502126653001102141653001402152653001502166653001702181653003102198653000902229653001002238653002702248653001102275653001802286653003202304653001102336653001702347653001702364653001702381653001502398653001002413653001402423653001402437653001702451653003202468773015202500856008202652852000902734655001202743IND60783670020220830000000.0220830e20220717xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078367002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cnd.2022.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmiot-Carlin, Marie Josèphe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4563-458710aProfils alimentaires et pathologies cardiovasculaires  aPre-press version  aCardiovascular diseases (CVD) are among the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and in France. Diet is one of the factors in maintaining vascular health. Different profiles associated with CVD have been identified from the PubMed and WOS databases. Randomized and controlled trials and prospective studies aggregated in meta-analyses allow linking different profiles with the incidence of CVD (coronary heart disease, stroke) as well as risk factors associated with nutritional targets, such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. The studies summarize the effects in primary prevention. Thus, three categories of profiles were reported and based on: 1) food groups (Prudent, Vegetarian, Mediterranean or Nordic profiles) 2) food groups with specific recommendations on nutritional targets (DASH and Portfolio) and 3) on macronutrients (low in lipids or carbohydrates, etc.). All of the beneficial profiles on CVD have common components: more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes and nuts. The DASH profile targeted at reducing hypertension through lower salt intake is convincingly protective against CVD, while Prudent and Mediterranean profiles are beneficial but with lower quality. In conclusion, eating more vegetable products as less refined, less salt and more polyunsaturated fatty acids than saturated ones is recommended for a decrease in CVD incidence.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoronary disease 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ahypertension 3ameta-analysis 3amorbidity 3amortality 3astroke 3avegetables 3avegetarian diet 3aFrance 0aAlimentation 0aRégimes alimentaires 0aMaladies coronariennes 0aAccidents vasculaires cérébraux 0aInsuffisance cardiaque 0aFacteurs de risque cardiovasculaire 0aPoids 0aHypertension 0aDyslipidémies 0aInflammation 0aMicrobiote 0aFibres 0aPotassium 0aMagnésium 0aAntioxydants 0aAcides gras polyinsaturés 0aFood 0aDiets 0aCoronary heart disease 0aStroke 0aHeart failure 0aCardiovascular risk factors 0aWeight 0aHypertension 0aDyslipidemia 0aInflammation 0aMicrobiota 0aFiber 0aPotassium 0aMagnesium 0aAntioxidants 0aPolyunsaturated fatty acids0 tCahiers de nutrition et de diététique.g2022 July 17, dElsevier Masson SASaSociété française de nutritionwJournal:jnl17549x0007-99607nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cnd.2022.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03193naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245013200169520155900301592002801860650001801888650001501906650003201921650001601953650001401969650001601983650001601999650001602015650001402031650001802045650000902063650002402072650002202096650001502118651001002133653001602143653001602159653003202175653002902207653002002236700001502256700001502271700001402286700001702300700001702317700001402334700001602348700001702364700001402381700001602395773011902411856008802530852000902618655001202627IND60793048620221116183624.0220929e20230110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079304862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lixia10aResponses of soil microbial communities to concentration gradients of antibiotic residues in typical greenhouse vegetable soils  aTo explore the responses of soil microbial communities to concentration gradients of antibiotic residues in soil, 32 soil samples were collected from a typical greenhouse vegetable production base in Northern China in 2019. The total concentrations of 26 antibiotic residues in these soil samples was 83.24–4237.93 μg·kg⁻¹, of which metabolites of tetracyclines were 23.34–1798.80 μg·kg⁻¹. The total concentrations in 32 samples were clustered into three levels (L: <100 μg·kg⁻¹, M: 100–300 μg·kg⁻¹, H: >300 μg·kg⁻¹) to elucidate the impacts of antibiotic residues on the diversity, structure, composition, function and antibiotic resistome of soil microbial community. Results showed that higher concentration of antibiotic residues in soil was prone to decrease the diversity and shift the structure and composition of soil microbial community. Antibiotic resistome occurred in soils with antibiotic residues exceeding 300 μg·kg⁻¹. Interactions among soil bacteria followed the order of H > L > M, consistent with the relative abundances of mobile genetic elements. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the top attributors impacting the profile of antibiotics in soil. According to weighted comprehensive pollution index of risk quotient, in 28.1 % of soil samples the residual antibiotics presented high ecological risk, whereas in the rest of soil samples the ecological risk is medium. The results will enrich the database and provide references for antibiotic contamination control in soils of the region and alike.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacteroidetes 3aFirmicutes 3aantibiotic resistance genes 3aantibiotics 3adatabases 3aenvironment 3agreenhouses 3ametabolites 3apollution 3arelative risk 3asoil 3asoil microorganisms 3avegetable growing 3avegetables 3aChina 0aAntibiotics 0aMetabolites 0aAntibiotic resistance genes 0aSoil microbial community 0aEcological risk1 aPan, Zheng1 aSun, Baoli1 aSun, Yang1 aWeng, Liping1 aLi, Xiaojing1 aYe, Huike1 aYe, Jianzhi1 aPan, Xiaowei1 aZhou, Bin1 aLi, Yongtao0 tScience of the total environment.g2023 Jan. 10, v. 855 p.158587-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.1585873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245011500164300001800279520132100297592002801618650001501646650001401661650002301675650001601698650002001714650001201734650001801746650000701764650001801771650002401789650003401813650002101847650002101868650001901889700001901908700002201927773009801949856007502047852000902122655001202131IND60577367920180109000000.0170808e20150224xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057736792DNAL7 a10.1021/la504213t2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlimkevicius, Vaidas10aEffect of Structure of Cationic Comb Copolymers on Their Adsorption and Stabilization of Titania Nanoparticles  ap. 2074-2083.  aCationic linear polymer poly([2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl] trimethylammonium chloride) p(METAC), neutral brush polymer poly(poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) p(PEO₂₂MEMA), and cationic comb copolymers p(METAC-PEOₓMEMA) were used for the stabilization of titania dispersions under neutral and alkaline conditions. Random comb copolymers p(METAC-PEOₓMEMA) differing in charge density and length of PEO side chains were synthesized by RAFT. The adsorption of cationic polymers on titania nanoparticles was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis; changes in surface potential, by measuring the zeta potential; and the stability of the treated TiO₂ dispersions, by laser diffraction and DLS. Cationic linear and comb copolymers containing relatively short PEO side chains promoted the inversion of nanoparticle surface potential from strongly negative (−60 mV) to moderately positive (10–35 mV). Cationic comb copolymers containing longer PEO side chains increased the zeta potential of the treated nanoparticles but did not invert it to positive. Aqueous dispersions of titania nanoparticles stabilized by cationic comb copolymers under alkaline conditions (pH 10) were dispersed by high-energy planetary ball milling up to a primary particle size of 20 nm and were stable for at least 2 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achlorides 3acomposite polymers 3adispersions 3aethylene glycol 3amilling 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3apolyethylene glycol 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3athermogravimetry 3atitanium dioxide 3azeta potential1 aGraule, Thomas1 aMakuska, Ricardas0 tLangmuir.g2015 Feb. 24, v. 31, no. 7 p.2074-2083dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla504213t3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04188naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002800144245012500172300001100297520283100308592002803139650002503167650002203192650002503214650002303239650001003262650001803272650002103290650002203311650001303333650001903346650003003365650002703395650002203422650000803444650001303452700002103465700001503486700002503501700002603526773010203552856007903654852000903733655001203742IND60766756820221120102138.0220211e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076675682DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-9-532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aŚarmā, Rāma Kumāra,10aIdentification, characterization and utilization of unigene derived microsatellite markers in tea (Camellia sinensis L.)  ap. 53.  aBACKGROUND: Despite great advances in genomic technology observed in several crop species, the availability of molecular tools such as microsatellite markers has been limited in tea (Camellia sinensis L.). The development of microsatellite markers will have a major impact on genetic analysis, gene mapping and marker assisted breeding. Unigene derived microsatellite (UGMS) markers identified from publicly available sequence database have the advantage of assaying variation in the expressed component of the genome with unique identity and position. Therefore, they can serve as efficient and cost effective alternative markers in such species. RESULTS: Considering the multiple advantages of UGMS markers, 1,223 unigenes were predicted from 2,181 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of tea (Camellia sinensis L.). A total of 109 (8.9%) unigenes containing 120 SSRs were identified. SSR abundance was one in every 3.55 kb of EST sequences. The microsatellites mainly comprised of di (50.8%), tri (30.8%), tetra (6.6%), penta (7.5%) and few hexa (4.1%) nucleotide repeats. Among the dinucleotide repeats, (GA)n.(TC)n were most abundant (83.6%). Ninety six primer pairs could be designed form 83.5% of SSR containing unigenes. Of these, 61 (63.5%) primer pairs were experimentally validated and used to investigate the genetic diversity among the 34 accessions of different Camellia spp. Fifty one primer pairs (83.6%) were successfully cross transferred to the related species at various levels. Functional annotation of the unigenes containing SSRs was done through gene ontology (GO) characterization. Thirty six (60%) of them revealed significant sequence similarity with the known/putative proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana. Polymorphism information content (PIC) ranged from 0.018 to 0.972 with a mean value of 0.497. The average heterozygosity expected (H E) and observed (H ₒ) obtained was 0.654 and 0.413 respectively, thereby suggesting highly heterogeneous nature of tea. Further, test for IAM and SMM models for the UGMS loci showed excess heterozygosity and did not show any bottleneck operating in the tea population. CONCLUSION: UGMS markers identified and characterized in this study provided insight about the abundance and distribution of SSR in the expressed genome of C. sinensis. The identification and validation of 61 new UGMS markers will not only help in intra and inter specific genetic diversity assessment but also be enriching limited microsatellite markers resource in tea. Further, the use of these markers would reduce the cost and facilitate the gene mapping and marker-aided selection in tea. Since, 36 of these UGMS markers correspond to the Arabidopsis protein sequence data with known functions will offer the opportunity to investigate the consequences of SSR polymorphism on gene functions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aCamellia sinensis 3aamino acid sequences 3acost effectiveness 3acrops 3agene ontology 3agenetic analysis 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3aheterozygosity 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3asequence homology 3atea 3aunigenes1 aBhardwaj, Pankaj1 aNegi, Rinu1 aMohapatra, Trilochan1 aAhuja, Paramvir Singh0 tBMC plant biology.g2009 Dec., v. 9, no. 1 p.53-53dBioMed CentralwJournal:2167x1471-22297nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-9-533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03550naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245014800169300001600317520188800333592002802221650002002249650002502269650002102294650002002315650002402335650002002359650002002379650001602399650001902415650002602434650001002460650001702470650002102487650001902508650002202527650001802549650001202567650001002579650001802589650002902607653004202636653002602678653001402704653001602718653001302734700001602747700001602763700001502779773010602794856008702900852000902987655001202996IND60583060920221120161127.0190401e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058306092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Zhihua10aDietary supplementation of enzymatically treated Artemisia annua could alleviate the intestinal inflammatory response in heat-stressed broilers  ap. 184-190.  aThe study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of enzymatically treated Artemisia annua (EA) on the intestinal inflammatory response of heat-stressed broilers. A total of 144 male Arbor Acres broilers aged 21 days were randomly divided into 3 groups with 6 replicates per group and 8 broilers in each replicate. The 3 treatment groups were as follows: the control group, in which broiler chickens were raised at 22 ± 1°C and fed basal diets, the heat stress (HS) and HS-EA groups, in which broiler chickens were raised at 34 ± 1°C for 8h (0900–1700h) and 22 ± 1°C for 16h, and fed basal diets supplemented with 0 or 1g/kg EA, respectively. From 22 to 41 days, the heat treatment lasted for 20 consecutive days. Compared with the control group, HS increased the activity of plasma diamine oxidase (P < 0.05) and the concentration of intestinal interleukin-1β, and up-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of intestinal interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, interferon-γ, toll-like receptor 4 and heat shock protein 70, down-regulated (P < 0.05) jejunal zonula occludens-1 and ileal occluding mRNA abundances and intestinal interleukin-10 at both protein and transcriptional levels. However, EA treatment significantly decreased (P < 0.05) plasma diamine oxidase activity, the mRNA expression of heat shock protein 70, toll-like receptor 4, interleukin-6, interleukin-1β and interferon-γ in intestine of heat-stressed broilers, whereas upregulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of ileal occluding, jejunal zonula occludens-1 and occluding. In addition, both protein and transcriptional levels of interleukin-10 in jejunum and ileum were increased (P < 0.05) by EA treatment in the HS group. In conclusion, dietary EA supplementation could alleviate the intestinal inflammatory response, and improve the intestinal barrier function in broilers during the heat stress period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia annua 3aToll-like receptor 4 3abroiler chickens 3adiamine oxidase 3adietary supplements 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3aheat stress 3aheat treatment 3aheat-shock protein 70 3aileum 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3ajejunum 3amales 3amessenger RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 0aEnzymatically treated Artemisia annua 0aInflammatory response 0aIntestine 0aHeat stress 0aBroilers1 aCheng, Kang1 aZhang, Lili1 aWang, Tian0 tJournal of thermal biology.g2017 Oct., v. 69 p.184-190dElsevier LtdwJournal:12493x0306-45657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2017.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245017700167300001400344520093100358592002801289650001301317650002201330650002201352650001601374650003101390650002001421650001101441650001401452650001401466651001301480700001801493700001601511700001901527700001701546773007901563856008101642852000901723655001201732IND60518380120221120113540.0160414e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051838012DNAL7 a10.1007/s13237-015-0154-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatawang, Isara10aNew record on karyological analysis and first study of NOR localization of parthenogenetic brahminy blind snake, Ramphotyphlops braminus (Squamata, Typhlopidae) in Thailand  ap. 61-66.  aThis is chromosomal analysis of the brahminy blind snake, Ramphotyphlops braminus (Daudin, 1803), a newly recorded species in northeastern Thailand. Mitotic chromosomes were prepared directly from intestinal epithelia cells of five brahminy blind snakes. Conventional staining and Ag-NOR banding techniques were applied to stain the chromosomes. The results showed that the triploid chromosome number was 3n = 42, while the fundamental number (NF) was 78. The types of chromosomes were 24 macrochromosomes (19 m + 5sm) and 18 microchromosomes (9 m + 3sm + 6 t). The region adjacent to the short arm near the telomere of one in macrochromosome pair 8 showed a clearly observable nucleolar organizer region/NOR. There were no irregularly sized chromosomes related to sex. The karyotype formula for R. braminus is as follows: 3n (42) = Lᵐ ₁₂ + Sᵐ ₇ + Sˢᵐ ₅ + 18 microchromosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSquamata 3achromosome number 3aintestinal mucosa 3akaryotyping 3anucleolus organizer region 3aparthenogenesis 3asnakes 3atelomeres 3atriploidy 3aThailand1 aTanomtong, A.1 aKaewmad, P.1 aChuaynkern, Y.1 aDuengkae, P.0 tNucleus.g2016 Apr., v. 59, no. 1 p.61-66dSpringer Indiax0029-568X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13237-015-0154-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03414naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245019800170300001600368520166400384592002802048650001602076650003702092650002302129650002702152650001302179650003802192650002102230650001902251650001302270650001102283650002402294650001602318650001402334650001402348653002902362653002302391653002302414653002402437653000802461653000802469653000802477700001902485700002302504700002702527700003102554700002402585700002902609700001902638773010802657856008602765852000902851655001202860IND60095714120221121232954.0161021e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009571412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2012.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPalmer, Dasha10aMechanism of synergistic interactions and its influence on drug release from extended release matrices manufactured using binary mixtures of polyethylene oxide and sodium carboxymethylcellulose  ap. 174-180.  aThe ability of anionic polymer sodium carboxymethylcellulose to influence the release of four model cationic drugs (chlorpheniramine maleate, venlafaxine hydrochloride, propranolol hydrochloride and verapamil hydrochloride) from extended release (ER) hydrophilic matrices based on non-ionic polymer polyethylene oxide was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). For all studied APIs, a combination of polyethylene oxide with sodium carboxymethylcellulose produced slower drug release compared to the matrices of single polymers. This behaviour was mainly attributed to the interaction of ester/carboxylic acid functionalities to yield H-bonding between the anionic polymer groups and the additionally protonated N-atoms of the active substances. X-ray photoelectron and isothermal titration calorimetry studies confirmed drug–polymer interaction and polymer–polymer interaction (i.e. the PEO binding with negatively charged NaCMC), whilst differential scanning calorimetry indicated the existence of both crystalline and molecularly dispersed active forms in the created complexes. The drug release mechanisms were fitted to various models suggesting diffusion control for the majority of the formulations. The Korsmeyer–Peppas model was found to be the most suitable for description of release profiles of all formulations. The present study showed that XPS and ITC in combination with DSC can be valuable tool to investigate the presence and nature (mechanism) of synergistic interactions between polymers and drugs in extended release matrix tablets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aactive ingredients 3acarboxymethylcellulose 3acolloids 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophilicity 3amaleates 3amodels 3apolyethylene glycol 3apropranolol 3atitration 3averapamil 0aExtended release tablets 0aPolyethylene oxide 0aSynergistic effect 0aPolymer combination 0aXPS 0aITC 0aDSC1 aLevina, Marina1 aDouroumis, Dennis,1 aManiruzzaman, Mohammed1 aMorgan, D.

This paper considers the problem of estimating the survival function of time-to-event when it is subject to dependent censoring. When the censorship is due to competing risks, the traditional assumption of independent censorship may not be satisfied, and hence, the usual application of the Kaplan–Meier estimator yields a biased estimation for the survival function of the event time. This paper follows an assumed copula approach (Zheng and Klein in Biometrika 82(1):127–138, 1995) to adjust for dependence between the event time of interest and the competing event time. While the literature on an assumed copula approach has mostly focused on semiparametric settings, we alternatively consider a parametric approach with piecewise exponential models for fitting the survival function. We develop maximum likelihood estimation under the piecewise exponential models with an assumed copula. A goodness-of-fit procedure is also developed, which touches upon the identifiability issue of the copula. We conduct simulations to examine the performance of the proposed method and compare it with an existing semiparametric method. The method is applied to real data analysis on time to metamorphosis for salamander larvae living in Hokkaido, Japan (Michimae et al. in Evol Ecol Res 16:617–629, 2014).  aPublisher supplied data 3adeath 3aecology 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3amodels 3arisk 3asalamanders and newts 3astatistical analysis 3aJapan1 aMichimae, Hirofumi0 tEnvironmental and ecological statistics.g2017 Mar., v. 24, no. 1 p.151-173dSpringer USx1352-85057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10651-017-0364-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03310naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245010900166500001400275520198200289592002802271650000902299650002202308650001302330650002702343650001602370650001702386650002602403650001202429650001402441650001302455650000902468650001502477700002402492700002002516700002002536700001902556700001802575700001902593700002102612773012302633856007402756961001302830852000902843655001202852IND60721735820221119101050.0201224e20201218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072173582DNAL7 a10.3390/nu121238792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCallender, Chishinga 10aHow Minority Parents Could Help Children Develop Healthy Eating Behaviors: Parent and Child Perspectives  aNAL-light  aMinority children and children living in under-resourced households are at the greatest risk for obesity and diet-related disparities. Identifying effective strategies to reduce these risks is an important step in child obesity prevention. Parents influence the home environment and play a critical role in child obesity prevention. Eighteen parent–child dyads living in under-resourced Houston area communities participated in a mixed methods study (online surveys, telephone interviews). The purpose of the research reported here was to conduct a secondary analysis of the qualitative data to explore Black/African American and Hispanic parent and child perspectives of the ways in which parents could help their children make healthy food choices. Descriptive statistics were calculated for parent and child demographic characteristics; hybrid thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the interview transcripts. Frequencies were calculated for children’s interview responses to rating scales and the grade they gave their eating habits. Mothers’ responses were grouped into two broad categories: facilitators (modeling, availability, and teaching) as ways parents could help their child eat healthy, and barriers (lack of time, cost of healthy foods, and lack of knowledge) to helping their child eat healthy. Alternatively, child responses focused on ways in which parents could provide support: environmental support (home availability, home cooking, and introducing new foods) and personal support (providing child choice, teaching, and encouragement). Most children reported that eating healthy was easy, and most rated their personal eating habits as an A or B. These findings suggest that understanding the perspectives of Black/African American and Hispanic parent–child dyads can provide insight into the development of culturally and economically relevant healthy eating strategies and interventions for families living in under-resourced communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarea 3achildhood obesity 3achildren 3adescriptive statistics 3aenvironment 3ahealthy diet 3ahealthy eating habits 3ahybrids 3aknowledge 3aresearch 3arisk 3atelephones1 aVelazquez, Denisse 1 aAdera, Meheret 1 aDave, Jayna  M.1 aOlvera, Norma 1 aChen, Tzu-An 1 aAlford, Shana 1 aThompson, Debbe 0 tNutrients.g2020 Dec. 18, v. 12, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu121238793Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005200151245012300203520148700326592002801813650001101841650001901852650001801871650002001889650002901909650002201938650001401960651001001974653002801984653002802012653002302040653003002063653001002093700005102103773011802154856008602272852000902358655001202367IND60794930220221118001417.0221004e20221215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079493022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1163532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7652-933910aDoes low-carbon pilot city policy induce low-carbon choices in residents' living: Holistic and single dual perspective  aLow-carbon pilot cities can break the lock-in effect of living carbon emissions, which are an important strategic component of China's response to climate change. Current research on low-carbon pilot cities focuses on the production field. Insufficient attention has been paid to whether low-carbon pilot cities can promote the green transformation of residents' lifestyle. Using panel data of 285 cities in China from 2004 to 2016, this study explores the inducing effect of low-carbon pilot cities on residents' low-carbon choices from holistic and single-dual perspectives based on the difference-in-differences method and the synthetic control method. This study finds that low-carbon pilot cities can promote the green transformation of residents' lifestyle, and this policy has reduced living carbon emissions by approximately 15.3%. The transmission mechanisms are mainly green life consciousness and green habits. The conclusion considers the effects of multi-pilot policies and other living differences during the parallel period and is still valid after robustness testing using propensity score matching difference-in-differences. In addition, the policy has a snowball effect, and is stronger in larger cities. Ultimately, this paper provides useful information for the scientific implementation of carbon emission reduction plans in the field of residents' living and the improvement of the long-term mechanism of pilot cities with both quality and quantity guaranteed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate change 3aconsciousness 3acontrol methods 3aenvironmental management 3aissues and policy 3alifestyle 3aChina 0aLow-carbon pilot cities 0aLiving carbon emissions 0aLow-carbon choices 0aDifference-in-differences 0aChina1 aXu, Hui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6970-00350 tJournal of environmental management.g2022 Dec. 15, v. 324 p.116353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2022.1163533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02898naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009600160300001600256520173700272592002802009650001302037650001102050650001102061650001002072650001902082650001702101650002002118650001202138650001602150650001102166650001102177650001902188651001802207651000902225651001802234651001602252700001802268773010802286856007302394852000902467655001202476IND60342623520221117034252.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034262352DNAL7 a10.1111/jav.006532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLislevand, Terje10aSkipping‐type migration in a small Arctic wader, the Temminck's stint Calidris temminckii  ap. 419-424.  aBy using morphometric data and geolocator tracking we investigated fuel loads and spatio‐temporal patterns of migration and non‐breeding in Temminck's stints Calidris temminckii. Body masses in stints captured at autumn stopover sites from Scandinavia to northern Africa were generally not much higher than during breeding and did not vary geographically. Thus, we expected migrating stints to make several stopovers and either circumventing the Sahara desert with low fuel loads or fuelling at north African stopover sites before desert crossing. Geolocation revealed that birds (n = 6) departed their Norwegian breeding site in the last part of July and all but one migrated south‐west over continental western Europe. A single bird headed south‐east to the Balkan Peninsula where the geolocator died. As predicted, southbound migration proceeded in a typical skipping manner with 1–4 relatively short stopovers (median 4 d) during 10–27 d of migration before reaching north‐west Africa. Here birds spent 11–20 d before crossing the Sahara. The non‐breeding sites were located at or near the Niger River in Mali and were occupied continuously for more than 215 d with no indications of itinerancy. Spring migration commenced in late April/early May when birds crossed the desert and used stopover sites in the western Mediterranean basin in a similar manner as during autumn. The lowest body masses were recorded in spring at islands in the central Mediterranean basin, indicating that crossing the Sahara and Mediterranean barriers is exhausting to these birds. Hence, the skipping‐type pattern of migration revealed by geolocators is likely to be natural in this species and not an effect of instrumentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalidris 3aautumn 3abasins 3abirds 3abreeding sites 3afuel loading 3ainstrumentation 3aislands 3amorphometry 3arivers 3aspring 3astopover sites 3aArctic region 3aMali 3aSahara Desert 3aScandinavia1 aHahn, Steffen0 tJournal of avian biology.g2015 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.419-424dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0908-88577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jav.006533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02032naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001900145245016400164300001600328520092800344592002801272650001001300650004301310650001701353650001301370650002601383650001401409650001301423650001201436700002001448700001701468773012101485856007901606852000901685655001201694IND60342625220221117043420.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034262522DNAL7 a10.1111/1442-1984.120542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNagano, Yusuke10aGenetic structure of a hybrid zone between two violets, Viola rossii Hemsl. and V. bissetii Maxim.: dominance of F1 individuals in a narrow contact range  ap. 237-243.  aThe genetic composition of a hybrid zone can provide insight into the evolution of diversification in plants. We carried out morphological and amplified fragment length polymorphism analyses to investigate the genetic composition of a hybrid zone between two violets, Viola bissetii Hemsl. and Viola rossii Maxim. Our aim was to clarify the formation and maintenance of hybrids between these Viola species. We found that most hybrid individuals (V. bissetii × V. rossii) were of the F₁ generation, with a few of the F₂ generation. We found no backcrosses. The scarcity of post‐F₁ hybrids indicates that a species barrier is established between the parental species. The F₁‐dominated hybrid zone occupied only a narrow, intermediate ecotone between the parental habitats, suggesting that selection by environmental factors against hybrids may help to maintain the current conditions in this hybrid zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aViola 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3abackcrossing 3aecotones 3aenvironmental factors 3aevolution 3ahabitats 3ahybrids1 aHirao, Akira S.1 aItino, Takao0 tPlant species biology.g2015 July, v. 30, no. 3 p.237-243dSociety for the Study of Species Biologyx0913-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1442-1984.120543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03074naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002800145245012100173300001600294520178600310592002802096650002002124650001302144650001602157650002002173650001902193650001202212650001402224650002302238650002002261650001602281650002102297650001102318650001102329650001702340650001502357650002902372650001102401700001902412773012102431856007902552852000902631655001202640IND60342625520221117043431.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034262552DNAL7 a10.1111/1442-1984.120502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMolano‐Flores, Brenda10aSexual differences in Lobelia spicata populations: floral morphometrics, stigma pollen loads, and pollen tube growth  ap. 202-211.  aIn many gynodioecious species, gender differences have been documented. Previous studies on populations of Lobelia spicata consistently documented hermaphrodites having larger corollas than females, but inconsistencies as to whether females had higher fruit set or not. In this study we expanded the data set on floral morphology, and to relate morphological differences to potential reproductive output we recorded stigma pollen loads and pollen tube growth to the ovary for both genders from four populations. Also, individuals were bagged to determine if and how much self‐pollen deposition occurred on stigmas. Because this species is self‐compatible but protandrous, it was thought unlikely to be able to self‐fertilize through autogamy. Hermaphroditic flowers were larger than female flowers in four out of the six flower traits analyzed. Overall, hermaphroditic flowers had larger corollas and stigma–nectary distance, but female flowers had longer and wider stigmas and more ovules. Open‐pollinated hermaphroditic flowers received more pollen grains on the stigma than female flowers. Positive correlations were found between floral morphological traits and stigma pollen load, but only for hermaphrodites. Pollen was found on the stigmas of all hermaphroditic bagged individuals and on a few female bagged individuals, though pollen tube growth was quite limited. Lastly, population differences were found. This study has identified several floral morphological traits and pollen grain/tube differences between genders and among populations for Lobelia spicata, supporting overall patterns identified in other gynodioecious species and adding a more detailed description of differences between the reproductive biology of each gender for this particular species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLobelia spicata 3aautogamy 3acorrelation 3adata collection 3afemale flowers 3afemales 3afruit set 3agender differences 3ahermaphroditism 3amorphometry 3aopen pollination 3aovules 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3apopulation 3areproductive performance 3astigma1 aFaivre, Amy E.0 tPlant species biology.g2015 July, v. 30, no. 3 p.202-211dSociety for the Study of Species Biologyx0913-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1442-1984.120503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02828naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001700189245010300206300002200309506007600331520100400407592002801411506003701439650002701476650002701503650001401530650001501544650001801559650002001577650001901597650002201616650002301638650001601661650000901677650001201686650001401698653001701712653001001729653002201739653001501761653001401776653002701790653002701817653001001844700002301854700001601877700001901893700002501912700002101937700002101958700001901979700002201998773010202020856008302122852000902205655001202214IND60623305920221207062812.0200103e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062330592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.0472doi7 aPMC62944772pmcid7 a303929562pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHara, Hideki14aThe NLRP6 Inflammasome Recognizes Lipoteichoic Acid and Regulates Gram-Positive Pathogen Infection  ap. 1651-1664.e14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe activator and composition of the NLRP6 inflammasome remain poorly understood. We find that lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a molecule produced by Gram-positive bacteria, binds and activates NLRP6. In response to cytosolic LTA or infection with Listeria monocytogenes, NLRP6 recruited caspase-11 and caspase-1 via the adaptor ASC. NLRP6 activation by LTA induced processing of caspase-11, which promoted caspase-1 activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β)/IL-18 maturation in macrophages. Nlrp6⁻/⁻ and Casp11⁻/⁻ mice were less susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection, which was associated with reduced pathogen loads and impaired IL-18 production. Administration of IL-18 to Nlrp6⁻/⁻ or Casp11⁻/⁻ mice restored the susceptibility of mutant mice to L. monocytogenes infection. These results reveal a previously unrecognized innate immunity pathway triggered by cytosolic LTA that is sensed by NLRP6 and exacerbates systemic Gram-positive pathogen infection via the production of IL-18.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acaspase-1 3acaspase-11 3ainflammasomes 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-18 3ainterleukin-1beta 3alipoteichoic acids 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3apathogens 0ainflammasome 0aNLRP6 0alipoteichoic acid 0acaspase-11 0acaspase-1 0agram-positive bacteria 0aListeria monocytogenes 0aIL-181 aSeregin, Sergey S.1 aYang, Dahai1 aFukase, Koichi1 aChamaillard, Mathias1 aAlnemri, Emad S.1 aInohara, Naohiro1 aChen, Grace Y.1 aNúñez, Gabriel,0 tCell.g2018 Nov. 29, v. 175, no. 6 p.1651-1664.e14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02729naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245006900171300001600240520173500256592002801991650001102019650001802030650001902048650001102067650001202078650001002090653001802100653002502118653001902143653002602162700001802188773011602206856004802322852000902370655001202379IND50087495020221122043121.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008749502DNAL7 a10.1080/004050010037038642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlamdar‐Yazdi, A.10aCross‐sectional shapes of the yarn in cotton gray woven fabric  ap. 248-262.  aThis experimental work looks into the geometry of the yarn cross‐section at the weaving and relaxed stages using microscopic and digital image processing techniques. A total of 54 plain‐weave cotton fabric samples (different in the yarn twist and the fabric density) were produced and the cross‐sectional shapes of the wefts at the early stage of weaving (in which the wefts were also under tension by full‐width temples) and at the relaxed state were compared with the ideal circular shape. The measurements of the samples showed that the cross‐sectional shapes of the yarns at the early stage of weaving are circular, elliptical or a combination of two circles or an asymmetric elliptical. Moreover, the effect of the fabric tightness on the yarn cross‐sectional shape and dimension was negligible. The measurements of the cross‐sectional dimensions of the relaxed fabric (released from weaving tension) showed an increase in the area occupied by the yarn inside the fabric and did not follow the Peirce standard model. The measurement and the comparison showed that the cross‐sections of the yarns inside the woven fabric could be categorized into five different shapes, namely; circular (C), elliptical (E), sharp symmetrical amygdaloidal (SSA), asymmetrical amygdaloidal (AA) and sharp asymmetrical amygdaloidal (SAA), but the number of each group depends upon the yarn properties and the fabric structures. The fabrics with the highest density and the highest twisted yarns had a circular cross‐sectional shape, whereas the fabrics with the lowest fabric density and the lowest twisted yarns had the most flattened yarn cross‐sections in the form of sharp symmetrical or asymmetrical amygdaloidal shapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3acotton fabric 3aimage analysis 3amodels 3aweaving 3ayarns 0ayarn geometry 0ayarn cross‐section 0afabric density 0apoint of intersection1 aHeppler, G.R.0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 102, no. 3 p.248-262dTFwJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405001003703864  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245007900178300001600257520130100273592002801574650001101602650001501613650001301628650000901641650001001650653001401660653001901674653002501693653001901718773011601737856004801853852000901901655001201910IND50087495120221122032906.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008749512DNAL7 a10.1080/004050010037223512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlamdar‐Yazdi, Aliasghar10aEffects of directed movement of fibres in a twist triangle on yarn quality  ap. 263-271.  aThis work investigates the effect of directed flow of the fibres in a twist triangle on yarn properties. This is done using different clip‐on attachments positioned on the front rollers of a ring spinning frame. Seven sets of rollers (plain non‐grooved; 75°‐biased left‐to‐right grooved; 75°‐biased right‐to‐left grooved; 15°‐, 45°‐ and 75°‐biased grooved from both sides towards the centre and solo) are made and positioned immediately below and parallel to the top front draft rollers of the laboratory ring spinning frame (tester model 82 KA) so that they can interact with the emerging drafted fibre strand before twist insertion. Afterwards, a 0.495‐ktex (2.02 Nm) finisher worsted roving composed of 55% polyester and 45% wool is fed into each unit of the ring spinning frame to produce a yarn with a yarn count of 30 Nm and a twist factor of 125. The rollers affect the flow of the fibres in the triangle zone and, as a result, the quality of the yarns is affected. A comparison of the yarns produced shows that directing the fibres in the triangle zone could improve the yarn quality. The results indicate that the 75°‐biased grooved (from both sides towards the centre) rollers improve the yarn quality in terms of hairiness, elongation and imperfections.  aPublisher supplied data 3amodels 3apolyesters 3aspinning 3awool 3ayarns 0aspun yarn 0atwist triangle 0aclip‐on attachment 0ayarn hairiness0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 102, no. 3 p.263-271dTFwJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405001003722351  aDNAL 7aarticle02365naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003600147245007800183300001600261520110800277592002801385650001501413650001501428650001001443650001101453650000901464650002001473650001801493650001101511650000901522650001601531650001201547653001801559653001601577653001501593653001401608653001601622653000901638653001101647700002401658700001801682700002201700773011601722856004801838852000901886655001201895IND50087495220221122043222.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008749522DNAL7 a10.1080/004050010037223692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMongkholrattanasit, Rattanaphol10aUV protection properties of silk fabric dyed with eucalyptus leaf extract  ap. 272-279.  aA natural dye extracted from eucalyptus leaves was applied to a silk fabric using two padding techniques, namely the pad‐batch and pad‐dry techniques, under different conditions. It was observed that with an increase in the dye concentration, the ultraviolet (UV) protection factor (UPF) values ranged between good and excellent for the silk fabric. In addition, a darker colour, such as that provided by a FeSO₄ mordant, gave better protection because of higher UV absorption. A silk fabric dyed in a solution containing the eucalyptus leaf extract showed a shade of pale yellowish‐brown. The exception was when the fabric was dyed with the FeSO₄ mordant, resulting in a shade of dark greyish‐brown. The colour fastness to washing and rubbing of the silk fabrics treated with the mordant after dyeing was investigated and the results showed good fastness, whereas colour fastness to light was at a fair level. The results confirmed that natural dyes from eucalyptus leaf extract with metal mordants have potential applications in fabric dyeing and in producing UV‐protective silk fabrics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus 3aabsorption 3acolor 3adyeing 3adyes 3aferrous sulfate 3aleaf extracts 3aleaves 3asilk 3asilk fabric 3awashing 0aUV protection 0anatural dye 0aeucalyptus 0apad‐dry 0apad‐batch 0asilk 0adyeing1 aKryštůfek, Jiří1 aWiener, Jakub1 aViková, Martina,0 tThe journal of the Textile Institute.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 102, no. 3 p.272-279dTFwJournal:23052x1754-23407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00405001003722369  aDNAL 7aarticle02659naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001300156245009900169300001400268500001500282520130600297592002801603650001401631650002701645650002901672650001601701650001701717650002001734650003001754650001401784650001101798650001401809650002101823650001401844650002301858650002201881650002301903650001301926650002301939653002601962700001901988773009502007856009002102852000902192655001202201IND60342629420221117042612.0150810e199409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034262942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.1994.tb00007.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, T.10aInduced Resistance in the Biocontrol of Pythium aphanidermatum by Pseudomonas spp. on Cucumber  ap. 51-63.  a2019-12-05  aPlants of Cucumis sativus cv.

B pots were treated with water or a cell suspension of Pseudomonas corrugata isolate 13 or P. fluorescens biovar C isolate 15, two rhizosphere isolates effective as biocontrol agents against Pythium aphanidermatum. The P pot was treated with water or a suspension of zoospores of P. aphanidermatum applied at the same time (simultaneous treatment) or 1 week after B pot treatments. Most of the bacterial treatments reduced disease incidence and disease severity. Simultaneous treatment with isolate 15 increased shoot dry weight, leaf area, and number of fruit of inoculated plants in one trial. Some treatments with isolate 13 or 15 also increased root volume or root dry weight in B or P pots, compared to the inoculated plants where the B pot was treated with water only (Pythium control). Lower population densities of P. aphanidermatum in P pots were detected in some treatments to which bacteria were applied to the B pot, but only in the early stages of the experiment. This is the first report of systemic‐induced resistance against a root pathogen in cucumber obtained by application of Pseudomonas spp. to a root system spatially separated from the pathogen‐inoculated root.  aPublisher supplied data 3azoospores 3aPythium aphanidermatum 3aPseudomonas mediterranea 3arhizosphere 3aroot systems 3aCucumis sativus 3abiological control agents 3acucumbers 3ashoots 3aleaf area 3adisease severity 3apathogens 3apopulation density 3adisease incidence 3ainduced resistance 3abacteria 3abiological control 0aPseudomonas corrugata1 aPaulitz, T.

RM@GMs showed maximum adsorption capacity of 76.57 mg/g for F⁻, and the adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. RM@GMs exhibited excellent dynamic separation effect at the flow rate of 4 mL/min and column height of 1 cm. In addition, RM@GMs had good selectivity for F⁻ in the competitive adsorption experiments and followed an order of: PO₄³⁻ > > SO₄²⁻ ≈ NO₃⁻ ≈ Cl⁻. In real seawater, natural surface water and tap water, RM@GMs still had excellent F⁻ removal effect. The adsorption mechanism revealed that RM@GMs removed F⁻ mainly through the synergistic effect of adsorption and ion exchange. Therefore, this paper provides the potential value for the large-scale utilization of RM in the application of F⁻-containing wastewater.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3afluorides 3aion exchange 3amicroparticles 3apH 3apolymers 3aseawater 3asorption isotherms 3asurface water 3asynergism 3atap water 3awastewater 0aSlag 0aDispersion-suspension-solidification 0aCompetitive adsorption 0aColumn experiment1 aWang, Kaituo1 aWei, Hongyang1 aWei, Deshuai1 aWei, Xuefei1 aWei, Binghu1 aShao, Lin1 aFujita, Toyohisa1 aCui, Xuemin0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 442 p.130027-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130027  aDNAL 7aarticle03659naa a2200901 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001200189245005400201300002200255506007600277520117400353592002801527506003701555650000801592650001901600650002001619650002301639650001201662650001601674650001701690650002001707650001301727650001901740650001101759650000901770650001101779650001901790650001701809650002901826653002001855653002101875653001701896653001601913653002101929653001401950653002001964653001901984653001602003653001202019700001502031700002002046700001402066700002202080700001602102700001302118700002002131700001902151700002102170700001702191700002202208700001702230700001502247700001702262700001802279700002102297700001402318700002202332700001502354700002002369700001402389700002102403700001802424700001702442700003102459700002102490700002002511700002002531773010202551856008302653852000902736655001202745IND60623306620221207073206.0190523e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062330662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.0062doi7 aPMC64334692pmcid7 a303929592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Qi10aN6-methyladenine DNA Modification in Glioblastoma  ap. 1228-1243.e20.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenetic drivers of cancer can be dysregulated through epigenetic modifications of DNA. Although the critical role of DNA 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in the regulation of transcription is recognized, the functions of other non-canonical DNA modifications remain obscure. Here, we report the identification of novel N6-methyladenine (N6-mA) DNA modifications in human tissues and implicate this epigenetic mark in human disease, specifically the highly malignant brain cancer glioblastoma. Glioblastoma markedly upregulated N6-mA levels, which co-localized with heterochromatic histone modifications, predominantly H3K9me3. N6-mA levels were dynamically regulated by the DNA demethylase ALKBH1, depletion of which led to transcriptional silencing of oncogenic pathways through decreasing chromatin accessibility. Targeting the N6-mA regulator ALKBH1 in patient-derived human glioblastoma models inhibited tumor cell proliferation and extended the survival of tumor-bearing mice, supporting this novel DNA modification as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma. Collectively, our results uncover a novel epigenetic node in cancer through the DNA modification N6-mA.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aanimal tissues 3abrain neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3aenzymes 3aepigenetics 3aglioblastoma 3aheterochromatin 3ahistones 3ahuman diseases 3ahumans 3amice 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 0aDNA methylation 0aN6-methyladenine 0aglioblastoma 0aepigenetics 0acancer stem cell 0achromatin 0aheterochromatin 0aneuro-oncology 0abrain tumor 0aH3K9me31 aWu, Tao P.1 aGimple, Ryan C.1 aLi, Zheng1 aPrager, Briana C.1 aWu, Qiulian1 aYu, Yang1 aWang, Pengcheng1 aWang, Yinsheng1 aGorkin, David U.1 aZhang, Cheng1 aDowiak, Alexis V.1 aLin, Kaixuan1 aZeng, Chun1 aSui, Yinghui1 aKim, Leo J.Y.1 aMiller, Tyler E.1 aJiang, Li1 aLee, Christine H.1 aHuang, Zhi1 aFang, Xiaoguang1 aZhai, Kui1 aMack, Stephen C.1 aSander, Maike1 aBao, Shideng1 aKerstetter-Fogle, Amber E.1 aSloan, Andrew E.1 aXiao, Andrew Z.1 aRich, Jeremy N.0 tCell.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 175, no. 5 p.1228-1243.e20dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010100172520090900273592002801182650003701210650003001247650001701277650001901294650001601313650001901329650002801348650001701376653003001393653001801423653003001441653003801471653001001509700001601519700001501535700001601550700001501566700001601581700001401597700001901611700001901630773011401649856005201763852000901815655001201824IND60794932620221118001412.0220929e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079493262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1300362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShangguan, Ding,10aWork function mediated interface charge kinetics for boosting photocatalytic water sterilization  aPhotocatalytic sterilization is an eco-friendly strategy to utilize solar energy for treating water contaminated with resistant bacteria.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ irradiation X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ISI-XPS) results show that photogenerated charge carriers can be directionally separated by the IEF.

The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions quantified in prior experiments suggests that initial losses of biodiversity have relatively small impacts on properties like community biomass production; however, beyond some threshold, increasing losses lead to accelerating declines in function. Some have questioned whether a saturating relationship between diversity and community biomass production is an artifact of overly simplified experiments that manipulate diversity in homogeneous conditions over short time‐scales in which niche differences may not be realized. Others have questioned whether even the modest effects of biodiversity observed in experiments would be discernible in natural systems where they could be over‐ridden by the stronger influence of abiotic factors. Here, we used a biogeographic dataset to assess how the taxonomic richness of aquatic primary producers relates to community biomass in unmanipulated lake ecosystems in the US, and then compared these findings to prior experiments. We used structural equation modeling to evaluate hypotheses about the effects of algal richness on community biomass while accounting for covariance with environmental parameters measured in the USEPA's National Lakes Assessment (NLA), which sampled 1157 freshwater lakes. These analyses converged on a single best‐fit model (χ²= 0.31, p = 0.58) wherein community algal biomass was a function of three explanatory variables – nitrogen, phosphorus, and algal richness. The quantitative magnitude of the algal diversity (x) – biomass (y) relationship in the NLA dataset is statistically greater than that documented in the average biodiversity experiment. It did, however, lie at approximately the 75th percentile of experimental relationships, indicating the diversity–biomass relationship in unmanipulated lakes is within the range that has been characterized experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3abiomass production 3acovariance 3adata collection 3aecosystems 3alakes 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3atrophic relationships 3aUnited States1 aCardinale, Bradley J.0 tOikos.g2014 Mar., v. 123, no. 3 p.267-278dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00777.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02785naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245007800175300002200253520107900275592002801354650002501382650001601407650002001423650001801443650001401461650002101475650001501496650000901511650002001520653001001540653001601550653001101566653001401577653001501591653001401606653003101620653001701651653002401668653001801692700001801710700002901728700002001757700002501777700002101802700003201823700003501855700001601890700002201906700002801928700001701956700002801973773010202001856008302103852000902186655001202195IND60623307020221119031520.0200103e20181129xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062330702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalzer, Marion Claudia10aIdentity Noise and Adipogenic Traits Characterize Dermal Fibroblast Aging  ap. 1575-1590.e22.  aDuring aging, stromal functions are thought to be impaired, but little is known whether this stems from changes of fibroblasts. Using population- and single-cell transcriptomics, as well as long-term lineage tracing, we studied whether murine dermal fibroblasts are altered during physiological aging under different dietary regimes that affect longevity. We show that the identity of old fibroblasts becomes undefined, with the fibroblast states present in young skin no longer clearly demarcated. In addition, old fibroblasts not only reduce the expression of genes involved in the formation of the extracellular matrix, but also gain adipogenic traits, paradoxically becoming more similar to neonatal pro-adipogenic fibroblasts. These alterations are sensitive to systemic metabolic changes: long-term caloric restriction reversibly prevents them, whereas a high-fat diet potentiates them. Our results therefore highlight loss of cell identity and the acquisition of adipogenic traits as a mechanism underlying cellular aging, which is influenced by systemic metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aextracellular matrix 3afibroblasts 3agene expression 3ahigh fat diet 3alongevity 3alow calorie diet 3ametabolism 3amice 3atranscriptomics 0aaging 0afibroblasts 0adermis 0aepidermis 0astem cells 0acell fate 0asingle-cell RNA-sequencing 0aadipogenesis 0acaloric restriction 0ahigh-fat diet1 aLafzi, Atefeh1 aBerenguer-Llergo, Antoni1 aYoussif, Catrin1 aCastellanos, Andrés1 aSolanas, Guiomar1 aPeixoto, Francisca Oliveira1 aStephan-Otto Attolini, Camille1 aPrats, Neus1 aAguilera, Mònica1 aMartín-Caballero, Juan1 aHeyn, Holger1 aBenitah, Salvador Aznar0 tCell.g2018 Nov. 29, v. 175, no. 6 p.1575-1590.e22dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01781naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001500156245008900171300001400260520066500274592002800939650002500967650004300992650002301035650002801058650001701086650002401103650001401127650001301141700002101154700001701175700001701192700001601209773009501225856009001320852000901410655001201419IND60342633220221119051517.0150810e199409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034263322DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0434.1994.tb00004.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPerner, B.10aEffect of Coronatine on Ethylene Release and ATPase Activity of Tomato Cell Cultures  ap. 27-36.  aThe effects of the phytotoxin coronatine formed by pathovars of Pseudomonas syringae on coronatine sensitive cell cultures of Lycopersicon peruvianum and Lycopersicon esculentum were investigated.

The isolates represented three of the four FOC races and the seven vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) known to occur in Australia. Isolates of F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense were also compared to isolates of F. oxysporum f.sp. gladioli, F. oxysporum f.sp. zingiberi, F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici, F. moniliforme, Aspergillus niger and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. DNA was extracted from fungal mycelium and amplified by RAPD‐PCR using one of two single random 10‐mer primers; the primer sequences were chosen arbitrarily. The RAPD‐PCR products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis producing a characteristic banding pattern for each isolate. The genetic relatedness of the F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense isolates was determined by comparing the banding patterns generated by RAPD‐PCR. This RAPD‐PCR analysis revealed variation at all five levels of possible genetic relatedness examined. F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense could very easily be distinguished from the other fungi, and the three races and five VCGs of F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense could also be differentiated. Within F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense, each isolate was scored for the presence or absence of each band (50 different bands were produced for primer SS01 and 59 different bands for primer RC09) and these data were clustered using the UPGMA method (unweighted pair‐group method, arithmetic average). UPGMA cluster analysis of the data generated by primer SS01 revealed two distinct clusters. One cluster contained race 4 isolates (VCGs 0120, 0129 and 01211) and the other cluster contained both race 1 (VCGs 0124, 0124/5 and 0125) and race 2 isolates (VCG 0128). Similar results were obtained with primer RC09. The banding patterns for each isolate were reproducible between experiments. These results indicated that RAPD‐PCR was a useful method for analysing genetic variation within F. oxysporum f.sp. cubense. Some of the advantages of this technique were that it was rapid, no sequence data were required to design the primers and no radioisotopes were required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus niger 3aDNA 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense 3aGlomerella cingulata 3acluster analysis 3adata analysis 3afungi 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3amycelium 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3apopulation 3araces 3aradionuclides 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aAustralia1 aPegg, K.

P. cambivora grew more slowly over calli from C. crenata than C. sativa. In both calli the fungus penetrated along the surface fissures. In C. sativa callus, the fungus grew intercellularly and penetrated the host cells as a haustorium or intracellular hyphae. In callus from C. crenata the hyphae grew mostly intercellularly, due in part to the fact that the host cell formed wall appositions which made penetration difficult.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCastanea sativa 3aPhytophthora cambivora 3acallus 3afungi 3ahyphae 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aultrastructure 3azoospores1 aGonzález, A.1 aSánchez Tamés, R.,0 tPhytopathologische Zeitschrift.g1994 Sept., v. 142, no. 1 p.19-26dPareyx0931-17857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0434.1994.tb00003.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245015800169520149000327592002801817650002501845650001901870650001801889650002101907650001301928650002201941650002601963650002101989650001902010650001202029650001402041650002402055650001502079650001102094650001402105650001702119650001502136650002202151650001602173653001702189653002402206653003102230653001502261700001502276700001402291700001602305700001602321700001802337700001502355700002102370700001102391700001702402773011402419856005202533852000902585655001202594IND60794933420221118001158.0220929e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079493342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1300452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Peiyuan10aPolyethylene mulching film degrading bacteria within the plastisphere: Co-culture of plastic degrading strains screened by bacterial community succession  aAs an ecological niche close to the polymer, microorganisms in the plastisphere possess the advantage of degrading plastics. This study aims to investigate the bacterial community succession and obtain degrading bacteria in the plastisphere, as well as identify the most efficient degradation combination by co-culture of multiple strains. The findings demonstrate the alpha-diversity indices of the plastisphere bacterial community are significantly lower, and the community structure is regularly and significantly altered. With the time of culture, the plastisphere community composition alters regularly, and the hydrocarbon-degrading genera become the core members. Functional prediction of community reveals the potential for Xenobiotics Biodegradation and Metabolism of plastisphere, and the apparent variations detections of polyethylene mulching film (PMF) indicating the PMF degrading ability of plastisphere. Besides, three PMF-degrading bacterial strains, Rhodopseudomonas sp. P1 (P), Rhodanobacter sp. Rs (R) and Microbacterium sp. M1 (M), are screened for co-culture with PMF degrading strain Bacillus aryabhattai 5–3 (B). By considering bacterial growth, biofilm adhesion, and apparent degradation of different samples, RB (R. sp. Rs + B. aryabhattai 5–3) is ultimately selected as the best PMF degradation combination. This study provides a new possibility for plastisphere-related research from the perspective of mitigating plastic pollution on agricultural land.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus aryabhattai 3aMicrobacterium 3aRhodanobacter 3aRhodopseudomonas 3aadhesion 3aagricultural land 3abacterial communities 3abacterial growth 3abiodegradation 3abiofilm 3acoculture 3acommunity structure 3ametabolism 3aniches 3apollution 3apolyethylene 3aprediction 3aspecies diversity 3axenobiotics 0aPlastisphere 0aBacterial community 0aPolyethylene mulching film 0aCo-culture1 aLiu, Jiaxi1 aHan, Siqi1 aWang, Yufan1 aDuan, Yifan1 aLiu, Tingting1 aHou, Lijun1 aZhang, Zengqiang1 aLi, Li1 aLin, Yanbing0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 442 p.130045-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.130045  aDNAL 7aarticle01534naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245007900164300001600243520056200259592002800821650000800849650001200857650002100869650001700890650001000907653001900917653001300936653001600949653002100965653001200986700001300998773011601011856004801127852000901175655001201184IND50087495820221122033031.0140412e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008749582DNAL7 a10.1080/004050010037712002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yanping10aCompression property and air permeability of weft‐knitted spacer fabrics  ap. 366-372.  aThis paper presents an investigation of the compression properties and air permeability of weft‐knitted spacer fabrics.

Three treatments were conducted with different percentages of biochar in the compost, including 5 %, 10 %, and 20 %. The treatment with 10 % of biochar showed the longest thermophilic phase compared to that of 5 % and 20 % of biochar, which greatly promoted the decomposition of organic matter. In addition, the degradation rate of the hard-to-degrade chlorinated-OPEs was significantly increased by 10 % biochar, reaching to 57.2 %. Correspondingly, approximately 43.6 % of the total concentration of OPEs (Σ₆OPEs) was eliminated in the presence of 10 % of biochar, which was higher than the treatments with 5 % and 20 % of biochar. Biochar significantly influenced the microbial community structure of compost, but the previously reported organophosphorus-degrading bacteria did not play a major role in the degradation of OPEs. The redox ability of the increased oxygen-containing functional groups such as quinone on the surface of biochar and the biochar-mediated electron transfer ability may play an essential role in the degradation of OPEs during the composting process.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acommunity structure 3acomposts 3aelectron transfer 3amicrobial communities 3aorganic matter 3aorganophosphorus compounds 3aquinones 3asewage sludge 0aOrganophosphate esters 0aAerobic composting 0aBiochar 0aSewage sludge 0aDegradation1 aHuang, Ziling1 aYang, Peijie1 aWu, Mingkai1 aZhang, Yanyan1 aPang, Rong1 aJin, Baodan1 aZhang, Ruiming0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2023 Jan. 15, v. 442 p.130047-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1300473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100001900189245009400208300002200302506007600324520097300400592002801373506003701401650001601438650001901454650002001473650001701493653001201510653001301522653001501535653002301550653002001573653001201593653002601605653002901631653002301660700002201683700001301705700002301718700002301741700002101764700002301785700001601808700002001824700002201844773010201866856008301968852000902051655001202060IND60623307720221207051132.0190523e20181115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062330772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.0262doi7 aPMC63267422pmcid7 a304158412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yunxiao10aStructural Basis for Cholesterol Transport-like Activity of the Hedgehog Receptor Patched  ap. 1352-1364.e14.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHedgehog protein signals mediate tissue patterning and maintenance by binding to and inactivating their common receptor Patched, a 12-transmembrane protein that otherwise would suppress the activity of the 7-transmembrane protein Smoothened. Loss of Patched function, the most common cause of basal cell carcinoma, permits unregulated activation of Smoothened and of the Hedgehog pathway. A cryo-EM structure of the Patched protein reveals striking transmembrane domain similarities to prokaryotic RND transporters. A central hydrophobic conduit with cholesterol-like contents courses through the extracellular domain and resembles that used by other RND proteins to transport substrates, suggesting Patched activity in cholesterol transport. Cholesterol activity in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane is reduced by PTCH1 expression but rapidly restored by Hedgehog stimulation, suggesting that PTCH1 regulates Smoothened by controlling cholesterol availability.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholesterol 3ahydrophobicity 3aplasma membrane 3atransporters 0aPatched 0aHedgehog 0aSmoothened 0aHedgehog signaling 0aRND transporter 0acryo-EM 0acholesterol transport 0amembrane lipid asymmetry 0acholesterol sensor1 aBulkley, David P.1 aXin, Yao1 aRoberts, Kelsey J.1 aAsarnow, Daniel E.1 aSharma, Ashutosh1 aMyers, Benjamin R.1 aCho, Wonhwa1 aChʻeng, I-fan,1 aBeachy, Philip A.0 tCell.g2018 Nov. 15, v. 175, no. 5 p.1352-1364.e14dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245013800170520152200308592002801830650002301858650002701881650002601908650002601934650002401960650001801984650001602002650001002018650001602028650001502044650001002059650001602069650001502085650002002100650001002120650001602130650002002146650000902166650001802175653002302193653003002216653002602246653002802272653001802300700001902318700001502337700001602352700001402368700001602382700001602398700001902414773011402433856008602547852000902633655001202642IND60794934120221118001746.0221004e20230115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079493412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.1300522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Changtao10aImpact of submerged macrophytes on growth and 2-MIB release risk of Pseudanabaena sp.: From field monitoringa to cultural experiments  aThe off-flavor compound 2-methylisoborneol (2-MIB) is generally associated with the proliferation and metabolism of filamentous cyanobacteria in shallow freshwater ecosystems. Here field monitoring in East Taihu Lake from July to October 2021, along with cultural experiments, was conducted to determine the impact of submerged macrophytes on the growth and 2-MIB production of filamentous cyanobacteria. Pseudanabaena sp. was identified as the 2-MIB producer with the highest detection rate (100%) and correlation coefficient (R=0.68, p < 0.001). The 2-MIB concentration and algal growth in the macrophyte-dominated zones were markedly decreased compared with those in the phytoplankton-dominated zone. Five submerged macrophytes classified into flat-leaf type (Vallisneria natans and Potamogeton crispus) and thin-leaf type (Hydrilla verticillata, Ceratophyllum demersum, and Myriophyllum spicatum) exhibited strong inhibition effects against Pseudanabaena sp.: Overall inhibition efficiencies (IEs) of 92.7% ± 6.8% and 92.7% ± 8.4% for cell growth and 2-MIB production were achieved, respectively. Moreover, the thin-leaf macrophytes exhibited significant higher IEs for cell growth (94.0% vs. 84.7%) and 2-MIB production (99.4% vs. 82.6%) than the flat-leaf macrophytes and can be selected as pioneer species in controlling odor problems.

Under different oxygen concentrations, the mass and heat intensity of three metamorphic levels of bituminous coal were investigated through synchronous thermal analysis, and their thermophysical parameters were tested using a laser-flash apparatus. The results indicated that as the oxygen concentration increased, the T3 (the temperature at maximum mass) and exothermic initial temperature slowly decreased. The changes in T1 (maximum adsorption temperature) and T2 (initial temperature at the oxygen-absorption and mass-gain stage) were nonsignificant. The effect of oxygen concentration on mass, heat intensity, and thermophysical parameters was primarily concentrated in high-temperature regions. As the temperature increased, the thermal diffusivity first decreased and then increased. The specific heat capacity gradually increased, then plateaued until it began to decrease; meanwhile, the thermal conductivity increased, first slowly and then quickly. A calculation model for different temperatures and oxygen concentrations was established through curve fitting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acoal 3acombustion 3aheat production 3aheat transfer 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aspecific heat 3atemperature 3athermal analysis 3athermal conductivity 3athermal diffusivity 0aHeat transfer 0aHeat intensity 0aThermal diffusivity 0aSpecific heat capacity 0aCalculation model1 aRen, Shuai-Jing1 aXiao, Yang1 aLi, Qing-Wei1 aShu, Chi-Min1 aBai, Guang-Yu0 tThermochimica acta.g2019 June, v. 676 p.186-197dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11747x0040-60317nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tca.2019.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010100172300001600273520094100289592002801230596004201258650001501300650001001315650001901325650000901344650002701353650001301380700001801393700001601411700002601427773012301453856008201576852000901658655001201667IND60524142020221118094826.0200303e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414202DNAL7 a10.1007/s12011-015-0603-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Zelst, Mariëlle10aStorage of Heparinised Canine Whole Blood for the Measurement of Glutathione Peroxidase Activity  ap. 361-363.  aGlutathione peroxidase activity is used as a biomarker of selenium status in dogs. Freshly collected blood samples are usually measured, due to the lack of knowledge on the effect of storing the samples. This study investigated if the analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity in whole blood collected from dogs was affected by storage of between 5 and 164 days. Results indicated that glutathione peroxidase activity was more variable in the freshly analysed samples compared to the stored samples. Although the mean differences between fresh and stored samples were not always equal to zero, this is thought to be caused by the variability of reagent preparation rather than by storage, as no consistent increase or decrease in glutathione peroxidase activity was found. Therefore, it can be concluded that heparinised dog blood samples can be successfully stored up to 164 days before analysis of glutathione peroxidase activity.  aPublisher supplied data  aN/AcWALTHAM Centre for Pet Nutrition 3abiomarkers 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3adogs 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aselenium1 aHesta, Myriam1 aGray, Kerry1 aJanssens, Geert P.

IgA production is influenced by intrinsic genetic factors in the foetus as well as extrinsic environmental factors during the post-natal period. At birth, piglets are exposed to new antigens through maternal colostrums/milk as well as exogenous microbiota. This exposure to new antigens is critical for the proper development of the gut mucosal immune system and is characterized mainly by the establishment of IgA response. A second critical period for neonatal intestinal immune system development occurs at weaning time when the gut environment is exposed to new dietary antigens. Neonate needs to establish oral tolerance and in the absence of protective milk need to fight potential new pathogens.To improve knowledge about the immune response in the neonates, it is important to identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors which influence the intestinal immune system development and to elucidate their mechanism of action.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3adigestive system 3aenvironmental factors 3afetus 3aimmune response 3aimmune system 3aimmunoglobulin A 3amechanism of action 3amicroorganisms 3amilk 3aneonates 3apiglets 3apostpartum period 3aswine production 3aweaning 0aPre- and post-natal period 0aMucosal immunity 0aIgA 0aGut flora 0aMilk 0aPig1 aBerri, Mustapha1 aWilson, Heather L.1 aMeurens, François1 aSalmon, Henri0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 May, v. 44, no. 1 p.235-244dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02737naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245012700160300001600287500002000303520140600323592002801729650002401757650001101781650001101792650001801803650001101821650002501832650002001857650002401877650001401901650001001915650001901925650001101944650001201955650001101967650001101978650001001989700001901999700001602018700001802034700001802052773011502070856007302185852000902258655001202267IND60524142220221118095250.0160704e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414222DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.121932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFavoretto, S.

The aim of this study was to describe morphological features of the female reproductive system of the species. The oval ovaries were partially surrounded by ovarian bursa. An external cortex and an inner medulla were present. Corpora lutea and corpora albicans together with follicles at various stages of development each with a single oocyte were found in the cortex. Uterine tubes were tortuous, tubular, travelled around the perimeter of the ovary and possessed a folded mucosa with ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. Uterus was simplex, with no horns and divided into three parts: a pear‐shaped cranial segment and a long caudal uterine segment (both forming the body of the uterus) and two cervices. Uterus presented three layers: mucosa, lined by pseudostratified epithelium, muscular and serosa. The cervices connected the uterus to the urogenital sinus, a distensible cavity with longitudinal mucosal folds lined by transitional epithelium that extended from the external urethral orifice and the external uterine ostia to the vulva, which was lined by a keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. Brown‐throated sloth presented a bipartite clitoris with paired crura, bodies and glandes. The presence of a double cervix and a bipartite clitoris was unique features of the species.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBradypus variegatus 3aPilosa 3acervix 3acorpus luteum 3acortex 3adevelopmental stages 3afallopian tubes 3ahabitat destruction 3ahistology 3ahorns 3akeratinization 3amucosa 3aoocytes 3aserosa 3auterus 3avulva1 adaSilva, E.

Fasting can have dramatic physiological and biological consequences for fish, including impacts on mucosal immunity which can, in turn, change host susceptibility to pathogens. Culture and selection of blue catfish (Ictalurus furcatus) has gained importance as the production of a channel catfish×blue catfish (Ictalurus punctatus×I. furcatus) hybrid has increased in the Southeast US. Following a recent examination of fasting-induced impacts on mucosal immunity in channel catfish, here we utilized Illumina-based RNA-seq expression profiling to compare changes in blue catfish gill and skin after a brief (7day) period of fasting. Transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly of over 194million 100base-pair transcript reads was followed by differential expression analysis. Fasting altered a total of 530genes in the surface mucosa, including genes regulating the immune response, energy metabolism, mucus production, cellular cytoskeletal structure, cell proliferation, and antioxidant responses. In particular, fasting perturbed arginine synthesis and metabolism pathways in a manner likely altering macrophage activation states and immune readiness. Our findings highlight key mediators of the critical interaction between nutrition and immunity at points of pathogen adherence and entry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIctalurus furcatus 3aIctalurus punctatus 3aantioxidant activity 3aarginine 3acatfish 3acell proliferation 3acytoskeleton 3adisease outbreaks 3aenergy metabolism 3afarmed fish 3afasting 3afeed deprivation 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahybrids 3amacrophage activation 3amucosa 3amucosal immunity 3amucus 3apathogens 3aseasonal variation 3asequence analysis 3atemperature 3atranscriptomics 0aFish 0aMucosal 0aFeed deprivation 0aFlavobacterium columnare 0aRNA-seq 0aImmune response1 aBeck, Benjamin H.1 aPeatman, Eric0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 May, v. 44, no. 1 p.226-234dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2013.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005900166300001600225520101600241592002801257650002501285650001601310650002001326650001301346650002101359650001401380650001101394650001401405650001301419650001101432650001301443650001701456650003701473653001301510653001301523653001601536653001901552700002201571700002401593700001801617773012701635856008201762852000901844655001201853IND60533532220221119064154.0190329e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGradil, Ana M.10aOntogeny of the immune system in Acipenserid juveniles  ap. 303-314.  aSturgeon aquaculture has increased considerably worldwide but little is known about their immunological development and competence in early life stages. Culture of larvae is one of the most critical stages in intensive sturgeon farming, often associated with high mortality rates. The objective of this study was to characterize the developmental morphology (light and transmission electron microscopy, LM and TEM) of the meningeal myeloid tissue, spleen and thymus in Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus) from hatching until 5months old (2895°C·day(dd)). The spleen was first visible on 541dd larvae LM sections and the other two immune organs in 768dd samples (approximately 400 and 600dd after onset of feeding). Generally, younger fish had significantly higher percentages of undifferentiated cells (meningeal myeloid tissue and spleen) and effective adaptive immune competence would not be expected in these fish on the onset of feeding, but further functional immune assessment is needed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser oxyrinchus 3aaquaculture 3afarming systems 3ahatching 3aimmunocompetence 3ajuveniles 3alarvae 3amortality 3aontogeny 3aspleen 3asturgeon 3athymus gland 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aSturgeon 0aImmunity 0aDevelopment 0aUltrastructure1 aWright, Glenda M.1 aWadowska, Dorota W.1 aFast, Mark D.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 June, v. 44, no. 2 p.303-314dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02907naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013400168300001600302520132400318592002801642650002801670650002101698650002701719650001701746650001301763650001601776650003101792650001001823650001001833650001401843650002001857650002001877650001801897650001801915650001901933650001101952653006401963653004002027653002702067653003102094653002502125700002102150700002402171773012702195856008202322852000902404655001202413IND60533532320221119063651.0190329e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKongton, Kittima10aIdentification of gamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) homologues in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster  ap. 389-396.  aGamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) has been demonstrated to be involved in the immune response to bacterial challenge in various organisms. However, little is known about GILT function in innate immunity. Drosophila has been commonly used as a model for the study of the innate immune response of invertebrates. Here, we identify the CG9796, CG10157, and CG13822 genes of fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as GILT homologues. All deduced Drosophila GILT coding sequences contained the major characteristic features of the GILT protein family: the GILT signature CQHGX2ECX2NX4C sequence and the active site CXXC or CXXS motif. The mRNA transcript levels of the Drosophila GILT genes were up-regulated after Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli DH5α infection. Moreover, a bacterial load assay showed that over-expression of Drosophila GILT in fat body or hemocytes led to a low bacterial colony number whereas knock-down of Drosophila GILT in fat body or hemocytes led to a high bacterial colony number when compared to a wild-type control. These results indicate that the Drosophila GILTs are very likely to play a role in the innate immune response upon bacterial challenge of Drosophila host defense. This study may provide the basis for further study on GILT function in innate immunity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aactive sites 3afat body 3afruit flies 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agilts 3ahemocytes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainvertebrates 3amessenger RNA 3amicrobial load 3amodels 0aGamma-interferon-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) 0aFruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) 0aInnate immune response 0aEscherichia coli (E. coli) 0aBacterial load assay1 aMcCall, Kimberly1 aPhongdara, Amornrat0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 June, v. 44, no. 2 p.389-396dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245014000164300001600304520150300320592002801823650002101851650001501872650001301887650001701900650001701917650002101934650001901955650000901974650001101983650001101994650001202005650001402017650001602031650002302047653002802070653002102098653001702119653002002136700001302156700001702169700002002186700001402206700001402220700005702234700005902291773009702350856008502447852000902532655001202541IND60642899420221122192210.0191010e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064289942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.04.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lei12aA one-year long survey of temporal disinfection byproducts variations in a consumer's tap and their removals by a point-of-use facility  ap. 203-213.  aIn order to better understand the occurrence of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in tap water and their real impacts on consumers, this study made a one-year long survey of the temporal variations of a series of DBPs before and after a point-of-use (POU) treatment facility installed in a building serving for ∼300 people. Water samples were collected every week at a fixed location and time for 1 year, and frequent samplings were carried out every 6 h a day for 1 month at selected seasons, which ultimately amounted to 322 samples. The results show that the concentrations of DBPs were higher in the summer than other seasons, with the lowest DBP levels being observed in spring. Within one week, higher levels of haloacetic acids (HAAs) were identified on weekdays than those on weekends. Diurnally, trihalomethanes, HAAs, and haloacetaldehydes were found to be higher at noon but lower in the evening. Consistent with other studies, the variations of most DBPs were somewhat positively related to the changes of temperature and organic matter, but negatively related to the quantity of free chlorine. With the use of a POU facility, which equips with two activated carbon cartridges and a boiler in sequence, most of DBPs were dramatically reduced, leading to 62–100% lower cytotoxicity for the measured DBPs. The study hence provides a real-water evidence about the DBP occurrences in a typical distribution system endpoint and the efficiency of a typical POU on mitigating DBP risks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3abyproducts 3achlorine 3acytotoxicity 3adisinfection 3ahaloacetic acids 3aorganic matter 3arisk 3aspring 3asummer 3asurveys 3atap water 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 0aDisinfection byproducts 0aHaloacetaldehyde 0aPoint-of-use 0aTemporal survey1 aChen, Yi1 aChen, Shuwei1 aLong, Liangchen1 aBu, Yinan1 aXu, Haoyu1 aChen, Baiyang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8547-91581 aKrasner, Stuart1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8186-311X0 tWater research.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 159 p.203-213dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.04.0623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02531naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245015200155300001800307500002000325520133600345592002801681650001501709650001201724650001101736650001301747650001901760650001901779650001901798650002701817650001101844700001701855700001501872700001701887700001401904700001801918773011401936856007402050852000902124655001202133IND60524143620221118094606.0160704e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414362DNAL7 a10.1002/pola.281382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Jin10aFabrication of V‐shaped brushes consisting of two highly incompatible arms of PEG and fluorinated PMMA and their protein‐resistance performance  ap. 2599-2610.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this article, the fluorinated amphiphilic V‐shaped brushes with two highly incompatible arms of mPEG₄₂ and PMMA₃₈‐b‐PFMAy were produced by reacting COOH in the PAA segment in methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)‐b‐poly(acrylic acid)‐b‐poly(methyl methacrylate)‐b‐poly(2‐perfluoro‐octylethyl methacrylate) (mPEG₄₂‐b‐PAA₁₁‐b‐PMMA₃₈‐b‐PFMAy) with an epoxy group on the functionalized SiO₂ substrate. It was found that the resulting phase separation structures of the V‐shaped brushes can be adjusted by altering the degree of polymerization (y) of PFMA. The brush surface with y = 8 showed an alternating phase separation structure, in which one domain was water‐soluble PEG and the other was ultralow surface energy domain with a crystalline fluorinated side group. Protein adsorption studies indicated that this surface structure exhibited desirable protein‐resistant performance. The reason was attributed to the stimuli‐responsive PEG domain, in which PEG chains stretch out at the interface in water, while the PFMA domain remains relatively stable. The synergistic effect of the hydrophilic PEG domain and the hydrophobic PFMA domain in water prevents protein adsorption. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

Recent evidence demonstrated bidirectional transcription and a sense/antisense transcriptional regulatory manner in PU.1 locus. However, the effect of PU.1 mRNA and its antisense long non-coding RNA (AS lncRNA) on adaptive immunity in vivo is still not clear. In this study, we first confirmed the expression of PU.1 AS lncRNA by strand-specific RT-PCR in zebrafish. Additionally, we found that GFP was detected in zebrafish kidney using tissue smears after zebrafish was intraperitoneally injected with pLentiHI-PU.1 shRNA or pLentiHI-PU.1 AS shRNA for 2days. Moreover, on day 0, 2 and 4, the levels of PU.1 and immune-related genes including TCRAC, Rag2, AID, IgLC-1, mIg, and sIg mRNAs were detected using real-time qPCR. The results showed that the levels of PU.1 and above 6 immune-related gene mRNAs were significantly downregulated on day 2 (P<0.05) and day 4 (P<0.01) by the treatment with the pLentiHI-PU.1 shRNA, whereas these genes were markedly upregulated by the treatment with the pLentiHI-PU.1 AS shRNA. Based on our results, we suggested that the effects of PU.1 transcripts including mRNA and AS lncRNA on immune-related gene expression in zebrafish were opposite. To our knowledge, this was the first report that a novel functional AS lncRNA in adaptive immunity was transcribed from the zebrafish PU.1 locus. Our findings provided novel insight into further exploration on modulating adaptive immunity by regulating PU.1 mRNA and AS lncRNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3aadaptive immunity 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aimmune system 3akidneys 3aloci 3amessenger RNA 3anon-coding RNA 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 0aZebrafish 0aAdaptive immunity 0aPU.1 mRNA 0aPU.1 AS lncRNA 0aGene expression1 aPang, Weijun1 aWang, Yu1 aXiong, Yan1 aXu, Ruxiang1 aWu, Wenjing1 aZhao, Cunzhen1 aYang, Gongshe0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 June, v. 44, no. 2 p.315-319dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001800188245012100206300001600327506007600343520164800419592002802067506003702095650002502132650002102157650002702178650002702205650001802232650001602250650000902266650001602275650001202291650002002303650001702323650001402340650001402354650001002368650001202378650001602390650002402406650000702430650001402437650001702451650001202468650001302480650001902493653002802512653002502540653001202565653001202577653001902589653001302608700001702621700001702638700001602655700001902671773014102690856008202831852000902913655001202922IND60533533520221207051700.0190329e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0192doi7 aPMC46072642pmcid7 a244865342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCammarata, M.12aA rhamnose-binding lectin from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) plasma agglutinates and opsonizes pathogenic bacteria  ap. 332-340.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe discovery of rhamnose-binding lectins (RBLs) in teleost fish eggs led to the identification of a novel lectin family characterized by a unique sequence motif and a structural fold, and initially proposed to modulate fertilization. Further studies of the RBL tissue localization and gene organization were also suggestive of role(s) in innate immunity. Here we describe the purification, and biochemical and functional characterization of a novel RBL (DlRBL) from sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) serum. The purified DlRBL had electrophoretic mobilities corresponding to 24kDa and 100kDa under reducing and non-reducing conditions, respectively, suggesting that in plasma the DlRBL is present as a physiological homotetramer. DlRBL subunit transcripts revealed an open reading frame encoding 212 amino acid residues that included two tandemly-arrayed carbohydrate-recognition domains, and an 18-residue signal sequence at the N-terminus. The deduced size of 24.1kDa for the mature protein was in good agreement with the subunit size of the isolated lectin. Binding activity of DlRBL for rabbit erythrocytes could be inhibited in the presence of rhamnose or galactose, did not require calcium, and was optimal at around 20°C and within the pH 6.5–8.0 range. DlRBL agglutinated Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, and exposure of formalin-killed Escherichia coli to DlRBL enhanced their phagocytosis by D. labrax peritoneal macrophages relative to the unexposed controls. Taken together, the results suggest that plasma DlRBL may play a role in immune recognition of microbial pathogens and facilitate their clearance by phagocytosis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aagglutination 3aamino acids 3abass 3ablood serum 3acalcium 3aelectrophoresis 3aerythrocytes 3afish eggs 3agalactose 3agenes 3alectins 3amacrophages 3aopen reading frames 3apH 3apathogens 3aphagocytosis 3arabbits 3arhamnose 3asignal peptide 0aRhamnose binding lectin 0aDicentrarchus labrax 0aTeleost 0aOpsonin 0aHemagglutinins 0aBacteria1 aParisi, M.G.1 aBenenati, G.1 aVasta, G.R.1 aParrinello, N.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 June, v. 44, no. 2 p.332-340dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03798naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016800169300001600337520191800353592002802271650001502299650002102314650001502335650001602350650002202366650001402388650001602402650001702418650001002435650002602445650002602471650001402497650002102511650001702532650001502549650001702564650001402581650001902595650001502614650001902629650001502648650002102663650001802684650002502702650001102727653001702738653001602755653002902771653003102800653002502831700001802856700001302874700002302887700001502910700001502925700001702940773009702957856008503054852000903139655001203148IND60642900420221120181200.0191010e20190801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Xiaoyan Y.14aThe treatability of trace organic pollutants in WWTP effluent and associated biotoxicity reduction by advanced treatment processes for effluent quality improvement  ap. 423-433.  aAs increasing attention is paid to surface water protection, there has been demand for improvements of domestic wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent. This has led to the application of many different advanced treatment processes (ATPs). In this study, the treatability of trace organic pollutants in secondary effluent (SE) and associated biotoxicity reduction by four types of ATPs, including coagulation, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, ultraviolet (UV) photolysis and photocatalysis, and ozonation, were investigated at the bench-scale. The ATPs showed different removal capacity for the 48 chemicals, which were classified into seven categories. EDCs, herbicides, bactericides and pharmaceuticals were readily degraded, and insecticides, flame retardants, and UV filters were relatively resistant to removal. During these processes, the efficiency of the ATPs in reducing four biological effects were investigated. Of the four biological effects, the estrogenic activity from SE was not detected using the yeast estrogen screen. In contrast with genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition, bacterial cytotoxicity posed by SE was the most difficult biological effect to reduce with these ATPs. GAC adsorption and ozonation were the most robust treatment processes for reducing the three detected biotoxicities. UV photolysis and photocatalysis showed comparable efficiencies for the reduction of genotoxicity and photosynthesis inhibition. However, coagulation only performed well in genotoxicity reduction. The effect-based trigger values for the four bioassays, that were derived from the existing environmental quality standards and from HC5 (hazardous concentration for 5% of aquatic organisms), were all used to select and optimize these ATPs for ecological safety. Conducting ATPs in more appropriate ways could eliminate the negative effects of WWTP effluent on receiving water bodies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aantibiotics 3aaquatic organisms 3abioassays 3acoagulation 3acytotoxicity 3adrugs 3aenvironmental quality 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrogens 3aflame retardants 3agenotoxicity 3aherbicides 3ainsecticides 3aozonation 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotolysis 3aphotosynthesis 3apollutants 3asewage treatment 3asurface water 3awastewater treatment 3ayeasts 0aTreatability 0aBiotoxicity 0aTrace organic pollutants 0aAdvanced treatment process 0aEffect-based trigger1 aWang, Yongkun1 aDong, Ke1 aWang, Xiaochang C.1 aZheng, Kai1 aHao, Liwei1 aNgo, Huu Hao0 tWater research.g2019 Aug. 01, v. 159 p.423-433dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03440naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245010500163300001600268500001500284520179800299592002802097650000902125650001202134650001702146650002702163650001002190650002002200650003002220650001602250650001502266650001202281650002102293650001502314650002702329650001002356650001202366650001802378650001702396650001202413650001302425650002102438650000902459650001402468650002102482651002002503653002002523653001902543700001702562700001602579700001902595700001902614700001702633773009802650856008102748852000902829655001202838IND4459990720221116193405.0141110e20110912xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445999072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2011.05.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJantaboon, J.10aIdeotype breeding for submergence tolerance and cooking quality by marker-assisted selection in rice  ap. 206-213.  a2019-12-06  aSubmergence tolerance and jasmine-like cooking quality are desirable for rice varieties grown in rainfed and irrigated lowland ecosystems in the Mekong region of Southeast Asia. Hybridization between varieties IR57514 and Kao Dawk Mali 105 (KDML105) was initiated with the goal of producing an ideotype that combines submergence tolerance and jasmine-like cooking quality. Through the single seed descent (SSD) method, a large population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed, and we demonstrated the potential of using marker-assisted selection (MAS) in the identification of the ideotype from the offspring. Four markers, R10783Indel, Waxy, Aromarker and GT11, were used to select the favored alleles of the Sub1, Wx, badh2 and SSIIa loci, respectively. The ideotype was classified into two groups: ideotype1 (ID1), carrying the Sub1ᴵᴿ, badh2ᴷᴰ, Wxᴷᴰ and SSIIaᴷᴰ alleles and consisting of 66 RILs and ideotype2 (ID2), carrying the Sub1ᴵᴿ, badh2ᴷᴰ, Wxᴷᴰ and SSIIaᴵᴿ alleles and consisting of 31 RILs. Submergence tolerance, cooking quality, grain quality and agronomic characteristics of the IDs were evaluated and compared with those of the parents. All of the ID1 lines exhibited submergence tolerance and jasmine-like cooking quality and displayed a low amylose content, a fragrance and a high alkali spreading value, whereas the ID2s showed the same characteristics as ID1, except for a low alkali spreading value, which was inherited from IR57514. A wide range of agronomic characteristics was observed in both of the ID groups, and some of the IDs were superior in the yield component, as compared to their parents. This study provides further support that the precision of markers used in MAS can enhance the development of ideotypes in rice.  aPublisher supplied data 3arice 3aalleles 3aOryza sativa 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aodors 3agenetic markers 3amarker-assisted selection 3asubmergence 3airrigation 3aparents 3ayield components 3aecosystems 3aalkali spreading value 3aseeds 3aamylose 3ahybridization 3ainbred lines 3aprogeny 3alowlands 3astress tolerance 3aloci 3aideotypes 3aagronomic traits 3aSouth East Asia 0acooking quality 0aplant breeding1 aSiangliw, M.1 aIm-mark, S.1 aJamboonsri, W.1 aVanavichit, A.1 aToojinda, T.0 tField crops research.g2011 Sept. 12, v. 123, no. 3 p.206-213dElsevier B.V.x0378-42907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2011.05.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245014700160300001400307520099400321592002801315650002401343650001801367650001001385650001701395650001401412650001201426650001101438650001901449650001701468653001401485653001301499653001101512653001801523653001401541653001601555700002001571700001901591700001801610700001901628773012501647856008201772852000901854655001201863IND60533534120221119063715.0190329e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Jian12aA continuous cell line, SYSU-OfHe-C, from hemocytes of Ostrinia furnacalis possesses immune ability depending on the presence of larval plasma  ap. 10-20.  aA continuous cell line, SYSU-OfHe-C, from larval hemocytes of corn borer, Ostrinia furnacalis was established. With increasing passages, the cells grew increasingly faster, and approximately 45% of the cells were in division at passage 55. The culture was mainly composed of two types of cells, granulocytes and plasmatocytes, which showed different division and proliferation behaviors, but possessed similar phagocytic ability. Its spreading ability was significantly weaker than that of hemocytes from naïve larva; however, it could be promoted by larval plasma. Furthermore, its encapsulation ability was also promoted by larval plasma to form multilayer capsules on Sephadex A-25 beads. Finally, the expression of several immune-related genes was verified after provocation by microbes or Sephadex beads. These results indicated that the cell line possessed immune ability depending on the presence of plasma of naïve larvae and are beneficial to studies of insect cellular systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOstrinia furnacalis 3aencapsulation 3agenes 3agranulocytes 3ahemocytes 3ainsects 3alarvae 3amicroorganisms 3aphagocytosis 0aCell line 0aHemocyte 0aImmune 0aEncapsulation 0aSpreading 0aLepidoptera1 aFeng, Xiangping1 aYang, Zhongguo1 aChen, Zhuoxin1 aZhang, Wenqing0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 July, v. 45, no. 1 p.10-20dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02201naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002300140245016000163300001800323500002000341520117400361592002801535650002301563650001001586650001901596650000901615650001301624700002901637700002401666773011401690856007401804852000901878655001201887IND60524145020221118094834.0160704e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414502DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.240622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicciche, Fabrizio14aThe effect of molecular structure on the secondary transitions and their influence on the decoloration kinetics of photochromic dyes in co‐polycarbonates  ap. 1593-1601.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhotochromic dyes have restricted use in rigid polycarbonates because of slow coloration and decoloration kinetics. In this study, it is shown that the decoloration kinetics of two photochromic dyes can be controlled by tuning the chain stiffness and free volume of the host matrix. The introduction of flexible moieties in rigid BPA‐based polycarbonate chain accelerates the decoloration of these dyes whereas a rigid co‐monomer delays the decoloration kinetics. Although Tg might be used as a parameter to improve photochromism in polymer matrices, dynamic mechanical analysis demonstrates that the decoloration kinetics of the dyes in host polymer matrices having similar Tg depends primarily on the secondary relaxations and, thus, on the polymer architecture. The effect of the co‐monomer type on the characteristic ratio is also discussed underlining the potential relationship between the free volume and chain stiffness. These results open the possibility to develop transparent or semitransparent photochromic materials based on tailor‐made co‐polycarbonates. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

They have been recognized as crucial regulators for membrane trafficking including cargo sorting, vesicle formation, budding, motility, docking, fusion, secretory and endocytic pathway of host immune responses. However, little is known of the Rab gene family in teleost fish species. The development of full-length transcripts and whole genome sequences allow the identification and annotation of Rab GTPase gene family in catfish. In this study, a total of 52 Rab genes were identified from catfish cDNA and genome databases. Phylogenetic analysis assigned them into eleven subfamilies. Most Rab GTPases are conserved among vertebrates, though some of which are absent in fish genomes. Analysis of multiple RNA-seq datasets, along with real time PCR analysis revealed up-regulation of 10 Rab genes after bacterial infection. These included Rab3a, Rab4a, Rab4b, Rab5a, Rab5c, Rab7a, Rab9a, Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab33a. Their up-regulation are temporally and spatially regulated in various tissues, but mostly induced at early stages after infection and in the gill and liver tissues, with the exception of Rab5c that is mostly up-regulated in the head kidney and trunk kidney. The complex pattern of their induced expression suggested both specific and cooperative actions of a these Rab genes in the acute immune responses to bacterial infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aG-proteins 3aIctalurus punctatus 3abacterial infections 3acatfish 3acell membranes 3acomplementary DNA 3adata collection 3adatabases 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aguanosinetriphosphatase 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3akidneys 3aliver 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphysiological transport 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asequence analysis 0aCatfish 0aFish 0aRab 0aInnate immunity 0aAcute phase, infection 0aDisease1 aZhang, Yu1 aLiu, Shikai1 aLi, Chao1 aSun, Luyang1 aBao, Lisui1 aFeng, Jianbin1 aLiu, Zhanjiang0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 July, v. 45, no. 1 p.21-34dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.01.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03592naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010900167300001200276520219600288592002802484650001702512650003302529650002602562650001202588650003202600650001502632650002402647650001302671650001802684650002202702650002202724650002502746650002202771653001202793653002102805653002602826653002402852653003402876700001802910700001802928773009402946856008503040852000903125655001203134IND60642901220221120171340.0190620e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeng, Yabing10aImpacts of diel temperature variations on nitrogen removal and metacommunity of anammox biofilm reactors  ap. 1-9.  aThe influence of diel temperature variations (DTVs) on nitrogen removal and bacterial communities was investigated in two parallel anammox reactors (i.e., control and DTV reactors). The control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 °C, whereas the DTV reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12/12 h of high/low temperatures. Nine water temperature variations for the day/night periods were set from 30/30 °C (i.e., Δ0 °C) to 38/22 °C (i.e., Δ16 °C). An increase in DTVs from Δ8 °C (34/26 °C) to Δ16 °C (38/22 °C) caused a significant decline in reactor performance and a shift in bacterial diversity. Compared to the control reactor, for instance, nitrogen removal efficiency decreased (P < 0.05) when temperature fluctuations exceeded Δ8 °C in the DTV reactor with a decreasing ΔNO3−/ΔNH4+ ratio (from 0.21 ± 0.15 to 0.16 ± 0.04). The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the initial disturbance of temperature variations led to increased levels of bacterial diversity (i.e., alpha diversity) and decreased community levels of anammox consortia whereas they slightly recovered at the end of each DTV phase. Notably, Candidatus Jettenia was more sensitive to strong water temperature fluctuations, with the lower relative abundance at Δ14 °C (17.11 ± 5.01%) and Δ16 °C (17.83 ± 7.22%) than at Δ4 °C (39.82 ± 0.01%). In contrast, Ca. Brocadia and Ca. Kuenenia had higher relative abundance at Δ14 °C (i.e., 0.24 ± 0.07% and 0.09 ± 0.02%, respectively) and Δ16 °C (i.e., 0.28 ± 0.05% and 0.12 ± 0.03%, respectively) compared to that at Δ4 °C (i.e., 0.15 ± 0.04% and 0.04 ± 0.01%, respectively). Nitrifiers (i.e., unidentified_Nitrospiraceae and Nitrosomonas) and denitrifiers (i.e., Denitratisoma) were also capable of tolerating high temperature perturbations. Overall this study furthers our knowledge of responses of the microbial ecology of anammox bacteria to DTVs in anammox processes, which could aid us in optimizing anammox-related wastewater treatment systems and in understanding the nitrogen cycles of natural ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNitrosomonas 3aanaerobic ammonium oxidation 3abacterial communities 3abiofilm 3adenitrifying microorganisms 3aecosystems 3anitrifying bacteria 3anitrogen 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aspecies diversity 3awastewater treatment 3awater temperature 0aAnammox 0aNitrogen removal 0aCommunity composition 0aBacterial diversity 0aDiel temperature perturbation1 aZhou, Zhongbo1 aMeng, Fangang0 tWater research.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 160 p.1-9dElsevier LtdwJournal:1966x0043-13547nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2019.05.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02657naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245015700154300001800311500002000329520154700349592002801896650002201924650002001946650002801966650001501994650000902009650001302018650001602031700001702047700002002064700002602084773011402110856007402224852000902298655001202307IND60524145620221118094622.0160704e20160815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414562DNAL7 a10.1002/polb.240682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Qing10aInfluence of the crystallization on the molecular mobility and ionic DC conductivity behaviors of relaxor ferroelectric P(VDF‐TrFE‐CTFE) terpolymers  ap. 1645-1657.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe dynamics of semicrystalline poly(vinylidene fluoride‐trifluoroethylene‐chlorotrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF‐TrFE‐CTFE)) terpolymers were fully investigated as a function of temperature and frequency, by means of broadband dielectric spectroscopy. Four types of relaxation regimes were observed over the full dielectric spectroscopy, namely β (second) relaxation in the sub‐glass state, α (segmental dynamics) in the rubbery state, the Curie transition and space charge carrier motion at high temperatures. Constrained segmental dynamics were observed in the terpolymer containing the highest crystalline fraction for which a narrow relaxation time distribution was found. These results indicate a decreasing average size of the cooperative rearranging region over the crystalline fraction. A decrease of the strength index values also implied a more fragile behavior for terpolymers with a higher degree of crystallinity. An exceptional increase in dielectric strength Δεα was found as the crystallinity increased. This behavior could be explained by an enhanced interphase (constrained amorphous phase). The Curie transition showed an accelerating relaxation rate for a more fragile terpolymer. Moreover, a motion of the space charge carrier ions was observed in the higher temperature range. Finally, there was evidence that the segmental dynamics in the amorphous phase was responsible for the motion of the space charge carrier ions. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

Phenotypic analyses in this study showed that CD2− γδ T cells in their vast majority had a CD8α−SLA-DR−CD27+ phenotype. CD2+ γδ T cells dominated in spleen and lymph nodes and had a more heterogeneous phenotype. CD8α+SLA-DR−CD27+ γδ T cells prevailed in blood, spleen and lymph nodes whereas in liver a CD8α+SLA-DR+CD27− phenotype dominated, indicating an enrichment of terminally differentiated γδ T cells. γδ T cells were also investigated for their potential to produce IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-17A. Within CD2+ γδ T cells, IFN-γ and TNF-α single-producers as well as IFN-γ/TNF-α double-producers dominated, which had a CD8α+CD27+/− phenotype. IL-17A-producing γδ T cells were only found within CD2− γδ T cells, mostly co-produced TNF-α and had a rare CD8α+CD27− phenotype. However, quantitatively TNF-α single-producers strongly dominated within CD2− γδ T cells. In summary, our data identify CD2 and CD8α as important molecules correlating with functional differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aT-lymphocytes 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-17 3aliver 3alymph nodes 3aphenotype 3aspleen 3aswine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aBM 0abr.

Differing from classical memory effect, mesomorphic iPP melt had a higher growth rate and a higher memory temperature. The relative growth rate increased with increasing crystallization temperature. Lauritzen–Hoffman plots indicated that the increased growth rate arose from reduced surface nucleation barrier. The highest memory temperature was estimated to be 185 °C, which was close to the equilibrium melting point of iPP crystal. Additionally, Small‐angle X‐ray scattering measurements showed that a liquid crystal layer might exist between lamellar and amorphous layers. Based on above results, a crystallization model was proposed. In the mesomorphic iPP melt, there exist aggregates structurally similar to β phase except α‐phase crystal residuals, which cannot act as nucleation sites or transform to β crystal through surface nucleation. The only way for the aggregate is to transform to α crystal during crystal growth. The aggregate decreases the surface nucleation barrier and promotes the helical growth, leading to higher growth rate. Only when the aggregate relaxes to polymer coils through thickening at a higher temperature, can the memory effect be erased. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part B: Polym.

This study was conducted to understand the prevalence of V. parahaemolyticus and the presence of virulence factors in environmental isolates of V. parahaemolyticus, collected from three major shrimp producing states viz, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat of India during February 2014 to June 2017. Total 183 V. parahaemolyticus were isolated from moribund shrimp and identified using toxR and 16S rRNA gene. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was performed to detect virulence genes under T3SS1 and T3SS2 along with AHPND. All the isolates showed presence of vcrD1, vp1680 and vopD1 gene under T3SS1 but negative for AHPND. Only 3% of isolates showed presence of all the virulence genes (vcrD2, vopD2, vopB2 and vopC) used in the present study under T3SS2. The isolates were also tested for the presence of tdh, trh or both the genes; 8% of the isolates had trh gene and 3% of the isolates had tdh gene. The genetic diversity within and between V. parahaemolyticus isolated from three different geographical locations, was analyzed by using 16S rRNA gene. Though the biotype diversity (h) was high for all three populations, phylogenetic study of V. phaemolyticus revealed an admixture of biotypes. Tajima's D (−2.59470; p < .001) test of selective neutrality and Fu's Fs (−32.422; p < .001) test were negative and significant, suggesting a sudden population expansion with limited time for population differentiation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aaquaculture farms 3abiotypes 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahuman diseases 3aphylogeny 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apopulation growth 3aribosomal RNA 3ashrimp 3avirulence 3aIndia 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0a16S rRNA gene 0aT3SS1 0aT3SS2 0aGenetic diversity1 aKunal, Swaraj Priyaranjan1 aBehera, Bijay Kumar1 aMohapatra, Pradeep Kumar Das1 aDas, Abhishek1 aParida, Pranaya Kumar1 aDas, Basantakumar,0 tAquaculture.g2019 July 15, v. 509 p.104-111dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02814naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017300159300001600332500002000348520159000368592002801958650001801986650001702004650001302021650002302034650001302057650000902070650002302079650001502102650002102117650001002138650002502148650001302173650002402186700002002210773010402230856007302334852000902407655001202416IND60524146620221118094607.0160704e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414662DNAL7 a10.1111/vde.123022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBizikova, Petra12aA randomized, double‐blinded crossover trial testing the benefit of two hydrolysed poultry‐based commercial diets for dogs with spontaneous pruritic chicken allergy  ap. 289-e70.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Hydrolysed protein diets are used to diagnose and treat dogs with cutaneous adverse food reactions (CAFR). Little is known about what proportion of dogs hypersensitive to the native protein would react to its hydrolysed form. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical allergenicity of hydrolysed poultry feather (RCU) and chicken liver diets (HZD) in dogs with chicken induced CAFR. METHODS: In this randomized, double‐blinded, crossover trial, ten dogs with chicken induced CAFR were selected after a positive oral challenge to chicken meat and a negative one to corn. Test diets were fed for 14 days separated by a 14 day wash‐out period. Owners rated pruritus daily with a Visual Analog Scale (PVAS). The challenge was ended if a flare in pruritus occurred (i.e. PVAS ≥5/10). RESULTS: The median PVAS scores before feeding RCU and HZD were 0.9 and 1.7, respectively (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.46). Pruritus scores increased significantly after feeding HZD (Friedman's test, P < 0.001) but not after feeding RCU (P = 0.895). None of the dogs fed RCU, but four dogs fed HZD (40%), were withdrawn after a flare in pruritus developed (Fisher's test, P = 0.04). The maximal PVAS score was significantly higher after HZD (median: 4.7) compared to RCU (2.5) (Wilcoxon signed rank test, P = 0.01). One dog in each group was withdrawn due to diarrhoea. CONCLUSIONS: The hydrolysed poultry feather diet did not induce pruritus flares in dogs allergic to chicken in contrast to the hydrolysed chicken liver diet that led to pruritus flares in 40% of these dogs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aallergenicity 3achicken meat 3achickens 3across-over studies 3adiarrhea 3adogs 3aexperimental diets 3ahydrolysis 3ahypersensitivity 3aliver 3aprotein hydrolysates 3apruritus 3aveterinary medicine1 aOlivry, Thierry0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2016 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.289-e70dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.123023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03686naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100003100148245018500179300001600364500001500380520193600395592002802331650001902359650001602378650002202394650001502416650001202431650001202443650002402455650002002479650003702499650001402536650002502550650001202575650001602587650001102603650001702614650001802631650002902649650001202678650002202690650002202712650001202734653001502746700001802761700002202779700002302801700002302824700002302847700001902870700002402889773010202913856008403015852000903099655001203108IND4465007020221116193022.0141111e20120817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446500702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunasekara, R.A.Y.S.Asanka10aLight and transmission electron microscopy of Vibrio campbellii infection in gnotobiotic Artemia franciscana and protection offered by a yeast mutant with elevated cell wall glucan  ap. 337-343.  a2019-12-06  aLuminescent vibrios are amongst the most important pathogens in aquaculture, affecting almost all types of cultured organisms. Vibrio campbellii is one of these most important pathogens. In this study, the effects of feeding mnn9 yeast cell wall mutant and wild type yeast strain were investigated in the digestive tract of brine shrimp nauplii, Artemia franciscana, after experimental infection with V. campbellii (LMG 21363). Gnotobiotic A. franciscana nauplii were fed daily with dead Aeromonas hydrophila LVS3, and with either wild type strain of baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or mutant strain mnn9, of which the cell wall contains elevated chitin and glucan and lower mannose levels. After three days of feeding, some nauplii were challenged with V. campbellii. Mean survival (%), individual length (mm) and total length (mm) at one day and two days after challenge were significantly higher in the group fed mnn9 than in the group fed wild type yeast (81±1.50 and 63±0.49, 1.56±0.07 and 1.13±0.02, 38.21±3.11 and 21.26±0.81 respectively for one day and 50±2.37 and 20±1.41, 2.33±0.01 and 1.24±0.04, 34.97±5.56 and 7.45±1.63 for two days after challenge). Histological examination revealed that the luminal diameter and enterocyte height of both mid- and hindgut were larger in the mnn9-fed group. Colonization of the gut lumen by V. campbellii could be observed by transmission electron microscopy for the group of nauplii fed with wild type yeast. Furthermore, it was observed that V. campbellii caused damage to the gut epithelium including shortening and disappearance of the microvilli, destruction of the apical cell membrane and cell lysis in the nauplii fed wild type yeast. The gut epithelium remained intact in challenged nauplii fed mnn9 yeast. The morphological findings of the present study further substantiate previous studies reporting a protective effect of this yeast cell wall mutant.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3abody length 3aprotective effect 3acell walls 3aglucans 3ahindgut 3aArtemia franciscana 3adigestive tract 3atransmission electron microscopy 3apathogens 3aAeromonas hydrophila 3amannose 3aenterocytes 3achitin 3abakers yeast 3asurvival rate 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3amutants 3aaquaculture feeds 3aVibrio campbellii 3anauplii 0aepithelium1 aDefoirdt, Tom1 aRekecki, Anamaria1 aDecostere, Annemie1 aCornelissen, Maria1 aSorgeloos, Patrick1 aBossier, Peter1 aVan den Broeck, Wim0 tVeterinary microbiology.g2012 Aug. 17, v. 158, no. 3-4 p.337-343dElsevier B.V.x0378-11357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2012.02.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245013900159300001600298500002000314520183900334592002802173650001502201650001502216650002202231650001302253650001702266650001002283650000902293650001302302650002402315650001302339650002402352650001102376700002602387773010402413856007302517852000902590655001202599IND60524147320221118094614.0160704e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414732DNAL7 a10.1111/vde.122972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo, Kimberly L.10aEvaluation of cytology collection techniques and prevalence of Malassezia yeast and bacteria in claw folds of normal and allergic dogs  ap. 279-e67.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Canine bacterial and Malassezia paronychia are common secondary complications of atopic dermatitis and adverse food reactions. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare three different sampling methods for claw fold cytology and to evaluate the numbers of bacteria, Malassezia yeast and inflammatory cells. ANIMALS: Sixty client‐owned dogs were classified into three groups: (A) normal dogs; (B) allergic dogs with no clinical evidence of claw disease (brown staining, erythema, swelling, crusts or exudates); and (C) allergic dogs with clinical paronychia. METHODS: A prospective, blinded, split‐plot study design was used. Claw folds from each dog were sampled using either a toothpick, tape preparation or direct impression smear. Slides were evaluated by two investigators for inflammatory cells, nuclear streaming, debris, corneocytes, yeast, intracellular (IC) cocci, extracellular (EC) cocci, IC rods and EC rods. For each parameter, data were compared between groups and between methods. Inter‐reader agreements were calculated. RESULTS: Group C had significantly higher values of EC cocci and corneocytes than Groups A or B. Although Malassezia organisms were more prevalent in allergic dogs than normal dogs, the counts were not significantly different. There were significantly higher numbers of Malassezia organisms (P = 0.0016) and EC cocci (P = 0.0106) retrieved from samples collected with a toothpick compared to other methods. Tape preparations were associated with significantly more debris and corneocytes (both P < 0.0001) and impression smears with significantly more nuclear streaming (P = 0.0468). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Sample collection using a toothpick optimizes the value of cytological results when sampling allergic dogs with clinical paronychia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMalassezia 3aParonychia 3aatopic dermatitis 3abacteria 3acell biology 3aclaws 3adogs 3aerythema 3aexperimental design 3astaining 3aveterinary medicine 3ayeasts1 aRosenkrantz, Wayne S.0 tVeterinary dermatology.g2016 Aug., v. 27, no. 4 p.279-e67dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0959-44937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/vde.122973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245019700205300001600402506007600418520099100494592002801485506003701513650001901550650001901569650001901588650002401607650001001631650001501641650001401656650001001670650000901680650001601689650001201705650002201717650001601739650001001755653001801765653001001783653001101793653001101804653001401815653001501829700001601844700002101860700002001881700001301901700002201914700002301936700001701959773012701976856008202103852000902185655001202194IND60533536320221207045532.0190329e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.03.0022doi7 aPMC40524642pmcid7 a246138512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Qiaoqing10aSequence and expression analysis of rainbow trout CXCR2, CXCR3a and CXCR3b aids interpretation of lineage-specific conversion, loss and expansion of these receptors during vertebrate evolution  ap. 201-213.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe chemokine receptors CXCR1–3 bind to 11 chemokines (CXCL1–11) that are clustered on the same chromosome in mammals but are largely missing in ray-finned fish. A second CXCR1/2, and a CXCR3a and CXCR3b gene have been cloned in rainbow trout. Analysis of CXCR1–R3 genes in lobe-finned fish, ray-finned fish and tetrapod genomes revealed that the teleostomian ancestor likely possessed loci containing both CXCR1 and CXCR2, and CXCR3a and CXCR3b. Based on this synteny analysis the first trout CXCR1/2 gene was renamed CXCR1, and the new gene CXCR2. The CXCR1/R2 locus was shown to have further expanded in ray-finned fish. In relation to CXCR3, mammals appear to have lost CXCR3b and birds both CXCR3a and CXCR3b during evolution. Trout CXCR1–R3 have distinct tissue expression patterns and are differentially modulated by PAMPs, proinflammatory cytokines and infections. They are highly expressed in macrophages and neutrophils, with CXCR1 and CXCR2 also expressed in B-cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCXCR1 receptor 3aCXCR2 receptor 3aCXCR3 receptor 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3abirds 3achemokines 3aevolution 3agenes 3aloci 3amacrophages 3amammals 3amolecular cloning 3aneutrophils 3atrout 0aRainbow trout 0aCXCR2 0aCXCR3a 0aCXCR3b 0aEvolution 0aExpression1 aLi, Ronggai1 aMonte, Milena M.1 aJiang, Yousheng1 aNie, Pin1 aHolland, Jason W.1 aSecombes, Chris J.1 aWang, Tiehui0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 Aug., v. 45, no. 2 p.201-213dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.03.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02469naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245015900166300001600325520104200341592002801383650001001411650001401421650001001435650001201445650001701457650001801474650001601492650001401508650001301522650003601535650001601571653001801587653001401605653003601619653002101655653002201676700001701698700001301715700001901728700001601747700001801763773012701781856008201908852000901990655001201999IND60533536620221119063830.0190329e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shengnan10aStructural and functional characterization of a TGFβ molecule from amphioxus reveals an ancient origin of both immune-enhancing and -inhibitory functions  ap. 219-226.  aTransforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) is a pleiotropic cytokine with important roles in mediating inflammatory response. TGFβ has been shown to be widely present in invertebrates, but little is known about its functions in immune and inflammatory responses. Moreover, structural and functional insights into TGFβ molecules in invertebrates remain completely lacking. Here we demonstrate the presence of a single TGFβ-like gene in the amphioxus Branchiostoma japonicum, Bjtgfβ, which represents the archetype of vertebrate TGFβ proteins, and displays a higher expression in the hind-gut, hepatic caecum, ovary, and gill. We also show that amphioxus TGFβ exerts both enhancing and suppressing effects on the migration of macrophages like RAW264.7, and the motif WSTD is important for TGFβ in inducing or inhibiting the migration of macrophages. Altogether, these data suggest that amphioxus TGFβ is phylogenetically and functionally similar to vertebrate TGFβ, suggesting an ancient origin of bipolar function of TGFβ proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3acecum 3acytokines 3agenes 3ahindgut 3ainflammation 3ainvertebrates 3amacrophages 3aphylogeny 3aproteins 3atransforming growth factor beta 3avertebrates 0aProtochordate 0aAmphioxus 0aTransforming growth factor beta 0aBipolar property 0aImmune regulation1 aLi, Fengzhen1 aHu, Lili1 aLiu, Shousheng1 aLi, Hongyan1 aZhang, Shicui0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 Aug., v. 45, no. 2 p.219-226dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01982naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245005800209300001400267506007600281520062200357592002800979506003701007650001801044650001601062650001801078650002501096650002001121650001401141650001601155650001201171653001401183653002901197653002001226653001801246653001601264700002101280700001801301773012601319856008201445852000901527655001201536IND60533537120221207062824.0190329e201409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.03.0102doi7 aPMC41588522pmcid7 a246855112pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLewis, Kanako L.10aPerspectives on antigen presenting cells in zebrafish  ap. 63-73.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAntigen presentation is a critical step in the activation of naïve T lymphocytes.

The best way to reduce post‐fire runoff is the rapid application of mulch: a protective cover of straw, needles, wood‐based material, or other ground cover. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of forest residue mulching for reducing post‐fire runoff across spatial scales on a logged and burnt eucalypt hillslope. Additionally, we assessed the underlying processes involved in the hydrologic responses of burnt areas in central Portugal during the first 2 years after a wildfire, with special focus on soil moisture, soil water repellency, and rainfall. Forest residue mulch reduced post‐fire runoff by 50% in both micro‐plots (0·25 m²) and hillslope scale silt fence plots (100 m²) during the first year after the wildfire. Runoff in the micro‐plots was tenfold higher than the larger plots, regardless of mulching. The main controlling factors for the volume of runoff were rainfall amount (direct correlation) and soil moisture (inverse correlation). Soil water repellency and soil moisture were not affected by the mulch but played a role in the hydrologic response. In contrast, there was no decrease in runoff rate within the first two post‐fire years. Forest residue mulching can be an effective post‐fire treatment for reducing runoff rates, and the consistent decrease in runoff rates between the two spatial scales suggests that the scaling of runoff was not affected by the mulch.

In this work, we use a chronosequence approach to investigate the long‐term effects of wildfires on the surface and topsoil (0–30 cm) of volcanic soils in two different ecosystems: the Canary pine forest (dry and fire‐adapted) and the laurel forest or monteverde (subhumid and not prone to fire). Redundancy analysis and partial Kendall's correlation were used to analyse the relationship between soil characteristics and the wildfire chronosequences, controlling most significant environmental variables. No long‐term effects of fire were observed on the pine forest topsoil, but strongly persistent erosion‐related features were found on the soil surface, suggesting that chronic erosion might occur as a result of increased wildfire frequency. The soils of the monteverde were affected over the long term by severe losses of organic matter including highly humified and complexed forms. Organic losses appeared to be mainly due to erosion and associated with decreases in water‐holding capacity and in the levels of organo‐complexed metals and bioavailable nutrients such as boron or zinc. Fire also led to decreased bioavailability of some nutrients (e.g. phosphorus) and increased release of other elements (e.g. silicon), most likely by exposing surfaces of short‐range‐order minerals. Better management is needed to reduce irreversible effects of severe wildfires on these soils.

The chemical compositions of fifteen extracts of six Lippia species were investigated comparatively by HPLC–PDA. To avoid data replication of previous works on this genus, Lippia lupulina Cham. root ethanol extract was selected for isolation procedures based on Principal Component Analyses (PCA) of such data. Seven compounds previously unreported in this genus were isolated from this extract (a triterpene, two furanonaphtoquinones, a furanochromone, an isoflavone, a stilbene and an iridoid). The activities of extracts, fractions and pure compounds towards Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida parapsilosis and Cryptococcus neoformans were investigated. Two fractions from the extract of Lippia salviaefolia leaves showed marked inhibition of fungal growth, in addition to verbascoside and asebogenin, which showed MICs lower than 15.6μg/ml and may be promising leads for the development of new antifungal agents, especially against C. neoformans.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida albicans 3aCandida krusei 3aCandida parapsilosis 3aCryptococcus neoformans 3aLippia 3aantifungal agents 3abeverages 3achemical composition 3aethanol 3aleaves 3amicrobial growth 3aprincipal component analysis 3aroots 2aAntifungal Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aFungixdrug effects 2aLippiaxchemistry 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 3aBrazil 0aBrazil1 aGullo, Fernanda Patrícia1 aNapolitano, Assunta1 aCarneiro, Renato Lajarim1 aMendes-Giannini, Maria José Soares1 aFusco-Almeida, Ana Marisa1 aPiacente, Sonia1 aPizza, Cosimo1 aSilva, Dulce Helena Siqueira0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Dec. 1, v. 135, no. 3 p.2086-2094dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.06.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02668naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100003300155245017300188300001400361520118600375592002801561650002001589650001701609650001701626650002201643650001001665650001701675650001401692650001801706650001101724650001701735650001301752653001701765653001201782653002601794653001501820653001801835653001701853653001701870653001701887653001701904700002201921700005501943773008901998856009002087852000902177655001202186IND60642904620221123024753.0190529e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.04.2032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOrtiz-Cañavate, Bruno Kenji10aFungicides at environmentally relevant concentrations can promote the proliferation of toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria by inhibiting natural fungal parasite epidemics  ap. 18-21.  aFungal parasites of the phylum Chytridiomycota (chytrids) are increasingly recognized as potent control agents of phytoplankton, including toxic bloom-forming cyanobacteria. We experimentally tested whether agricultural fungicides can interfere with natural epidemics caused by parasitic chytrid fungi and thereby favor cyanobacterial bloom formation. Specifically, we exposed the toxic bloom-forming cyanobacterium Planktothrix and its chytrid parasite Rhizophydium megarrhizum to different concentrations of the widely used agricultural fungicides tebuconazole and azoxystrobin, as well as the medical fungicide itraconazole (the latter was included to test its potential to suppress infection in vitro). Environmentally relevant concentrations of tebuconazole (20–200 μg/L) and azoxystrobin (1–30 μg/L) significantly decreased infection prevalence over a timespan of seven days, while not affecting the growth of uninfected cyanobacteria. Itraconazole suppressed infection completely. Our findings demonstrate that agricultural fungicide run-off has the potential to inhibit natural chytrid epidemics and, thereby, to promote the proliferation of toxic cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChytridiomycota 3aPlanktothrix 3aazoxystrobin 3adisease outbreaks 3afungi 3aitraconazole 3aparasites 3aphytoplankton 3arunoff 3atebuconazole 3atoxicity 0aAzoxystrobin 0aChytrid 0aCyanobacterial blooms 0aFungicides 0aHost-parasite 0aItraconazole 0aPlanktothrix 0aRhizophydium 0aTebuconazole1 aWolinska, Justyna1 aAgha, Ramsy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6109-46240 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug., v. 229 p.18-21dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.04.2033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002200138245013400160300001800294500002000312520175600332592002802088650001502116650002402131650002202155650001902177650001602196650001202212650000902224650002402233650001102257650001402268650000902282650001402291651001302305700002102318700002102339773011402360856007202474852000902546655001202555IND60524149520221118094545.0160704e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052414952DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.23652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalvar, Maruxa C.10aRunoff and Inter‐Rill Erosion Affected by Wildfire and Pre‐Fire Ploughing in Eucalypt Plantations of North‐Central Portugal  ap. 1366-1378.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIncreases in post‐fire runoff and erosion have been reported worldwide, but little is known about the combined effect of wildfires and pre‐existent ploughing operations. A previous study using simulated rainfall found a similar runoff for an unploughed and a pre‐fire ploughed site, but clearly showed lower erosion for the pre‐fire ploughed site. This study measured post‐fire runoff and erosion at the same two sites, with the same experimental design, but under natural rainfall conditions. Four micro‐plots were installed on each of two eucalypt stands, one of which was rip‐ploughed 20 years before the fire. The rainfall amount was 35% lower during the first post‐fire year than during the second, but the runoff coefficient was approximately 20% for both years and sites. The sediment losses were significantly higher on the unploughed than on the pre‐fire ploughed site during the first year (378 vs. 112 g m⁻² y⁻¹) and especially during the second year (552 vs. 67 g m⁻² y⁻¹). Half of the eroded sediments consisted of organic matter. On the unploughed site, both the natural and the extreme‐intensity simulated rainfall produced specific sediment losses of 0·35 gm⁻² mm⁻¹ rain, whereas the high‐intensity simulated rainfall produced approximately half (0·16 g m⁻² mm⁻¹ rain). At the pre‐fire ploughed site, the natural, high, and extreme‐intensity simulated rainfall produced similarly low‐specific sediment losses (0·07 g m⁻² mm⁻¹ rain). These low rates and the absence of differences between methodologies and simulated intensities suggested a depletion of soil stocks 20 years after the rip‐ploughing.

Viral illnesses have and will continue to shape human history: from smallpox, to influenza, to HIV, and beyond. Animal models of human viral illnesses are needed in order to generate safe and effective antiviral medicines, adjuvant therapies, and vaccines. These animal models must support the replication of human viruses, recapitulate aspects of human viral illnesses, and respond with conserved immune signaling cascades. The zebrafish is perhaps the simplest, most commonly used laboratory model organism in which innate and/or adaptive immunity can be studied. Herein, we will discuss the current zebrafish models of human viral illnesses and the insights they have provided. We will highlight advantages of early life stage zebrafish and the importance of innate immunity in human viral illnesses. We will also discuss viral characteristics to consider before infecting zebrafish with human viruses as well as predict other human viruses that may be able to infect zebrafish.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDanio rerio 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 3aVariola virus 3aadaptive immunity 3aadjuvants 3aanimal models 3adevelopmental stages 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3ainfluenza 3ainnate immunity 3avaccines 3avertebrate viruses 3aviruses 0aHSV-1 0aCHIKV 0aIAV 0aHCV 0a(q)PCR 0aISH 0aIHC 0aCNS 0aTCID50 0aEID50 0aMDCK 0aIFN 0aHpi/dpi 0aHpf/dpf 0aMAVS 0aCRFB1/CRFB2 0aPRR 0aPHB 0aPFU 0aNS1-GFP 0ampx 0ampeg1 0afli1 0amxa 0aImmunity 0aZebrafish 0aVirus 0aHuman 0aInfection1 aSullivan, Con1 aKim, Carol H.0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 Sept., v. 46, no. 1 p.84-95dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.03.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001300155245013200168300001600300520155300316592002801869650001301897650002201910650001501932650001601947650001501963650001401978650001301992650001902005650001402024650001402038650000702052650001502059650002202074650001302096650002102109653004102130653002202171653001902193653003702212653002802249700001502277700001802292700005702310700002302367700001502390773009102405856009002496852000902586655001202595IND60642905420221120100644.0190529e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.04.2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Xin10aMechanism of the hybrid ozonation-coagulation (HOC) process: Comparison of preformed Al13 polymer and in situ formed Al species  ap. 262-272.  aBecause of the influence of hydrolysed species from Al-based coagulants on coagulation performance, the performance and mechanism of the developed hybrid ozonation-coagulation (HOC) process using AlCl3·6H2O and preformed Al13 as coagulants were investigated in this study, in which ozonation and coagulation occurred simultaneously within a single unit. It was found that the HOC process exhibited higher organic matter removal performance compared with coagulation and the pre-ozonation-coagulation process. It was found that the high ibuprofen (IBP) removal efficiency in the HOC process was mainly attributed to OH oxidation promoted by in situ formed hydrolysed aluminium species from AlCl3·6H2O and preformed Al13. Furthermore, the surface hydroxyl groups were determined to be the active reaction sites for the HOC process. Due to the higher proportion of surface hydroxyl groups for Al13, the HOC process with preformed Al13 as coagulants (Al13-HOC) exhibited a higher removal performance than that with AlCl3·6H2O as the coagulant (AlCl3-HOC). It was revealed that most of the generated O2− in the Al13-HOC was adsorbed on the surface of Al13 at different pH values, while a considerably lower proportion of adsorbed O2− was observed on the surface of in situ formed Al species from AlCl3·6H2O. Nevertheless, low proportions of adsorbed OH were found on the surfaces of both preformed Al13 and in situ formed Al species, indicating that the OH oxidation for the removal of organic pollutants occurred primarily in the aqueous phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum chloride 3acoagulants 3acoagulation 3ahydrolysis 3aibuprofen 3amoieties 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3apH 3apollutants 3apollution control 3apolymers 3asuperoxide anion 0aHybrid ozonation-coagulation process 0aHydroxyl radicals 0aPreformed Al13 0ain situ formed aluminium species 0aSurface hydroxyl groups1 aWang, Yong1 aZhang, Weijie1 aJin, Pengkang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6754-46141 aWang, Xiaochang C.1 aWen, Lijie0 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug., v. 229 p.262-272dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.04.2253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245016600167300001600333500001500349520099500364592002801359650002201387650002501409650002201434650002501456650001601481650001601497650001901513650001001532650002201542650001201564650002501576650000901601650001201610650001601622653000701638653006201645653002201707653001001729653001401739700001701753700001801770700001701788700001301805700002301818700002101841773012701862856008201989852000902071655001202080IND60533539020221119065802.0190329e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053353902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.04.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Young-Mao10aFunctional analysis of an orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) interferon gene and characterisation of its expression in response to nodavirus infection  ap. 117-128.  a2019-12-06  aWe cloned and sequenced 2C I-IFN, a two-cysteine containing type I interferon (I-IFN) gene, in orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides). The cDNA has 769 base pairs, the protein has 172 amino acids, and the predicted signal peptide has 18 amino acids with two cysteines. This gene is similar to I-FNs from sea bass and other teleosts. 2C I-IFN has 5 exons and 4 introns, also similar to other teleost I-IFNs. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis indicated that expression is predominantly membrane-localized in healthy grouper, but has a zonal distribution in nodavirus-infected grouper. Grouper infected with nodavirus had elevated levels of 2C I-IFN at 72h and Mx at days 6–7. Recombinant 2C I-IFN activated grouper Mx, leading to upregulated antiviral activity. The grouper Mx promoter was highly induced after treatment with recombinant 2C I-IFN. The present results suggest that expression of grouper 2C I-IFN may participate in the immunologic barrier function against nodavirus.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aantiviral properties 3acomplementary DNA 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aNodaviridae 3aamino acids 3asignal peptide 3aexons 3amolecular cloning 3agrouper 3aEpinephelus coioides 3abass 3aintrons 3ainterferons 0aMx 0aTwo-cysteine containing type I interferon (2C I-IFN) gene 0aAntiviral protein 0agenes 0aNodavirus1 aKuo, Cham-En1 aChen, Guan-Ru1 aKao, Yu-Ting1 aZou, Jun1 aSecombes, Chris J.1 aChen, Tzong-Yueh0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 Oct., v. 46, no. 2 p.117-128dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03068naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002100139245009000160300001600250500002000266520212300286592002802409650001202437650001502449650001102464650001402475650001202489650001302501651001402514700001902528773011302547856007302660852000902733655001202742IND60524150620221119100029.0160704e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052415062DNAL7 a10.1111/geb.124552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCardillo, Marcel10aAnalysing patterns of spatial and niche overlap among species at multiple resolutions  ap. 951-963.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Analyses of spatial overlap in species distributions are frequently used to test a range of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses, from the role of competition in community assembly to the geography of speciation. Most studies quantify overlap at one spatial resolution. Here we explore the effects of measuring spatial and niche overlap patterns for the same clade (Banksia) at multiple resolutions. LOCATION: Australia. METHODS: We quantify overlap among species using broad overlap of species range polygons, proximity of occurrence points and co‐occurrence within small survey plots. We compare overlap patterns with null models using age–range correlations and the frequency of sympatric sister species. We then use similar methods to examine patterns of overlap in environmental niche dimensions. RESULTS: Banksia species show a wide range of overlap values based on range polygons and point proximities, but very low levels of co‐occurrence at the local scale. Intercepts of age–range correlations point to higher levels of overlap among recently diverged species than expected. However, comparing the frequency of sympatric sister species with an evolutionary null model supports a prevailing allopatric mode of speciation. In many cases, niche overlap between species exceeds that expected from phylogenetic relatedness or spatial overlap alone. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of broad geographical overlap among Banksia species support a predominantly allopatric mode of speciation, combined with post‐speciation range drift. There is more evidence for niche conservatism than for rapid niche divergence among closely related species. This pattern is consistent with broad‐scale geomorphic and landscape complexity as a driver of plant speciation in south‐west Australia. It is less consistent with finer‐scale mechanisms of species divergence such as fire mosaics, or with ecological divergence in sympatry. Analysis of species overlap patterns at different resolutions is a useful approach for revealing the multiple ecological and historical factors that influence species distributions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBanksia 3alandscapes 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3asurveys 3asympatry 3aAustralia1 aL.

Although many genes have been identified as being involved in the process, the molecular mechanisms of pollen tube growth remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified that the Arabidopsis Transmembrane Protein 18 (AtTMEM18) gene played important roles in pollen tube growth. The AtTMEM18 shares a high similarity with the Transmembrane 18 proteins (TMEM18s) that are conserved in most eukaryotes and may play important roles in obesity in humans. Mutation in the AtTMEM18 by a Ds insertion caused abnormal callose deposition in the pollen grains and had a significant impact on pollen germination and pollen tube growth. AtTMEM18 is expressed in pollen grains, pollen tubes, root tips and other vegetative tissues. The pollen‐rescued assays showed that the mutation in AtTMEM18 also caused defects in roots, stems, leaves and transmitting tracts. AtTMEM18‐GFP was located around the nuclei. Genetic assays demonstrated that the localization of AtTMEM18 around the nuclei in the generative cells of pollen grains was essential for the male fertility. Furthermore, expression of the rice TMEM18‐homologous protein (OsTMEM18) driven by LAT52 promoter could recover the fertility of the Arabidopsis attmem18 mutant. These results suggested that the TMEM18 is important for plant growth in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3acallose 3aembryo sac 3aeukaryotic cells 3afemales 3agametophytes 3agenes 3agerm cells 3ahumans 3aleaves 3amale fertility 3amales 3amutants 3amutation 3aobesity 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3arice 3aroot tips 3astems 3atissues 3atransmembrane proteins 3avegetative growth1 aYang, Ke‐Zhen1 aMa, Zhao‐Xia1 aChen, Li‐Qun1 aZhang, Xue‐Qin1 aBai, Jin‐Rong1 aYe, De0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2016 July, v. 58, no. 7 p.679-692dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx1672-90727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.124593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03538naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245013000174300001600304520190200320592002802222650001502250650001802265650001902283650001402302650002202316650002202338650001302360650002502373650001402398650001002412650000702422650002302429650001502452650002202467650002202489650002602511653002202537653001902559653001002578653001202588653001502600653000902615700001702624700001502641700001802656700001802674700001702692700001802709700005402727773009202781856009002873852000902963655001202972IND60642907120221118005821.0190801e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeo, Changdong10aElimination efficiency of organic UV filters during ozonation and UV/H2O2 treatment of drinking water and wastewater effluent  ap. 248-257.  aThe efficiency of elimination of organic UV filters by ozonation and UV254nm/H2O2 processes was assessed and predicted in simulated treatments of sewage-impaired drinking water and wastewater effluent in bench-scale experiments. Second-order rate constants (k) for the reactions of the eight UV filters with ozone and OH were determined by quantum chemical calculations and competition kinetics methods, respectively. The UV filters containing phenolic (ethylhexyl-salicylate, homosalate, and benzophenone-3) and olefinic moieties (4-methylbenzylidene-camphor, benzyl-cinnamate, and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate) showed high ozone reactivity (k ≥ 8 × 104 M−1s−1 at pH 7), while those without such electron-rich moieties (isoamyl-benzoate and benzophenone) were ozone-refractory. All the UV filters showed high OH reactivity (k ≥ 6.2 × 109 M−1s−1). In concordance with the rate constant information, the phenolic and olefinic UV filters were efficiently eliminated by ozone treatment, requiring specific ozone doses of <0.5 mgO3/mgDOC for ∼100% elimination. The UV filters were eliminated by ≤ 38% at a UV fluence of 1500 mJ/cm2 in the UV254nm-only treatment. Rapid photoisomerisation between the E and Z geometric isomers was observed for the olefinic UV filter, benzyl-cinnamate. The addition of H2O2 (10 mg/L) greatly enhanced the elimination of all UV filters, indicating that OH was the main contributor to their elimination in the UV254nm/H2O2 treatment. A chemical kinetics approach developed previously for ozonation and UV/H2O2 processes was shown to predict the elimination of the UV filters in the tested water matrices reasonably well, demonstrating that the chemical kinetics method can be used for a priori prediction of micropollutant elimination in oxidative treatment processes for potable reuse of municipal wastewater effluents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUV filters 3abenzophenones 3adrinking water 3aeffluents 3ageometric isomers 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amoieties 3amunicipal wastewater 3aozonation 3aozone 3apH 3aphotoisomerization 3aprediction 3aquantum mechanics 3areaction kinetics 3aultraviolet radiation 0aOrganic UV filter 0aMicropollutant 0aOzone 0aUV/H2O2 0aOH radical 0aQSAR1 aShin, Jaedon1 aLee, Minju1 aLee, Woongbae1 aYoom, Hoonsik1 aSon, Heejong1 aJang, Seongho1 aLee, Yunho1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5923-48970 tChemosphere.g2019 Sept., v. 230 p.248-257dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03584naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245014600174300001600320520161800336592002801954650002001982650001402002650001002016650002302026650001902049650001002068650002302078650001402101650001302115650001302128650001702141650002902158650001202187650000802199650000902207650001502216650002602231650001202257650002802269650002402297650001902321650001802340650002002358650001502378653001902393653002002412653003302432653002402465653002002489700005402509700001802563700001402581700001602595700001302611700002002624700001802644700001902662700001202681700001402693773009202707856009002799852000902889655001202898IND60642907220221118005825.0190801e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Pengfei10aLow dose chlorothalonil impairs mouse spermatogenesis through the intertwining of Estrogen Receptor Pathways with histone and DNA methylation  ap. 384-395.  aRecently, environment contaminants including pesticides, fungicides, mycotoxin and others chemicals have been suggested to be responsible for the decline in the human spermatozoa quality especially motility and the increase in infertility rate. Chlorothalonil is used widely for protection of vegetables and crops because it is a broad spectrum fungicide. It has been reported that chronic occupational exposure to fungicides was associated with poor spermatozoa morphology in young men. The pubertal period is very important for the male reproductive system development due to spermatogonial cell proliferation, the expansion of meiotic and haploid germ cells. Although some investigations have studied the male reproductive toxicity of chlorothalonil, almost no studies focused on spermatogenesis. The aim of our current investigation was to explore the impacts of chlorothalonil on spermatogenesis and the underlying mechanisms. It demonstrates: i) chlorothalonil decreased boar spermatozoa motility in vitro and increased the cell apoptosis; ii) chlorothalonil inhibited mouse spermatogenesis in vivo; iii) chlorothalonil disturbed spermatogenesis through the disruption of estrogen receptor signalling; iv) chlorothalonil disrupted histone methylation and DNA methylation which might be through estrogen signalling pathways. Due to the over use or incorrect use, chlorothalonil might cause serious problems to human health, especially spermatogenesis. Therefore we strongly recommend that greater attention should be paid to this fungicide to minimise its impact on human health especially spermatogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA methylation 3aapoptosis 3aboars 3acell proliferation 3achlorothalonil 3acrops 3aestrogen receptors 3aestrogens 3ahaploidy 3ahistones 3ahuman health 3amale reproductive system 3ameiosis 3amen 3amice 3amycotoxins 3aoccupational exposure 3apuberty 3areproductive toxicology 3asignal transduction 3asperm motility 3asperm quality 3aspermatogenesis 3avegetables 0aChlorothalonil 0aSpermatogenesis 0aEstrogen receptor signalling 0aHistone methylation 0aDNA methylation1 aZhao, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3423-27181 aZhang, Hongfu1 aLiu, Jing1 aFeng, Yanni1 aYinshen,1 aCheng, Shunfeng1 aSun, Xiaofeng1 aMin, Lingjiang1 aLi, Lan1 aShen, Wei0 tChemosphere.g2019 Sept., v. 230 p.384-395dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245018000162300001600342520230300358592002802661650002502689650002502714650001902739650001602758650001102774650001202785650001702797650002002814650001502834650002402849650001002873650001002883650001302893650004302906650001202949650005202961650001103013650001203024650001903036653002403055653002303079653001103102653002303113700001503136700001603151700001603167700001603183700001403199700001703213773012703230856008203357852000903439655001203448IND60533541120221119062028.0190329e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053354112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dci.2014.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Chen10aExpression pattern of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in different organs and effects of lipopolysaccharide on the expression of TLR 2 and 4 in reproductive organs of female rabbit  ap. 341-348.  aToll-like receptors (TLRs) are vital for innate immunity, and they were expressed in various immune cells, tissues and organs. Moreover, TLRs specific expression pattern in different cells, tissue and organs have been confirmed to have correlation with the ability to resistance to pathogenic challenges. The present study aimed to determine the expression profiles and levels of TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 in the lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary, oviduct and hypothalamus of female rabbits, and whether the expression level of TLR2 and 4 in the ovary, oviduct, uterine horn and body, and cervix were affected by lipopolyasaccharide (LPS). The tissues of the lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary, oviduct and hypothalamus were collected from four rabbits which didn’t be treated as 0h. 16 rabbits in LPS group were injected with LPS (according to 0.5mg/kg body weight) and 16 rabbits in control group were injected with saline (LPS carrier), hereafter the tissues of the uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary and oviduct from 32 rabbits were collected after 1.5, 3, 6, and 12h (n=4 each group) postinjection. The expression profiles of TLRs were analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and expression level of TLRs were examined using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results shown: TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 were expressed in lung, trachea, intestine, stomach, liver, spleen, uterine horn and body, cervix, ovary, oviduct and hypothalamus of female rabbits, but their expression level had great difference in the same organs, and each TLR has different expression level in the different organs. After LPS-stimulation, the expression of TLR2 in the uterine body and horn was significantly higher than that in control group by 3h and 12h of postinjection (P<0.05) respectively. The expression of TLR4 in ovary and uterine body was significantly higher than that in control group by 3 and 12h of postinjection (P<0.05), and the expression of TLR4 in uterine body was greater than that in control by 3h postinjection (P<0.05). The results suggested LPS upregulated the expression of TLR2 and 4 in uterine body and horn, and the expression of TLR4 in ovary.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aToll-like receptor 4 3aanimal ovaries 3abody weight 3acervix 3afemales 3ahypothalamus 3ainnate immunity 3aintestines 3alipopolysaccharides 3aliver 3alungs 3aoviducts 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arabbits 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3astomach 3auterine tissue 0aToll-like receptors 0aExpression pattern 0aRabbit 0aLipopolysaccharide1 aZibiao, He1 aMing, Zhang1 aShiyi, Chen1 aRuixia, Lan1 aJie, Wang1 aSongJia, Lai0 tDevelopmental and comparative immunology.g2014 Oct., v. 46, no. 2 p.341-348dElsevier LtdwJournal:11789x0145-305X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dci.2014.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03161naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002400155245006100179300001600240520173900256592002801995650001502023650001802038650001602056650001702072650000902089650001402098650001502112650001202127650001702139650001702156653002302173653005402196653004202250653004002292653003902332653003602371700007702407700001802484700002302502773009102525856009002616852000902706655001202715IND60642907620221120033921.0190529e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRydzyński, Dariusz10aInvestigation of chlorophyll degradation by tetracycline  ap. 409-417.  aAntibiotics represent a novel type of environment pollutants which modify chlorophyll content in plants. Spectroscopic methods were employed to investigate the effect of tetracycline on chlorophyll degradation. Changes in absorbance and fluorescence demonstrated that tetracycline reaction with chlorophyll results in the formation of pheophytin, which was confirmed by new bands typical of pheophytin which appeared in the absorbance spectrum. The rate of pheophytin formation depended on ratio tetracycline to chlorophyll concentration in solution. In solutions with chlorophyll concentration of C = 1 × 10−5 M and tetracycline concentrations of C = 1 × 10−3 M and C = 1 × 10−2 M, pheophytin was formed after 28 h and 25 min, respectively. The obtained lifetime for pheophytin formed during chlorophyll reaction - with tetracycline hydrochloride was τ = 5.71 ± 0.02 ns and its value coincides, within the error limits, with the value obtained for pure pheophytin purchased from ChromaDex. The experiment demonstrated two mechanisms of chlorophyll degradation to pheophytin by tetracycline hydrochloride, i.e. 1) loss of Mg2+ ions from the chlorophyll molecule as a result of the presence of H+ ions in solution (i.e. as a result of medium acidification), and 2) removal of Mg2+ ions directly from chlorophyll by tetracycline which binds Mg2+ ions from the chlorophyll.We demonstrated that magnesium occurring in low concentrations attached to a tetracycline molecule in the BCD ring, and that the second ion of Mg2+ may attach to the A ring of tetracycline at higher Mg2+ concentrations. Two fluorescence bands appeared which indicated such magnesium attachments indeed occurred.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aacidification 3achlorophyll 3afluorescence 3aions 3amagnesium 3apollutants 3aprotons 3aspectroscopy 3atetracycline 0aAbsorption spectra 0aStationary and time-resolved fluorescence spectra 0aChlorophyll degradation to pheophytin 0aRemoving magnesium from chlorophyll 0aAttachment of Mg2+ to tetracycline 0aRate of chlorophyll degradation1 aPiotrowicz-Cieślak, Agnieszka I.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8356-63731 aGrajek, Hanna1 aWasilewski, Janusz0 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug., v. 229 p.409-417dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245012900171300001600300520134200316592002801658650001001686650001201696650001101708650001801719650002001737650001201757650001801769650001901787650001501806650001901821650001901840650001501859650001901874650002101893650001401914650001101928653001201939653003901951653001801990653001902008700001402027700005602041700002602097700001902123773009102142856009002233852000902323655001202332IND60642907820221120034024.0190529e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064290782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Ting10aBi4O5I2/nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon (NHC) composites with tremella-like structure for high photocatalytic performance  ap. 426-433.  aBiOI is a visible photocatalyst towards organic pollutant. In this work, biomass waste (withered typha grass) was used to fabricate nitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon (NHC) by an one-step carbonization route. Then NHC provided a good carrier to load the BiOI semiconductor materials by a green simple co-precipitation method, after adding NaOH solution, the irregular microspheres BiOI/NHC was gradually etched by OH− to form the tremella-like Bi4O5I2/NHC. The well-defined tremella-like Bi4O5I2/NHC invested adequate interface and high particular surface range (SBET: 66 m2 g−1), which is higher than pure BiOI (22 m2 g−1) and Bi4O5I2 (17 m2 g−1). Multiple synergistic effects, such as high SBET can give more dynamic destinations, the special tremella-like structure can assimilate more reflected occurrence light of other nanosheets, low I content can increase the conduction/valence band gap of semiconductor materials and NHC can act as an electron acceptor, making as-prepared Bi4O5I2/NHC composite ideal candidates for photocatalysis. The degradation rate of Bi4O5I2/NHC reaches up to 87.4% of methyl orange in 2 h, which is about 2 times higher than BiOI and Bi4O5I2. Therefore, this work gives a technique to link NHC derived from biomass waste to Bi4O5I2 with highly-efficiency photocatalytic performance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTypha 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acoprecipitation 3agrasses 3amethyl orange 3amicroparticles 3ananosheets 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3apollutants 3asemiconductors 3asodium hydroxide 3asynergism 3awastes 0aBi4O5I2 0aNitrogen-doped hierarchical carbon 0aTremella-like 0aPhotocatalysis1 aJin, Jing1 aHou, Jianhua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1525-45511 aṬāhir, Muḥammad,1 aIdrees, Faryal0 tChemosphere.g2019 Aug., v. 229 p.426-433dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.05.0433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03067naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245007500170520190500245592002802150650003002178650001502208650001102223650001202234650001102246650001202257650002802269651001002297653002402307653002002331653002902351653002402380653002002404653001102424700001402435700001302449700001702462773011602479856005302595852000902648655001202657IND60794912720221120150313.0220929e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1162542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuan, Xinjian10aWater ecology emergy analytic system construction and health diagnosis  aThe water competitions between human and nature pose a health problem of the water ecosystem. The relationship and health level of a water ecosystem, which are an important basis, are explored to formulate the sustainable development strategy of human society and natural ecology. The study proposes a new water ecology emergy (WEE) analytic system that comprises five main components: input module, storage module, output module, addition module, and consumption module. Based on the emergy theory, we have realized the quantification of ecological-economic flow inside and outside each module and converted each energy to emergy. Given this, the WEE analytic system health diagnosis indicators are proposed, including emergy interaction ratio, economic-social benefit ratio, ecological-environmental benefit ratio, water resource value, and sustainable development indicator. The comprehensive diagnosis method is the minimum information entropy (MIE) combination weighting method based on entropy and variation coefficient, which can comprehensively diagnose the health level of the system. Taking Luoyang, China as an example, the results show that for the WEE analytic system, the input module, output module, storage module, and consumption module were deteriorating, and only the addition module had a good trend. The health diagnosis results also show that the health level decreased year by year in the initial stage (2010–2015) and fluctuated and increased in the later stage (2015–2019). The main reason for the improvement of the system health level is the increase in the ecological-environmental benefit ratio. Harmonious development of human society and natural ecology, which consider the dual objectives of ecological-environmental protection and economic-social development, realize the benign operation of the water ecosystem and the sustainable utilization of water resources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aecosystems 3aemergy 3aentropy 3ahumans 3asociety 3asustainable development 3aChina 0aEmergy interactions 0aEconomic-social 0aEcological-environmental 0aEcological-economic 0aEmergy analysis 0aHealth1 aFu, Yuwen1 aMeng, Yu1 aYan, Denghua0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 270 p.116254-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.116254  aDNAL 7aarticle04010naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245017300171506010400344506007600448520217600524592002802700506003702728650002302765650003002788650001602818650001202834650001402846650001202860650002202872650002202894650001502916650003102931650001902962650001502981650001402996650001303010650001603023650001703039653001903056653002703075653001403102653001703116653002303133653001203156700001903168700002103187700001703208700001903225773011603244856008703360852000903447655001203456IND60794913220221207113931.0221004e20221015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1162602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGüleç, Fatih12aA comprehensive comparative study on the energy application of chars produced from different biomass feedstocks via hydrothermal conversion, pyrolysis, and torrefaction  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aUnderstanding the suitability of different conversion technologies for different types of biomass feedstocks is crucial in delivering the full valorisation of different types of biomasses. This is novel research which presents an extensive comparative study on how three different thermal conversion technologies (torrefaction, pyrolysis, and semi-continuous hydrothermal conversion) and process interdependencies are influenced by different feedstocks (Rapeseed (RS), Whitewood (WW), Seaweed Laminaria digitata (LD))) for the optimisation of char (hydrochar/biochar) formation and their associated bioenergy applications. A wide range of processing conditions was analysed to optimise char formation and potential applications of these chars in energy production were extensively investigated. Based on the evaluation of char structures, hydrothermal conversion could be an applicable method for char production from WW and RS. The char yield of WW is in the range of 30–50 wt% at the early stage of hydrothermal carbonisation (HTC, 235 °C). Increasing temperature (>265 °C) decreased char yield but produced a higher HHV char (∼30 kJ/g). Approximately 90 wt% of LD dissolved into the water at low temperatures (<200 °C) during hydrothermal conversion, leaving small amounts of char with a significant ash content (∼50 wt%). During pyrolysis, RS and WW gradually decomposed and produced char with yield of ∼ 35–40 wt% at 400 °C consisting of a high lignin content with a HHV of > 34 kJ/g. Similarly, LD decomposed gradually with a char yield of 45 wt% at 400 °C, but with a low HHV (∼15 kJ/g) and high ash content (20 wt%). WW had relatively high char yield of ∼ 60 wt% during pyrolysis at 250 °C, with a HHV of 25 kJ/g. Although RS had a high char yield (∼75 wt%) with a high HHV (>30 kJ/g), the chars still contained a significant amount of volatiles. The WW char from these three thermal conversion technologies, and RS chars produced by pyrolysis and hydrothermal conversion, could have a potential application in bioenergy production. However, the ash content and low HHV make LD unsuitable for bioenergy applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLaminaria digitata 3aadministrative management 3aash content 3abiochar 3abioenergy 3abiomass 3acomparative study 3aenergy conversion 3ahydrochars 3ahydrothermal carbonization 3alignin content 3amacroalgae 3apyrolysis 3arapeseed 3atemperature 3atorrefaction 0aChar formation 0aHydrothermal treatment 0aPyrolysis 0aTorrefaction 0aEnergy application 0aBiomass1 aWilliams, Orla1 aKostas, Emily T.1 aSamson, Abby1 aLester, Edward0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2022 Oct. 15, v. 270 p.116260-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2022.1162603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03169naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245009100169300001600260520154700276536012201823592002801945596006101973650002502034650001702059650002702076650001002103650001702113650001502130650001102145650002302156650001102179650001502190651001302205653001702218653002202235653002202257653001702279653001802296700002502314700001602339700001802355700002102373700002402394700001802418700001702436773010902453856008002562852000902642655001202651IND60621840520221122065350.0181121e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184052DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721177086472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNtwenya, Julius E.10aRich Food Biodiversity Amid Low Consumption of Food Items in Kilosa District, Tanzania  ap. 501-511.  aIndigenous foods, which contribute largely to the majority of the households' food basket in rural Tanzanian communities, have not been fully characterized or documented. The study aimed to document foods available and consumed in Kilosa District, Tanzania, in an attempt to promote, revive use, and build evidence for sustainable utilization of the rich local biodiversity. Data were collected from 307 households in 3 agroecological zones in Kilosa District during the beginning of the rainy season (February-May) and immediately after harvest (September-October). A list of food items was generated, and 24-hour recall was performed. Descriptive statistics were calculated and a student t test statistic was used to compare the means of the Food Biodiversity Score between the agricultural seasons. A total of 183 edible food items were reported by households with more reported in the rainy season (n = 82) compared to harvest season (n = 64). The mean number of food items consumed per day during the rainy season was 4.7 (95% CI: 4.5-5.0) compared to 5.9 (95% CI: 5.7-6.1) during harvest season. About 50% of the households mentioned that wild edible foods were less accepted by household members. Despite the rich local food biodiversity, households relied on few food items which may be due to limited awareness and knowledge about the biodiversity of foods in the community. It is important to educate communities on the rich and affordable food base available locally to improve their food diversity, income, and nutritional status.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data  a106025cInternational Development Research Center (IDRC) 3aagroecological zones 3abiodiversity 3adescriptive statistics 3afoods 3aharvest date 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3anutritional status 3at-test 3awet season 3aTanzania 0abiodiversity 0adietary diversity 0awild edible foods 0amalnutrition 0afood security1 aKinabo, J.q(Joyce),1 aMsuya, John1 aMamiro, Peter1 aMamiro, Delphina1 aNjoghomi, Elifuraha1 aLiwei, Philip1 aHuang, Megan0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 38, no. 4 p.501-511dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721177086473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245016000165300001600325520115100341592002801492650002001520650001101540650001201551650001701563651002301580653001701603653002301620653001101643653002301654653002301677653001901700653001301719773009601732856008101828852000901909655001201918IND60622347320221116161915.0181124e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062234732DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683604hl731rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee Lyman, R.10aIdentification and palaeoenvironmental significance of late-Quaternary ermine (Mustela erminea) in the central Columbia Basin, Washington, northwestern USA  ap. 553-562.  aDistinguishing late-quaternary remains of long-tailed weasel (Mustela frenata) from those of ermine (M. erininea) usually depends on size as the former species tends to be larger than the latter. Clinal variation and character displacement among these two taxa make comparative data taken from modern specimens of similar location to prehistoric holocene-age specimens mandatory for valid identifications. Taxonomically diagnostic criteria for modern long-tailed weasels and ermines in eastern Washington indcate that the smallest remains of Mustela represent ermines, mid-size remains cannot be identified to spcies, and the largest remains represent long-tailed weasel. Re-evaluation of small late-Quaternary Mvustela specimens originally identified as ermine suggests that all but two of them cannot be assigned to species. The original identification of one of the remaining specimens as ermine is confirmed. The latto middlHolocene age of the confirmed ermine specimen corresponds to a period of cooler and moister climates, and this accounts for its recovery from modern warm-dry areas in eastern Washington where ermine do not occur today.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMustela erminea 3abasins 3aclimate 3apaleoecology 3aWashington (state) 0aBiogeography 0aeastern Washington 0aermine 0along-tailed weasel 0apalaeoenvironments 0alate Quatenary 0aHolocene0 tHolocene.g, v. 14, no. 4 p.553-562dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl731rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03834naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245010200168300001600270520176400286536038702050592002802437650001402465650001302479650002402492650001502516650001402531650002302545650002002568650001902588650001502607650001502622650001102637650001402648650001502662650001202677650001802689650002402707650001702731650001602748651001502764653001302779653001502792653002402807653002902831653001502860700002502875700002602900700001802926700002202944700002202966700002702988700001903015773010903034856008003143852000903223655001203232IND60621841120221122123134.0181121e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184112DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721177101032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSarma, Haribondhu10aFactors Influencing the Prevalence of Stunting Among Children Aged Below Five Years in Bangladesh  ap. 291-301.  aPoor nutrition during childhood impedes physical and mental development of children, which propagate the vicious cycle of intergenerational under nutrition. This paper is aimed at understanding the determinants of stunting among children aged 0 to 59 months in Bangladesh. The study used Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011 data and a multistage stratified cluster-sampling design. Anthropometric data (for height and weight) were collected and analysis was limited to 7647 children. Multiple binary logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association of stunting with potential socioeconomic and demographic factors. The prevalence of stunting has been found to be about 41% among children aged less than 60 months and higher in rural setting than in urban areas (43% vs 36%). Adjusted model revealed that several factors were influencing stunting. The children living in moderately food-insecure households had higher odds of becoming stunted (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.54, P = .01) compared to the children living in food-secure households. The derived ORs of stunting for children delivered at institutions facilitated particularly by public (OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.67-0.96; P = .02) or private (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97; P = .02) sectors were less than for children delivered at home. Similarly, wealth index, exposure of mother to the mass media, age of child, size of child at birth, and parents’ education were significantly associated with stunting. Moreover, the demographic characteristics and other indicators appeared to have significant influence in the prevalence of stunting. Public health programs are needed to avert the risk factors of stunting among children in Bangladesh.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation-UK (CIFF) was the funder for operating research work of this unit.

The objective of the study was to understand maternal perceptions on sources of psychological distress, and how distress impacts functioning, especially related to childcare and feeding practices among mothers of young children in South Kivu, DR Congo. Mothers of young children who were participating in a larger study were eligible. Using purposive sampling, participants were selected if they had high or low levels of psychological distress, based on their mean item score on measures of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Twenty in-depth interviews and 2 focus group discussions were conducted, with a total of 35 mothers. Key informant interviews were conducted with 5 local health workers. Audio recordings were transcribed and coded, and the analysis was guided by Grounded Theory methodology. Major themes to emerge were that women’s husbands were a significant source of distress, with husbands’ infidelity, abandonment, and lack of financial support mentioned by participants. Psychological distress resulted in appetite and weight loss, and poor nutritional status made it difficult to breastfeed. Participants perceived psychological distress caused milk insufficiency and difficulty breastfeeding. Mothers experiencing psychological distress may need greater support for maternal nutrition and breastfeeding, and engaging fathers through responsible parenting interventions may reduce psychological distress and have a positive impact on child health.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: ADRA provided funding for the parent study through a USAID Office of Food for Peace Cooperative Agreement (AID-FFP-A-11-00006).

The extracted plasmids were transformed into naturally competent Acinetobacter oleivorans DR1 to recover a non-Escherichia coli-based plasmid. The transformed cells showed 80–100-fold higher TC resistance than the wild-type strain. Restriction length polymorphism performed using 30 transformed cells showed four different types of plasmids. Illumina-based whole sequencing of the four plasmids identified three previously unreported plasmids and one previously reported plasmid. All plasmids carried TC resistance-related genes (tetL, tetH), tetracycline transcriptional regulators (tetR), and mobilization-related genes. As per expression analysis, TC resistance genes were functional in the presence of TC. The recovered plasmids showed mosaic gene acquisition through horizontal gene transfer. Membrane fluidity, hydrophobicity, biofilm formation, motility, growth rate, sensitivity to stresses, and quorum sensing signals of the transformed cells were different from those of the wild-type cells. Plasmid-bearing cells seemed to have an energy burden for maintaining and expressing plasmid genes. Our data showed that acquisition of TC resistance through plasmid uptake is related to loss of biological fitness. Thus, cells acquiring antibiotic resistance plasmids can survive in the presence of antibiotics, but must pay ecological costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcinetobacter 3aactivated sludge 3aantibiotic resistance 3aenergy 3agenes 3ahorizontal gene transfer 3ahydrophobicity 3amembrane fluidity 3aplasmids 3aquorum sensing 3atetracycline 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAcinetobacterxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aAlkanesxchemistry 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacology 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aBiofilms 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterialxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGene Transfer, Horizontal 2aOxidative Stress 2aPhenotype 2aPlasmidsxisolation & purification 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 2aQuorum Sensing 2aSaltsxmetabolism 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSewagexmicrobiology 2aTetracyclinexpharmacology 2aTetracycline Resistancexgenetics1 aKo, Hyeok-Jin1 aChoi, In-Geol1 aPark, Woojun0 tMicrobial ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 67, no. 2 p.369-379dSpringer USx0095-36287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-013-0343-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03807naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245015900171300001600330520164700346536033401993592002802327596006502355650002202420650002302442650001202465650001102477650001202488650003402500650001602534650001602550650001802566650001102584650000902595650001002604650002602614650001402640650002302654650001802677650002302695650000802718650001402726650001002740651001002750653002602760653002002786653002302806653002302829653001002852700001902862700002202881700002002903700002302923700002202946700001502968773010902983856008003092852000903172655001203181IND60621841520221122081542.0181121e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184152DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721177181212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVenkatramanan, Sudha10aDouble Fortified Salt Intervention Improved Iron Intake But Not Energy and Other Nutrient Intakes in Female Tea Plantation Workers From West Bengal, India  ap. 369-383.  aIron deficiency is a global public health concern and has implications on the health status of women in reproductive age. We hypothesized that improving iron intake with double fortified salt would improve food intake, resulting in higher energy, nutrient intakes, and weight indicators of female tea plantation workers. In this randomized double-masked study, the participants (n = 245) were assigned to receive salt double fortified with iron and iodine (DFS; treatment) or salt fortified with iodine (control) and followed for 7.5 to 9 months. Dietary intakes were measured at three time points, baseline, midpoint, and end line using (1) food frequency questionnaire, (2) 24-hour recall, and (3) weighed lunch intake. Anthropometric measures of height (cm), weight (kg), and mid-upper arm circumference (cm) were also recorded at three time points. Mixed-model repeated-measures approach was used to detect group differences across time. Double fortified salt improved dietary iron intake in the treatment group compared to the control group (P < .001). No other dietary or anthropometric differences could be attributed to treatment. Significant effect of time was observed in the intake frequency of major food groups and calcium, vitamin A and C (P <.001 for all), suggesting an equal effect of seasonality in both the groups. Addition of DFS in the diet improved dietary iron intake but did not affect the intake of energy, other nutrients, or nutritional status indicators. The improvement observed in the dietary iron intake demonstrates that fortification is an effective strategy to address iron deficiency in at-risk populations.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The study was carried out with financial support from Micronutrient Initiative, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada and the Mathile Institute for the Advancement of Human Nutrition, Dayton, Ohio, USA.  aPublisher supplied data  cThe Mathile Institute for the Advancement of Human Nutrition 3aarm circumference 3aat-risk population 3acalcium 3aenergy 3afemales 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afood groups 3afood intake 3ahealth status 3aiodine 3airon 3alunch 3anutrient deficiencies 3anutrients 3anutritional status 3apublic health 3astatistical models 3atea 3avitamin A 3awomen 3aIndia 0adouble fortified salt 0airon deficiency 0adietary assessment 0anutritional status 0aIndia1 aMarquis, Grace1 aNeufeld, Lynnette1 aWenger, Michael1 aMurray-Kolb, Laura1 aReinhart, Gregory1 aHaas, Jere0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 38, no. 3 p.369-383dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721177181213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011700166300001600283520115600299592002801455650002801483650001101511650001101522650001301533650000801546650001201554650002301566650001401589650002001603651001801623651001601641653002001657653001701677653002301694653001401717653001001731653001801741653001601759653001801775700001801793700001901811773009601830856008101926852000902007655001202016IND60622348120221116162023.0181124e200405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062234812DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683604hl740rr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolyak, Leonid12aA high-resolution, 800-year glaciomarine record from Russkaya Gavan', a Novaya Zemlya fjord, eastern Barents Sea  ap. 628-634.  aSediment core ASV-987 from Russkaya Gavan', a tidewater fjord on the northwestern coast of Novaya Zemlya, provides the first multicentury record of sedimentary and hydrographic glaciomarine environments in Russian Arctic with a century-scale resolution. Age is constrained by seven 14C ages securing an especially robust control for the period between c. AD 1370 and 1600. Based on sediment struture, grain size, depositional rates, foraminiferal assemblages and stable isotopes in foraminiferal tests, we reconstruct the changes in fjord sedimentation and circulation in relation to the history of a tidewater glacier connected to the main Novaya Zemlya ice complex. We conclude that a noticeable glacier advance occurred c. AD 1400, contemporaneous with a change in North Atlantic atmospheric circulation inferred from GISP-2 ion-contents data. A major glacier retreat from Russkaya Gavan' occurred by c. AD 1600, succeeded by low sedimentary inputs. Intervals with depleted stable isotopic values, including the core top, may indicate intensified glacier melting. Stronger melting in the 1900s is consistent with an increase in sedimentation rates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatmospheric circulation 3acarbon 3acoasts 3aglaciers 3aice 3amelting 3asedimentation rate 3asediments 3astable isotopes 3aArctic region 3aBarents Sea 0aLast millennium 0aglaciomarine 0asedimentary record 0atidewater 0afjord 0aNovaya Zemlya 0aBarents Sea 0alate Holocene1 aMurdmaa, Ivar1 aIvanova, Elena0 tHolocene.g, v. 14, no. 4 p.628-634dSAGE PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl740rr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03041naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011700174300001600291520160900307592002801916650001301944650001201957650001901969650001001988650001201998650001002010650001002020650001502030650001402045650001102059650001102070650001302081650001502094650001402109651001402123653002202137653000902159653001202168653001502180653002502195653003602220653001802256653002602274653001402300653001402314773010502328856008102433852000902514655001202523IND60622348520221116162035.0181124e200407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062234852DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683604hl745rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUmbanhowar, Charles E.10aInteraction of fire, climate and vegetation change at a large landscape scale in the Big Woods of Minnesota, USA  ap. 661-676.  aThe Big Woods region of Minnesota is on the prairie-forest border and is a much studied model for the interaction of climate, fire and vegetation. The purpose of this study was (a) to document the extent and timing of changes in vegetation and fire over the past 2000 years and (b) to examine the link between charcoal influx and vegetation during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. To reconstruct changes in vegetation, fire and climate, sieve charcoal (120 gm), pollen, environmental magnetism and loss-on-ignition were used. Charcoal deposition at prairie lakes was 3-4 times greater than for woodland or forest lakes, consistent with current understanding of the fire dependence of prairies, but charcoal influxes to forests were considerably higher than reported elsewhere, suggesting that ground fires were more common than assumed. Regionally, charcoal deposition at a subset of 17 lakes began to change at cal. AD 1100, dating to the period of the ‘Mediaeval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA; cal. AD 900-1250) but preceding the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA; cal. AD 1250). For seven of 14 lakes the MCA was characterized by a significant increase in charcoal deposition. This was followed by a decrease with the onset of the LIA, which for most sites continued into the nineteenth century. Relative timing of changes in charcoal and pollen and the other proxies differed from site to site, suggesting no one single response to climatic change. This variation most likely derives from local differences in fuels and topography, as compounded by strong positive feedbacks between fuels and fire.  aPublisher supplied data 3acharcoal 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3afires 3aforests 3afuels 3alakes 3alandscapes 3amagnetism 3amodels 3apollen 3aprairies 3atopography 3awoodlands 3aMinnesota 0aCharcoal analysis 0afire 0aclimate 0avegetation 0a‘Little Ice Age’ 0a‘Mediaeval Climate Anomaly’ 0apollen record 0aprairie-forest border 0aBig Woods 0aMinnesota0 tHolocene.g2004 July, v. 14, no. 5 p.661-676dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683604hl745rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04548naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245017500166300001500341520267900356592002803035650002403063650002503087650001903112650002003131650001803151650001603169650001103185650002703196650001703223650002103240650003203261650001503293650001903308650001703327650001903344650001503363650002303378650001303401650001703414651001303431653002403444653001203468653001703480653001603497653002703513700001703540700002403557700005903581700005903640700005803699773012103757856008303878852000903961655001203970IND60794915320221120174812.0221004e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sajb.2022.09.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Mostak10aEffects of an Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed extract application dose and method on growth, fruit yield, quality, and water productivity of tomato under water-deficit stress  ap. 95-107.  aThe scarcity of irrigation water is a major threat restricting growth and productivity of almost all agronomic and horticultural crops. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is no exception. Seaweed extracts are widely used as biostimulants for the improvement of plant growth and development. Two independent pot experiments were conducted to find out the best soil drench or foliar spray dose of a commercial Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed extract (ASE) formulation (Amino Seaweed, SV Group, Bangkok, Thailand) on growth, physiological and biochemical parameters, fruit yield, quality, and water productivity of tomato under water-deficit stress. The commercial ASE formulation was applied in five doses (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mL L⁻¹) as a soil drench (Experiment 1) or as a foliar spray (Experiment 2) under three soil moisture levels (50, 75, and 100% field capacity [FC]). Severe soil moisture deficit of 50% FC caused a 67 and 52% reduction in fruit yield, 11 and 11% reduction in fruit length, 25 and 29% decrease in leaf relative water content, while total soluble solids content was increased by 38 and 49% compared with 100% FC in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Soil drench or foliar spray of the commercial ASE formulation at 5 mL L⁻¹ was effective at all soil moisture levels. Soil drench of the commercial ASE formulation at 5 mL L⁻¹ resulted in 225% higher fruit yield in comparison to the untreated plants at 50% FC, whereas its application as a foliar spray resulted in 271% higher fruit yield in comparison to the untreated plants subjected to severe water-deficit stress (50% FC). Water productivity was found lower for the untreated plants regardless of soil moisture levels in both application methods; however, it was maximized at 5 mL L–¹ for all soil moisture levels. The beneficial effects of 5 mL L–¹ ASE formulation dose was also evident in physiological/biochemical traits and fruit quality of tomato regardless of application methods. Tomato yielded more when the commercial ASE formulation was applied at 5 mL L–¹ as a soil drench (523.3 g plant–¹ fruit yield) rather than as a foliar spray treatment (397.1 g plant–¹ fruit yield). The results indicate that (i) 5 mL L⁻¹ could be regarded as an optimum dose of the commercial ASE formulation for tomato applied either as a soil drench or foliar spray and (ii) exogenous application of the commercial ASE formulation at 5 mL L⁻¹ as a soil drench treatment is more efficient, especially in fruit yield improvement, compared with its application as a foliar spray and, therefore, this technique holds promise for tomato cultivation under moderate water-deficit stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAscophyllum nodosum 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3afield capacity 3afoliar spraying 3afruit quality 3afruit yield 3afruits 3agrowth and development 3ahorticulture 3airrigation water 3aleaf relative water content 3amacroalgae 3aplant extracts 3aplant growth 3asoil drenching 3asoil water 3asoil water deficit 3atomatoes 3awater stress 3aThailand 0aAscophyllum nodosum 0aDrought 0aFoliar spray 0aSoil drench 0aSolanum lycopersicum L1 aUllah, Hayat1 aPiromsri, Kanokkorn1 aTisarum, Rujira1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5402-17931 aCha-um, Suriyan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7662-363X1 aDatta, Avishek1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5575-27660 tSouth African journal of botany.g2022 Dec., v. 151 p.95-107dElsevier B.V.aSAABwJournal:jnl34108x0254-62997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sajb.2022.09.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03611naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005800146245009700204300001600301520163600317536053401953592002802487596009002515650001602605650000902621650001902630650001302649650002402662650002002686650001402706650001002720650002202730650002502752650001202777650002402789651001002813653001002823653001802833653001402851653001102865653000902876700002002885700002602905773010902931856008003040852000903120655001203129IND60621842520221121015245.0181121e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184252DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721177331002doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNandi, Arindam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3967-242410aBreastfeeding Duration and Adolescent Educational Outcomes: Longitudinal Evidence From India  ap. 528-541.  aThere is a significant evidence gap on the long-term educational benefits of longer breastfeeding in low- and middle-income countries. We estimated the association between duration of (any) breastfeeding and educational outcomes of Indian children. We used regression analysis to examine the association between the length of breastfeeding (in months) and future education outcomes on the basis of 2 data sets: (1) data from a follow-up survey known as the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parents Study (APCAPS, 2003-2005) of 1165 children aged 13 to 18 years from a controlled nutrition trial originally conducted in South India during the period of 1987 to 1990; and (2) nationally representative data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS-2, 2011-2012) of 6121 children aged 6 to 12 years. In APCAPS, children with >36 months of breastfeeding scored 0.28 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.00-0.56; P < .05) higher on tests than those with up to 12 months of breastfeeding. In the nationally representative IHDS-2 data, above-median breastfeeding duration was associated with 0.1 year (95% CI: 0.04-0.16; P < .01) higher educational attainment. In IHDS-2, >12 to 24 months and >24 months of breastfeeding were associated with 0.12 (95% CI: 0.01-0.23; P < .05) and 0.19 years of (95% CI: 0.05-0.34; P < .05) higher educational attainment, respectively, than for those with up to 6 months of breastfeeding. In additional analyses by sex, we found that the benefits of breastfeeding accrued primarily to boys. Breastfeeding duration was associated with small gains in educational outcomes for boys but not for girls in India.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which provided a grant to the University of Virginia.

To compare the Fueling Learning through Exercise study (FLEX) dietary questionnaire, a screener designed to assess consumption patterns in third to fifth graders, to a validated dietary assessment tool. The FLEX dietary questionnaire was developed to assess fruit, vegetable, snack, and beverage consumption and was compared to the Block Kids Food Screener (BKFS). Correlations were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficient. Agreement was assessed using Bland-Altman plots. The sample (n = 63) had mean age of 9.9 years (SD 0.7). Most participants were non-Hispanic white (70%) and eligible for free/reduced price lunch (57%). Correlations between food group categories were significant for all groups (P < .05) except fruits (r = 0.51) and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) (r = 0.21). We found moderate-to-strong correlations between reported vegetable, salty snack, sweet snack, total beverage, milk, and fruit juice consumption (0.62, 0.59, 0.69, 0.47, 0.48, and 0.46, respectively). The FLEX screener reported systematically higher mean servings per day (0.24-1.1) compared to the BKFS (0.05-0.51). Based on these correlations, the FLEX dietary questionnaire performs similarly to a validated tool in assessing intake of under- and overconsumed food groups in a diverse third to fifth grade population. Overall serving size discrepancies are likely due to more relevant food items on the FLEX questionnaire and a more child-friendly format. This study highlights the need to update older diet screeners to reflect current child consumption patterns.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: financed by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development of the National Institutes of Health, Award Number R01HD080180, with additional support from the Boston Foundation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3achildren 3adiet study techniques 3aexercise 3afood groups 3afruit juices 3afruits 3alearning 3alunch 3amilk 3anutrition assessment 3aprices 3aquestionnaires 3aserving size 3asugar sweetened beverages 3avegetables 0adietary patterns 0achildren 0afood frequency questionnaires 0avalidation studies1 aKranz, Sarah1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3021-706X1 aBakun, Peter1 aTanskey, Lindsay1 aWright, Catherine1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3422-24131 aSacheck, Jennifer0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 38, no. 4 p.585-593dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721177334003Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03974naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002000146245016300166300001300329520181100342536037402153592002802527596010002555650001702655650001302672650001302685650001902698650002002717650001802737650001202755650001702767650001802784650001502802650001102817650001102828650001002839650002502849650000902874650000802883650001402891650001202905650001902917650001002936651001002946653001402956653001502970653001002985653002602995653001103021700001903032700002003051700002103071700002003092700002203112700001903134773010603153856008003259852000903339655001203348IND60621842820221121015132.0181121e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184282DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721177374282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDumas, Sarah E.10a“Men Are in Front at Eating Time, but Not When It Comes to Rearing the Chicken”: Unpacking the Gendered Benefits and Costs of Livestock Ownership in Kenya  ap. 3-27.  aLivestock can promote resilience in low-income communities through a number of pathways. Livestock development programs seek to amplify these benefits but often fail to consider the costs to intended beneficiaries or the effect of prevailing gender norms. To explore perceptions of livestock ownership among female smallholder livestock keepers in Nyanza Region, Kenya, and unpack how the distribution of livestock benefits and investments varies by gender within households. We used multiple ethnographic techniques, including Photovoice, a photo-elicitation interview method, focus group discussions, and pile sorts, with female smallholder livestock owners (n = 18) participating in an ongoing cohort study. Transcripts were coded using a combination of a priori constructs and grounded theory. We found that livestock benefited households by providing financial security, food security, social benefits, and human time and labor savings. However, these benefits largely promoted long-term household resilience rather than immediate gains. Livestock ownership also had major costs to household time and labor, which were overwhelmingly borne by women and children. Despite this investment, women had limited livestock ownership rights, decision-making power, control over income, or access to meat. Our findings suggest that livestock ownership requires significant investments of household time and labor, which disproportionately burden women. Prevailing gender inequalities may therefore constrain the net benefit of livestock ownership for many women and their households in some contexts. Livestock development programs must assess both program benefits and costs at multiple levels to ensure that women’s participation in livestock production leads to improved individual and household outcomes.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (S.L.Y., award number K01 MH098902), the Einhorn Discovery Grant (A.M.), and the Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research Program (A.M.).  aPublisher supplied data  aK01 MH098902cNational Institutes of Healthdhttps://doi.org/https://doi.org/10.13039/100000002 3aanthropology 3achickens 3achildren 3acohort studies 3adecision making 3aeating habits 3afemales 3afocus groups 3afood security 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3aincome 3alabor 3alivestock production 3ameat 3amen 3aownership 3arearing 3asocial benefit 3awomen 3aKenya 0alivestock 0aresilience 0aKenya 0awomen’s empowerment 0agender1 aMaranga, Abena1 aMbullo, Patrick1 aCollins, Shalean1 aWekesa, Pauline1 aOnono, Maricianah1 aYoung, Sera L.0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 39, no. 1 p.3-27dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721177374283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03298naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245011900164300001400283520159500297536034201892592002802234650003002262650001402292650001102306650001802317650001902335650001102354650002202365650002202387650002002409651001102429653001802440653002202458653001702480653002202497653001102519700001902530700001802549700002702567700001802594700002002612773010702632856008002739852000902819655001202828IND60621843020221122212536.0181121e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184302DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721177388832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Fan-Fen10aIodine Status of Taiwanese Population in 2013: 10 Years After Changing From Mandatory to Voluntary Salt Iodization  ap. 75-85.  aIn 2003, Taiwan’s iodine policy changed from mandatory to voluntary. The Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan (NAHSIT) 2001-2002 for schoolchildren showed adequate iodine nutrition, while NAHSIT 2005-2008 for adults showed the iodine status was at borderline adequacy. To investigate the iodine status of the Taiwanese population from schoolchildren to adulthood 10 years after the change of the salt iodization policy. Urinary iodine was measured in samples from subjects in NAHSIT 2013. The median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) of the Taiwanese population aged 6 years and above in 2013 was 96 μg/L, indicating mild iodine deficiency. The median UIC of 6- to 12-year-old schoolchildren was 124 μg/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 92-213 μg/L), and 115 μg/L (IQR: 80-166 μg/L), 125 μg/L (IQR: 74-161 μg/L), 73 μg/L (IQR: 52-131 μg/L), and 78 μg/L (IQR: 52-132 μg/L) in populations aged 13 to 18 years, 19 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, and ≥65 years, respectively. Declining iodine nutrition in age groups ≥45 years old was noted that the median UIC of populations aged 45 to 64 years and ≥65 years was 99 and 88 μg/L, respectively, in NAHSIT 2005-2008. The median UIC of schoolchildren was not lower than that during the mandatory salt fortification period, but the distribution of urinary iodine levels signified a dietary pattern change. Wide-ranging variation in iodine nutrition levels was observed in different age groups. Universal salt iodization, as suggested by the World Health Organization, should be the best strategy to achieve adequate iodine nutrition.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The project of Urinary iodine analysis of Nutrition and Health Survey in Taiwan 2010-2013 was sponsored by the Health Promotion Administration, Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan (B1021019).  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aeating habits 3ahealth surveys 3aiodine 3aiodine deficiency 3aissues and policy 3aschool children 3aTaiwan 0athyroid gland 0aiodine deficiency 0aiodized salt 0anutrition surveys 0aTaiwan1 aTang, Kam-Tsun1 aPan, Wen-Harn1 aWon, Justin Ging-Shing1 aHsieh, Yao-Te1 aHuang, Chun-Jui0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 39, no. 1 p.75-85dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721177388833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03218naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001300151245014300164500002200307520157700329592002801906650004401934650002501978650002202003650002402025650001402049650001902063650001902082650001702101650001902118650001802137650001902155650001802174650002202192650002502214650001602239653002602255653002502281653002502306653002902331653002502360653002502385700001702410700001802427700001502445700001402460700001902474773010002493856008602593852000902679655001202688IND60794916720221123010202.0221004e20220924xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1081882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jiao10aImproved gelling and emulsifying properties of myofibrillar protein from frozen shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) by high-intensity ultrasound  aPre-press version  aThe deterioration of shrimp protein functionality during chilling and frozen storage has recently attracted wide attention due to its adverse effects on shrimp quality. The high-intensity ultrasound (20 kHz, 400 W) was applied to improve the protein structure and functional properties of frozen shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) in this study. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that the cavitation effect of ultrasound could change the secondary structure of myofibrillar protein (MP) by turning the α-helix and random coil to β-sheet and β-turn. The unfolding of MP conformation increased the reactive sulfhydryl content and surface hydrophobicity accordingly. The structure changes eventually led to the significant improvement of protein functionality. Gel properties analysis showed after ultrasonic treatment, the gel strength and water holding capacity of protein gels were increased gradually. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images also demonstrated that ultrasound treatment contributed to the formation of stable network structures in protein gels. In addition, ultrasonic homogenization could increase the emulsifying ability (45.54 m²/g to 78.82 m²/g) and stability of protein in a short time, which might be related to the decrease of particle size. Confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) analysis further illustrated that ultrasound treatment made the emulsion distribution more uniform. The application of these findings will improve the deep processing ability and expand the commercialization of frozen shrimp products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3acommercialization 3aelectron microscopy 3aemulsions 3afrozen shrimps 3afrozen storage 3agel strength 3ahomogenization 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aparticle size 3aprotein structure 3aultrasonic treatment 3aultrasonics 0aUltrasonic cavitation 0aLitopenaeus vannamei 0aMyofibrillar protein 0aConformational structure 0aGel-forming property 0aEmulsifying property1 aDai, Zechuan1 aChen, Zhaohui1 aHao, Yanan1 aWang, Sai1 aMao, Xiangzhao0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2022 Sept. 24,  p.108188-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2022.1081883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005400150245011500204520128800319592002801607650001501635650000901650650002001659650000901679650001701688650002201705650001101727650001401738650001901752651001001771653000801781653001601789653003201805653002801837653002001865700001701885700001701902700001401919700001401933700001801947700001301965700001801978700001501996773011002011856005102121852000902172655001202181IND60794918520221117160351.0220929e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Suzhen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1401-395610aDistribution and source identification of polychlorinated naphthalenes in bees, bee pollen, and wax from China  aPolychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are highly toxic and persistent organic pollutants that can cause adverse effects in the environment and on human health. PCNs have been detected in remote areas because of their long-range transportation. Bees and bee products are commonly used as biomonitors for various pollutants in the environment. However, information on PCNs in apiaries is scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrences of PCNs in bees and bee products from apiaries located in different geographical regions of China, and to identify potential pollution sources and assess exposure risks to humans. Our results showed that the average Σ₇₅PCNs concentrations in bees, pollen, and wax were 74.1, 96.3, and 141 pg/g dry weight, respectively. The homologue and congener profiles of PCNs in bees, pollen, and wax were similar, and di- and tri-chlorinated naphthalenes (>60%) were the predominant homologues. The concentrations and distributions of PCNs in bees, pollen, and wax varied among different geographical regions, but their occurrences were correlated with PCN metallurgical sources in China. The health risks of PCNs in pollen were evaluated, and both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of PCNs exposure to humans through the diet were low.  aPublisher supplied data 3abee pollen 3abees 3acarcinogenicity 3adiet 3ahuman health 3aindicator species 3apollen 3apollution 3atransportation 3aChina 0aBee 0aBee product 0aPolychlorinated naphthalene 0aGeographic distribution 0aSource analysis1 aDong, Shujun1 aZhao, Yazhou1 aZhang, Su1 aZhao, Yin1 aLiu, Zhaoyong1 aZou, Yun1 aWang, Peilong1 aWu, Liming0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 314 p.120225-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120225  aDNAL 7aarticle02811naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245012900167520145100296592002801747650001101775650002101786650003401807650001401841650001801855650002001873650001101893650001501904650002501919651001001944653003101954653004001985653002502025653002002050653001402070700001502084700001102099700001902110700001902129700001302148773011002161856008502271852000902356655001202365IND60794918620221117160326.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wenbin10aOccurrence, fate and risk assessment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in wastewater treatment plants in Shaanxi, China  aWastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are considered as major sinks for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). However, conventional WWTPs with low efficiency are also a secondary point source of PFASs entering the environment. Herein, a large-scale investigation of PFASs was conducted in 44 WWTPs throughout Shaanxi Province in the transitional zone between North and South China. The composition profiles of target PFASs differed between wastewater and sludge samples. Perfluorobutanoic acid was dominant in wastewater influent and effluent samples, with maximum concentrations of 59.8 and 11.4 ng/L, respectively. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid occurred predominantly in sludge samples, with a maximum concentration of 73.2 ng/g. Through wastewater treatment, short-chain PFASs with an even number of carbon atoms were mostly removed, whereas short-chain PFASs with an odd number of carbon atoms were primarily discharged into receiving water. Long-chain PFASs (perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids: C ≥ 8; perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids: C ≥ 6) were not removed efficiently and secondary production might occur during treatment. Based on the risk quotient, PFASs residues in wastewater effluent posed minimal ecological risk, but the residues in sludge posed low to high potential risk. The mass loadings of PFASs discharged through wastewater and sludge were 15.5 and 3.74 kg/year, respectively, from all WWTPs in Shaanxi Province.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aperfluorocarbons 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3apollution 3arelative risk 3arisk assessment 3asludge 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 3aChina 0aWastewater treatment plant 0aPer- and polyfluoroalkyl substances 0aSpatial distribution 0aEcological risk 0aMass load1 aYang, Fang1 aHu, En1 aYang, Chenghua1 aSun, Changshun1 aLi, Ming0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 314 p.120226-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03530naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006500150245017300215520191000388592002802298650002802326650002502354650000802379650000902387650002002396650001702416650002202433650001102455650001402466650002302480650001102503650001702514650001402531650001502545650002402560650002802584651001502612653001602627653001602643653001802659653002402677653003002701653002702731700002902758700006702787773011002854856005102964852000903015655001203024IND60794918720221117160344.0220929e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalazar-Rojas, Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2366-363810aComparison between machine linear regression (MLR) and support vector machine (SVM) as model generators for heavy metal assessment captured in biomonitors and road dust  aExposure to suspended particulate matter (PM), found in the air, is one of the most acute environmental problems that affect the health of modern society. Among the different airborne pollutants, heavy metals (HMs) are particularly relevant because they are bioaccumulated, impairing the functions of living beings. This study aimed to establish a method to predict heavy metal concentrations in leaves and road dust, through their magnetic properties measurements. For this purpose, machine learning, automatic linear regression (MLR), and support vector machine (SVM) were used to establish models for the prediction of airborne heavy metals based on leaves and road dust magnetic properties. Road dust samples and leaves of two common evergreen species (Cupressus lusitanica/Casuarina equisetifolia) were sampled simultaneously during two different years in the Great Metropolitan Area (GMA) of Costa Rica. MLR and SVM algorithms were used to establish the relationship between airborne heavy metal concentrations based on single (χlf) and multiple (χlf y χdf) leaf magnetic properties and road dust. Results showed that Fe, Cu, Cr, V, and Zn concentrations were well-simulated by SVM prediction models, with adjusted R² values ≥ 0.7 in both training and test stages. By contrast, the concentrations of Pb and Ni were not well-simulated, with adjusted R² values < 0.7 in both training and test stages. Heavy metal predicción models using magnetic properties of leaves from Casuarina equisetifolia, as collectors, yielded better prediction results than those based on the leaves of Cupressus lusitanica and road dust, showing relatively higher adjusted R² values and lower errors (MAE and RMSE) in both training and test stages. SVM proved to be the best prediction model with variations between single (χlf) and multiple (χlf y χdf) magnetic properties depending on the element studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCasuarina equisetifolia 3aCupressus lusitanica 3aair 3adust 3aevergreen trees 3aheavy metals 3aindicator species 3aleaves 3amagnetism 3ametropolitan areas 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apollution 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asupport vector machines 3aCosta Rica 0aHeavy metal 0aBiomonitors 0aAir pollution 0aMagnetic properties 0aMachine linear regression 0aSupport vector machine1 aCejudo-Ruiz, Fredy Ruben1 aCalvo-Brenes, Guillermo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7021-35090 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 314 p.120227-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120227  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245009400170300001600264520167700280592002801957650001401985650001301999650001502012650001202027650001202039650001202051650001002063650002102073650001202094650001902106650001202125650001002137650001202147650001202159650001302171650001102184650001502195650001202210650001102222650001602233650001402249651001202263653001102275653001102286653001402297653002402311653001402335653002102349653002602370653002302396653001302419700002002432773010502452856008102557852000902638655001202647IND60622352320221123023938.0181124e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062235232DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683605hl791rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordova, Carlos E.10aHolocene environmental change in southwestern Crimea (Ukraine) in pollen and soil records  ap. 263-277.  aPollen records and soil development sequences from the Heraklean Peninsula and the Chyornaya Valley provide information on climatic change and fluctuation of ecological boundaries (mesic forests, steppes and sub-Mediterranean shrublands) in southwestern Crimea during the Holocene.

An increase in arboreal pollen, dominated by sub-Mediterranean and Mediterranean taxa, and the development of brown cinnamonic (calfersic) soil suggest higher temperatures and summer drought between 7.5 ka and 5 ka. An increase in arboreal pollen and the development of a meadow cinnamonic soil suggest an increase in moisture between 5.4 ka and 4.6 ka. A subsequent decrease in AP and the development of calcic horizons in cinnamonic soils indicate that a dry phase occurred between 4.2 ka and 3.5 ka. Woodland expansion occurred again after 3.2 ka, only to be interrupted by the establishment of Greek farms in the fifth century BC. An increase in AP on or after the first century BC was the result of climatic amelioration in conjunction with farm abandonment prompted by political crisis and steppe warrior raids. Although Holocene pollen and soil records from the Ukrainian steppes present climate trends similar to the Heraklean Peninsula, differences in plant taxa and soil response to climatic changes exist due to their different position with respect to marine influences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemisia 3aCarpinus 3aChernozems 3aCorylus 3aKnautia 3aQuercus 3aUlmus 3acinnamonic soils 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3adrought 3afarms 3aforests 3ameadows 3apolitics 3apollen 3ashrublands 3asteppes 3asummer 3atemperature 3awoodlands 3aUkraine 0aPollen 0aCrimea 0aBlack Sea 0aMediterranean flora 0achernozem 0acinnamonic soils 0aancient Greek farming 0apalaeoenvironments 0aHolocene1 aLehman, Paul H.0 tHolocene.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 2 p.263-277dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl791rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03470naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011500164300001600279520170300295592002801998650001202026650002202038650001002060650002902070650001102099650001902110650002202129650001202151650001102163650001502174650001002189650001402199650001802213650001702231650001102248650001402259650001502273650001302288650002202301650001402323651001502337651001602352651001102368653001102379653001702390653002202407653001302429653001502442653001102457653002802468653002102496653002302517653001902540700002502559700001802584700002302602773010502625856008102730852000902811655001202820IND60622352420221123024058.0181124e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062235242DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683605hl792rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Shi-Yong10aHolocene palaeoecology along the Blekinge coast, SE Sweden, and implications for climate and sea-level changes  ap. 278-292.  aTo investigate the Holocene vegetation history and shoreline displacement along the southeastern Swedish coast, two radiocarbon dated pollen, macrofossil and mineral magnetic sequences were studied in the western Blekinge coast: Hunnemara Lake and Smygen Bay. Both pollen records show mosaic vegetation with grasslands, heaths and woodlands prior to 11 300 cal. BP. Pinus-dominated mixed forest was initially established by 11 000 cal. BP. By 10 000 cal. BP, mixed forest with higher species diversity was fully established. Expansion of broad-leaved trees began at about 8600 cal. BP, indicating the onset of the mid-Holocene thermal maximum in Scandinavia. Following the Ulmus decline-5800 cal. BP, the regional forest became much more open due to increased human disturbance. Both basins were isolated during the period of I1 300-11 000 cal. BP, and subsequently in contact with the Ancylus Lake between 10 700 and 9800 cal. BR Low abundance of brackish-water diatoms at Smygen suggests that this basin was connected with the Baltic Sea between 9800 and 8600 cal. BP, corresponding to the Early Littorina Sea phase. Hunnemara was isolated during this period. The two basins were in turn flooded at 8600 and 8300 cal. BP, as a result of global sea-level rise. A sedimentary hiatus (8300-7500 cal. BP) was present at Hunnemara, probably caused by a rapid sea-level rise related to global meltwater pulse 3. Aquatic macrofossil and mineral magnetic proxies reveal several minor transgressions at both sites, probably regulated by centennial-scale variations in regional storminess. Hunnemara was isolated from the Baltic Basin by 3100 cal. BP, concurrent with a lowering of the sea level at Smygen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAncylus 3aBacillariophyceae 3aUlmus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3abrackish water 3abroadleaved trees 3aclimate 3acoasts 3agrasslands 3alakes 3amagnetism 3amixed forests 3apaleoecology 3apollen 3asea level 3ashorelines 3asnowmelt 3aspecies diversity 3awoodlands 3aBaltic Sea 3aScandinavia 3aSweden 0aPollen 0amacrofossils 0amineral magnetism 0aHolocene 0aBaltic Sea 0aSweden 0aLittorina transgression 0asea-level change 0avegetation history 0aclimate change1 aBerglund, Björn E.,1 aSandgren, Per1 aFritz, Sherilyn C.0 tHolocene.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 2 p.278-292dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl792rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02717naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006100146245011000207300001600317520123500333536029301568592002801861650001401889650001301903650001601916650001701932650002301949650000901972650002901981653001702010653001802027653002702045653003502072653003202107773011502139856008002254852000902334655001202343IND60621845520221123015035.0181121e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184552DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721187744922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStobaugh, Heather1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3827-283X10aMaximizing Recovery and Growth When Treating Moderate Acute Malnutrition with Whey-Containing Supplements  ap. S30-S34.  aMuch debate exists about the utility of dairy ingredients in the supplementary foods used to treat childhood moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). To review the evidence regarding the effectiveness of dairy-containing supplements, particularly specially formulated foods containing whey permeate and whey protein concentrate, in treating children with MAM. A summary of a conference presentation regarding an overview of current evidence behind the use of whey in supplementary foods, including results of a randomized double-blinded clinical effectiveness trial involving 2259 Malawian children treated for MAM using either a soy ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) or a novel whey RUSF treatment. While the majority of the evidence base only suggests potential benefits of including whey in supplementary foods to treat MAM, a recent study specifically demonstrates that a whey RUSF produced superior recovery and growth outcomes in treating children with MAM when compared with a soy RUSF. The use of whey ingredients has been shown to improve outcomes in the treatment of MAM; however, further research is needed to identify the ideal amount and type of dairy protein required to produce the best outcomes for the lowest cost.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The U.S. Dairy Export Council through the Dairy for Global Nutrition (DFGN) program with respect to the authorship and publication of this article.  aPublisher supplied data 3achildhood 3achildren 3aingredients 3amalnutrition 3aready-to-eat foods 3awhey 3awhey protein concentrate 0awhey protein 0awhey permeate 0asupplemental nutrition 0aready-to-use supplemental food 0amoderate acute malnutrition0 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 39, no. 2_suppl p.S30-S34dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721187744923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02779naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245010700172300001600279520166800295592002801963650001601991650001402007650001402021650001202035650001302047650001502060650001502075650001202090650001902102651001902121700001802140700002202158700002602180773010902206856008102315852000902396655001202405IND50073110420221120071506.0150213e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007311042DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-002-0467-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossiter, Stephen J.10aRelatedness structure and kin-biased foraging in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum)  ap. 510-518.  aFemale greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) exhibit strong natal philopatry to their maternity roost over many years, leading to the aggregation of matrilineal kin. Maternity colonies may, therefore, be expected to comprise highly related individuals, and, as such, provide conditions suitable for the evolution of kin-selected behaviours. To test these predictions, we examined relatedness and behaviour among matrilineal kin within a colony in south-west Britain. Genetic analysis of 15 matrilines, identified from microsatellite genotyping and long-term ringing surveys, revealed average relatedness levels of 0.17 to 0.64. In contrast, background relatedness among colony females approximated to zero (0.03). These results suggest that inclusive fitness benefits may only be accrued through discriminate cooperation within matrilines, and not at the wider colony level. To examine whether the potential for such benefits is realised through kin- biased cooperation during foraging, females from two matrilines were radio-tracked simultaneously over 3 years. Pairwise home-range overlap correlated significantly with Hamilton's relatedness coefficient. The greatest spatial associations were observed between females and their adult daughters, which shared both foraging grounds and night roosts, sometimes over several years. Tagged females, however, generally foraged and roosted alone, suggesting that kin-biased spatial association probably does not result from either information-transfer or cooperative territorial defence. Such patterns may instead result from a mechanism of maternal inheritance of preferred foraging and roosting sites.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhinolophus 3adaughters 3aevolution 3afemales 3aforaging 3agenotyping 3aphilopatry 3asurveys 3aterritoriality 3aUnited Kingdom1 aJones, Gareth1 aRansome, Roger D.1 aBarratt, Elizabeth M.0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2002 May, v. 51, no. 6 p.510-518dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-002-0467-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03926naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245018000164300001600344520173900360536031802099592002802417596005102445650002302496650004902519650002302568650001102591650002402602650001902626650001602645650002802661650001802689650001202707650001602719650001702735650001902752650001102771650002402782650001302806651000902819653004402828653002302872653002502895653001102920653001002931700002002941700003102961700002002992700001903012700002403031700001703055700006603072773010903138856008003247852000903327655001203336IND60621846020221123041759.0181121e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184602DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721187839502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakhaei, Roya14aThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-Style Diet and an Alternative Mediterranean Diet are Differently Associated with Serum Inflammatory Markers in Female Adults  ap. 361-376.  aStudies on the association between a priori dietary patterns and serum highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) have led to inconsistent results, and we are not aware of any study on interleukin 17A (IL-17A) as an inflammatory marker associated with autoimmune diseases. The present study aimed to investigate the association between Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) and the Mediterranean dietary patterns with circulating hs-CRP and IL-17A levels. In this cross-sectional study, female teachers (aged 20-50 years) who lived in Yazd, Iran, were randomly selected from elementary, guidance, and high schools from September 2015 to February 2016. Anthropometric data, as well as general information and dietary food intakes, were gathered, and each participant gave 1 blood sample. Participants were categorized into tertiles based on the DASH and the Mediterranean diet calculated scores. The associations between the dietary patterns and serum hs-CRP and IL-17A levels were assessed in the crude and multivariable models. In total, 320 female teachers aged 40.38 (8.08) years were included. The DASH diet was associated with lower serum hs-CRP levels in the crude (P = .05) and the fully adjusted models (P = .02), while it was not significantly associated with IL-17A levels. The participants with the highest adherence to the Mediterranean diet had significantly lower circulating IL-17A levels (P = .04) even controlling for all confounders (P = .02); however, there was not a significant relationship between this diet and hs-CRP levels. The DASH and the Mediterranean dietary patterns might be differently associated with inflammatory markers. Further prospective studies are recommended to confirm our results.  aFunding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was extracted from a thesis for MSc degree in nutrition and was funded by the international campus of Shahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran.  aPublisher supplied data  cShahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences 3aC-reactive protein 3aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet 3aMediterranean diet 3aadults 3aautoimmune diseases 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3afemales 3afood intake 3ahigh schools 3ainterleukin-17 3amodels 3aprospective studies 3ateachers 3aIran 0aDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension 0aMediterranean diet 0ainflammatory markers 0ahs-CRP 0aIL-171 aShahvazi, Simin1 aMozaffari-Khosravi, Hassan1 aSamadi, Morteza1 aKhatibi, Nasim1 aNadjarzadeh, Azadeh1 aZare, Fateme1 aSalehi-Abargouei, Amin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7580-67170 tFood and nutrition bulletin.g, v. 39, no. 3 p.361-376dSAGE PublicationswJournal:2034x0379-57217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/03795721187839503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02605naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010300167520140000270592002801670650001501698650001201713650001101725650002301736650001801759650000701777650001401784650001301798650001401811650002101825650001301846653002301859653001601882700001601898700001501914700001801929700001401947700005201961773011002013856005102123852000902174655001202183IND60794919620221120102158.0220929e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079491962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Wenwen10aEnhanced Cd2+ adsorption and toxicity for microbial biofilms in the presence of TiO2 nanoparticles  aTitanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO₂ NPs) easily combine with other pollutants such as heavy metals because of their excellent physiochemical properties. However, how such an interaction may affect the binding behavior of metals onto biofilms remains largely unclear. This study, examined the effects of TiO₂ NPs on Cd²⁺ accumulation and toxicity for natural periphytic biofilms were examined. The adsorption kinetics showed that adding 0.1 and 1 mg/L TiO₂–NPs increased the Cd²⁺ adsorption of biofilms at equilibrium by 23.5% and 35.8%, respectively. However, adding 10 mg/L TiO₂ NPs increased the Cd²⁺ adsorption of biofilms at equilibrium by only 1.9%. The adsorption isotherms indicate that the presence of TiO₂ NPs considerably increased the Cd²⁺ adsorption capacity of the biofilms; however, this effect became less prominent at high TiO₂ NP concentrations. The optimum pH for Cd²⁺ adsorption increased with increasing Cd²⁺ and TiO₂ NP contents. At low concentrations, the coexistence of Cd²⁺ and TiO₂ NPs may facilitate their respective accumulation by stimulating the secretion of extracellular polymeric substances and enhancing the microbial activity of the biofilm. The presence of TiO₂ NPs increases the surface binding energy between Cd²⁺ and functional groups such as carboxyl groups, enhancing the Cd²⁺ accumulation on the biofilm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiofilm 3aenergy 3amicrobial activity 3ananoparticles 3apH 3apollution 3apolymers 3asecretion 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 0aTiO2 nanoparticles 0aHeavy metal1 aZhu, Shijun1 aLi, Nihong1 aXie, Shanshan1 aWen, Chen1 aLuo, Xia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1179-880X0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 314 p.120239-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.120239  aDNAL 7aarticle03379naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245013300162300001600295520165800311536036801969592002802337596004902365650001902414650001702433650001502450650001202465650001502477650001802492651001102510653001802521653002702539653002502566653003602591653001502627700002202642700001902664700003402683700003002717773010902747856008002856852000902936655001202945IND60621846520221123041758.0181121e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184652DNAL7 a10.1177/03795721187897722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSafon, Cara10aCan “Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly” Impact Breastfeeding Protection, Promotion, and Support in Mexico? A Qualitative Study  ap. 393-405.  aThe Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly (BBF) initiative includes a guide that helps countries worldwide assess their readiness to scale up national breastfeeding programs. Country committees of breastfeeding experts across government, academia, and civil society engage with BBF by applying the BBF toolbox that includes (1) the BBF Index (BBFI) to measure and score a country’s breastfeeding environment, (2) case studies that illustrate how countries have created enabling environments for breastfeeding, and (3) a 5-meeting process, during which country committees develop policy recommendations intended to improve breastfeeding outcomes based on the BBFI scores. This study seeks to understand how the application of the BBF toolbox impacted plans to improve the enabling environment for breastfeeding in Mexico. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Mexico’s 11 BBF country committee members about the 5-meeting process between May and June 2017. Audio recordings were transcribed and were coded and analyzed using a grounded theory approach. Three major themes emerged: (1) the unique enabling environment for breastfeeding consisted of obstacles and opportunities for improvement, (2) favorable country committee member dynamics positively affected the utility of the BBF toolbox, and (3) BBF revealed and shaped country committee members’ shared vision of change that laid the foundation for a shared public policy agenda. Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly can generate multisectoral breastfeeding champions who can advance the public policy agenda to improve breastfeeding outcomes at the national level both in Mexico and elsewhere.  aFunding The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded through an unrestricted grant from the Family Larsson-Rosenquist Foundation to Yale University (PI Rafael Pérez-Escamilla).

In this study, knowledge about erosion processes on the development of present-day ephemeral gullies is used for reconstructing conditions leading to the formation of old, permanent gullies. Empirical relations between flow hydraulics and channel geometry have been recently established for gullies. Hence, using measured bottom width Wbₜₜₒₘ of old gullies as input, peak flow discharges (Qₚ) of these gullies can be estimated. In two forested areas in central Belgium, 52 old gullies were mapped. The old gullies had an average Wbₒₜₜₒₘ ranging between 1.1 and 1.5 m. Corresponding calculated Qₚ values ranged between 0.04 and 0.07 m³/s. Rainfall intensities (I) were also deduced from Qₚ using the rational formula. By simulating various land use scenarios and thus various runoff coefficient (C) values, I and concentration time (Tc) could be calculated for each land-use class. Using I, Tc and intensity-duration-frequency tables for the study area, the recurrence interval (RI) of the rain events, needed to erode the observed gully channels was assessed. Although analysis of historical documents indicates that both areas have probably been under forest since the Middle Ages, it is unlikely that the old gullies originated under forest vegetation or even degraded forest vegetation, since R>I 200 years were obtained for these land-use scenarios. Cropland is the only land use that provides acceptable values of RI(11-128 years).  aPublisher supplied data 3acropland 3afluid mechanics 3aforest damage 3aforests 3ageometry 3aland use 3alandscapes 3arain 3arain intensity 3aravines 3arunoff 3aBelgium 0aHistorical gully erosion 0agully width 0a(peak) flow discharge 0arainfall intensity 0aland use 0aBelgian loess belt 0alate Holocene1 aPoesen, J.1 aVan Den Eeckhaut, M.1 aNachtergaelel, J.1 aDeckers, J.0 tHolocene.g2005 Apr., v. 15, no. 3 p.378-386dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl807rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02703naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011400167300001600281500001500297520169100312592002802003650001602031650001002047650001202057650002002069650001902089653001802108700003102126700002102157773010902178856008102287852000902368655001202377IND50073110520221120052438.0150213e200205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007311052DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-002-0469-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPartecke, Jesko10aTerritory establishment in lekking marine iguanas, Amblyrhynchus cristatus: support for the hotshot mechanism  ap. 579-587.  a2019-12-06  aThe territory establishment of male marine iguanas and their subsequent mating success were analysed to identify spatial spillover (hotshot) and temporal spillover effects on lek formation. Males started to establish small display territories 2 months ahead of the mating season. Males did not establish territories in temporal synchrony and did not settle at sites where the probability of encountering females was highest. However, males arriving later preferentially established their territories in the neighbourhood of already established territories independently of the density of female-sized iguanas in these territories. Although settling in close proximity, there were no fights between those males. The number of fights between territorial males increased towards, and peaked during, the mating season. Fights did not result in the transfer of space, indicating that space per se was no resource. Instead, fights were directed towards central (hotshot) males. These central males had higher mating success than marginal males. Female density during the time of territory establishment did not predict the mating success of males, because females changed their spatial preferences between early establishment and mating periods. Similarly, the areas where males achieved the highest numbers of copulations changed during 4 years of our study. Thus, there was no evidence for temporal spillover between subsequent seasons. However, most male–male interactions served to distract successful males and may lead to spatial spillover of females into territories of unsuccessful males. In marine iguanas, territorial establishment appears largely governed by hotshot processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprobability 3amales 3afemales 3abreeding season 3aterritoriality 0amating season1 aVon Haeseler, A.q(Arndt),1 aWikelski, Martin0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2002 May, v. 51, no. 6 p.579-587dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-002-0469-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010700166300001600273520136200289592002801651650001201679650001301691650002501704650002201729653002701751653001301778653002501791653001701816653001801833653001901851653002201870653000901892773010501901856008102006852000902087655001202096IND60622354020221123034600.0181124e200502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062235402DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683605hl809rr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeline, Philip10aChange in surface debris cover on Mont Blanc massif glaciers after the‘Little Ice Age’ termination  ap. 302-309.  aBecause of insulation by supraglacial debris, the dynamics of debris-covered glaciers differ from those of‘clean’ glaciers. Thus, changes in debris cover have to be taken into account when interpreting glacier fluctuations in terms of climate forcing. Three large glaciers in the Mont Blanc massif were investigated for the period since the termination of the‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA) using historical and scientific documents of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Although debris cover was limited to its frontal area until the 1840s, Miage Glacier exhibited a continuous debris cover in the first decades after the LIA, increasing to its present extent by the 1930s. On the Mer de Glace, a partial debris cover formed by coalescence of two of the four medial moraines at the close of the LIA; until 1890, these moraines have formed the present Veine noire (‘Black vein’). In contrast, Brenva Glacier had a continuous debris cover at the end of the eighteenth century, possibly following a rock avalanche in 1767. For glaciers like Mer de Glace and Miage Glacier, the close of the LIA represents a threshold marked by a rapid change in state from‘clean’ to debris-covered; for others, long-term debris accumulation or frequent rock avalanching (e.g., Brenva Glacier) mask the climate control of a slow post-LIA expansion of debris cover.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3aglaciers 3ainsulating materials 3aradiative forcing 0aDebris-covered glacier 0aHolocene 0a‘Little Ice Age’ 0aMer de Glace 0aMiage Glacier 0aBrenva Glacier 0aMont Blanc massif 0aAlps0 tHolocene.g2005 Feb., v. 15, no. 2 p.302-309dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl809rr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03731naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005500150245011100205520207500316592002802391650001902419650001802438650002802456650002402484650002402508650001002532650001502542650001702557650002302574650002202597653001802619653003402637653000802671653001602679653001802695700002202713700002102735700001602756700001902772700002702791700002202818700002302840700002302863700001802886700002302904700001302927700002502940700002002965773011002985856008503095852000903180655001203189IND60794920220221119142130.0221004e20221201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079492022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Siqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6239-821610aShort-term effects of ultrafine particles on heart rate variability: A systematic review and meta-analysis  aAn increasing number of epidemiological studies have examined the association between ultrafine particles (UFP) and imbalanced autonomic control of the heart, a potential mechanism linking particulate matter air pollution to cardiovascular disease. This study systematically reviews and meta-analyzes studies on short-term effects of UFP on autonomic function, as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV). We searched PubMed and Web of Science for articles published until June 30, 2022. We extracted quantitative measures of UFP effects on HRV with a maximum lag of 15 days from single-pollutant models. We assessed the risk of bias in the included studies regarding confounding, selection bias, exposure assessment, outcome measurement, missing data, and selective reporting. Random-effects models were applied to synthesize effect estimates on HRV of various time courses. Twelve studies with altogether 1,337 subjects were included in the meta-analysis. For an increase of 10,000 particles/cm³ in UFP assessed by central outdoor measurements, our meta-analysis showed immediate decreases in the standard deviation of the normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) by 4.0% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.1%, −0.9%] and root mean square of successive R-R interval differences (RMSSD) by 4.7% (95% CI: 9.1%, 0.0%) within 6 h after exposure. The immediate decreases in SDNN and RMSSD associated with UFP assessed by personal measurements were smaller and borderline significant. Elevated UFP were also associated with decreases in SDNN, low-frequency power, and the ratio of low-frequency to high-frequency power when pooling estimates of lags across hours to days. We did not find associations between HRV and concurrent-day UFP exposure (daily average of at least 18 h) or exposure at lags ≥ one day. Our study indicates that short-term exposure to ambient UFP is associated with decreased HRV, predominantly as an immediate response within hours. This finding highlights that UFP may contribute to the onset of cardiovascular events through autonomic dysregulation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute exposure 3aair pollution 3acardiovascular diseases 3aconfidence interval 3aexposure assessment 3aheart 3aheart rate 3aparticulates 3astandard deviation 3asystematic review 0aAir pollution 0aParticle number concentration 0aHRV 0aTime course 0aMeta-analysis1 aBreitner, Susanne1 aPickford, Regina1 aLanki, Timo1 aOkokon, Enembe1 aMorawska, L.q(Lidia),1 aSamoli, Evangelia1 aRodopoulou, Sophia1 aStafoggia, Massimo1 aRenzi, Matteo1 aSchikowski, Tamara1 aZhao, Qi1 aSchneider, Alexandra1 aPeters, Annette0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2022 Dec. 01, v. 314 p.120245-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2022.1202453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02151naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010500160300001600265520081100281592002801092650001401120650001001134650001901144650001201163650001001175650001601185650001001201650001301211650002601224650001401250650001101264650001401275650001901289651000901308653001701317653001301334653002601347653001501373653001901388653001101407653001001418653000901428700002501437773010501462856008101567852000901648655001201657IND60622354220221123034610.0181124e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062235422DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683605hl811rr2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMauz, B.10aPalaeosols in Saharan and Sahelian dunes of Chad: archives of Holocene North African climate changes  ap. 453-458.  aLimnic sediments and palaeosols are frequently present in dunes of the Sahara and Sahel deserts of Chad. This study focused on genesis and degree of development of the palaeosols and the timing of soil formation. The soils are Cambic Arenosols formed by precipitation-induced silicate weathering and leaching. The upper parts of the Cambic Arenosols are indurated due to accumulation of salt and amorphous silica during a drier climate following soil formation. The optical age data reveal the occurrence of one or two distinct short-lived humid climate intervals shortly after-5 ka and before-2.5 ka and the formation of local desert lakes shortly after -5 ka. The study further suggests that rapid climate changes occurred mainly in the mid-Holocene whereas the early-Holocene humid period lasted longer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArenosols 3aSahel 3aclimate change 3adeserts 3adunes 3ahumid zones 3alakes 3aleaching 3apaleosolic soil types 3asediments 3asilica 3asilicates 3asoil formation 3aChad 0aNorth Africa 0aHolocene 0ahumid climate periods 0apalaeosols 0aoptical dating 0aSahara 0aSahel 0aChad1 aFelix-Henningsen, P.0 tHolocene.g2005 Apr., v. 15, no. 3 p.453-458dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl811rr3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02518naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011400163300001600277520107700293592002801370650001901398650001301417650002101430650001301451650001501464650001501479650002401494650001501518651001801533651001101551653001101562653001301573653002301586653001901609653001601628653002601644653001401670653001301684653001801697700001801715700001701733700002401750700002301774700002001797773010501817856008101922852000902003655001202012IND60622354720221117175624.0181124e200504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062235472DNAL7 a10.1191/0959683605hl817rp2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHumlum, Ole10aLate-Holocene glacier growth in Svalbard, documented by subglacial relict vegetation and living soil microbes  ap. 396-407.  aMuch renewed research interest in Arctic regions stems from the increasing concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases and the alleged climatic sensitivity of high latitude areas. Glacier and permafrost changes are among a number of proxies used for monitoring past and present Arctic climate change. Here we present observations on frozen in situ soil and vegetation, found below cold-based glacier Longyearbreen (78° 13'N), 2 km upstream from the present glacier terminus. Dating of the relict vegetation indicates that the glacier has increased in length from about 3 km to its present size of about 5 km during the last c. 1100 years. The meteorological setting of non-surging Longyearbreen suggests this example of late-Holocene glacier growth represents a widespread phenomenon in Svalbard and in adjoining Arctic regions. In addition, we use the subglacial permafrozen soil system to evaluate microbial survival capacity over considerable time periods, and we present evidence for microbes having survived more than 1100 years in a subglacial, permafrozen state.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aglaciers 3agreenhouse gases 3alatitude 3amonitoring 3apermafrost 3asoil microorganisms 3avegetation 3aArctic region 3aNorway 0aArctic 0aSvalbard 0aglacier variations 0aclimate change 0aradiocarbon 0asubglacial vegetation 0apalaeosol 0amicrobes 0alate Holocene1 aElberling, Bo1 aHormes, Anne1 aFjordheim, Kristine1 aHansen, Odd Harald1 aHeinemeier, Jan0 tHolocene.g2005 Apr., v. 15, no. 3 p.396-407dSage PublicationswJournal:J000001502x0959-68367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1191/0959683605hl817rp3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002200148242013600170245013000306300001600436520078400452592002801236650001901264650001401283650004101297650001501338650001101353650001501364650001001379653001001389653000801399653002001407653001201427653001001439653001001449653001901459653001201478700002301490700002601513773013001539856008201669852000901751655001201760IND60621847820221123041738.0181121e199508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062184782DNAL7 a10.1177/1082013295001002062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMariño, N.

Free and bound fractions were isolated by selective retention on a nonionic resin (Amberlite XAD-2). The free fraction was directly analyzed by means of gas chromatography and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC and GC-MS). The analysis of the bound fraction was performed following two methods: (1) by enzymttic hydrolysis, to release the volatile aglycons and (2) by TFA (trifluoroacetylation) of the glycosidic compounds. Several glycosidic compounds were identified as glucosides, arabinosides, rutinosides, and apiosides, which constitute an important grape aroma reserve.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitis vinifera 3acultivars 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aglucosides 3agrapes 3ahydrolysis 3aodors 0aaroma 0auva 0aVittis vinifera 0aMuscat. 0aaroma 0agrape 0aVitis vinifera 0aMuscat.1 aTamames, E.

The UNIFAC model was used for nonideal behavior description of the mixtures. In this application, the concentration of a 13-compound mixture was simulated. In fact, the numerical methods implemented in ProSim made it possible to attain the convergence quickly even with minor compounds. The results obtained showed that the use of ProSim results to be very advantageous because it is timesaving and improvements are attained with respect to the specific programs developed by researchers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adistillation 3amodels 3aodors 3awines 0aaroma 0avino 0adestilación 0asimulación 0aUNIFAC. 0awine aroma 0adistillation 0asimulation 0aProSim 0aUNIFAC.1 aBon, J.1 aSanjuán, N.1 aMulet, Y A.0 tFood science and technology international.g, v. 1, no. 2-3 p.117-127dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl3949853x1082-01327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1082013295001002073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03156naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245012600200300001800326506007600344520147100420592002801891506003701919650001601956650001101972650001601983650001601999650000902015650001702024650001502041650002002056650001102076650002002087650001202107650001402119650001302133650002602146650002102172650001602193650001802209650001002227700001902237700001902256700001502275700002002290700001802310700001502328700001802343700001802361773011602379856007402495852000902569655001202578IND60342601920221207075848.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034260192DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.133692doi7 aPMC48953732pmcid7 a261185702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNussbaum, L.K.10aAbdominal Ultrasound Examination Findings in 534 Hyperthyroid Cats Referred for Radioiodine Treatment Between 2007–2010  ap. 1069-1073.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The prevalence of concurrent disease in hyperthyroid cats is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To identify the prevalence of concurrent intra‐abdominal disease using abdominal ultrasound examination (AUS) in hyperthyroid cats referred for radioactive iodine treatment (RIT) and to determine whether the requirement for pretreatment AUS is justified. ANIMALS: Five hundred and thirty‐four client‐owned cats diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and referred for RIT. METHODS: Retrospective study. Age, breed, sex, body weight, clinical signs, total serum T4 concentration, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration, serum creatinine concentration, urine specific gravity (USG), AUS results, and biopsy or cytology results, or both (if obtained) were collected from the medical records. RESULTS: The prevalence of concurrent disease identified using AUS in hyperthyroid cats referred for RIT was 36.1%; 22.8% of the cats in the study had renal disease and 2.4% had confirmed neoplasia. Significant differences in median USG (P value 0.032) and median BUN (P value 0.028) were found between cats that had abnormal kidneys on AUS compared to those with normal‐appearing kidneys. Only 2.2% of the cats were not treated with RIT as a result of changes identified on AUS and subsequently obtained cytology or biopsy results. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The results indicate that pretreatment AUS in hyperthyroid cats referred for RIT is unnecessary in most patients.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aL-thyroxine 3abiopsy 3ablood serum 3abody weight 3acats 3acell biology 3acreatinine 3ahyperthyroidism 3aiodine 3akidney diseases 3akidneys 3aneoplasms 3apatients 3aretrospective studies 3aspecific gravity 3aultrasonics 3aurea nitrogen 3aurine1 aScavelli, T.D.1 aScavelli, D.M.1 aPintar, J.1 aHenderson, A.K.1 aDeMarco, J.A.1 aWorwag, S.1 aBastian, R.P.1 aKittner, H.S.0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2015 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.1069-1073dJ.B.

The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival. Methods Data from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m ² plots from 1994 to 2011. Key Results Median leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to >1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115–867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits. Conclusions The wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acorrelation 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3alianas 3alife history 3alongevity 3amortality 3aontogeny 3aseedlings 3ashade tolerance 3ashrubs 3atrees 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aunderstory 3awoody plants 2aAnimals 2aHerbivory 2aLight 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aSeedlingsxgrowth & development. 2aTreesxgrowth & development 2aTropical Climate 3aPanama 0aFracture toughness 0aherbivory 0aleaf life span 0aleaf density 0aleaf toughness 0alight environment 0aontogenetic changes 0aphenotypic plasticity 0aseedling survival 0astem density 0atropical lianas 0atropical trees1 aCordero, Roberto A.1 aWright, S.

The concentration of coating antigen, biotinylated monoclonal antibody specific to ZEN, avidin-horseradish peroxidase and reaction time in the system of BA-ELISA method were optimised. Under the optimum conditions, a good linear relationship between binding ratio and ZEN concentration in the range of 0.54 to 7.99 ng/mL was obtained. The regression equation was y=−21.26 ln(x)+66.89 (R ²=0.9989). The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.35 ng/mL and 0.812 ng/mL. The IC ₅₀ was calculated to be 2.071 ng/mL. In comparison with the traditional ELISA method, the sensitivity of BA-ELISA method developed has been elevated by six times. The recovery and coefficient of variation with the spiked corn samples were in the range of 86.6% to 93.7% and less than 7.8%, respectively. It promises a bright future for the sensitive and rapid detecting method of ZEN residues in corn.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3acorn 3adetection limit 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aequations 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aperoxidase 3azearalenone 0abiotin-avidin amplified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BA-ELISA) 0azearalenone 0adetection 0acorn1 aXu, Yang1 aHe, Qinghua1 aChu, Jinsheng1 aDu, Bibai1 aLiu, Jing0 tFood and agricultural immunology.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 25, no. 2 p.186-199dTaylor & Francisx1465-34437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09540105.2012.7595403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02764naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245005900173300001400232520158800246592002801834650001701862650001301879650000901892650002101901650001401922650001101936650001301947650001901960650001401979650002001993650001202013653001702025653001902042653001302061653002102074700001902095700001702114773012002131856008202251852000902333655001202342IND60613593220221121010046.0190131e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061359322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jes.2018.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitrova, Tsvetelina10aDetoxification of ferrocyanide in asoil–plant system  ap. 54-64.  aThe detoxification of iron cyanide in a soil–plant system was investigated to assess the total cyanide extracted from contaminated soil and allocated in the leaf tissue of willow trees (Salix caprea). They were grown in soil containing up to 1000 mg/kg dry weight (dw) of cyanide (CN), added as 15N-labeled potassium ferrocyanide and prepared with a new method for synthesis of labeled iron cyanides. CN content and 15N enrichment were monitored weekly over the exposure in leaf tissue of different age. The 15N enrichment in the young and old leaf tissue reached up to 15.197‰ and 9063‰, respectively; it increased significantly over the exposure and with increasing exposure concentrations (p < 0.05). Although the CN accumulation in the old leaf tissue was higher, compared to the young leaf tissue (p < 0.05), the 15N enrichment in the two tissue types did not differ statistically. This indicates a non-uniform CN accumulation but a uniform 15N allocation throughout the leaf mass. Significant differences were detected between the measured CN content and the C15N content, calculated from the 15N enrichment (p < 0.05), revealing a significant CN fraction within the leaf tissue, which could not be detected as ionic CN. The application of labeled iron CN clearly shows that CN is detoxified during uptake by the willows. However, these results do not exclude other detoxification pathways, not related to the trees. Still, they are strongly indicative of the central role the trees played in CN removal and detoxification under the experimental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalix caprea 3acyanides 3airon 3aisotope labeling 3aleaf mass 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3apolluted soils 3apotassium 3astable isotopes 3awillows 0aIron cyanide 0aDetoxification 0aExposure 0aPhytoremediation1 aRepmann, Frank1 aFreese, Dirk0 tJournal of environmental sciences (China).g2019 Mar., v. 77 p.54-64dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12417x1001-07427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jes.2018.06.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01894naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245005400162300001800216500001100234520090400245592002801149650000801177650001301185650001701198650001901215650001401234650001401248650001001262650001301272650001601285650001101301650001401312650001201326773010001338856007301438852000901511655001201520IND60571447720221117231216.0170712e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057144772DNAL7 a10.1111/nph.142182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelnyk, Charles W.10aConnecting the plant vasculature to friend or foe  ap. 1611-1617.  aREVIEW  aContents 1611 I. 1611 II. 1612 III. 1612 IV. 1614 V. 1614 VI. 1614 VII. 1615 VIII. 1616 1616 References 1616 SUMMARY: The plant vasculature transports water, sugars, hormones, RNAs and proteins. Such critical functions need to be protected from attack by pests and pathogens or from damage by wounding. Plants have developed mechanisms to repair vasculature when such protections fail and to even initiate new vascular connections to tissues supporting symbionts. The developmental phenomena underlying vascular repair and rewiring are therefore critical for horticultural grafting, for plant infection and for mutualist associations with rhizosphere microbes. Despite the biological and economic interest, we are only beginning to understand how plants connect and reconnect their vasculature to a wide variety of organisms. Here, I discuss recent work and future prospects for this emerging field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3ahormones 3ahorticulture 3amicroorganisms 3amutualism 3apathogens 3apests 3aproteins 3arhizosphere 3asugars 3asymbionts 3atissues0 tnew phytologist.g2017 Mar., v. 213, no. 4 p.1611-1617dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.142183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005200147245010500199300001800304520130400322592002801626596002401654596002401678650001601702650001501718650002601733650002401759650001401783650002101797650002001818650001701838650003001855650000901885650001201894650002801906650001601934650001501950650001601965650001901981650001302000650001402013700001902027700001602046700001802062700001902080700002102099700001802120773012002138856008102258852000902339655001202348IND60649658320221118025239.0190705e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064965832DNAL7 a10.1007/s10457-018-0242-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaas, J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8188-789110aToxicity assessment of plant extracts to Cleruchoides noackae Lin and Huber (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae)  ap. 1297-1305.  aExtracts of Matricaria chamomilla, Maytenus ilicifolia and Echinodorus grandiflorus have been integrated as viable pest management strategy for controlling bronze bug Thaumastocoris peregrinus (Hemipetra: Thaumastocoridae) due to their insecticidal activities. However, the side effects of these extracts on Cleruchoides noackae (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae), the main biological control agent against the bronze bug of eucalyptus, have never been studied. The objective of this study was to verify the effect of 5% aqueous extracts of M. chamomilla, M. ilicifolia and E. grandiflorus on C. noackae. Tests with eggs treated before being offered to the parasitoid female (pre-parasitism) and tests on which the eggs were treated 1 and 7 days after the female had performed oviposition (post-parasitism) were carried out. There was no difference between the treatments and the control group regarding parasitoid emergence in none of the tests. Although, there was increase in egg viability and number of emerged parasitoids when comparing the eggs treated 1 and 7 days after parasitism for all treatments. In conclusion, none of the plant extracts caused any harmful effect on C. noackae under lab conditions, indicating they may be an environment-friendly option to control the bronze bug of eucalyptus.  aPublisher supplied data  a6534/2014-07cCAPES  a481644/2013-0cCNPq 3aEchinodorus 3aEucalyptus 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3aMaytenus ilicifolia 3aMymaridae 3aThaumastocoridae 3aadverse effects 3aagroforestry 3abiological control agents 3aeggs 3afemales 3ainsecticidal properties 3aoviposition 3aparasitism 3aparasitoids 3aplant extracts 3atoxicity 3aviability1 aBarbosa, L.

A fundamental challenge in these applications is the formation of sensitive and stable electrodes. In this article we report the development of a wearable sensor based on carbon nanotube (CNT) electrode arrays for sweat sensing. Solid-state ion selective electrodes (ISEs), sensitive to Na⁺ ions, were prepared by drop coating plasticized poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) doped with ionophore and ion exchanger on CNT electrodes. The ion selective membrane (ISM) filled the intertubular spaces of the highly porous CNT film and formed an attachment that was stronger than that achieved with flat Au, Pt, or carbon electrodes. Concentration of the ISM solution used influenced the attachment to the CNT film, the ISM surface morphology, and the overall performance of the sensor. Sensitivity of 56 ± 3 mV/decade to Na⁺ ions was achieved. Optimized solid-state reference electrodes (REs), suitable for wearable applications, were prepared by coating CNT electrodes with colloidal dispersion of Ag/AgCl, agarose hydrogel with 0.5 M NaCl, and a passivation layer of PVC doped with NaCl. The CNT-based REs had low sensitivity (−1.7 ± 1.2 mV/decade) toward the NaCl solution and high repeatability and were superior to bare Ag/AgCl, metals, carbon, and CNT films, reported previously as REs. CNT-based ISEs were calibrated against CNT-based REs, and the short-term stability of the system was tested. We demonstrate that CNT-based devices implemented on a flexible support are a very attractive platform for future wearable technology devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagarose 3acarbon 3acarbon electrodes 3acarbon nanotubes 3acoatings 3aelectronics 3agold 3ahydrogels 3aions 3aplatinum 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3asilver 3asilver chloride 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3aspecific ion electrodes 3asweat 0aion-selective electrode 0asolid contact 0acarbon nanotube 0asolid reference electrode 0awearable device 0aelectrochemical sensor1 aDavid-Pur, Moshe1 aHanein, Yael0 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2017 Oct. 11, v. 9, no. 40 p.35169-35177dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.7b073463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245004200201300001600243520200800259592002802267650001502295650002102310650001202331650002402343650001302367650001102380650002202391650002302413650001702436650001702453650001502470650001102485653001602496653001802512773012102530856008002651852000902731655001202740IND60751189420221120222433.0210923e20201203xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075118942DNAL7 a10.1093/advances/nmaa1352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Paul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0844-644810aStarvation and Its Effects on the Gut  ap. 897-903.  aThere is growing awareness that intestinal dysfunction determines the clinical outcomes of situations as diverse as undernourished children in urban tropical slums and undernourished surgical patients in intensive care units. As experimental starvation in humans has only rarely been studied, and largely not using current biomedical research tools, we must draw inference from disparate clinical and experimental observations as to the derangements present in the starved gut. There is good evidence of intestinal atrophy and achlorhydria in starvation and severe undernutrition. Historical reports from concentration camps and conflict settings consistently reported a noncontagious phenomenon called “hunger diarrhea,” but in settings where starved individuals are isolated from others (prisoners on hunger strike, anorexia nervosa) diarrhea is not a feature. Changes in intestinal permeability and absorption have been infrequently studied in experimental starvation; available data suggest that short-term starvation reduces sugar absorption but not permeability. Severe acute malnutrition in children is associated with severe changes in the intestinal mucosa. Experimental animal models may help explain some observations in humans. Starved rats develop a hypersecretory state and intestinal barrier defects. Starved pigs demonstrate prolongation of rotavirus diarrhea and reproduce some of the absorptive and barrier defects observed in malnourished children. However, there remains much to be learned about the effects of starvation on the gut. Given the high prevalence of undernutrition in hospitals and disadvantaged communities, the lack of attention to the interaction between undernutrition and gastrointestinal damage is surprising and needs to be corrected. Current sophisticated cellular and molecular techniques now provide the opportunity to create fresh understanding of gastrointestinal changes in pure undernutrition, using volunteer studies and samples from anorexia nervosa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aanorexia nervosa 3aatrophy 3abiomedical research 3adiarrhea 3ahunger 3aintestinal mucosa 3alaboratory animals 3amalnutrition 3apermeability 3astarvation 3asugars 0aenteropathy 0amalabsorption0 tAdvances in nutrition.g2020 Dec. 03, v. 12, no. 3 p.897-903dOxford University PresswJournal:2280x2156-53767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/advances/nmaa1353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03114naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009100173300001800264520169900282592002801981650001502009650002302024650001702047650002802064650001902092650001702111650001402128650001102142650002202153650001702175650001502192650003302207653002202240653001602262653003702278653003002315653002702345653002402372700002102396700002302417773012202440856008502562852000902647655001202656IND60647493820221122222727.0190711e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKinoshita, Masanao10aMechanism of local anesthetic-induced disruption of raft-like ordered membrane domains  ap. 1381-1389.  aBecause ordered membrane domains, called lipid rafts, regulate activation of ion channels related to the nerve pulse, lipids rafts are thought to be a possible target for anesthetic molecules. To understand the mechanism of anesthetic action, we examined influence of representative local anesthetics (LAs); dibucaine, tetracaine, and lidocaine, on raft-like liquid-ordered (Lo)/non-raft-like liquid-disordered (Ld) phase separation.Impact of LAs on the phase separation was observed by fluorescent microscopy. LA-induced perturbation of the Lo and Ld membranes was examined by DPH anisotropy measurements. Incorporation of LAs to the membranes was examined by fluorescent anisotropy of LAs. The biding location of the LAs was indicated by small angle x-ray diffraction (SAXD).Fluorescent experiments showed that dibucaine eliminated the phase separation the most effectively, followed by tetracaine and lidocaine. The disruption of the phase separation can be explained by their disordering effects on the Lo membrane. SAXD and other experiments further suggested that dibucaine's most potent perturbation of the Lo membrane is attributable to its deeper immersion and bulky molecular structure. Tetracaine, albeit immersed in the Lo membrane as deeply as dibucaine, less perturbs the Lo membrane probably because of its smaller bulkiness. Lidocaine hardly reaches the hydrophobic region, resulting in the weakest Lo membrane perturbation.Dibcaine perturbs the Lo membrane the most effectively, followed by tetracaine and lidocaine. This ranking correlates with their anesthetic potency.This study suggests a possible mechanistic link between anesthetic action and perturbation of lipid rafts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3achemical structure 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3aion channels 3alidocaine 3alipids 3alocal anesthetics 3anerve tissue 3aseparation 3asmall-angle X-ray scattering 0aLocal anesthetics 0aLipid rafts 0aFluorescent sphingomyelin analog 0aElectron density profiles 0aFluorescent anisotropy 0aArtificial membrane1 aChitose, Takeshi1 aMatsumori, Nobuaki0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta.g2019 Sept., v. 1863, no. 9 p.1381-1389dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11872x0304-41657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbagen.2019.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01492naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245014500160300001800305520032300323592002800646650002300674650002300697650001600720650001400736650001600750700001600766700001800782700001900800700002200819700002700841700002600868700001800894773013400912856007501046852000901121655001201130IND60658744620221120113937.0190826e20101123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065874462DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc02024a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMercurol, Julie10a[FeᴵᴵLSCoᴵᴵᴵLS]₂ ⇔ [FeᴵᴵᴵLSCoᴵᴵHS]₂ photoinduced conversion in a cyanide-bridged heterobimetallic molecular square  ap. 8995-8997.  aThe self-assembly of [Feᴵᴵᴵ{B(pz)₄}(CN)₃]⁻ and [Coᴵᴵ(bik)₂(S)₂]²⁺ affords the diamagnetic cyanide-bridged [FeᴵᴵLSCoᴵᴵᴵLS]₂ molecular square which is converted into the corresponding magnetic [FeᴵᴵᴵLSCoᴵᴵHS]₂ species under light irradiation at relatively low temperatures.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical compounds 3achemical reactions 3airradiation 3amagnetism 3atemperature1 aLi, Yanling1 aPardo, Emilio1 aRisset, Olivia1 aSeuleiman, Mannan1 aRousselière, Hélène1 aLescouëzec, Rodrigue1 aJulve, Miguel0 tChemical communications.g2010 Nov. 23, v. 46, no. 47 p.8995-8997dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc02024a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01969naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006400147245008100211300001600292520085800308592002801166650002301194650002201217650001501239650001501254650001301269650001401282650001101296650001901307650001101326651002201337700002901359700001801388773011001406856008201516852000901598655001201607IND60593442920221123030826.0191228e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059344292DNAL7 a10.1007/s10164-018-0543-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallagher, Austin J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1515-344010aApex predatory sharks and crocodiles simultaneously scavenge a whale carcass  ap. 205-209.  aScavenging is an important component to the overall ecology of consumers in virtually all ecosystems on Earth. Given the energetic benefits of foraging on these resource subsidies, opportunistic predators will adjust their behaviors accordingly to maximize access. One of the many consequences of large-scale scavenging opportunities is species interactions that are rarely observed in nature. Here we describe the first published record of predatory sharks (tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier) and saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) foraging together in space and time, as documented on a large whale carcass off Western Australia. We report on and discuss the behaviors of the sharks and crocodiles in the hope of shedding new light on the interactions between apex predators that are rarely seen together, but may overlap under specific contexts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrocodylus porosus 3aGaleocerdo cuvier 3acrocodiles 3aecosystems 3aforaging 3apredators 3asharks 3aspace and time 3awhales 3aWestern Australia1 aPapastamatiou, Yannis P.1 aBarnett, Adam0 tJournal of ethology.g2018 May, v. 36, no. 2 p.205-209dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl42016x0289-07717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10164-018-0543-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245008500157300002000242500001900262520169500281592002801976650001302004650001302017650001702030650001302047650001502060650001302075650001902088650001602107650002002123650001902143650002802162650001002190653001102200653001502211653002502226653002402251653002502275700001902300700001802319700001302337700001202350700001502362700001402377700005802391773014302449856007802592852000902670655001202679IND60713761020221119113411.0201023e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071376102DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c144712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Dan10aRobust Waterborne Superhydrophobic Coatings with Reinforced Composite Interfaces  ap. 48216-48224.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWaterborne superhydrophobic coatings have attracted tremendous attention recently, but their practical applications are severely limited by hydrophobic instability and poor mechanical durability. Herein, a novel robust waterborne PTFE-CP&MgO-AOP superhydrophobic coating was successfully fabricated by reinforcing composite interfaces. Combined with the self-polymerization of dopamine and the in situ grown MgO, CNTs-polydopamine&MgO (CP&MgO) particles with improved interfacial compatibility were obtained. Through the cross-linking and hydrogen bonding interactions, phosphate networks (CP&MgO-AOP) with the aluminum orthophosphate (AOP) binder were formed during dehydration polymerization. The phosphate networks not only enhanced the interfacial interaction among CP&MgO to form coral-like structures but also strengthened the interfacial binding force between the waterborne polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coating and the substrate. With the enhanced composite interfacial strength, the waterborne PTFE-CP&MgO-AOP coating exhibited excellent wear-resistance, which can withstand more than 1.27 × 10⁵ abrasion cycles. Moreover, the chemical bonding between the functional groups of phosphate networks and metal substrate improved the adhesion strength from grade 5 to 1. Furthermore, the prepared coating surface with the reticular/coral-like composite structures can lock the stable gas layer to maintain excellent hydrophobic stability, even under the conditions of strong acidic/alkaline, high-temperature, xenon lamp irradiation, and mechanical wear. Thus, this study is expected to open new insights into interfacial enhancement of robust waterborne superhydrophobic coatings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaluminum 3acrosslinking 3adopamine 3adurability 3ahydrogen 3ahydrophobicity 3airradiation 3aorthophosphates 3apolymerization 3apolytetrafluoroethylene 3axenon 0arobust 0awaterborne 0aenvironment-friendly 0asuperhydrophobicity 0acomposite interfaces1 aZhang, Xiguang1 aYuan, Sicheng1 aLi, Yuan1 aXu, Fei1 aWang, Xiao1 aLi, Cheng1 aWang, Huaiyuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6283-93170 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Sept. 30, v. 12, no. 42 p.48216-48224dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c144713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02732naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245010900160300001600269520135000285592002801635650001701663650001901680650001601699650001801715650002001733650000901753650001301762650002101775650001501796650001301811650001501824653001601839653002001855653002401875653000901899700001401908700001301922700001301935700001701948700001401965700001901979700002101998700001602019773011202035856008202147852000902229655001202238IND60584772420221119052037.0190401e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058477242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2017.10.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJing, Li10aMetallothionein prevents doxorubicin cardiac toxicity by indirectly regulating the uncoupling proteins 2  ap. 204-213.  aDoxorubicin (Dox) is a broad-spectrum anticancer agent, but its clinical use is restricted due to irreversible cardiac toxicity. Metallothionein (MT) can inhibit Dox-induced cardiac toxicity. Applying a proteomics approach we determined that uncoupling proteins (UCPs) may be implicated in this process. This study was designed to examine the mechanisms of MT against Dox cardiac toxicity and the link between MT and UCP2. In vivo, wild-type (MT+/+) and MT-I/II null (MT−/−) mice were given a single dose of Dox (15 mg/kg, i.p.) and sacrificed at 4 days after Dox injection. In vitro, cardiomyocytes were prepared from MT−/− and MT+/+ neonatal mice and cardiomyocytes were pretreated with typical antioxidant NAC or the UCP2 inhibitor genipin followed by exposure to Dox. Based on the results, genipin enhanced Dox-induced oxidative injury, particularly in MT−/− cardiomyocyte. UCP2 levels in MT−/− mice were significantly lower compared to MT+/+ mice treated with Dox. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated that MT did not directly bind to UCP2. The NAC and Nrf2 activator oltipraz inhibit the decrease of UCP2 expression induced by Dox. Therefore, attenuating free radical damage with UCP2 help MT antagonize the Dox-induced cardiac toxicity, but does not directly bind MT. MT may regulate UCP2 expression by up-regulating Nrf2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidants 3acardiomyocytes 3adoxorubicin 3afree radicals 3ametallothionein 3amice 3aneonates 3aprecipitin tests 3aproteomics 3atoxicity 3atoxicology 0aDoxorubicin 0aMetallothionein 0aUncoupling proteins 0aNrf21 aYang, Man1 aLi, Yang1 aYu, Yang1 aLiang, Baolu1 aCao, Lige1 aZhou, Xianqing1 aPeng, Shuangqing1 aSun, Zhiwei0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2017 Dec., v. 110 p.204-213dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2017.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01733naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002000183245010900203300002000312506007600332520051900408592002800927506003700955650001900992650001601011650002801027650001301055700002201068700001701090700002401107700001901131773013401150856007801284852000901362655001201371IND60583326920221207063712.0171011e20171011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058332692DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.7b092652doi7 aPMC57180572pmcid7 a289426432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichl, Kyle D.10aBiomimetic Total Synthesis of (±)-Griffipavixanthone via a Cationic Cycloaddition–Cyclization Cascade  ap. 14053-14056.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the concise, biomimetic total synthesis of the dimeric, Diels–Alder natural product griffipavixanthone from a readily accessible prenylated xanthone monomer.

However, comparison between different types of land use strategies is challenging as land use has a multitude of expressions and intensities. The quantitative method presented here facilitates the exploration and synthetization of uneven archaeological and textual evidence from past societies. The approach quantifies the area required for habitation, agriculture, arboriculture, pasturage, and fuel supply, based on a combination of archaeological, historical, ethnographic and modern evidence from the relevant geographical region. It is designed to stimulate discussion and can be used to test a wide range of hypotheses regarding local and regional economies, ancient trade and redistribution, and the resilience and/or vulnerability of past societies to environmental change. The method also helps identify where our gaps in knowledge are in understanding past human–environment interaction, the ecological footprint of past cultures and their influence on the landscape in a transparent and quantitative manner. The present article focuses especially on the impact of dietary estimates and crop yield estimates, two main elements in calculating land use in past societies due to their uncertainty as well as their significant impact on calculations. By employing archaeological data, including botanical, zoological and isotopic evidence, alongside available textual sources, this method seeks to improve land use and land cover change models by increasing their representativeness and accuracy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarboriculture 3aarchaeology 3acrop yield 3aecological footprint 3afuels 3aland use 3aland use and land cover maps 3alandscapes 3alivelihood 3amodels 3aquantitative analysis 3aspace and time 3atrade 3auncertainty1 aWeiberg, Erika1 aBonnier, Anton1 aFinné, Martin1 aKaplan, Jed O.0 tLand.g2018 Jan. 16, v. 7, no. 1dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21555x2073-445X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land70100093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01256naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245007000168300001600238520030900254592002800563650002300591650001200614650001100626650001400637650001600651700001900667700002200686700002000708773013000728856007500858852000900933655001200942IND60658744920221120125055.0190826e20101206xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065874492DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc02033h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmith, Elana A.

In this study, the functions of NO and ROS in SO2-induced death of lower epidermal guard cells in ornamental plant Tagetes erecta were investigated. The results showed that SO2 derivatives (0.4–4.0mmolL−1 of final concentrations) could reduce the guard cells' viability and increase their death rates in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, the significant increase of cellular NO, ROS, and Ca2+ levels (P<0.05) and typical apoptosis features including nucleus condensation, nucleus break and nucleus fragmentation were observed. However, exposure to 2.0mmolL−1 of SO2 derivatives combined with either NO antagonists (NO scavenger c-PTIO; nitrate reductase inhibitor NaN3; NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME), ROS scavenger (AsA or CAT) or Ca2+ antagonists (Ca2+ scavenger EGTA or plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker LaCl3) can effectively block SO2-induced guard cells death and corresponding increase of NO, ROS and Ca2+ levels. In addition, addition of L-NAME or AsA in 2.0mmolL−1 of SO2 derivatives led to significant decrease in the levels of NO, ROS and Ca2+, whereas addition of LaCl3 in them just resulted in the decrease of Ca2+ levels, hardly making effects on NO and ROS levels. It was concluded that NO and ROS were involved in the apoptosis induced by SO2 in T. erecta, which regulated the cell apoptosis at the upstream of Ca2+.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTagetes erecta 3aantagonists 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3acalcium channel blockers 3acalcium channels 3adeath 3adose response 3aethylene glycol tetraacetic acid 3aguard cells 3amortality 3anitrate reductase 3anitric oxide 3anitric oxide synthase 3aornamental plants 3aplasma membrane 3areactive oxygen species 3asignal transduction 3asulfur dioxide 3aviability 0aSO2 0aNO 0aROS 0aTagetes erecta 0aGuard cell apoptosis1 aFu, Baocun1 aWang, Yunshan1 aZhai, Xiaoyan1 aXin, Xiaojing1 aZhang, Chao1 aCao, Dongmei1 aZhang, Xiaobing0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2015 Apr., v. 114 p.198-203dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100001200146245007500158300001600233520087100249592002801120650001401148650001501162650000901177650000901186650001401195650000901209650001301218700001401231700001501245700001601260700001801276773009101294856008201385852000901467655001201476IND4460155220221119165821.0141101e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446015522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIff, I.14aThe use of an acoustic device to identify the epidural space in cattle  ap. 267-268.  aTwelve healthy cattle (weighing 188–835kg) were placed in stocks and sedated with xylazine. Caudal epidural puncture was performed using an acoustic device that indicated a decrease in resistance with a change in pitch. Lidocaine was injected to verify correct needle placement by assessing needle prick stimuli applied on the left and right side of the tail root and the perineal region, and the loss of tail and anal sphincter tone. Pressure measurements were recorded during penetration of the different tissue layers and in the epidural space. A clear and sudden decrease in the pitch of the acoustic signal was audible in all 12 cattle. All cows showed clinical effects indicating successful epidural anaesthesia. The pressure in the epidural space after puncture was −19±10mmHg. The device may be of assistance in identifying the epidural space in cattle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacoustics 3aanesthesia 3aanus 3acows 3alidocaine 3atail 3axylazine1 aFranz, S.1 aMosing, M.1 aLechner, T.1 aMoens, Y.P.S.0 tveterinary journal.g2011 Feb., v. 187, no. 2 p.267-268dElsevier Ltdx1090-02337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tvjl.2010.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03473naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245012500190300001600315520134600331592002801677650002001705650001501725650001701740650001901757650001801776650001601794650002001810650001701830650001701847650001701864650001701881650001301898650001101911650001001922650002301932650002801955650001901983650004502002650002302047650004002070650002302110650002202133650001102155650002702166650001502193650001802208650002302226650002402249650001102273650004702284650002602331650000902357650001602366650001702382650004502399700002302444700002002467700002502487700001802512700002202530700002902552773008002581856008102661852000902742655001202751IND50067150420221119080125.0141112e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006715042DNAL7 a235105682pmid7 a10.1016/j.nut.2013.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorrêa, Telma A.F.10aPaper-filtered coffee increases cholesterol and inflammation biomarkers independent of roasting degree: A clinical trial  ap. 977-981.  aOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of medium light roast (MLR) and medium roast (MR) paper-filtered coffee on cardiovascular risk factors in healthy volunteers. METHODS: This randomized crossover trial compared the effects of consuming three or four cups (150 mL) of MLR or MR coffee per day for 4 wk in 20 healthy volunteers. Plasma lipids, lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), total homocysteine, and endothelial dysfunction–related inflammation biomarkers, serum glycemic biomarkers, and blood pressure were measured at baseline and after each intervention. RESULTS: Both roasts increased plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) concentrations (10%, 12%, and 18% for MLR; 12%, 14%, and 14% for MR, respectively) (P < 0.05). MR also increased high-density lipoportein-cholesterol concentration by 7% (P = 0.003). Plasma fibrinogen concentration increased 8% after MR intake (P = 0.01), and soluble E-selectin increased 12% after MLR intake (P = 0.02). No changes were observed for Lp(a), total homocysteine, glycemic biomarkers, and blood pressure. CONCLUSION: Moderate paper-filtered coffee consumption may have an undesirable effect on plasma cholesterol and inflammation biomarkers in healthy individuals regardless of its antioxidant content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3abiomarkers 3ablood lipids 3ablood pressure 3acell adhesion 3acholesterol 3aclinical trials 3ahomocysteine 3ainflammation 3alipoproteins 3arisk factors 3aroasting 3aroasts 2aAdult 2aBiomarkersxblood. 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBlood Pressure 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCoffeexadverse effectsxchemistry. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aE-Selectinxblood 2aFemale 2aFibrinogenxmetabolism 2aFiltration 2aFood Handling 2aHealthy Volunteers 2aHomocysteinexblood 2aHumans 2aInflammationxmetabolismxphysiopathology. 2aLipoprotein(a)xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRisk Factors 2aVascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1xblood1 aRogero, Marcelo M.1 aMioto, Bruno M.1 aTarasoutchi, Daniela1 aTuda, Vera L.1 aCésar, Luiz A.M.1 aTorres, Elizabeth A.F.S.0 tNutrition.g2013 , v. 29, no. 7-8 p.977-981dElsevier Inc.x0899-90077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nut.2013.01.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01565naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001400156245010600170300001500276520052200291592002800813650001200841650001300853650001300866650001000879650003700889650001300926650001400939650001000953650001500963700002600978700001801004700001601022773009901038856005701137852000901194655001201203IND50085917920221118232612.0140412e199406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008591792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2052.1994.tb00411.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHojný, J14aThe porcine M blood group system: evidence to suggest assignment of its Ml factor to a new system (P)  ap. 99-101.  aA new allele Mᵃᵉʲᵐ and a more precise genetic analysis of the Ml factor previously assigned to the M system are described after screening three generation families (Wild Boar × Pietrain, Meishan × Pietrain) for the M blood group system using a complete set of 13 M reagents.

Up to now, there was still no appropriate method to reduce the cytotoxicity while improving the anti-cancer activity of Ag NPs. This paper focuses on counteracting the toxic side effect of the ROS from Ag NPs while simultaneously improving their anti-cancer effect. We used α-TOS to modify Ag NPs and investigated their bioactivity in vitro for the first time. The modified Ag NPs with a high α-TOS concentration not only show much higher anti-tumor activity than Ag NPs alone but also promote the survival of normal cell lines slightly, while the modified Ag NPs with a low α-TOS concentration display a lower cytotoxicity against normal cell lines without affecting their anti-cancer activity when compared to Ag NPs alone. Therefore, this work presents a higher potential for cancer treatment than using Ag NPs alone.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantineoplastic activity 3acytotoxicity 3aions 3ananosilver 3aneoplasms 3areactive oxygen species 3asilver1 aCai, Yuchun1 aTu, Zhengchao1 aLuo, Jinfeng1 aQiao, Xueliang1 aChen, Qingyuan1 aZhang, Wanzhong0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 28, v. 5, no. 100 p.82050-82055dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra12911g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02625naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024002200133024001900155040001800174100002100192245012600213500001900339506007600358520103900434592002801473506003701501650001401538650001101552650002501563650001001588650000901598650001101607650001701618653002201635653002201657653002801679653001801707653001901725653001401744653001901758653002601777653001501803700003101818700006801849700002601917773009401943856008502037852000902122655001202131IND60690939020221207081042.0200508e201909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069093902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e024432doi7 aPMC67394602pmcid7 a315287522pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNalobile, Protus10aPyroprocessing and the optimum mix ratio of rice husks, broken bricks and spent bleaching earth to make pozzolanic cement  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis paper presents the findings of an experimental investigation on optimizing pozzolanic activity of a blend of Rice Husks (RH), Spent Bleaching Earth (SBE) and Broken Bricks (BB) to form pozzolana that would have pozzolanic activity comparable to natural pozzolanas. Four ratios of RH, BB, and SBE were burnt in the Fixed Bed Kiln (FBK). The starting ratio had 20 kg of RH, 0 kg of BB and 4 kg of SBE. The amount of BB was increased by 2 kg each to a maximum of 6 kg as the mass of SBE was kept constant. The resultant ashes were subjected to various pozzolanic tests. This included; saturated lime test and compressive strength analysis. It was observed that the calcined blend with 10: 1: 2 mix of RH: BB: SBE exhibited the highest pozzolanic activity. This sample was mixed with acetylene lime sludge (ALS) in the ratio of 2:1 pozzolana: ALS. The compressive strengths for these cements were tested at 2 and 28 days of curing. The compressive strengths of this cement met the required EN standards for Portland pozzolana cement.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetylene 3acement 3acompression strength 3akilns 3arice 3asludge 3avolcanic ash 0aMaterials science 0aCivil engineering 0aCalcium carbide residue 0aBroken bricks 0aBlended cement 0aPozzolana 0aPyroprocessing 0aSpent bleaching earth 0aRice husks1 aWachira, Jackson Muthengia1 aThiong'o, Joseph Karanja1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6405-84961 aMarangu, Joseph Mwiti0 tHeliyon.g2019 Sept., v. 5, no. 9 p.e02443-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e024433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01395naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245012900159300002200288520033000310592002800640650001300668650001500681650002600696650002300722650002700745700001400772700001400786700001600800700001600816700001500832773012700847856007400974852000901048655001201057IND60669498920221118003035.0190920e20151125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066949892DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra21919a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoxiao10aFriedel–Crafts alkylation of heteroarenes and arenes with indolyl alcohols for construction of 3,3-disubstituted oxindoles  ap. 101713-101717.  aAn intriguing camphorsulfonic acid catalyzed Friedel–Crafts alkylation of heteroarenes and arenes with indolyl alcohols has been developed featuring mild reaction conditions, wide substrate scope and high yields.

Air-dried biosolids and TSP were incorporated into surface soil at end of 2005, and corn (Zea mays) was planted for three consecutive years (2006–2008). Concentrations of soil extractable P except for Mehlich-3 P were always lower in the biosolids than TSP treatments at the same P rates. The soil potentially available P in water extractable P (WEP) and Olsen P derived from biosolids-P estimated by the exponential depletion model was 2–4% and 15–24% of total P in the applied biosolids, respectively. The residence time of biosolids-induced WEP and Olsen P in Midwest soil under annual corn cropping was 5 and 2 years, respectively. Corn tissue analysis showed lower increase in P concentration by biosolids-P than TSP. The elevation rate of soluble reactive P (SRP) concentration in simulated runoff was less by biosolids than TSP. Based on the data in this study, the plant availability and environmental risk of biosolids-P are lower than those of TSP in the Midwest soil, thus use of biosolids as P nutrient for corn would not cause a major impairment to water sources even P applied through biosolids was not completely used by annual crop.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aair drying 3aannuals 3abiosolids 3acorn 3afield experimentation 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus fertilizers 3arisk 3arunoff 3asoil 3asurface water 3atissue analysis 3atriple superphosphate 3awastewater treatment 3aIllinois 0aBiosolids 0aPhosphorus 0aPlant availability 0aP reactivity and persistence 0aRunoff simulation1 aCox, A.E.1 aKumar, K.1 aGranato, T.C.1 aO'Connor, G.A.1 aElliott, H.A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 May 01, v. 172 p.171-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.02.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02622naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245016300154520144400317592002801761650001701789650001101806650001501817650001401832650001601846650002801862650002301890650001501913650001601928650001701944651001001961700001601971700001401987700001202001700001302013773012702026856007402153852000902227655001202236IND60652206620221118003727.0190712e20180330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065220662DNAL7 a10.3390/su100410192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDai, Erfu10a‘Urban-Rural’ Gradient Analysis of Landscape Changes around Cities in Mountainous Regions: A Case Study of the Hengduan Mountain Region in Southwest China  aIt is of great significance to explore landscape pattern changes around urban areas to maintain regional ecological security and encourage sustainable development. Few studies have focused on the small cities located in the mountain regions. In this study, we established an ‘urban-rural’ gradient, and combined with landscape metrics to analyze the spatial-temporal changes of the landscape pattern around cities located in the Hengduan Mountain region in China. We also explored the impacts of topography on urban sprawl using the ‘relief degree of land surface’ index. Our results showed that: (1) There was an inverse relationship between the urban sprawl and restricted topography; (2) From the city center to rural areas, the landscape dominance degree and connectivity decreased initially and then increased, while the diversity presented an opposite trend and the shape complexity increased first and then fluctuated; (3) For temporal changes, in the internal buffers, the landscape dominance degree and connectivity increased, and the shape complexity and diversity decreased. However, in the outer buffers, the landscape showed opposite trends. It is advisable to use gradient and landscape metrics to explore landscape pattern changes. Similar to cities on plains, the landscape around mountain cities exhibits a circular structure, however, it also possesses unique characteristics when facing topographic restrictions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3acities 3alandscapes 3amountains 3arural areas 3asustainable development 3atemporal variation 3atopography 3aurban areas 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aWang, Yahui1 aMa, Liang1 aYin, Le1 aWu, Zhuo0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 30, v. 10, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100410193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005700146245014200203300002000345520192100365592002802286650002302314650001502337650001802352650003002370650001502400650001402415650001102429650001302440650001602453700001802469700001802487700001702505700001502522773013802537856008002675852000902755655001202764IND60649680020221122140022.0190705e20190614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064968002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b029172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jing-Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6750-123510aCombined Density Functional Theory and Kinetic Monte Carlo Study of Hydrogen Spillover on Fluorine-Decorating Covalent Organic Frameworks  ap. 15935-15943.  aHow to reduce the H migration barrier in hydrogen spillover is one of the crucial points for hydrogen storage. In this study, we use COF-8 as a representative to study the effect of F decoration for hydrogen spillover on the covalent organic framework (COF). We have found an effective way to promote the hydrogen spillover process: F-doping method. In this method, the F atoms are doped on the top of C atoms of hexahydroxytriphenylene (HHTP) or 4-phenylboronic acid (BTPA) linker of COF-8. Due to its extremely strong electronegativity, F atoms extract electrons of COF-8 and change the charge distribution on the surface of COF-8. It predicts that the maximum hydrogen storage capacity of F-doped COF-8 can reach 4.9 wt %. The doping of F atoms not only enhances the atomic H adsorption energy on COF-8 but also improves the contact between the Pt cluster and COF-8.With the F atoms doping, the H migration barrier from the Pt₆ cluster to HHTP and BTPA linkers can be lowered from 2.1 eV to 0.67 or 0.25 eV, respectively. The kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that the optimal reaction temperatures of H atoms migrating from the Pt₆ cluster to HHTP and BTPA linkers are 257.0 and 95.5 K, respectively. The second hydrogen atom can migrate from the Pt cluster to the F-doping COF-8 surface. The calculated migration barriers on COF-8_FD_A and COF-8_FD_B are 0.89 and 0.51 eV, respectively, and the optimal reaction temperatures are 337 and 201 K, respectively, which are slightly larger than those of the first hydrogen atom. The results reveal that the F-doping method can promote the H spillover process, and this method can also be applied on COF-5. The H₂ desorption in F-doped COFs can be realized by the Eley–Rideal recombination reaction. Because the Pt cluster and F atoms are doped on two opposite sides of COF-8, further works need to be done to investigate the controllable deposition method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aadsorption 3aboronic acids 3adensity functional theory 3adesorption 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3ahydrogen 3atemperature1 aLi, Xiao-Dong1 aLiu, Haiying,1 aLi, Shu-Juan1 aChen, Gang0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 June 14, v. 123, no. 26 p.15935-15943dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b029173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02351naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012100161300001400282520139600296592002801692650001101720650001101731650003301742650001601775700001701791700001901808700002101827773011101848856008101959852000902040655001202049IND60477940220221117233715.0160108e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047794022DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-014-1337-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSerra, C.10aPartial duration series distributions of the European dry spell lengths for the second half of the twentieth century  ap. 63-81.  aA spatial analysis of partial duration series, PDS, of the dry spell lengths, DSL, is applied to 267 European stations during years 1951–2000. A DSL is defined as the number of consecutive days with precipitation below 0.1 mm/day. For every station, PDS are made of DSL longer than those corresponding to 95th empirical percentile. The L-skewness and L-kurtosis diagram of the PDS distributions shows that most of the stations fit well a generalised Pareto, GP, model. Only four rain gauge records at the southeast Mediterranean coast notably depart from this model. In addition, DSL maps for return periods of 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50 years are introduced by taking into account GP parameters, which are estimated by fitting the GP distribution to empirical PDS distributions of DSL. A comparative study with those obtained in a previous paper, for the whole DSL series and the corresponding best distribution model (Pearson type III), shows that the differences of DSL for the different return periods keep within ±10 % in most of rain gauges. Moreover, a principal component analysis, PCA, is applied to the four first L-moments of the 267 rain gauges. Then, a regionalization in 11 groups is obtained after the clustering process. Finally, a regional frequency analysis is attempted, being possible to assign a GP parent distribution with different parameters to 7 out of the 11 groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoasts 3amodels 3aprincipal component analysis 3arain gauges1 aLana, Xavier1 aBurgueño, A.,1 aMartínez, M.

These stressors affect the growth, viability and development of bivalve larvae. Little is known, however, about the potential for interactions between these two concurrent stressors. While some mixed exposures have been performed with adult bivalves, no such work has been done with larvae which are generally more sensitive. This study examines whether dinoflagellates and bacteria may interactively affect the viability and immunological resilience of blue mussel Mytilus edulis larvae. Embryos were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations (100, 500, 2500 & 12,500 cells ml−1) of a dinoflagellate (Alexandrium minutum, Alexandrium ostenfeldii, Karenia mikimotoi, Protoceratium reticulatum, Prorocentrum cordatum, P. lima or P. micans), a known pathogen (Vibrio coralliilyticus/neptunius-like isolate or Vibrio splendidus; 105 CFU ml−1), or both. After five days of exposure, significant (p < 0.05) adverse effects on larval viability and larval development were found for all dinoflagellates (except P. cordatum) and V. splendidus. Yet, despite the individual effect of each stressor, no significant interactions were found between the pathogens and harmful algae. The larval viability and the phenoloxidase innate immune system responded independently to each stressor. This independence may be related to a differential timing of the effects of HABs and pathogens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlexandrium minutum 3aKarenia 3aMytilus edulis 3aProrocentrum 3aVibrio splendidus 3aadults 3aadverse effects 3aalgae 3aalgal blooms 3abacteria 3aclimate change 3ainnate immunity 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3apathogens 3atoxicity 3aviability 0aMytilus edulis 0aHarmful algae 0aVibrio spp. 0aPhenoloxidase activity1 aVan Acker, E.1 aNevejan, N.1 aDe Schamphelaere, K.A.C.1 aJanssen, C.R.0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2016 Oct., v. 57 p.236-242dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03160naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002300190245017200213300001600385520128700401592002801688653000901716653000901725653000801734653000901742653000801751653000801759653000801767653000901775653000901784653000801793653000901801653000901810653000801819653000801827653001101835653000801846653000801854653001101862653001101873653003001884653001401914653001201928653002101940700002101961700003301982700002202015700002002037700002102057700002102078700001902099700002102118700002002139700001902159700002002178700002202198700002802220700002102248700002402269773007702293856008302370852000902453655001202462IND60555316520221120194922.0161026e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055531652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.05.0322doi7 aPMC49725352pmcid7 a273330442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDarville, Hélène10aHuman Pluripotent Stem Cell-derived Cortical Neurons for High Throughput Medication Screening in Autism: A Proof of Concept Study in SHANK3 Haploinsufficiency Syndrome  ap. 293-305.  aAutism spectrum disorders affect millions of individuals worldwide, but their heterogeneity complicates therapeutic intervention that is essentially symptomatic. A versatile yet relevant model to rationally screen among hundreds of therapeutic options would help improving clinical practice. Here we investigated whether neurons differentiated from pluripotent stem cells can provide such a tool using SHANK3 haploinsufficiency as a proof of principle. A library of compounds was screened for potential to increase SHANK3 mRNA content in neurons differentiated from control human embryonic stem cells. Using induced pluripotent stem cell technology, active compounds were then evaluated for efficacy in correcting dysfunctional networks of neurons differentiated from individuals with deleterious point mutations of SHANK3. Among 202 compounds tested, lithium and valproic acid showed the best efficacy at corrected SHANK3 haploinsufficiency associated phenotypes in cellulo. Lithium pharmacotherapy was subsequently provided to one patient and, after one year, an encouraging decrease in autism severity was observed. This demonstrated that pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons provide a novel cellular paradigm exploitable in the search for specific disease-modifying treatments.  aPublisher supplied data 0aADHD 0aADOS 0aASD 0aDMSO 0aFDA 0aGAS 0aHTS 0ahESC 0aiPSC 0aNSC 0aPPIA 0aPPVT 0aPSC 0aRPM 0aSHANK3 0aSRS 0aVPA 0aAutism 0aSHANK3 0aHigh throughput screening 0aValproate 0aLithium 0aDrug repurposing1 aPoulet, Aurélie1 aRodet-Amsellem, Frédérique1 aChatrousse, Laure1 aPernelle, Julie1 aBoissart, Claire1 aHéron, Delphine1 aNava, Caroline1 aPerrier, Anselme1 aJarrige, Margot1 aCogé, Francis1 aMillan, Mark J.1 aBourgeron, Thomas1 aPeschanski, M.q(Marc),1 aDelorme, Richard1 aBenchoua, Alexandra0 tEBioMedicine.g2016 July, v. 9 p.293-305dElsevier B.V.x2352-39647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.05.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02545naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013100159520139000290592002801680650003001708650002501738650001701763650002301780650002301803650001501826650001201841650001401853650001201867650001901879650001701898650001301915651001001928700002301938773012701961856007402088852000902162655001202171IND60652202920221118003851.0190712e20180301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065220292DNAL7 a10.3390/su100306652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarino, Davide10aCan Payments for Ecosystem Services Improve the Management of Natura 2000 Sites? A Contribution to Explore Their Role in Italy  aFinancing protected areas is crucial for guaranteeing the flow of ecosystem services (ES) provided by natural and semi-natural ecosystems, which are the basis of human well-being. In the last two decades, together with traditional conservation tools, innovative instruments, such as PES (Payment for Ecosystem Services), have been proposed and implemented all over the world in order to improve management effectiveness in biodiversity conservation. In this paper we identified and categorized 33 PES case studies in 19 Natura 2000 sites developing the hypothesis that a PES approach may contribute to improving the effectiveness of conservation actions at different spatial and administrative levels. We found that in these areas, farmers and foresters often allow the maintenance of natural and semi-natural ecosystems through their economic activity. Through PES schemes their important role can be formally acknowledged, both in environmental and economic terms. PES schemes are also a tool for involving more stakeholders, particularly local companies, residents and tourists in conservation actions. So PES can actually improve Natura 2000 sites’ management and increase the availability of financial resources in favor of conservation actions. However, careful attention must to be paid to the supporting role of public authorities, generally crucial for the success of a PES.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3abusiness enterprises 3acase studies 3aconservation areas 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afarmers 3aforesters 3afunding 3asocial welfare 3astakeholders 3atourists 3aItaly1 aPellegrino, Davide0 tSustainability.g2018 Mar. 01, v. 10, no. 3dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su100306653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245013600162300001600298520116400314592002801478650002001506650002401526650001001550650002701560650001401587650004301601650001101644650001001655650002001665650001601685650001101701650001001712650001201722650002201734650003201756700001501788700001701803700001801820700001501838700001801853773011601871856008101987852000902068655001202077IND60173864120221120214401.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017386412DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-015-0632-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Zaiqi10aHeterologous overexpression of resveratrol synthase (PcPKS5) gene enhances antifungal and mite aversion by resveratrol accumulation  ap. 547-556.  aHuping jujube is widely cultivated in northern China. PcPKS5, a resveratrol synthase (STS) gene, contains all functionally divergent plant specific type III PKSs and is involved in resveratrol synthesis. This study aimed to assess the effects of heterologous overexpression of the resveratrol synthase (PcPKS5) gene on Huping jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) plant resistance and nutritional quality. Stems with leaves and shoot tips of Huping jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill) were infected with agrobacterium expressing PcPKS5 and GUS, and three positive plants were identified. Resveratrol (0.45 μg/g fresh weight) was detected by HPLC in line 2 transgenic plants. Interestingly, 100 μl extract of 1 g/ml transgenic plant crude extract showed an inhibitory effect equivalent to 1.0 μg of pure resveratrol. In addition, transgenic plants displayed increased anti-mite resistance compared with the wild-type counterparts. Importantly, higher PcPKS5 expression levels were found in young tissues compared with the stem and mature leaves. This study also provides a stable genetic transformation mechanism for developing new plant germplasms in Huping jujube.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZiziphus jujuba 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agenetic transformation 3agermplasm 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aleaves 3amites 3anutritive value 3aresveratrol 3ashoots 3astems 3atissues 3atransgenic plants 3atrihydroxystilbene synthase1 aGuo, Huili1 aYang, Yadong1 aYang, Mingfen1 aMa, Lanqin1 aWang, Younian0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2015 July, v. 142, no. 3 p.547-556dSpringer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-015-0632-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002200152245013700174300001400311520080500325592002801130650001701158650002401175650001501199650002201214650001801236650001201254650001901266650001201285650001501297650004401312650001701356650001401373650000901387653000801396653000801404653000901412653001001421653000801431653001001439653000801449653000801457653001001465653001201475653001301487653002201500653002101522653004001543700002201583700002201605700003201627700002101659700002701680700001801707773008801725856008701813852000901900655001201909IND60610206220221122095452.0180911e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061020622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2018.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPires, Diego A.T.12aA previously undescribed hexapeptide His-Arg-Phe-Leu-Arg-His-NH2 from amphibian skin secretion shows CO2 and metal biding affinities  ap. 37-44.  aA previously undescribed six residues long peptide His-Arg-Phe-Leu-Arg-His was identified and purified from the skin secretion of the amphibian Phyllomedusa centralis. A synthetic analogue carboxyamidated HRFLRH-NH2 showed structural changes induced by CO2 and metal ions in aqueous solution when analyzed by NMR. The present work reports NMR structures for the carboxyamidated hexapeptide in the presence CO2, Zn²⁺ and Cd²⁺, suggesting possible affinity regions on the polypeptide chain for each ligand.

In this study, the regional GWₚₒₜ of the Karak watershed in Northern Pakistan was first evaluated by means of the multi-influence factors (MIFs) model of optimized GCFs through geoprocessing tools in geographical information system (GIS). The distribution of petrophysical properties indicated by the measured resistivity fluctuations was then generated to locally verify the GWₚₒₜ, and to analyze the hydrogeological and geoelectrical characteristics of aquifers. According to the weighted overlay analysis of MIFs, GWₚₒₜ map was zoned into low, medium, high and very high areas, covering 9.7% (72.3 km²), 52.4% (1307.7 km²), 31.3% (913.4 km²), and 6.6% (44.8 km²) of the study area. The GWₚₒₜ accuracy sequentially depends on the classification criteria, the mean rating score, and the weights assigned to GCFs. The most influential factors are geology, lineament density, and land use/land cover followed by drainage density, slope, soil type, rainfall, elevation, and groundwater level fluctuations. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the confusion matrix, and Kappa (K) analysis show satisfactory and consistent results and expected performances (the area under the curve value 68%, confusion matrix 68%, Kappa (K) analysis 65%). The electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and vertical electrical sounding (VES) data interpretations reveals five regional hydrological layers (i.e., coarse gravel and sand, silty sand mixed lithology, clayey sand/fine sand, fine sand/gravel, and clayey basement). The preliminary interpretation of ERT results highlights the complexity of the hydrogeological strata and reveals that GWₚₒₜ is structurally and proximately constrained in the clayey sand and silicate aquifers (sandstone), which is of significance for the determination of drilling sites, expansion of drinking water supply and irrigation in the future. Moreover, quantifying the spatial distribution of aquifer hydrogeological characteristics (such as reflection coefficient, isopach, and resistivity mapping) based on Olayinka’s basic standards, indirectly and locally verify the performance of the MIF model and ultimately determine new locations for groundwater exploitation. The combined methods of regional GWₚₒₜ mapping and hydrogeological characterization, through the geospatial MIFs model and aquifer geoelectrical interpretation, respectively, facilitate decision-makers for sustainable GRM not only in the Karak watershed but also in other similar areas worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acase studies 3adecision making 3adrainage 3aelectrical resistance 3ageographic information systems 3agravel 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3aland cover 3aland use 3alithology 3amodels 3arain 3aresource management 3asand 3asandstone 3asilicates 3asoil types 3atomography 3awater supply 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aPakistan1 aFaheem, Haris 1 aJiang, Zhengwen 1 aWajid, Muhammad 1 aYounas, Muhammad 1 aCheung, Elena,0 tWater.g2021 Apr. 30, v. 13, no. 9dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w130912553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003300150245012500183300001400308520095700322592002801279650001601307650001701323650002601340650001401366650001501380650001401395650001301409650001401422650001401436650001101450650000901461650002001470650002301490650001101513651001101524653003501535653001401570653001401584653002401598700003001622700002301652700003201675700002001707773010301727856008401830852000901914655001201923IND60545857120221121035354.0160903e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054585712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.05.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDias, Amanda Cristina Vieira10aAnalysis of estrogenic activity in environmental waters in Rio de Janeiro state (Brazil) using the yeast estrogen screen  ap. 41-47.  aThe estrogenicity of waters collected from an important hydrological system in Brazil (Paraiba do Sul and Guandu Rivers) was assessed using the yeast estrogen screen (YES) assay. Sampling was performed in rivers and at the outlets of conventional water treatment plants (WTP). The removal of estrogenic activity by ozonation and chlorination after conventional water treatment (clarification and sand filtration) was investigated employing samples of the Guandu River spiked with estrogens and bisphenol A (BPA). The results revealed a preoccupying incidence of estrogenic activity at levels higher than 1ngL−1 along some points of the rivers. Another matter of concern was the number of samples from WTPs presenting estrogenicity surpassing 1ngL−1. The oxidation techniques (ozonation and chlorination) were effective for the removal of estrogenic activity and the combination of both techniques led to good results using less amounts of oxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3abisphenol A 3achlorination 3aestrogenic properties 3aestrogens 3afiltration 3ahydrology 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3aozonation 3arivers 3asand 3awater treatment 3awillingness to pay 3ayeasts 3aBrazil 0aEndocrine disrupting chemicals 0aEstrogens 0aYES assay 0aRiver water quality1 aGomes, Frederico Wegenast1 aBila, Daniele Maia1 aSant’Anna, Geraldo Lippel1 aDezotti, Marcia0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2015 Oct., v. 120 p.41-47dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.05.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245010200173300001400275520140200289592002801691650001301719650001101732650003001743650001301773650002701786650001001813650001901823650002301842650001101865650001401876650002001890650000701910650001101917650001601928650002701944650002701971650001401998650001502012650002502027653002302052653002602075653002302101653002602124700007102150700002102221700001902242773011602261856008502377852000902462655001202471IND60606938920221116152025.0180730e20160701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060693892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaje, Ahmed Samir10aElectrocoagulation using a rotated anode: A novel reactor design for textile wastewater treatment  ap. 34-44.  aThis paper investigates the optimum operational conditions of a novel rotated bed electrocoagulation (EC) reactor for the treatment of textile wastewater. The effect of various operational parameters such as rotational speed, current density (CD), operational time (RT), pH, temperature, and inter-electrode distance (IED) on the pollutant removal efficiency were examined. In addition, the consumption of aluminum (Al) and electrical energy, as well as operating costs at optimum conditions were also calculated. The results indicated that the optimum conditions for the treatment of textile wastewater were achieved at CD = 4 mA/cm², RT = 10 min, rotational speed = 150 rpm, pH = 4.57, temperature = 25 °C, and IED = 1 cm. The electrode consumption, energy consumption, and operating costs were 0.038 kg/m³, 4.66 kWh/m³ and 0.44 US$/m³, respectively. The removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solid (TSS), turbidity and color were 97.10%, 95.55%, 98%, 96% and 98.50%, respectively, at the first 10 min of reaction time, while the phenol compound of the wastewater was almost entirely removed (99.99%). The experimental results confirm that the new reactor design with rotated anode impellers and cathode rings provided high treatment efficiency at a reduced reaction time and with lower energy consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aanodes 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3acathodes 3achemical oxygen demand 3acolor 3aelectric power 3aelectrocoagulation 3aenergy 3aimpellers 3aoperating costs 3apH 3aphenol 3atemperature 3atextile mill effluents 3atotal suspended solids 3aturbidity 3awastewater 3awastewater treatment 0aElectrocoagulation 0aElectrode consumption 0aTextile wastewater 0aRotated anode reactor1 aChelliapan, Shreeshivadasan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3580-33511 aZakaria, Zuriati1 aAbbas, Saad A.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 July 01, v. 176 p.34-44dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02594naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245018000176300001400356520088200370592002801252650001601280650002101296650001201317650002201329650001101351650001101362650001101373650001501384650002301399650002101422650002601443650001901469650001401488653000801502653000801510653000801518653000701526653001601533653002501549653003101574653001401605653001301619653002501632700005601657700002201713700001901735700002001754700002001774700002001794700001801814773008801832856008701920852000902007655001202016IND60610206320221122130024.0180911e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061020632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2018.06.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamagishi, Takayuki10aGlucose, some amino acids and a plant secondary metabolite, chlorogenic acid induce the secretion of a regulatory hormone, tachykinin-related peptide, from the silkworm midgut  ap. 21-27.  aEnteroendocrine cells in the insect midgut are thought to secrete peptide hormones in response to the nutritional state. However, the role of dietary compounds in inducing peptide hormone secretion from enteroendocrine cells in insects remains unknown. In the present study, we demonstrated that several dietary compounds from mulberry leaves, including glucose, amino acids, and the secondary metabolite chlorogenic acid, induced significant secretion of tachykinin-related peptides from isolated silkworm midguts at the luminal concentrations measured in fed larvae. This study provides evidence that the insect midgut senses a non-nutritious secondary metabolite in addition to nutrient metabolites to monitor luminal food status and secretes a feeding regulatory hormone, suggesting that a unique dietary sensory system modulates insect feeding via enteroendocrine control.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3achlorogenic acid 3aglucose 3ahormone secretion 3alarvae 3aleaves 3amidgut 3amulberries 3anutritional status 3apeptide hormones 3asecondary metabolites 3asensory system 3asilkworms 0aEEC 0aTRP 0aCGA 0aCA 0aBombyx mori 0aEnteroendocrine cell 0aTachykinin-related peptide 0aSecretion 0aNutrient 0aSecondary metabolite1 aEndo, Haruka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5900-70771 aFukumura, Keisuke1 aNagata, Shinji1 aHayakawa, Tohru1 aAdegawa, Satomi1 aKasubuchi, Mayu1 aSato, Ryoichi0 tPeptides.g2018 Aug., v. 106 p.21-27dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2018.06.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002300151245013000174520172800304592002802032650002202060650001902082650002502101650001802126650001202144650003602156650001602192650002102208650001402229650001302243650001802256650001102274650001202285650002202297650001202319650000902331650001402340650001302354650001502367650002302382650001902405650001502424650001202439650001002451650002302461650002502484650001202509650000902521653002202530653001802552653002802570653002102598700006602619700002002685700005502705773010902760856008602869852000902955655001202964IND60647494920221121225833.0190801e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIglesias, Ignacio,10aRootstock affects quality and phytochemical composition of ‘Big Top’ nectarine fruits grown under hot climatic conditions  aThis study aimed to evaluate the stability of ‘Big Top’ nectarine fruit quality (fruit weight, fruit mineral elements and fruit phytochemical composition such as soluble solids content, titratable acidity, individual sugars, individual organic acids, total ascorbic acid content, total phenolics content, and antioxidant capacity) when grafted on 20 Prunus rootstocks over two consecutive seasons. For most of the evaluated traits, rootstock was the main source of variability, whereas for Mg, malic and citric acids, and glucose most of the variability was observed among years. Similarly, the interaction year × rootstock was not significant for most traits (14 out of 21), hence highlighting that most rootstocks responded in a similar manner to changes in the weather conditions. Thus said, some important micro- and macro-nutrients such as Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, together with taste- (fructose, glucose and sucrose) or health-related (antioxidant capacity) compounds showed a differential influence of the rootstock depending on the year conditions and thereby suggested that climatic conditions can be a limiting factor in the choice of rootstocks for a given nectarine cultivar. Overall, the results from this study indicated that the cherry-plum hybrid Krimsk-1 and the peach-plum hybrid PS rootstocks are the most suitable rootstocks for ‘Big Top’ under the conditions investigated herein. Both rootstocks induced high values on sugar profile, ascorbic acid, antioxidant activity, and TPC of ‘Big Top’ nectarine being relatively stable regardless of the weather conditions. Finally, the rootstocks IRTA-1 and Rootpac-20 also induced good fruit quality and phytochemical properties to ‘Big Top’ fruit.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPrunus cerasifera 3aPrunus persica 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3acalcium 3achemical constituents of plants 3acitric acid 3aclimatic factors 3acultivars 3afructose 3afruit quality 3afruits 3aglucose 3agrafting (plants) 3ahybrids 3airon 3amagnesium 3aminerals 3anectarines 3aphenolic compounds 3aphytochemicals 3arootstocks 3asucrose 3ataste 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids 3aweather 3azinc 0aIndividual sugars 0aOrganic acids 0aTotal phenolics content 0aMineral elements1 aGiné-Bordonaba, Jordi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8514-53371 aGaranto, Xavier1 aReig, Gemma1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6573-31040 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108586-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009100173300001800264520102100282536036201303592002801665650002801693650001101721650001301732650001901745650002901764651001301793653001001806653001801816653001001834653002001844700002801864700003001892700002001922700002601942773011901968856008602087852000902173655001202182IND60788967320221120044658.0220818e20220822xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078896732DNAL7 a10.1080/10106049.2021.18922062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChong, Wei-Sheng,10aIntroducing Theil-Sen estimator for sun glint correction of UAV data for coral mapping  ap. 4527-4556.  aDespite wider applications for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in aquatic remote sensing, frequent sun glint in UAV acquisition often results in significant data gaps. Much research exists in the development of sun glint correction methods for airborne and satellite imagery to generate accurate coral habitat maps. Conversely, little is known about an appropriate glint correction method that can also be considered as data gap in UAV. This study compared glint correction methods for filling data gaps in UAV imagery acquired from the coral-dominated Pulau Bidong island in Peninsular Malaysia. This study proposed a simple seed pixel region growing technique that can be used in glint detection and mask development. It introduces the Theil-Sen regression glint correction (TSGC) for glint correction in UAV imagery and to achieve coral composition maps with thematic details, useful for sustainable coastal management. TSGC achieved a 25.6% greater coral classification accuracy compared to the uncorrected images.  aThis work was supported by the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS) [Project Code: FRGS/1/2019/WAB05/UMT/02/3, Vot number: 59562).

The single-solvent electrolytes are based on tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI), respectively. Compared to TEGDME and EMITFSI electrolytes, the DMSO electrolyte leads to higher reversible Li–O₂ cells, even though decomposition of DMSO is observed. In this work, novel blended TEGDME (20 wt%)–DMSO (80 wt%), EMITFSI (20 wt%)–TEGDME (80 wt%) and EMITFSI (20 wt%)–DMSO (80 wt%) based electrolytes are first proposed and investigated in the assembled Li–O₂ cells. Incorporating with a Co₃O₄ catalysed cathode, the EMITFSI–DMSO electrolyte results in an optimized Li–O₂ battery, showing a lower voltage gap and a higher reversibility. In such a system, 80% of the recharge occurs at a potential underneath 4.0 V vs. Li⁺/Li. The low recharge voltage can suppress the decomposition of DMSO and favour a longer cycle life. More than 65 consecutive cycles are achieved at a current density of 0.1 mA cm⁻² with a cut-off capacity of 835 mA h gₑₗₑcₜᵣₒdₑ⁻¹. The improved electrochemical performance is attributed to the enhanced ionic conductivity of the mixed electrolyte. In addition, the EMITFSI–DMSO electrolyte is considered more stable, since the ionic liquid could alleviate the decomposition of DMSO provoked by the intermediate superoxides.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3acobalt oxide 3adimethyl sulfoxide 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aionic liquids 3alithium 3asuperoxide anion1 aFrancia, C.1 aAmici, J.1 aBodoardo, S.1 aPenazzi, N.0 tRSC advances.g2015 Sept. 30, v. 5, no. 101 p.83056-83064dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra13483h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03166naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005400151245010900205520160200314592002801916650002501944650001901969650000901988650001701997650001202014650001402026650001702040650001102057650001302068650001602081650001502097650001402112650001202126650002302138650002202161650000902183650002002192653001402212653001902226653001602245653001702261653001802278653001002296653001402306700001502320700005402335700001702389700001402406773010902420856008602529852000902615655001202624IND60647495120221120055650.0190801e20191015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064749512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBernat, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7827-569110aInfection risk of Monilinia fructicola on stone fruit during cold storage and immersion in the dump tank  aMonilinia spp. is the main pathogen responsible for postharvest losses of stone fruit. Several studies have examined the conditions for Monilinia spp. infection in the field, but very limited information is available about postharvest. Storing fruit for 1 day in the cold room or dumping fruit in a water tank are the most common handling operations during the postharvest of fruit. Then, the aim of this study was to investigate the risk of Monilinia fructicola infection for two peach and one nectarine cultivars during cold storage and water dump operations. A new methodology was performed using a dry inoculum of M. fructicola. A set of fruit was used as control to demonstrated that at 20 °C 60% relative humidity (RH) was not able to infect fruit, however, the disease was developed when was already infected. In addition, M. fructicola was able to infect and develop disease in fruit at 20 °C 100 RH. The storage of fruit with the presence of M. fructicola conidia on their surface for up to 30 days at 0 °C 100% RH or 4 °C 100% RH did not suppose an important risk of infection since only 3.3 and 3.8%, respectively of fruit were already infected. Overall, all treatments tested with the water dump operation gave optimal conditions to M. fructicola to infect fruit when it was superficially dry inoculated or it was immersed with water contaminated with conidia, increasing the need for water disinfection. In addition, when fruit was immersed in water free from M. fructicola conidia, the postharvest operation gave optimal conditions to develop infections already produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonilinia fructicola 3aPrunus persica 3acold 3acold storage 3aconidia 3acultivars 3adisinfection 3afruits 3ainoculum 3amethodology 3anectarines 3apathogens 3apeaches 3apostharvest losses 3arelative humidity 3arisk 3awater pollution 0aBrown rot 0aMonilinia spp. 0aPostharvest 0aCold storing 0aWater dumping 0aPeach 0aNectarine1 aCasals, C.1 aTorres, R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1806-96261 aTeixidó, N.1 aUsall, J.0 tScientia horticulturae.g2019 Oct. 15, v. 256 p.108589-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2019.1085893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02845naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245009400162300001500256520167500271592002801946650001501974650001601989650001002005650002002015650001302035650001302048650001802061650003502079650002202114650002402136650001202160650001402172650002002186650001102206700001502217773012602232856008002358852000902438655001202447IND60765236820221121073710.0220904e20090408xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076523682DNAL7 a10.17221/50/2009-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPodhorec, P.10aInduction of final oocyte maturation in Cyprinidae fish by hypothalamic factors: a review  ap. 97-110.  aGonadotropin-releasing hormone in Cyprinidae as in other Vertebrates functions as a brain signal which stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Two forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone have been identified in cyprinids, chicken gonadotropin-releasing hormone II and salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Hypohysiotropic functions are fulfilled mainly by salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone. The only known factor having an inhibitory effect on LH secretion in the family Cyprinidae is dopamine. Most cyprinids reared under controlled conditions exhibit signs of reproductive dysfunction, which is manifested in the failure to undergo final oocyte maturation and ovulation. In captivity a disruption of endogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone stimulation occurs and sequentially that of luteinizing hormone, which is indispensible for the final phases of gametogenesis. In addition to methods based on the application of exogenous gonadotropins, the usage of a method functioning on the basis of hypothalamic control of final oocyte maturation and ovulation has become popular recently. The replacement of natural gonadotropin-releasing hormones with chemically synthesized gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues characterized by amino acid substitutions at positions sensitive to enzymatic degradation has resulted in a centuple increase in the effectiveness of luteinizing hormone secretion induction. Combining gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues with Dopamine inhibitory factors have made it possible to develop an extremely effective agent, which is necessary for the successful artificial reproduction of cyprinids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinidae 3aamino acids 3abrain 3acaptive animals 3achickens 3adopamine 3agametogenesis 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3ahormone secretion 3aluteinizing hormone 3aoocytes 3aovulation 3apituitary gland 3asalmon1 aKouril, J.0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 54, no. 3 p.97-110dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/50/2009-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04099naa a2200709 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001900186245010800205300002000313506007600333520188300409592002802292506003702320650004902357650002202406650000802428650005002436650001702486650001102503650002202514650002302536650002202559650001602581650002502597650001002622650001802632650001102650650001402661650001302675650001602688650002202704650002202726650001902748650001302767650001302780650001202793653002202805653001302827653002102840700001902861700001702880700002302897700002902920700002502949700002202974700002202996700001903018700001803037700001703055700002203072700002003094773017503114856007903289852000903368655001203377IND60173830720221207092811.0150603e20131001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017383072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13115421102doi7 aPMC37917412pmcid7 a240437912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aScobey, Trevor10aReverse genetics with a full-length infectious cDNA of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus  ap. 16157-16162.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome with high mortality rates (∼50%) is associated with a novel group 2c betacoronavirus designated Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We synthesized a panel of contiguous cDNAs that spanned the entire genome. Following contig assembly into genome-length cDNA, transfected full-length transcripts recovered several recombinant viruses (rMERS-CoV) that contained the expected marker mutations inserted into the component clones. Because the wild-type MERS-CoV contains a tissue culture-adapted T1015N mutation in the S glycoprotein, rMERS-CoV replicated ∼0.5 log less efficiently than wild-type virus. In addition, we ablated expression of the accessory protein ORF5 (rMERS•ORF5) and replaced it with tomato red fluorescent protein (rMERS-RFP) or deleted the entire ORF3, 4, and 5 accessory cluster (rMERS-ΔORF3–5). Recombinant rMERS-CoV, rMERS-CoV•ORF5, and MERS-CoV-RFP replicated to high titers, whereas MERS-ΔORF3–5 showed 1–1.5 logs reduced titer compared with rMERS-CoV. Northern blot analyses confirmed the associated molecular changes in the recombinant viruses, and sequence analysis demonstrated that RFP was expressed from the appropriate consensus sequence AACGAA. We further show dipeptidyl peptidase 4 expression, MERS-CoV replication, and RNA and protein synthesis in human airway epithelial cell cultures, primary lung fibroblasts, primary lung microvascular endothelial cells, and primary alveolar type II pneumocytes, demonstrating a much broader tissue tropism than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The availability of a MERS-CoV molecular clone, as well as recombinant viruses expressing indicator proteins, will allow for high-throughput testing of therapeutic compounds and provide a genetic platform for studying gene function and the rational design of live virus vaccines.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3aNorthern blotting 3aRNA 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 3acell culture 3aclones 3acomplementary DNA 3aconsensus sequence 3aendothelial cells 3afibroblasts 3afluorescent proteins 3agenes 3aglycoproteins 3ahumans 3amortality 3amutation 3apneumocytes 3aprotein synthesis 3asequence analysis 3atissue tropism 3atomatoes 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aemerging pathogen 0azoonosis 0asynthetic genome1 aYount, Boyd L.1 aSims, Amy C.1 aDonaldson, Eric F.1 aAgnihothram, Sudhakar S.1 aMenachery, Vineet D.1 aGraham, Rachel L.1 aSwanstrom, Jesica1 aBove, Peter F.1 aKim, Jeeho D.1 aGrego, Sonia1 aRandell, Scott H.1 aBaric, Ralph S.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2013 Oct. 1, v. 110, no. 40 p.16157-16162dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13115421103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03364naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010600175300001600281520200400297592002802301650002202329650001102351650000902362650001002371650002702381650001902408650001502427650002202442650001202464650001302476650001902489650001902508650001702527650002202544650001002566651001002576653002802586653001102614653001302625653001702638653001502655653001902670773009502689856008902784852000902873655001202882IND60584765920221119052605.0190319e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058476592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacKay, Heather,10aMapping and characterising the urban agricultural landscape of two intermediate-sized Ghanaian cities  ap. 182-197.  aExtending beyond previous research biases towards large cities or analyses based largely on one type of urban agriculture (UA) (such as market gardening, or home gardening), this research aimed to investigate all forms of UA within two intermediate-sized Ghanaian cities (Techiman and Tamale). Where was being farmed? For whom, and why? The paper considers how findings compare to Ghana’s larger cities, and possible implications for theory and for planning. Methods included remote sensing, field mapping, interviews and a 1000-household per city questionnaire. The most common reason for farming was food supplementation. This was often via staple foods, particularly maize, rather than the leafy vegetables common in larger cities’ market gardening. Farming was predominantly via home gardening, particularly for the better off. The larger city of Tamale also sustained organised irrigated-vegetable market gardens.Findings suggest a picture not dissimilar to Ghana’s larger cities but with greater prevalence of home gardening, and a dominance of staple foods rather than perishable or high value crops. A compelling finding, which has received less attention in the literature, is the extent of, and roles played by, what this study refers to as ‘institutional land. Both Ghanaian Ministry of Food and Agriculture’s policy framing, and market crisis theorising, of the drivers and role of UA were not found to be an accurate reflection of Techiman and Tamale’s UA. Rather than being a localised survival activity of the poor or marginalised, of recent migrants, or of predominantly women, these cities contained a large scale and diverse spatiality of UA mainly for non-poor and non-migrants’ supplementation of their staple food larder. Results emphasise the context-specific nature of a city’s urban agriculture, and underline the need for researchers and UA advocates to be specific about the form of UA under the microscope when making claims for ‘an urban agriculture’.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acities 3acorn 3acrops 3agreen leafy vegetables 3ahome gardening 3ainterviews 3aissues and policy 3amarkets 3aplanning 3aquestionnaires 3aremote sensing 3astaple foods 3aurban agriculture 3awomen 3aGhana 0aUrban agriculture types 0aTamale 0aTechiman 0aStaple foods 0aUrban food 0aUrban land use0 tLand use policy.g2018 Jan., v. 70 p.182-197dElsevier LtdwJournal:12412x0264-83777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landusepol.2017.10.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245014000156300002000296520156300316592002801879650003701907650001501944650001601959650002101975650001601996650002502012650001402037650003702051650001802088650001102106650001602117650001502133650002002148650001402168650001102182650001402193653003402207653003802241653002202279653005702301653002402358700001902382700001902401700001302420700001702433700002002450700001802470700001602488773012902504856007302633852000902706655001202715IND60527762120221121032639.0160715e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052776212DNAL7 a10.1021/am505876b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiao-Mei10aFacile Preparation of Biocompatible Sulfhydryl Cotton Fiber-Based Sorbents by “Thiol–ene” Click Chemistry for Biological Analysis  ap. 17857-17864.  aSulfhydryl cotton fiber (SCF) has been widely used as adsorbent for a variety of metal ions since 1971. Thanks to the abundant thiols on SCF, in this study, we reported a universal method for the facile preparation of SCF-based materials using “thiol–ene” click chemistry for the first time. With the proposed method, two types of SCF-based materials, phenylboronic acid grafted sulfhydryl cotton fiber (SCF-PBA) and zirconium phosphonate-modified sulfhydryl cotton fiber (SCF-pVPA-Zr⁴⁺), were successfully prepared. The grafted functional groups onto the thiol group of SCF were demonstrated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). The prepared fibrous materials exhibited excellent fiber strength, good stability in aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, and great biocompatibility. Moreover, we developed filter-free in-pipet-tip SPE using these SCF-based materials as adsorbent for the enrichment of ribonucleosides, glycopeptides and phosphopeptides. Our results showed that SCF-PBA adsorbent can selectively capture ribonucleosides and glycopeptides from complex biological samples. And SCF-pVPA-Zr⁴⁺ adsorbent exhibited high selectivity and capacity in the enrichment of phosphopeptides from the digestion mixture of β-casein and bovine serum albumin (BSA), as well as human serum and nonfat milk digest. Generally, the preparation strategy can be a universal method for the synthesis of other functionalized cotton-based adsorbents with special requirement in microscale biological analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3abeta-casein 3abiocompatibility 3ablood serum 3abovine serum albumin 3adigestion 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aglycopeptides 3ahumans 3alint cotton 3ametal ions 3aribonucleosides 3askim milk 3athiols 3azirconium 0asulfhydryl cotton fiber (SCF) 0a“thiol−ene” click chemistry 0aboronate affinity 0aimmobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) 0abiological analysis1 aZhu, Gang-Tian1 aZhu, Yuan-Yuan1 aChen, Xi1 aZhang, Zheng1 aWang, Shaoding,1 aYuan, Bi-Feng1 aFeng, Yu-Qi0 tACS applied materials .g2014 Oct. 22, v. 6, no. 20 p.17857-17864dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/am505876b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02394naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005100146245014600197300001800343520104100361592002801402650002001430650001501450650002401465650002301489700001101512700001801523700005901541700005601600700001301656700001701669700001701686700001801703700001801721700001701739700001501756773013601771856008001907852000901987655001201996IND60635343520221121035601.0190329e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063534352DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b100022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Hao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3870-598110aAcceleration of δ- to β-HMX-D8 Phase Retransformation with D₂O and Intergranular Strain Evolution in a HMX-Based Polymer-Bonded Explosive  ap. 6958-6964.  aOctahydro-1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocine (HMX) is one of the most widely used explosives. Problems about phase state and unrecoverable damage are significant in the application of HMX and HMX-based polymer-bonded explosive (PBX). Recently, the acceleration of δ- to β-HMX retransformation in humid atmosphere was reported. However, the function of water was not well understood. In this paper, we studied the mixed phase during δ- to β-HMX-d8 retransformation with neutron diffraction. Evidence of γ-HMX-d8 is specially focused to estimate whether the hydrated phase is part of the δ- to β- phase retransformation. Besides, in situ high-pressure neutron diffraction of HMX-based PBX was performed to study the evolution of intergranular strains in special structures such as twin plane, cleavage planes, and slip systems. We observed an abnormal release of strain on certain planes under applied pressure which had not been reported. This abnormal phenomenon was considered to explain the formation of microcracks in HMX.  aPublisher supplied data 3adeuterium oxide 3aexplosives 3aneutron diffraction 3aphysical chemistry1 aLi, Yu1 aBai, Liangfei1 aHuang, Shiliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9825-66661 aYan, Guanyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5201-47441 aXie, Lei1 aChen, Xiping1 aXia, Yuanhua1 aFang, Leiming1 aZheng, Xianxu1 aSun, Guangai1 aGong, Jian0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Feb. 25, v. 123, no. 12 p.6958-6964dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b100023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03723naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005800145245007200203300001800275500002000293520217500313592002802488596003202516596002302548650003102571650001802602650002402620650001202644650001702656650001702673650001202690650001402702650001402716650001002730650001302740650001002753650001002763650001002773650001102783650001602794650001202810651000902822700005502831700006402886700005902950773012003009856007903129852000903208655001203217IND60649736920221117235534.0190705e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064973692DNAL7 a10.1111/1365-2435.133322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKessler, Danny1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0410-116X14aThe defensive function of a pollinator‐attracting floral volatile  ap. 1223-1232.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBenzyl acetone (4‐phenylbutan‐2‐one; BA), the dominant floral fragrance of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata, is known to attract night‐time pollinators, such as Manduca sexta hawkmoths. For this pollinator, BA is not only essential for the pollen transport between conspecific plants, but also for the moth’s short‐distance handling of flowers at night. The emission of BA from the corolla limb, however, starts up to 4 hr before dusk, peaks at dusk and continues throughout the first half of the night. While the function of the nocturnal part of the emission is well studied, the function of the early part of the peak emission remained unknown. By using plants silenced in the expression of the biosynthetic gene of BA (Nachal1), we investigated the function of this early peak emission of BA in the plants´ native habitat in Southwestern Utah. By emitting BA before dusk, N. attenuata is able to prevent the establishment and resulting floral damage by a florivore, the cucumber beetle (Diabrotica undecimpunctata). Plants lacking BA emissions (CHAL) were not only more often colonized by florivores, but also suffered significantly more damage, than control empty vector plants (EV). Choice assays revealed that D. undecimpunctata feeding required the absence of BA. While feeding damage to CHAL flowers was higher than to EV flowers in the early night hours, the effect disappeared during the second half of the night, when flowers stop emitting BA. The close proximity of BA‐emitting flowers to non‐emitting CHAL flowers prevented D. undecimpunctata feeding. In the field, the emission of BA at dusk was sufficient to protect plants for the entire night, as beetles search for new hosts during the early evening hours and remain for the duration of the night, once a host is chosen. Floral BA emission before dusk may have evolved as a consequence of antagonistic interactions with florivores. A single floral volatile can thus simultaneously function as an important floral attractant for pollinators and as effective feeding deterrent against florivores in the same plant species. A plain language summary is available for this article.  aPublisher supplied data  cMax‐Planck‐Gesellschaft  cMax Planck Society 3aDiabrotica undecimpunctata 3aManduca sexta 3aNicotiana attenuata 3aacetone 3aantifeedants 3abiosynthesis 3acorolla 3acucumbers 3aemissions 3agenes 3ahabitats 3ahosts 3amoths 3aodors 3apollen 3apollinators 3atobacco 3aUtah1 aBing, Julia1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9428-91721 aHaverkamp, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3512-96591 aBaldwin, Ian T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5371-29740 tFunctional ecology.g2019 July, v. 33, no. 7 p.1223-1232dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44821x0269-84637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.133323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02489naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245010300158300001600261500001900277520138700296592002801683650002601711650001701737650001501754650001201769650002101781650001501802650001501817650001301832653002601845653001801871653002501889773012901914856007502043852000902118655001202127IND60727186920221121222614.0210209e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072718692DNAL7 a10.3382/japr/pfv0742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjuwon, K.M.10aToward a better understanding of mechanisms of probiotics and prebiotics action in poultry species  ap. 277-283.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aFor many decades, the poultry industry has benefitted from improved health and performance of birds due to inclusion of sub-therapeutic levels of antibiotics in feeds. However, several countries have prohibited, or are in the process of prohibiting, non-therapeutic uses of antibiotics in poultry. This is necessitated by the need to prevent development of antibiotic resistant strains (superbugs) of bacteria that may pose a threat to human health. The industry has responded with development of probiotic (direct-fed microbials)/prebiotic products that are claimed to have similar benefits as antibiotics. However, although many of these products have reasonable levels of field efficacy, significant variability still exists in their effectiveness in comparison with antibiotics. To complicate the issue further, many commercial vendors “oversell” their products with unsubstantiated claims of efficacy. A “systems” approach involving a better understanding of the microbiome, microbe-microbe and microbe-host interaction is being proposed for a better understanding of physiological mechanisms of probiotic/prebiotic action. This may require the use of advanced molecular, analytical and computational techniques. Although these techniques are expansive, the pay-off for the poultry industry in terms of better predictability of prebiotics/probiotic effects is enormous.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3ahuman health 3amicrobiome 3apoultry 3apoultry industry 3aprebiotics 3aprobiotics 3aresearch 0acompetitive exclusion 0anutrigenomics 0ainteractome analysis0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2016 June 01, v. 25, no. 2 p.277-283dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfv0743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02322naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006300166300001600229520125900245592002801504650002701532650001901559650002601578650001201604650001401616650001501630650001101645650001201656650001401668651001801682700001901700700002501719700002301744773009101767856008101858852000901939655001201948IND60082561920221120163900.0150209e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008256192DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-014-1253-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHowe, Peter D.10aMapping the shadow of experience of extreme weather events  ap. 381-389.  aClimate change will increase the frequency and/or intensity of certain extreme weather events, and perceived experience with extreme weather may influence climate change beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors. However, the aspects of extreme events that influence whether or not people perceive that they have personally experienced them remain unclear. We investigate (1) the correspondence of reported experience of extreme weather events with documented events, and (2) how characteristics of different extreme events shape the geographic area within which people are likely to report they have experienced it—the event’s perceived “shadow of experience.” We overlay geocoded survey responses indicating personal experience with hurricanes, tornadoes, and drought—from a 2012 nationally representative survey (N = 1,008) of U.S. residents—on maps of recorded event impacts. We find that reported experiences correspond well with recorded event impacts, particularly for hurricanes and tornadoes. Reported experiences were related to event type, proximity, magnitude and duration. The results suggest locations where disaster preparedness efforts and climate change education campaigns could be most effective after an extreme weather event.  aPublisher supplied data 3aattitudes and opinions 3aclimate change 3adisaster preparedness 3adrought 3aeducation 3ahurricanes 3apeople 3asurveys 3atornadoes 3aUnited States1 aBoudet, Hilary1 aLeiserowitz, Anthony1 aMaibach, Edward W.0 tClimatic change.g2014 Nov., v. 127, no. 2 p.381-389dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-014-1253-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02643naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245008400164520145200248592002801700650001401728650002001742650001501762650001201777650001601789650001401805650001401819650001801833650001101851700002101862700002101883700002201904700001901926700002001945700002001965700002001985700002102005773012302026856007502149852000902224655001202233IND60760793220221120142745.0211223e20211217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076079322DNAL7 a10.3390/nu131245112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahanani, Melani R.10aLong-Term Outcomes of in Utero Ramadan Exposure: A Systematic Literature Review  aHealth outcomes of in utero Ramadan exposure have been reported in a systematic literature review; however, the available literature on long-term effects were not fully covered. Our study aims to specifically review the long-term outcomes of in utero Ramadan exposure. We searched for original research articles analyzing any long-term outcome of in utero Ramadan exposure, excluding maternal and perinatal outcomes. Sixteen studies from 8304 non-duplicate search results were included. Most studies suggest negative consequences from in utero Ramadan exposure on health, as well as on economic outcomes later in adulthood. Higher under-five mortality rate, higher mortality under three months, and under one year, shorter stature, lower body mass index, increased incidence of vision, hearing and learning disabilities, lower mathematics, writing and reading scores, as well as a lower probability to own a home were associated with Ramadan exposure during conception or the first trimester of pregnancy. Furthermore, age and sex seem to play a pivotal role on the association. Existing studies suggest that in utero Ramadan exposure may adversely impact long-term health and economic well-being. However, evidence is limited. Meanwhile, increasing awareness of the potential risks of Ramadan fasting during pregnancy should be raised among pregnant women and clinicians and other antenatal care workers should promote better maternal healthcare.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulthood 3abody mass index 3aconception 3afasting 3amathematics 3amortality 3apregnancy 3aprenatal care 3avision1 aAbderbwih, Eman 1 aWendt, Amanda S.1 aDeckert, Andreas 1 aAntia, Khatia 1 aHorstick, Olaf 1 aDambach, Peter 1 aKohler, Stefan 1 aWinkler, Volker 0 tNutrients.g2021 Dec. 17, v. 13, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2271x2072-66437nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu131245113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02996naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245018300169300001600352520137400368592002801742650002001770650002201790650002201812650002401834650001801858650001201876650001701888650002401905650001801929650002101947650001201968650003301980650000902013650001602022650001602038650002102054653002002075653001902095653001702114653003302131653002202164653001602186700002102202700001802223700001702241700001702258773009802275856008402373852000902457655001202466IND60601133820221118054720.0180706e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060113382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatel, Jaydeep10aDesign and development of solid nanoparticulate dosage forms of telmisartan for bioavailability enhancement by integration of experimental design and principal component analysis  ap. 331-343.  aAim of the present investigation was to develop nanoparticulate solid oral dosage forms of a poorly water soluble antihypertensive agent, telmisartan (TLM) by converting the optimized batch of drug loaded nanosuspensions into a tablet dosage form using lyophilization technique. The TLM loaded nanosuspensions were optimized by implementation of 3² full factorial design along with principal component analysis (PCA) with concentration of stabilizer and amount of milling agents as factors. The optimized batch of TLM loaded nanosuspension exhibited a mean particle size of 334.67±10.43nm. The results of various instrumental techniques illustrated retention of drug crystallinity after milling and lyophilization. The results of in vitro drug release study of tablets containing drug nanocrystals revealed remarkable improvement in the dissolution rate as compared to the marketed tablet (Sartel® 20). The results of in vivo pharmacokinetic study on Wister rats revealed 1.5-fold enhancement in oral bioavailability for tablets containing TLM nanocrystals against the marketed tablets. The present study proposed nanosuspension as a suitable approach for developing nanosized solid oral dosage forms of poorly water soluble drugs like telmisartan using design of experiment and principal component analysis as two important paradigms of quality by design technique.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioavailability 3acrystal structure 3adrug formulations 3aexperimental design 3afreeze drying 3amilling 3ananocrystals 3aoral administration 3aparticle size 3apharmacokinetics 3apowders 3aprincipal component analysis 3arats 3astabilizers 3atelmisartan 3awater solubility 0aBioavailability 0aNanosuspension 0aNanocrystals 0aPrincipal component analysis 0aQuality by design 0aTelmisartan1 aDhingani, Anjali1 aGarala, Kevin1 aRaval, Mihir1 aSheth, Navin0 tPowder technology.g2014 May, v. 258 p.331-343dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03765naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245021200216300001600428506007600444520160700520592002802127506003702155650002202192650002002214650002802234650001602262650001102278650001002289650001402299650001402313650001302327650001802340650001602358650001102374650001302385650001002398650001902408650001002427650001002437650001202447650000802459650001802467650002302485650002102508650004402529650001102573650002002584650001002604653002202614653002802636653002002664653002502684653002702709653001702736700002602753700002702779773019302806856008302999852000903082655001203091IND60625453120221207075209.0190417e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062545312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijvsm.2018.08.0062doi7 aPMC62864042pmcid7 a305645912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSumuduni, Bannak G.D.10aChronological analysis of the damages caused by the metacercariae of Centrocestus formosanus in the gills of Cyprinus carpio and lesions caused by the adult flukes in Ardeola ralloides: An experimental study  ap. 165-171.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCentrocestus formosanus is a digenean that requires three host species to complete its life cycle. This study was conducted to observe the damage caused by two life stages of the C. formosanus on its host species. The snail Melanoides tuberculata was induced to shed cercariae by exposing to sunlight and specimens of koi carps were experimentally infected with cercariae. Gills of two infected fish were killed and fixed in Bouin’s solution daily for 21 days. Infected fish were continuously fed to a pond heron (Ardeola ralloides) for three weeks and therafter the bird was killed. Small intestine was resected as duodenum, jejunum, and ileum and fixed in formol saline. Gills and small intestine were prepared to study the histopathological damages. Flared opercula with protruding gills and increased respiratory rate were identified as the primary clinical signs of the fish. Encysted metacercariae were observed in the basal, middle and in the apical portion of the gills’ filaments and gradual distortions and extensive proliferation of the cartilage of the gills resulted in loss of the respiratory epithelium. A progression of fibroblast to chondroblast encapsulation of the parasite was observed in the gill of fish as a host response. The duodenum of the heron was severely infected with adult parasites than jejunum and ileum. Flukes were observed in the villi, mucosae, submucosae, and also in the tunica muscularis of the duodenum. In conclusion, this study revealed that the heavy infection of C. formosanus could cause severe pathological lesions in both koi carps and pond heron.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArdeola ralloides 3aCyprinus carpio 3aMelanoides tuberculatus 3aPetrorhagia 3aadults 3abirds 3acartilage 3acercariae 3aduodenum 3aencapsulation 3afibroblasts 3aflukes 3aformalin 3agills 3ahistopathology 3ahosts 3aileum 3ajejunum 3akoi 3ametacercariae 3arespiratory mucosa 3arespiratory rate 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3asnails 3asolar radiation 3avilli 0aArdeola ralloides 0aCentrocestus formosanus 0aCyprinus carpio 0aIntestinal pathology 0aMelanoides tuberculata 0aMetacercaria1 aMunasinghe, Dona H.N.1 aArulkanthan, Appudurai0 tInternational journal of veterinary science and medicine.g2018 Dec., v. 6, no. 2 p.165-171dElsevier B.V.aFaculty of Veterinary Medicine, Cairo UniversitywJournal:21657x2314-45997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijvsm.2018.08.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02280naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002900144245009000173520128300263592002801546650002401574650001101598650002401609650002201633650001701655650001401672650001501686700003101701700002501732773012101757856007901878852000901957655001201966IND60781065520221120031901.0220623e20220613xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106552DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNkosi, Lungani Siyabonga10aMorpho-Agronomic Evaluation of Lagenaria siceraria Landraces and Their F1 Populations  aLagenaria siceraria is one of the most important cucurbitaceous vegetables due to its prolific bearing habit, its edibility as a cooked vegetable, and its low cost of cultivation. The objective of this study was to evaluate variation in the morpho-agronomic traits among selected landraces and their F₁ populations. The landraces were crossed based on the North Carolina II genetic design to develop F₁ populations. The twelve F₁ populations along with seven parental landraces were grown in a randomized complete block design with three replications. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among quantitative traits suggesting considerable genetic variability. The genotypes displayed significant variation in most qualitative traits of fruits and seeds. The first five principal components of quantitative traits among the evaluated 19 genotypes contributed 74.84% of the variability. The biplot and dendrogram clustered the genotypes into five clusters according to their vegetative, fruit, and seed traits. The highest value for the broad-sense heritability estimate was recorded for days to edible harvest maturity trait. The F₁ progenies were more variable than the landraces and can therefore be used for further Lagenaria siceraria genetic improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLagenaria siceraria 3afruits 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3alandraces 3avegetables1 aNtuli, Nontuthuko Rosemary1 aMavengahama, Sydney 0 tPlants.g2022 June 13, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02367naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245013600163300001600299520115800315592002801473650001501501650001301516650001001529650001101539650001901550650001101569650001301580650001601593650000901609650000901618650001701627650001601644650002601660650001801686650001301704650001201717650001501729700001901744773011301763856004801876852000901924655001201933IND50089267720221120052249.0140503e200508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008926772DNAL7 a10.1007/s00217-005-1167-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaack, Karl10aApplication of by-products from industrial processing of potato flour and yellow peas as ingredients in low-fat high-fibre sausages  ap. 313-319.  aExperiments using dry potato pulp from processing of potato flour, and pea flour from processing of yellow peas as raw materials for processing of low-fat high-fibre sausages were carried out. Color and texture were measured using objective methods and the approximate content of energy was calculated. A 1:1 mixture of potato pulp and pea flour hydrated with 7:1 vegetable soup resulted in sausages with a delicious flavor and texture and an attractive external and internal color. The percentage of fat energy was reduced from 68% in the standard sausages to 24% in the low-fat high-fibre sausages. Factor analysis showed that 96% of the data variation in results from measurement of texture could be attributed to factors of high loadings for hardness, energy, modulus and gumminess. Cohesiveness, modulus, energy, hardness and gumminess were the most important factors. Results from studies of the effect of exchange of meat with water showed patterns similar to the pattern between texture characteristics and dry matter. It was theorized that hardness depended on two gelling processes. The texture patterns were associated to salt and dry matter.  aPublisher supplied data 3abyproducts 3acohesion 3acolor 3aenergy 3aenergy content 3aflavor 3ahardness 3aingredients 3ameat 3apeas 3apotato flour 3apotato pulp 3aprocessing technology 3araw materials 3asausages 3atexture 3avegetables1 aPedersen, Lene0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2005 Aug., v. 221, no. 3-4 p.313-319dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-005-1167-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02059naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245018500164300001800349520069800367592002801065650001201093650002101105650001601126650001901142650001501161650004601176650001501222650002101237650001601258650001101274700002301285700002501308700003101333700002701364700002501391700002201416773012801438856007401566852000901640655001201649IND60638821720221120050124.0190430e20171123xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063882172DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ay01965c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTopolyan, Artyom P.12aA novel trityl/acridine derivatization agent for analysis of thiols by (matrix-assisted)(nanowire-assisted)laser desorption/ionization and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  ap. 6335-6340.  aThe derivatization reagent was prepared in situ by the reaction of tris(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)methylium hexafluorophosphate with N-(2-aminoethyl)maleimide and used for the modification of a number of low molecular weight thiols.

However, for genes with more than a few exons, the problem tends to be challenging and often involves identifiability issues in statistical modeling. We have developed a statistical method called "sparse linear modeling of RNA-Seq data for isoform discovery and abundance estimation" (SLIDE) that takes exon boundaries and RNA-Seq data as input to discern the set of mRNA isoforms that are most likely to present in an RNA-Seq sample. SLIDE is based on a linear model with a design matrix that models the sampling probability of RNA-Seq reads from different mRNA isoforms. To tackle the model unidentifiability issue, SLIDE uses a modified Lasso procedure for parameter estimation. Compared with deterministic isoform assembly algorithms (e.g., Cufflinks), SLIDE considers the stochastic aspects of RNA-Seq reads in exons from different isoforms and thus has increased power in detecting more novel isoforms. Another advantage of SLIDE is its flexibility of incorporating other transcriptomic data such as RACE, CAGE, and EST into its model to further increase isoform discovery accuracy. SLIDE can also work downstream of other RNA-Seq assembly algorithms to integrate newly discovered genes and exons. Besides isoform discovery, SLIDE sequentially uses the same linear model to estimate the abundance of discovered isoforms. Simulation and real data studies show that SLIDE performs as well as or better than major competitors in both isoform discovery and abundance estimation.

SJ-10 plus β-glucooligosaccharides as a synbiotic on growth performance, innate immunity and streptococcosis resistance in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus)  ap. 544-553.  aBacillus sp. SJ-10 (BSJ-10) was identified from traditional Korean fermented fish, the previously recognized prebiotic β-glucooligosaccharides (BGO), and their combination as a synbiotic were prepared to evaluate their individual and synergistic effects in olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Four diets (one control and three treatments) were formulated containing neither BSJ-10 nor BGO (control), 1 × 108 CFU g −1 BSJ-10 (BSJ-10), 0.1% BGO (BGO), and 1 × 108 CFU g−1 BSJ-10 + 0.1% BGO (BSJ-10 + BGO). Triplicates of 15 fish (weight 10 ± 0.25 g) were randomly allocated to the four diet groups and fed one of the diets for 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, fish weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion ratio, and protein efficiency ratio in BSJ-10, BGO and BSJ-10 + BGO diets were positively modulated (P < 0.05) compared with control. Specially, WG and SGR were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in BSJ-10 + BGO than that of BSJ-10 and BGO (individual component). The innate immune parameters such as respiratory burst, superoxide dismutase, and lysozyme activity (LSZ) of fish fed BSJ-10 and BSJ-10 + BGO (both groups) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the control. Moreover, myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and LSZ of fish fed BSJ-10 + BGO were significantly higher compared with individual component. Compared with control, intestinal BSJ-10 content, expression of interleukin (IL)-1β in liver and kidney, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in liver were higher in both groups, but microvillus length was increased (P < 0.05) only in BSJ-10 + BGO. During in vivo challenge experiment with Streptococcus iniae (1 × 108 CFU ml−1), survival rate of fish was significantly higher in all treatment groups versus control. Moreover, in BSJ-10 + BGO, protection against S. iniae infection and transcription of TNF-α and IL-6 in gill were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the individual component. Collectively, an improved WG, SGR, MPO, LSZ, transcription of IL-6 and TNF-α, and cumulative survival rate against streptococcosis clearly demonstrates a synergistic outcome of diet BSJ-10 + BGO as synbiotic in olive flounder.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aStreptococcus iniae 3aenzyme activity 3afeed conversion 3afermented fish 3aflounder 3agrowth performance 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-6 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aliver 3alysozyme 3amicrovilli 3amyeloperoxidase 3aprebiotics 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3arespiratory burst 3ashellfish 3aspecific growth rate 3asuperoxide dismutase 3asurvival rate 3asynergism 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3aweight gain 0aSynbiotic 0aGrowth performance 0aInnate immunity 0aGene expression 0aOlive flounder 0aBSJ-10 0aBSJ-10 diet 0aBGO 0aBGO diet 0aBSJ-10 + BGO 0aboth groups 0aindividual component 0aWG 0aFCR 0aLSZ 0aMPO 0aSOD 0aTNF 0aIL 0aCD 0aMVL1 aJang, Won Je1 aKim, Haham1 aLee, Bong Joo,1 aKim, Kang Woong1 aHur, Sang Woo1 aLim, Sang Gu1 aBai, Sungchul C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7984-22671 aKong, In-Soo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8759-88550 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2018 Nov., v. 82 p.544-553dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02006naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002200183245022200205300001800427506007600445520055400521592002801075506003701103650001601140650001301156650001401169650001501183650001801198650002301216650001901239700002101258700001701279700001601296700006301312773014701375856007701522852000901599655001201608IND60607915820221207133104.0181020e20180718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060791582DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.8b057252doi7 aPMC62065062pmcid7 a300207772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabrera, James M.10aSelection between Diastereomeric Kinetic vs Thermodynamic Carbonyl Binding Modes Enables Enantioselective Iridium-Catalyzed anti-(α-Aryl)allylation of Aqueous Fluoral Hydrate and Difluoroacetaldehyde Ethyl Hemiacetal  ap. 9392-9395.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEnantioselectivity increases with increasing carbonyl electrophilicity in 2-propanol-mediated reductive couplings of aldehydes with branched aryl-substituted allylic acetates to form products of carbonyl anti-(α-aryl)allylation.

Similarities between capacitation and cryoinjury have not been fully elucidated. The present study attempted to characterize both processes, including the role of seminal plasma (SP). Merocyanine-540 staining detected an increase (P < 0.01) in plasma membrane disorder from 60.5% in in vitro capacitated sperm to 91.4% in cryopreserved sperm, with no effect of SP. After cryopreservation, 42.8% of sperm displayed phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet compared to 13.6% of in vitro capacitated sperm (P < 0.01), as assessed by annexin-V staining (SP decreased phosphatidylserine inversion in both populations). Lipid raft-associated glycolipid GM₁ movement increased throughout the entire sperm membrane in cryopreserved sperm, although SP did not affect lipid raft movement in these sperm. Cryopreserved and in vitro capacitated sperm had a similar intensity of tyrosine phosphorylation (although SP reduced this intensity). In in vitro capacitated sperm, 67.5% underwent an ionophore induced acrosome reaction with 91.3% reacting in cryopreserved sperm. In both cases, SP reduced (P < 0.01) the percentage of acrosome-reacted sperm to 1.0 and 7.8%, respectively. Cryopreservation appeared to damage sperm, resulting in marked increases in membrane disorder, cholesterol efflux, and percent of capacitated sperm. In both capacitated and cryoinjured sperm, the addition of SP appeared to attenuate some of these events.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aacrosome reaction 3abiochemical pathways 3acholesterol 3acryopreservation 3aphosphorylation 3aplasma membrane 3aseminal plasma 3aspermatozoa 3aswine 3atyrosine 2aAnimals 2aCell Membrane 2aCryopreservationxveterinary 2aMale 2aSemenxphysiology 2aSemen Preservationxveterinary 2aSignal Transduction 2aSperm Capacitationxphysiology 2aSpermatozoaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aSwinexphysiology1 aAlthouse, Gary C.0 tTheriogenology.g2011 Nov., v. 76, no. 8 p.1508-1516dElsevier Inc.x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2011.06.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02356naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002700145245010500172300001800277520124100295592002801536650001201564650002601576650001701602650000901619650001901628650001801647650001801665650001001683650001301693650002301706700002801729700003601757700002301793773010901816856004801925852000901973655001201982IND4466337220221120164818.0130322e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446633722DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-012-1204-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFritt-Rasmussen, Janne10aHydrocarbon and Toxic Metal Contamination from Tank Installations in a Northwest Greenlandic Village  ap. 4407-4416.  aContamination from tank installations in the Arctic is an important issue, since tanks are a necessary feature of all communities, and may be a source of local pollution. Soil samples from below and around three tank installations and one reference site in the Northwest Greenlandic village of Tasiusaq were analysed for the total content of hydrocarbons (THC), lead, cadmium and organic content in the soil. Concentrations up to 77,000Â mg/kg DW THC were found, mainly as weathered oil products. Elevated levels of lead and cadmium were also found in many of the samples, with concentrations up to 300 and 2Â mg/kg DW, respectively. The tank installation areas were contaminated by THC, lead and cadmium compared to the reference site, and parts of the areas were highly contaminated, exceeding the Danish environmental quality criteria. The correlation between lead and cadmium concentrations was significant (pâ<â0.01), while no correlation existed between THC and organic matter. Small spills from daily use of the tank installations are suggested to be the source of the THC contamination, whereas the lead and cadmium contamination is suggested to originate primarily from the plume of smoke from waste incineration.  aPublisher supplied data 3acadmium 3aenvironmental quality 3ahydrocarbons 3alead 3aorganic matter 3aorganic soils 3asoil sampling 3atanks 3avillages 3awaste incineration1 aJensen, Pernille Erland1 aChristensen, Rune Haubo Bojesen1 aDahllÃ¶f, Ingela0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2012 Sept., v. 223, no. 7 p.4407-4416dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-012-1204-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02632naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245010100167300001800268520148600286592002801772650002801800650001401828650001701842650001101859650001101870650001501881650001201896653002601908653003001934653002501964653003001989653002602019700001702045773010002062856008702162852000902249655001202258IND60565539620221117233318.0180830e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056553962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yibo10aShort-term prediction of electric demand in building sector via hybrid support vector regression  ap. 1363-1374.  aReliable and highly-generalized prediction models of short-term electric demand are urgently needed for the building sector, as the crucial basis of sophisticated building energy management. Advances in metering technologies and machine learning methods provide both opportunities and challenges for modified approaches. With multi-resolution wavelet decomposition (MWD) as a preprocessing from the point of view of signal analysis, the hybrid support vector regression (SVR) model was applied in two case study buildings to predict the hourly electric demand intensity. Taking ten-dimensional parameters of 29 workdays as the training sample, this model was carried out in a mall and a hotel, the consumed electric demand sequences of which represented the stationary and non-stationary series respectively.By comparisons between the hybrid SVR and the pure SVR, results indicated that the introduction of MWD can always improve the predicting accuracy for the hotel, while it is not necessary for the mall. Specifically, the similar steady level around 0.65W/m² of absolute error was obtained for the mall and the hotel buildings, when ε was lower than 0.1. At the same time, the steady quantitative values of relative errors tended to be around 4% and 6% respectively for the hotel and the mall. Based on the limited historical readings, this paper offers an on-line prediction method of short-term electric demand, which is applicable for the further smart energy management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3abuildings 3acase studies 3aenergy 3amodels 3aprediction 3awavelet 0aShort-term prediction 0aElectric demand intensity 0aCommercial buildings 0aSupport vector regression 0aWavelet decomposition1 aTan, Hongwei0 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 204 p.1363-1374dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02945naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245009600161500001400257520134700271592002801618650001101646650001901657650001401676650001001690650001701700650001601717650002001733650001001753650001501763650001501778650001701793653001301810653000901823653000701832653000801839653000801847653000801855653001001863653000901873653001001882653001001892653000901902653000801911653000701919653001301926653000901939653001201948653000801960653000901968653001301977653001001990653002602000653002102026653001502047653001002062700001502072700001602087773008802103856008302191852000902274655001202283IND60687374420221120193349.0200503e20200630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068737442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2020.1446252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yun10aHsa_circ_0061140 promotes endometrial carcinoma progression via regulating miR-149-5p/STAT3  aNAL-light  aCircular RNAs (circRNAs) are reported to participate in many diseases including tumorigenesis, which can modulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.

Moreover, we revealed hsa_circ_0061140 could act as a molecular sponge for miR-149-5p. STAT3 was predicted as a downstream target gene of miR-149-5p. As well known, miR-149-5p is reported to be involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Then, dual luciferase reporter experiment and RIP assay were carried out to evidence the direct binding association between hsa_circ_0061140 and miR-149-5p. miR-149-5p was able to negatively modulate STAT3 expression. Additionally, we proved hsa_circ_0061140 exhibited its oncogenic role due to the modulation of miR-149-5p and STAT3 axis. Taken these together, we suggested that hsa_circ_0061140 might act as an effective therapy to treat EC through functioning as a molecular sponge of miR-149-5p.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassays 3acarcinogenesis 3acarcinoma 3acells 3acircular RNA 3aendometrium 3agene expression 3agenes 3aluciferase 3ametastasis 3atherapeutics 0aCircRNAs 0aCCK8 0aEC 0aECL 0aFBS 0aHRP 0aHIPK3 0aIL-6 0aLARP4 0aLATS1 0amTOR 0aPBS 0aPI 0aPI3K/AKT 0aPVDF 0aqRT-PCR 0aRIP 0aRPMI 0aSDS-PAGE 0aSTAT3 0aEndometrial carcinoma 0aHsa_circ_0061140 0amiR-149-5p 0aSTAT31 aChang, Yue1 aCai, Yixuan0 tGene.g2020 June 30, v. 745 p.144625-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2020.1446253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03532naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011500170300001600285520215500301592002802456650001902484650002502503650002002528650001602548650002202564650001202586650001602598650001802614650002002632650001802652650002302670650001602693651001502709653001502724653001402739653001702753653001602770653001602786700002502802700002302827700001902850773009802869856008602967852000903053655001203062IND60593086520221122044100.0180415e20150101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Mingjie13aAn efficient optimization of well placement and control for a geothermal prospect under geological uncertainty  ap. 352-363.  aThis study applies an efficient optimization technique based on a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) technique to determine the optimal design and engineering of a potential geothermal production operation at a prospect near Superstition Mountain in Southern California, USA. The faster MARS-based statistical model is used as a surrogate for higher-fidelity physical models within the intensive optimization process. Its use allows for the exploration of the impacts of specific engineering design parameters in the context of geologic uncertainty as a means to both understand and maximize profitability of the production operation. The MARS model is initially developed from a training dataset generated by a finite set of computationally complex hydrothermal models applied to the prospect. Its application reveals that the optimal engineering design variables can differ considerably assuming different choices of hydrothermal flow properties, which, in turn, indicates the importance of reducing the uncertainty of key geologic properties. The major uncertainty sources in the natural-system are identified and ranked first by an efficient MARS-enabled total order sensitivity quantification, which is then used to assist evaluating the effect of geological uncertainties on optimized results. At the Southern California prospect, this parameter sensitivity analysis suggests that groundwater circulation through high permeable structures, rather than heat conduction through impermeable granite, is the primary heat transfer method during geothermal extraction. Reservoir histories simulated using optimal parameters with different constraints are analyzed and compared to investigate the longevity and maximum profit of the geothermal resources. The comparison shows that the longevity and profit are very likely to be overestimated by optimizations without appropriate constraints on natural conditions. In addition to geothermal energy production, this optimization approach can also be used to manage other geologic resource operations, such as hydrocarbon production or CO2 sequestration, under uncertain reservoir conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sequestration 3adata collection 3aengineering 3ageothermal energy 3agranite 3agroundwater 3aheat transfer 3aphysical models 3aprofitability 3astatistical models 3auncertainty 3aCalifornia 0aGeothermal 0aSurrogate 0aOptimization 0aUncertainty 0aSensitivity1 aTompson, Andrew F.B.1 aMellors, Robert J.1 aAbdalla, Osman0 tApplied energy.g2015 Jan. 01, v. 137 p.352-363dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2014.10.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02959naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002100143245010300164300001600267520160500283592002801888650001501916650001701931650001901948650001301967650002301980650001402003650001602017650002902033650005302062650002002115650001702135650002902152650003102181653001702212653001302229653001402242653000902256653001202265700002102277773012802298856007802426852000902504655001202513IND60649392320221117234249.0190730e20180801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064939232DNAL7 a10.1089/jmf.2017.01362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Jeremy E.10aTranscriptional Regulation of TCF/LEF and PPARγ by Daidzein and Genistein in 3T3-L1 Preadipocytes  ap. 761-768.  aAdipogenesis is central to adipose tissue plasticity and lipid homeostasis. Regulation of adipogenic signaling by phytoestrogens has been implicated as a potential therapeutic strategy for obesity-related disease. However, it remains unclear how these compounds directly impact transcriptional control of adipogenesis. As such, the focus of this study was to determine how daidzein and genistein effect transcriptional activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and TCF/LEF in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. We also measured the effect of estrogen receptor (ER) knockdown on expression of preadipocyte (i.e., Pref1) and adipocyte (i.e., Fabp4) markers in cells treated with varying concentrations of daidzein or genistein (i.e., 10⁻⁴, 10⁻⁷, and 10⁻¹⁰). Our findings showed that activation of TCF/LEF was induced by daidzein and genistein in undifferentiated and differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Conversely, PPARγ reporter activity was inhibited by genistein, which corresponded with a reduction in cell diameter of differentiated preadipocytes. Daidzein increased cell diameter, as well as reduced Pref1 abundance in undifferentiated cells. Although small, there was a significant reduction in Pref1 and Fabp4 abundance in undifferentiated cells with ERα and ERβ knockdown. However, reduced abundance of ER subtypes exhibited no significant effect on phytoestrogen treatment. Collectively, our findings show phytoestrogens distinctly regulate adipogenic transcription factors and thus, may have implications for adipose dysfunction and obesity-related disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadipocytes 3aadipogenesis 3aadipose tissue 3adaidzein 3aestrogen receptors 3agenistein 3ahomeostasis 3aobesity-related diseases 3aperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 3aplant estrogens 3atherapeutics 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptional activation 0aadipogenesis 0adaidzein 0agenistein 0aPPAR 0aTCF/LEF1 aHastings, Darcie0 tJournal of medicinal food.g2018 Aug. 01, v. 21, no. 8 p.761-768dMary Ann Liebert, Inc.wJournal:jnl57082x1557-76007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1089/jmf.2017.01363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02157naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245007900171300001800250520111200268592002801380650001401408650001301422650001101435653002201446653002001468653002001488653001801508653001501526653001301541700001601554700001301570700001601583773010001599856008701699852000901786655001201795IND60565539720221117233252.0180830e20171015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056553972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xiaopeng10aObserver based battery SOC estimation: Using multi-gain-switching approach  ap. 1275-1283.  aSensor drifts and modelling mismatches are key factors that influence the accuracy of state of charge (SOC) estimation for LiFePO4 batteries. In this study, an observer robust to these factors is proposed. First, the causes of SOC errors, for example, modelling error and uncertain initial error, are studied. Second, a geometry classifier is designed to categorize these errors into different groups using the information of voltage error between model and measurements. Third, with the classifier, different types of errors are treated differently by switching the gains of the observer. Finally, the method is tested in comparison to the existing methods for both new and aged cells. The test results show that the proposed method can correctly categorize the error causes and take the corresponding countermeasures. The common problems encountered in SOC estimations, such as local model inaccuracy, current sensor drifting and data saturation, could be overcome. The computation time of the proposed method is close to that of the Luenberger observer, making it suitable for real embedded applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3ageometry 3amodels 0aElectric vehicles 0aLiFePO4 battery 0aState-of-charge 0aBattery model 0aClassifier 0aObserver1 aLiu, Boyang1 aLv, Zhou1 aGao, Furong0 tApplied energy.g2017 Oct. 15, v. 204 p.1275-1283dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02683naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245010600174300002000280520109100300592002801391650001501419650001501434650002401449650001401473650001401487650002701501650002001528650002601548653001101574653002101585653000801606653001101614653001101625700005301636700002301689700001801712700005501730700005701785700003301842700001801875700002601893700002901919700001601948700001201964700002001976773010901996856005102105852000902156655001202165IND60767924420221120181335.0220222e20220217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076792442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.molcel.2022.01.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMeza-Sosa, Karla F.10aSPARCLE, a p53-induced lncRNA, controls apoptosis after genotoxic stress by promoting PARP-1 cleavage  ap. 785-802.e10.  ap53, master transcriptional regulator of the genotoxic stress response, controls cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis following DNA damage. Here, we identify a p53-induced lncRNA suicidal PARP-1 cleavage enhancer (SPARCLE) adjacent to miR-34b/c required for p53-mediated apoptosis. SPARCLE is a ∼770-nt, nuclear lncRNA induced 1 day after DNA damage. Despite low expression (<16 copies/cell), SPARCLE deletion increases DNA repair and reduces DNA-damage-induced apoptosis as much as p53 deficiency, while its overexpression restores apoptosis in p53-deficient cells. SPARCLE does not alter gene expression. SPARCLE binds to PARP-1 with nanomolar affinity and causes apoptosis by acting as a caspase-3 cofactor for PARP-1 cleavage, which separates PARP-1’s N-terminal (NT) DNA-binding domain from its catalytic domains. NT-PARP-1 inhibits DNA repair. Expressing NT-PARP-1 in SPARCLE-deficient cells increases unrepaired DNA damage and restores apoptosis after DNA damage. Thus, SPARCLE enhances p53-induced apoptosis by promoting PARP-1 cleavage, which interferes with DNA-damage repair.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aDNA-binding domains 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell cycle checkpoints 3astress response 3atranscription factors 0alncRNA 0agenotoxic stress 0ap53 0aPARP-1 0amiR-341 aMiao, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5541-38521 aNavarro, Francisco1 aZhang, Zhibin1 aZhang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1116-21821 aHu, Jun Jacob1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7098-62721 aHartford, Corrine Corrina R.1 aLi, Xiao Ling1 aPedraza-Alva, Gustavo1 aPérez-Martínez, Leonor1 aLal, Ashish1 aWu, Hao1 aLieberman, Judy0 tMolecular cell.g2022 Feb. 17, v. 82, no. 4 p.785-802.e10dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12017x1097-27657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2022.01.001  aDNAL 7aarticle02746naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001600145245012400161300001800285500002000303520138500323592002801708596006601736596006901802650002201871650001201893650001701905650002301922650001701945650002901962650002601991650003102017700001502048700002002063700005702083773013202140856007902272852000902351655001202360IND60751180920221123040624.0210923e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075118092DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Sebin10aTranscription activation of two clusters for exopolysaccharide biosynthesis by phosphorylated DctD in Vibrio vulnificus  ap. 5364-5377.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNtrC‐mediated production of exopolysaccharides (EPS), essential components for Vibrio vulnificus biofilms, is highly increased in the presence of dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic acids. Gel‐shift assays showed that regulation of the EPS‐gene cluster I (EPS‐I cluster) by NtrC was direct via binding of phosphorylated NtrC (p‐NtrC) to the regulatory region of the EPS‐I cluster. In contrast, p‐NtrC did not bind to the EPS‐II and EPS‐III clusters, suggesting that NtrC regulation was not direct and another transcription factor belonging to an NtrC‐regulon might play a role in activating their transcription. A candidate transcription factor, DctD, of which expression was induced by NtrC, activated the expression of the EPS‐II and EPS‐III clusters via direct binding to their upstream regions. Under growth conditions with either dicarboxylic or tricarboxylic acids, the expression of NtrC was induced and the transcription of dctD was activated. Furthermore, DctD exhibited higher transcriptional activity under the conditions with dicarboxylic acids than with tricarboxylic acids. Therefore, this study demonstrates that under dicarboxylate‐rich conditions, both the abundance and activity of DctD were markedly induced, which activates the expression of two EPS clusters to maximize biosynthesis of EPS facilitating biofilm maturation in V. vulnificus.  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF‐2018R1A5A1025077cNational Research Foundation of Korea  aNRF‐2021R1A2B5B02002477cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aVibrio vulnificus 3abiofilm 3abiosynthesis 3aexopolysaccharides 3amicrobiology 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3atranscriptional activation1 aPark, Hana1 aLee, Kyung‐Jo1 aLee, Kyu‐Ho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4424-80620 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.5364-5377dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013200156520132100288592002801609650001501637650001701652650002301669650002101692650001501713700001901728700001901747700001501766700002001781700001801801700001801819773012801837856007501965852000902040655001202049IND60771431020221121224941.0220325e20220310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077143102DNAL7 a10.3390/rs140613492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLian, Ting 10aEstimating Evapotranspiration over Heterogeneous Surface with Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 Data: A Case Study in Heihe River Basin  aEvapotranspiration (ET) is an important part of surface–atmosphere interactions, connecting the transfer of matter and energy. Land surface heterogeneity is a natural attribute of the Earth’s surface and is an inevitable problem in calculating ET with coarse resolution remote sensing data, which results in significant error in the ET estimation. This study aims to explore the effect and applicability of the evaporative fraction and area fraction (EFAF) method for correcting 1 km coarse resolution ET. In this study we use the input parameter upscaling (IPUS) algorithm to estimate energy fluxes and the EFAF method to correct ET estimates. Five ground stations in the midstream and downstream regions of the Heihe River Basin (HRB) were used to validate the latent heat flux (LE) calculated by the IPUS algorithm and EFAF method. The evaluation results show that the performance of the EFAF method is superior to that of the IPUS algorithm, with the coefficient of determination (R²) increasing, the root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing, and the mean bias error (MBE) decreasing by 17 W/m² on average. In general, the EFAF method is suitable for correcting the deviation in LE estimated based on Sentinel data caused by land surface heterogeneity and can be applied to obtain accurate estimates of ET.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3aevapotranspiration 3alatent heat flux 3awatersheds1 aXin, Xiaozhou 1 aPeng, Zhiqing 1 aLi, Fugen 1 aZhang, Hailong 1 aYu, Shanshan 1 aLiu, Huiyuan 0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Mar. 10, v. 14, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs140613493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010200169300001600271520111000287536019301397592002801590596006701618596012501685650001001810650002001820650001901840650001501859650002501874651001901899651001501918700001501933700001701948773011401965856008502079852000902164655001202173IND60595795620221122161640.0180607e20180703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059579562DNAL7 a10.1080/2150704X.2018.14631112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYanfang, Xiao10aAnalysis of the effective observation of ocean color satellites of the Yellow and East China Seas  ap. 656-665.  aBased on long time series of merged ocean color products (2003–2016) from the ESA GlobColour dataset, spatial and temporal distributions on effective observation days of ocean color satellites of the Yellow and East China Seas are analyzed. The results show that the average number of effective observation days for the region is 51 ± 6.8 days per year. Large numbers of such days appeared for the West Korea Bay and western Liaodong Bay, at 100 ± 8.3 days per year. Small numbers of days appeared for the southwestern southern Yellow Sea, northwestern East China Sea, and the branch of Kuroshio Current region, at 40 ± 10.1 days per year. Effective observation days of the Yellow and East China Seas had strong seasonal characteristics. The Bohai Sea, northern Yellow Sea, and southern Yellow Sea had two peaks in March and October. The East China Sea had a single peak in July. A lack of effective observation reduces the quality of monthly ocean color products, with greater than 15% bias if the monthly data are averaged from 3 days and 30% bias if the monthly data are from 1 day only.  aFoundation item: National Key R&D Program of China under contract No. 2016YFA0600102; the National Science Foundation of China under contract Nos 41506203, 41476159, 41506204 and 41606197.  aPublisher supplied data  acontract No. 2016YFA0600102cNational Key R&D Program of China  aNos 41506203 41476159 41506204 and 41606197cNational Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809 3acolor 3adata collection 3aremote sensing 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3aEast China Sea 3aYellow Sea1 aJie, Zhang1 aTingwei, Cui0 tRemote sensing letters.g2018 July 3, v. 9, no. 7 p.656-665dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12304x2150-70587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2150704X.2018.14631113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245012900176300001600305520225200321592002802573650002302601650002102624650002002645650001502665650001502680650001202695650001402707650001302721650000902734650001102743650002202754650001002776650001302786651001702799651001302816651001102829700002302840700002102863700002402884700002602908700002502934700002602959773010602985856005503091852000903146655001203155IND4476614020221120040857.0120418e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447661402DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02640.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlbernaz, Ana Luisa10aTree species compositional change and conservation implications in the white‐water flooded forests of the Brazilian Amazon  ap. 869-883.  aAim The aim of this study was to use compositional changes in tree species along the Amazon River floodplain in Brazil to identify and characterize biogeographic regions that would serve as broad surrogates for conservation planning. Location The main course of the Amazon River in Brazil, covering a river distance of approximately 2800 km. Methods Two sampling methods were employed at specific sites: standardized transects and/or individual‐based samples. Seventy‐three samples were collected from 26 sites at approximately 100‐km intervals along the floodplain. Biogeographic regions were identified by non‐metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and by a hierarchical cluster analysis. The relative influence of environmental components (flood depths, annual rainfall, and length of the dry season) on tree species composition and one spatial component (longitude) were analysed by multiple regressions against a one‐dimensional NMDS ordination axis. Results Based on tree species composition, three main biogeographic regions were identified: a western region between Tabatinga and the Negro River confluence; a central region from the Negro River confluence to the Xingu confluence; and an estuarine region from the Xingu confluence to Santana. The regions identified were consistent using different data sets and analytical techniques. Mixed environmental and spatial effects explained most of the variation, but the spatial effect alone had a greater influence on species composition than environmental effects alone. Main conclusions The regions delimited in the analyses differed from those based on geomorphology or World Wildlife Fund (WWF) ecoregions. These results reinforce the need for surrogates to be tested against biological data before they are used to shape approaches to conservation planning. Although a protected area coverage of 25% gives the impression of extensive conservation management on the floodplain, less than 1% of the Amazon’s floodplain in Brazil is strictly protected. The significant compositional differences between regions and the strong spatial variation along the Amazon indicate that strict protection areas should be distributed much more evenly within and between regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3acluster analysis 3adata collection 3adry season 3aecoregions 3aforests 3alongitude 3aplanning 3arain 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3atrees 3awildlife 3aAmazon River 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aPressey, Robert L.1 aCosta, Luiz R.F.1 aMoreira, Marcelo P.1 aRamos, José Ferreira1 aAssunção, Paulo A.1 aFranciscon, Carlos H.0 tJournal of biogeography.g2012 May, v. 39, no. 5 p.869-883dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0305-02707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2011.02640.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01303naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245015300157300001800310520022800328592002800556650000800584650002000592650002300612650002900635650002100664650001900685650001900704700001800723700002000741773013200761856007500893852000900968655001200977IND60658820920221120130022.0190826e20110207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065882092DNAL7 a10.1039/c0cc03921g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Yingshu10aElectrochemiluminescence induced photoelectrochemistry for sensing of the DNA based on DNA-linked CdS NPs superstructure with intercalator molecules  ap. 1595-1597.  aA novel detection protocol of DNA was developed using electrochemiluminescence (ECL) induced photoelectrochemistry (PEC) synthesis based on DNA-linked CdS NPs superstructure with methylene blue as the intercalator molecule.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3acadmium sulfide 3achemical reactions 3aelectrochemiluminescence 3aelectrochemistry 3amethylene blue 3aphotochemistry1 aSun, Yuanshun1 aZhang, Shusheng0 tChemical communications.g2011 Feb. 7, v. 47, no. 5 p.1595-1597dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c0cc03921g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03118naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245011000170300001600280520139000296592002801686650004401714650002201758650001301780650001901793650002401812650001201836650001201848650001101860650002401871650002501895650001101920650001701931650000901948650001301957650000901970650003301979650001102012650001302023650000902036653001202045653001902057653003602076653004002112700001702152700001302169700001802182700001802200700002102218700001902239700001902258700001302277700001702290773011402307856008602421852000902507655001202516IND60613230920221120160314.0200831e20180215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061323092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuan-Cheng10aUtilization of red mud and Pb/Zn smelter waste for the synthesis of a red mud-based cementitious material  ap. 343-349.  aA new method in which Pb/Zn smelter waste containing arsenic and heavy metals (arsenic sludge), red mud and lime are utilized to prepare red mud-based cementitious material (RCM) is proposed in this study. XRD, SEM, FTIR and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests were employed to assess the physicochemical properties of RCM. In addition, ettringite and iron oxide-containing ettringite were used to study the hydration mechanism of RCM. The results show that the UCS of the RCM (red mud+arsenic sludge+lime) was higher than that of the binder (red mud+arsenic sludge). When the mass ratio of m (binder): m (lime) was 94:6 and then maintained 28days at ambient temperature, the UCS reached 12.05MPa. The red mud has potential cementitious characteristics, and the major source of those characteristics was the aluminium oxide. In the red mud-arsenic sludge-lime system, aluminium oxide was effectively activated by lime and gypsum to form complex hydration products. Some of the aluminium in ettringite was replaced by iron to form calcium sulfoferrite hydrate. The BCR and leaching toxicity results show that the leaching concentration was strongly dependent on the chemical speciation of arsenic and the hydration products. Therefore, the investigated red mud and arsenic sludge can be successfully utilized in cement composites to create a red mud-based cementitious material.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aambient temperature 3aarsenic 3acalcium 3acement 3achemical speciation 3acompression strength 3agypsum 3aheavy metals 3airon 3aleaching 3alead 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asludge 3atoxicity 3azinc 0aRed mud 0aArsenic sludge 0aUnconfined compressive strength 0aRed mud-based cementitious material1 aMin, Xiao-Bo1 aKe, Yong1 aChai, Li-Yuan1 aShi, Mei-Qing1 aTang, Chong-Jian1 aWang, Qing-Wei1 aLiang, Yan-Jie1 aLei, Jie1 aLiu, De-Gang0 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2018 Feb. 15, v. 344 p.343-349dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2017.10.0463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03141naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245013700169300001600306520146100322592002801783650001801811650002301829650002101852650002801873650001501901650001901916650002001935650002601955650002201981650001402003650001902017650002702036650001402063650001202077651002102089651001002110653000902120653000802129653000702137653000702144653001002151653000902161653001802170653001602188653003102204653002302235653002202258700001402280700001402294700002202308773014102330856008302471852000902554655001202563IND60549709620221122053541.0190415e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054970962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jssas.2016.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoor Shah, Uzma10aAssessment of germplasm diversity and genetic relationships among walnut (Juglans regia L.) genotypes through microsatellite markers  ap. 339-350.  aJammu and Kashmir region of India has a rich walnut germplasm that has arisen from populations of naturally grown seedlings and some introductions from other countries over many years. In this study, the genetic relatedness of 96 walnut genotypes adapted to the North Western Himalayan region of Jammu and Kashmir, India, was analyzed by 19 SSR markers. Genetic relationships among 96 walnut genotypes revealed very high polymorphism rate of 89.6%. Primer parameter values viz PIC, MI and Rp range from 0 to 0.43, 0 to 0.87 and 1.04 to 2.37 with an average of 0.168, 0.244 and 1.91 respectively. UPMGA dendrogram showed that all the accessions formed twelve main clusters with various degree of sub-clustering within the clusters. Model-based cluster analysis grouped 96 walnut genotypes into 5 genetically distinct sub-populations with varied level of admixture. Allele Frequency Divergence and expected heterozygosity vary from 0.00 to 0.057 and 0.043 to 0.067 with an average of 0.024 and 0.057 respectively between all the five populations. These studies will be helpful in association mapping studies for important traits in walnut. The high variability existing in the walnut germplasm suggested that it would be beneficial to utilize this germplasm pool in walnut breeding programs and germplasm management activities and also identified microsatellite markers for cultivar identification, characterization, registration and assessment in genebanks.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJuglans regia 3achromosome mapping 3acluster analysis 3acultivar identification 3agene banks 3agene frequency 3agenetic markers 3agenetic relationships 3agenetic variation 3agermplasm 3aheterozygosity 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aseedlings 3awalnuts 3aHimalayan region 3aIndia 0aPCoA 0aPIC 0aRP 0aMI 0aUPGMA 0aSAHN 0aJuglans regia 0aSSR markers 0aMolecular characterization 0aStructure analysis 0aGenetic diversity1 aMir, J.I.1 aAhmed, N.1 aFazili, Khalid M.0 tJournal of the Saudi Society of Agricultural Sciences.g2018 Oct., v. 17, no. 4 p.339-350dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23282x1658-077X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jssas.2016.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245007200164300001600236520069200252592002800944650001500972650002200987650001501009773012701024856008301151852000901234655001201243IND60765236920220904000000.0220904e20110329xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076523692DNAL7 a10.17221/50/2010-agricecon2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVeselý, A.10aEconomic classification and regression problems and neural networks  ap. 150-157.  aArtificial neural networks provide powerful models for solving many economic classifications, as well as regression problems.

Some factors controlling population size, such as temperature and food, often have been studied; however, the importance of predators is poorly known. Aeolid nudibranchs feed on cnidarians, but their predation on the benthic polyps of scyphozoan rarely has been documented. To understand the potential of nudibranchs to consume polyps, we tested several predation preference hypotheses with the generalist feeding nudibranch, Hermissenda crassicornis, and polyps of the common moon jellyfish, Aurelia labiata. Of the six prey species tested during feeding experiments, A. labiata polyps and the tunicate Distaplia occidentalis were significantly preferred. Nudibranch size, diurnal cycle, and ingestive conditioning did not significantly influence prey choice. Nudibranchs showed significant positive chemotaxis toward living polyps, hydroids, and tunicates, but not to sea anemones. Nudibranch chemotaxis was significantly more positive to polar extract of A. labiata than of D. occidentalis. Consumption of polyps was correlated with nudibranch size, with mean consumption by large nudibranchs (>0.92 g) of about 31 polyps h−1. Three other nudibranch species also ate A. labiata polyps. Our results emphasize the potential importance of predation for controlling jellyfish benthic polyp populations and consequent jellyfish blooms.  aPublisher supplied data 3atemperature 3afoods 3afeeds 3apredators 3aScyphozoa 3apredation 3apopulation size 3achemotaxis 3aAnthozoa 0apolyps1 aArmour, Ruth1 aDow, Ian1 aPurcell, J.

Critical knowledge gaps related to Poweshiek skipperling adult behavior, phenology, habitat structure, and potential larval host plants are limiting the ability to manage this federally endangered species. To address these information needs, we conducted extensive surveys in the last remaining stronghold of four extant prairie fens in Michigan. We used point transect surveys to collect data on plant structure, and Poweshiek skipperling behavior and detection. We estimated Poweshiek skipperling abundance and modeled the influence of local vegetation on Poweshiek skipperling presence/absence. We estimated the abundance of adult Poweshiek skipperling in Michigan prairie fens to be 231 (95% CI 160–332), further highlighting the imperiled status of this species. Presence of Poweshiek skipperling along our transects was negatively associated with obstructive vegetation and positively associated with the availability of the nectar source Dasiphora fruticosa. Our observation data indicated females nectared most frequently on D. fruticosa, whereas males nectared most often on Rudbeckia hirta. Across the field season we observed 7 oviposition events on four plant species (Muhlenbergia richardsonis, Muhlenbergia glomerata, Carex sterilis, and D. fruticosa), three of which had no previous documentation as a possible host plant. Results from this study can be used to evaluate management decisions and inform both in situ and ex situ conservation efforts. It is critical to continue monitoring remaining populations, not only to assess conservation efforts, but also to discern the patterns and processes influencing species extinction.  aPublisher supplied data  aGreat Lakes Restoration InitiativecU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  aCollege of SciencecCentral Michigan University  aEngineering's Dean's Research AssistantshipcCentral Michigan University  aDBI-1730526cNational Science Foundation 3aCarex 3aDasiphora fruticosa 3aHesperiidae 3aMuhlenbergia richardsonis 3aRudbeckia hirta 3aadults 3aendangered species 3aex situ conservation 3aextinction 3afemales 3afens 3ahabitats 3ahost plants 3ainformation needs 3ainsect ecology 3alarvae 3alife history 3amales 3amonitoring 3anectar 3aoviposition 3aphenology 3aprairies 3asurveys 3aMichigan1 aMonfils, Michael J.1 aCuthrell, David L.1 aMonfils, Anna K.0 tJournal of insect conservation.g2019 June, v. 23, no. 3 p.635-649dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl3870062x1366-638X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10841-019-00158-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02797naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011500160300001800275500002000293520144700313592002801760650001001788650001601798650002001814650002001834650001201854650002001866650001101886650002001897650001401917650001001931650001501941650002101956650001001977700002101987700002102008700002102029700003602050700005802086773012002144856007802264852000902342655001202351IND60596966420221119203606.0180622e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059696642DNAL7 a10.1002/elps.2018000592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Wilson10aThread/paper‐ and paper‐based microfluidic devices for glucose assays employing artificial neural networks  ap. 1443-1451.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper describes the fabrication of and data collection from two microfluidic devices: a microfluidic thread/paper based analytical device (μTPAD) and 3D microfluidic paper‐based analytical device (μPAD). Flowing solutions of glucose oxidase (GOx), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and potassium iodide (KI), through each device, on contact with glucose, generated a calibration curve for each platform. The resultant yellow‐brown color from the reaction indicates oxidation of iodide to iodine. The devices were dried, scanned, and analyzed yielding a correlation between yellow intensity and glucose concentration. A similar procedure, using an unknown concentration of glucose in artificial urine, is conducted and compared to the calibration curve to obtain the unknown value. Studies to quantify glucose in artificial urine showed good correlation between the theoretical and actual concentrations, as percent differences were ≤13.0%. An ANN was trained on the four‐channel CMYK color data from 54 μTPAD and 160 μPAD analysis sites and Pearson correlation coefficients of R = 0.96491 and 0.9739, respectively, were obtained. The ANN was able to correctly classify 94.4% (51 of 54 samples) and 91.2% (146 of 160 samples) of the μTPAD and μPAD analysis sites, respectively. The development of this technology combined with ANN should further facilitate the use of these platforms for colorimetric analysis of other analytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3acolorimetry 3adata collection 3aelectrophoresis 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3aiodine 3aneural networks 3aoxidation 3apaper 3aperoxidase 3apotassium iodide 3aurine1 aGonzalez, Ariana1 aArguelles, Paolo1 aGuevara, Ricardo1 aGonzalez‐Guerrero, Maria Jose1 aGomez, Frank A.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0104-92660 tElectrophoresis.g2018 June, v. 39, no. 12 p.1443-1451dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3938548x0173-08357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.2018000593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02982naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100003200158245004600190300001400236520133900250592002801589650001301617650001401630650001601644650001301660650002201673650001201695650001301707650001401720650001201734650001401746650001001760650002801770650001701798650001301815650001001828650001001838650002601848650002201874650002301896650004401919650002201963650002101985650001102006650002202017650002402039650001602063650002102079650001402100650001002114650001002124650004102134700001502175773012902190856004002319852000902359655001202368IND50070548020221119230303.0131109e20140115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007054802DNAL7 a238814102pmid7 a10.1002/jsfa.63112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayuoni‐Kirshinbaum, Lina14aThe flavor of pomegranate fruit: a review  ap. 21-27.  aDespite the increasing commercial importance of pomegranate, especially because of its recently discovered health‐promoting benefits, relatively little is yet known regarding its sensory quality and flavor preferences, or about the biochemical constituents that determine its sensory characteristics. The perceived flavor of pomegranate fruit results from the combination of various taste, aroma and mouthfeel sensations. The taste is governed mainly by the presence of sugars (glucose and fructose) and organic acids (primarily citric and malic acids). The aroma evolves from the presence of dozens of volatiles, including alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and terpenes, which provide a mixture of various ‘green’, ‘woody’, ‘earthy’, ‘fruity’, ‘floral’, ‘sweet’ and ‘musty’ notes. In addition, the sensory satisfaction during the eating of pomegranate arils is complemented by various mouthfeel sensations, including seed hardness and astringency sensations. In the present review we will describe the sensory quality and flavor preferences of pomegranate fruit, including the genetic diversity in flavor characteristics among distinct varieties. In addition, we will describe the dynamic changes that occur in fruit flavor during fruit ripening and postharvest storage. © 2013 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aaldehydes 3aastringency 3afructose 3agenetic variation 3aglucose 3ahardness 3aingestion 3aketones 3amouthfeel 3aodors 3aorganic acids and salts 3apomegranates 3aripening 3aseeds 3ataste 2aCitric Acidxanalysis 2aFood Preservation 2aFructosexanalysis 2aFruitxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aGlucosexanalysis 2aHealth Promotion 2aHumans 2aMalatesxanalysis 2aOdorantsxanalysis. 2aLythraceae. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSensation 2aSmell 2aTaste 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxanalysis1 aPorat, Ron0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2014 Jan. 15, v. 94, no. 1 p.21-27dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0022-51427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.6311  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002400140245016600164300002000330520135900350592002801709650001901737650001601756650002101772650001201793650002001805650000901825650004301834650001901877650003301896650000701929650003701936650001301973650001601986700003502002700002102037773012302058856007402181852000902255655001202264IND60640517420221119132930.0190504e20160516xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051742DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04103e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarajzadeh, Mir Ali10aSimultaneous synthesis of a deep eutectic solvent and its application in liquid–liquid microextraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from aqueous samples  ap. 47990-47996.  aIn the present study, a new generation of solvents, named deep eutectic solvents, were simultaneously synthesized and used as an extraction solvent in a liquid–liquid microextraction method for the extraction and preconcentration of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from aqueous samples prior to their determination by high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. In this method, choline chloride and p-chlorophenol (at a 1 : 2 molar ratio) are added to an aqueous phase containing the target analytes and the mixture is shaken manually to obtain a homogeneous solution. After heating, choline chloride and p-chlorophenol form a deep eutectic solvent in whole parts of the solution and a cloudy state is obtained. The solution is centrifuged and the sedimented phase is injected into the separation system. Some important parameters such as deep eutectic solvent composition, ionic strength, pH and temperature of aqueous phase, and centrifuge rate and time were studied. Under the optimum conditions, enrichment factors and extraction recoveries were obtained in the 586–632 and 88–95% ranges, respectively. The linear ranges of calibration curves were wide and the limits of detection and quantification were between 0.19 and 0.92 and 0.61–3.0 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. This method is very simple, rapid and efficient.  aPublisher supplied data 3a4-chlorophenol 3acalibration 3achemical species 3acholine 3adetection limit 3aheat 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aionic strength 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3apH 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aAfshar Mogaddam, Mohammad Reza1 aFeriduni, Behruz0 tRSC advances.g2016 May 16, v. 6, no. 53 p.47990-47996dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra04103e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02230naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002600140245014100166300001800307520115300325592002801478650001401506650001201520650001801532650001201550650001301562650003101575650001001606650001401616700002101630700002001651700001801671773010801689856007401797852000901871655001201880IND60478985820221119194500.0160116e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047898582DNAL7 a10.1111/maec.122232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSal Moyano, María P.10aVariation in the post‐copulatory guarding behavior of Neohelice granulata (Brachyura, Grapsoidea, Varunidae) in two different habitats  ap. 1185-1194.  aCrab guarding behaviors are influenced by the biological and physical characteristics that each population experiences in a particular habitat. We studied post‐copulatory guarding behavior and the factors affecting it, such as the presence of burrows, female receptivity duration, operational sex ratio (OSR) and male size, in two different populations of Neohelice granulata: Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (MCL) and San Antonio Oeste (SAO). Laboratory experiments showed that post‐copulatory guarding duration varied between the study areas. In MCL, it depended upon the presence of burrows and female receptivity duration, whereas it was independent of the OSR and male size. In SAO, it was dependent upon the OSR and female receptivity duration, whereas it was independent of the presence of burrows and male size. Thus, N. granulata males display different reproductive strategies related to their post‐copulatory guarding behavior pattern in different habitats. These strategies are related to the fact that this species constructs and defends a burrow that provides shelter and a place to mate, something that other varunids do not have.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVarunidae 3aburrows 3acoastal water 3afemales 3ahabitats 3alaboratory experimentation 3amales 3asex ratio1 aGavio, María A.1 aMcLay, Colin L.1 aLuppi, Tomás0 tMarine ecology.g2015 Dec., v. 36, no. 4 p.1185-1194dPaul Parey Scientific Publishersx0173-95657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/maec.122233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02941naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006700151245016700218300001600385520134600401592002801747650001601775650001301791650001301804650001601817650001801833650001301851650001401864650001201878650001301890650001201903650001301915650001101928650001501939650000901954650001901963650001601982650000901998653001402007653002302021653002502044700003502069700002302104700003002127700002902157700002602186773011702212856008502329852000902414655001202423IND60606923520221120035825.0180730e20160515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060692352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.11.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorges, Wesley da Silva1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9606-075810aBio-oil production and removal of organic load by microalga Scenedesmus sp. using culture medium contaminated with different sugars, cheese whey and whey permeate  ap. 134-140.  aThe objective of this study was to evaluate the bio-oil production and the organic load removal using the microalga Scenedesmus sp. The cultivation was carried out in reactors with a total volume of 3 L and 0.7 vvm aeration, with illumination in photoperiods of 12 h light/12 h dark for 12 days. The following sugar concentrations were tested: 2.5, 5.0 and 10 g/L of glucose, lactose, fructose and galactose with 10% inoculum volume. After experiments were performed with cheese whey in natura and cheese whey permeate with different lactose concentrations (1.5, 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 g/L). In these experiments the inoculum concentrations were 10, 15, 20 and 30% (v/v). The results showed that this microalga was effective for the production of lipids when it was cultivated in medium with cheese whey in natura with 2.5 g/L of lactose and 20% inoculum (v/v). Using cheese whey in natura at the concentration of 3.5 g/L of lactose and 30% (v/v) of inoculum obtained 77.9% of TOC removal and 38.447 mg of TOC removed/mg oil produced. It was also observed that when there is increased production of bio-oil, there is less removal of organic matter. The addition of glucose, fructose or galactose in the medium did not enhance the production of bio-oil by Scenedesmus sp. when compared to lactose, but increased the organic matter removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScenedesmus 3aaeration 3abiofuels 3acheese whey 3aculture media 3afructose 3agalactose 3aglucose 3ainoculum 3alactose 3alighting 3alipids 3amicroalgae 3aoils 3aorganic matter 3aphotoperiod 3awhey 0aMicroalga 0aBio-oil production 0aOrganic load removal1 aAraújo, Breno Severiano Alves1 aMoura, Lucas Gomes1 aCoutinho Filho, Ubirajara1 ade Resende, Miriam Maria1 aCardoso, Vicelma Luiz0 tJournal of environmental management.g2016 May 15, v. 173 p.134-140dElsevier LtdwJournal:2018x0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.11.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02667naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245009900165300002000264520124200284592002801526650001501554650001401569650001001583650001801593650001901611650001801630650001101648650002001659650001201679653002501691653001801716653001801734653002001752653001901772700001701791700001901808700002401827700001901851700002601870700003201896700002101928700002101949773012601970856008002096852000902176655001202185IND60555359020170706000000.0161027e20161026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055535902DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b066862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinto, Tânia V.10aScreen-Printed Photochromic Textiles through New Inks Based on SiO2@naphthopyran Nanoparticles  ap. 28935-28945.  aPhotochromic silica nanoparticles (SiO₂@NPT), fabricated through the covalent immobilization of silylated naphthopyrans (NPTs) based on 2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran (S1, S2) and 3H-naphtho[2,1-b]pyran (S3, S4) or through the direct adsorption of the parent naphthopyrans (1, 3) onto silica nanoparticles (SiO₂ NPs), were successfully incorporated onto cotton fabrics by a screen-printing process.

However, safety problems such as overcharge may be a key hindrance for their wide-spread applications. In this study, an aromatic compound (biphenyl) is investigated as an overcharge protection additive for sodium batteries. It is found that BP can be electro-polymerized at 4.3 V (vs. Na/Na⁺), which protects the Na₀.₄₄MnO₂/Na batteries from voltage runaway for more than 800% overcharge capacity by consuming the overcharge current. The influence of proper BP addition on the cycling performance and capacity is negligible. Thus, BP can be used as an overcharge additive for sodium batteries. The results may also be helpful for the further research of safer sodium battery systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiphenyl 3aelectric potential difference 3alithium batteries 3asodium1 aCi, Lijie1 aXiong, Shenglin0 tRSC advances.g2015 Nov. 11, v. 5, no. 117 p.96649-96652dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra19988c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245009300171300001600264520160300280592002801883650001801911650001101929650002101940650002001961650001301981650001501994650001202009650002802021650002302049650001502072650002202087650001302109650002102122651001602143700002002159700002302179773010702202856008102309852000902390655001202399IND60550208520221118012407.0160909e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055020852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00035-016-0166-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchumann, Katharina10aFactors affecting primary succession of glacier foreland vegetation in the European Alps  ap. 105-117.  aVegetation succession on glacier forelands has been well-studied. However, most of the studies investigated only one or few glacier forelands. We studied regional variations in vegetation succession on 16 glacier forelands in the European Alps. To improve our understanding of how vegetation succession is regulated by environmental conditions, we took edaphic and climatic factors into account. We collected vegetation data in three stages (early; middle; late) along a successional gradient on glacier forelands in the Eastern and Western European Alps. The progressions of species richness, vegetation cover and composition during primary succession were compared between these two regions. In addition, the effects of climatic and edaphic factors and grazing were tested. Our results reveal that the vegetation from the early stage did not differ between the regions and different elevations. With progressing time, and especially in the late successional stage, several vegetation differences emerged. The forelands of the Western Alps already developed to open shrubland, while the forelands of the Eastern Alps so far only developed toward grassland. Surprisingly, these differences cannot be explained by different precipitation amounts, but possibly by different regional species pools and elevations of the treelines. We conclude that a complex of edaphic factors closely related to terrain age, regional differences in the species pool, and the different elevation of the treeline in the eastern and western Alps mostly influenced later stages of primary succession on glacier forelands.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpine plants 3abotany 3aclimatic factors 3aedaphic factors 3aglaciers 3agrasslands 3agrazing 3ainterspecific variation 3aprimary succession 3ashrublands 3aspecies diversity 3atreeline 3avegetation cover 3aAlps region1 aGewolf, Susanne1 aTackenberg, Oliver0 tAlpine botany.g2016 Oct., v. 126, no. 2 p.105-117dSpringer International Publishingx1664-22017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00035-016-0166-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03726naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002100144245018800165520198400353592002802337650001302365650002202378650003002400650002502430650002302455650002602478650001802504650001002522650001802532650001602550650001102566650002102577650001902598650001802617650002002635650001302655650001502668650001702683700001902700700002202719700002502741700002302766700002902789700002602818700002202844700002402866700002402890700002002914700002902934773012102963856007903084852000903163655001203172IND60781066320221120221450.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106632DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRebouh, Nazih Y.10aEnvironmentally Friendly Wheat Farming: Biological and Economic Efficiency of Three Treatments to Control Fungal Diseases in Winter Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under Field Conditions  aThe control of wheat diseases using bioagents is not well studied under field conditions. The present study was aimed at investigating, during four consecutive growing seasons (2017–2020), the efficacy of two integrated crop protection (ICP) systems to control the common wheat diseases for enhancing the productivity and profitability of winter wheat crops and ensuring nutritional and food security. Two environmental-friendly treatments were tested, biological (T1), which contained bioagents and fertilizers, and combined (T2), which included fertilizers and bioagents coupled with lower doses of fungicides. The chemical treatment (T3) was used for comparison with (T1) and (T2). Furthermore, two Russian winter wheat varieties (Nemchinovskaya 17 (V1) and Moscovskaya 40 (V2)) were studied. A randomized complete block design was used with four replicates. Diseases infestation rates for snow mold (SM), root rot (RR), powdery mildew (PM), and Fusarium (Fus), yield performances, and grain quality (measured through protein content) were determined according to the tested treatments, and the economic efficiency was calculated for each treatment. The combined treatment (T2) was the most effective against fungal diseases with 1.8% (SM), 1.2% (RR), 0.9% (PM), and 0.9% (Fus). The highest grain yield (6.8 t·ha⁻¹), protein content (15.2%), and 1000-grain weight (43.7%) were observed for winter wheat variety Moscovskaya 40 with the combined treatment (T2). The highest number of productive stems (N.P.S) (556 stems/m²) was attained for combined treatment (T2), followed by biological treatment (T1) (552 stems/m²) with the variety Nemchinovskaya 17. The profitability (cost–benefit ratio) of the combined treatment (T2) was 2.38 with the Moscovskaya 40 variety (V2), while 2.03 was recorded for the biological treatment. Applying environmentally friendly combined and biological treatments resulted in high wheat yield and net income, as well as healthy products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aTriticum aestivum 3abiological control agents 3abiological treatment 3achemical treatment 3acost benefit analysis 3afood security 3afungi 3agrain quality 3agrain yield 3aincome 3aplant protection 3apowdery mildew 3aprofitability 3aprotein content 3aroot rot 3asnow molds 3awinter wheat1 aAliat, Toufik 1 aPolityko, Petr M.1 aKherchouche, Dalila 1 aBoulelouah, Nadia 1 aTemirbekova, Sulukhan K.1 aAfanasyeva, Yuliya V.1 aKucher, Dmitry E.1 aPlushikov, Vadim G.1 aParakhina, Elena A.1 aLatati, Mourad 1 aGadzhikurbanov, Anvar S.0 tPlants.g2022 June 14, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245009300169300001600262520114500278592002801423650002101451650001501472650002201487650001501509650001801524650001601542650001201558650002401570650001101594650001101605650001101616653003101627653003801658653002401696653003101720653001601751700005601767700002001823773009801843856008701941852000902028655001202037IND60593087120221123032945.0200614e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059308712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShan, Nannan10aStudy on performance of a novel energy-efficient heat pump system using liquid desiccant  ap. 325-337.  aIn this paper, a novel heat pump system is proposed, which operates as a heat-source-tower heat pump with no frosting in winter, and as a hybrid refrigerant system consisting of a conventional chiller combined with a liquid desiccant dehumidification and evaporative cooling subsystem in summer. A validated mathematical model of the proposed system operating in summer is established to investigate the effects of key parameters, including solution to refrigerant flow ratio (FR), condensation heat recovery ratio (Rcₒₙd) and ambient parameters, on the cooling performance. Besides, this paper analyzes key factors that should be considered in designing the heat exchange area of the solution-cooled condenser (SCC). The results show that the maximum COP and ECOP of the heat pump system are 13.4% and 10.3% higher than those of conventional vapor compression refrigerant systems under the typical summer condition of Nanjing, respectively. The recommended range of FR is from 1.2 to 6 and that for Rcₒₙd is from 16% to 40%. Moreover, the proposed system is more superior to conventional ones when applied in hot and humid regions.  aPublisher supplied data 3adehumidification 3adesiccants 3aenergy efficiency 3aheat pumps 3aheat recovery 3ahumid zones 3aliquids 3amathematical models 3asummer 3avapors 3awinter 0aEnergy-efficient heat pump 0aLiquid desiccant dehumidification 0aEvaporative cooling 0aCondensation heat recovery 0aSub-cooling1 aYin, Yonggao1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1556-85741 aZhang, Xiaosong0 tApplied energy.g2018 June 01, v. 219 p.325-337dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.03.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100002100161245007600182300001600258500000900274520202000283592002802303650002002331650002202351650001902373650001602392650001602408650001902424700002102443773012102464852000902585856009802594655001202692IND8602689020221119164934.0191122e198511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860268902DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1985.0011183X002500060014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerik, Thomas J.10aTemperature Effects on Dark Respiration Among Diverse Sorghum Genotypes  ap. 957-961.  aepub  aDark respiration is a key physiological process of plant growth and maintenance, but information is limited regarding its genetic variability in grain sorghum. The objectives of this study were i) to determine the range of variability for genetically diverse grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) moench] lines and hybrids over a range of temperatures, and ii) to characterize the relationship between dark respiration of a plant during vegetative development and a panicle during grain filling. Dark respiration rates of shoots were determined under controlled conditions at temperatures ranging from 13 to 40°C. At 23°C, the mean rate of dark respiration was 27 μmol CO₂ kg⁻¹ s⁻¹ with a range of 32 μmol CO₂ kg⁻¹ s⁻¹. Plant growth at near optimum temperatures (30/25°C; day/night) was correlated with dark respiration rates (measured at 29°C) when the rates were expressed on a per shoot basis, but not when expressed on a dry weight basis. Genotypes differed in their sensitivity to temperature. for the genotypes studied, the linear regression coefficients of dark respiration on temperature ranged from 1.1 to 2.5 μmol CO₂ kg⁻¹ s⁻¹ °C⁻¹ over the 13 to 40°C range. Within the limits of this experiment, there appears to be sufficient variability to select high and low respiring grain sorghum genotypes and to distinguish those which possess high or low sensitivity to temperature. Panicle dark respiration rates were 50% lower than those of the vegetative portion of the plant. Both panicle and vegetative shoot dark respiration responded in a linear manner to temperature from 13 to 40°C. The panicle dark respiration increased at a rate of 0.75 μmol CO₂ kg⁻¹ s⁻¹ °C⁻¹ compared with 1.5 for the vegetative shoot indicating that panicle dark respiration was less sensitive to temperature than was shoot dark respiration. This may be related to the linear nature of dry matter accumulation in grain sorghum panicles grown under divergent temperature environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3agenetic variation 3ainflorescences 3atransposons 3atemperature 3afilling period1 aEastin, Jerry D.0 tCrop science.g1985 Nov., v. 25, no. 6 p.957-961dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci1985.0011183X002500060014x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02667naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001800161245013800179300001300317500000900330500001500339520155000354592002801904650001801932650002601950650002101976650002001997650002502017653002402042700001602066700002202082773011802104852000902222856009802231655001202329IND8604369220221118123434.0191122e198601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND860436922DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1986.0011183X002600010003x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFlores, C.

Estimates were obtained from random S₁ families from each population in a replications-in-blocks design. The means of the two populations did not differ statistically for any agronomic or nutritional trait and had similar estimates of genetic variances that revealed large genetic variation for agronomic traits but relatively little for nutritional traits. Mostraits had significant genotype ✕ year interaction variances. Broad-sense heritabilities for all traits were relatively high (0.44 to 0.92), had low standard errors (0.10 to 0.12), and were similar in both populations. Predicted gains from 20% selection intensity were 18.2 and 15.9% of the population means for grain yield in NP20BRME and NP20BR-MEYD, respectively. Expected gains for ME were small, and sometimes negative, whether selection was for yield, ME, or MEYD. Directional selection for grain yield alone or for ME alone would not be expected to result in simultaneous improvement of grain yield and ME, but selection for high MEYD should result in yield improvement equivalent to selection for grain yield alone with similar reductions in most nutritional traits negatively correlated with grain yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3arandom mating 3aquantitative genetics 3aagronomic traits 3aSorghum bicolor 3ametabolizable energy 0apopulation genetics1 aRoss, W.

The fuel contents remained in the anode tail gas from the SOFC is reutilized in the engine to improve the system electrical efficiency. Our previous research has confirmed the electrical efficiency of the SOFC-engine hybrid system can be enhanced by about 7.8% compared to the SOFC stand-alone system. Although the hybrid system has higher electrical efficiency than the stand-alone system, higher elaboration for the system operation should be necessary due to higher degree of system complication. The objective of the present study is to develop the dynamic modeling of the SOFC-engine hybrid system. The component dynamic modeling of SOFC, engine, external reformer, air blower, and heat exchanger are developed and integrated into a system using Matlab-Simulink®. Component models of SOFC, external reformer, and engine have been verified by comparison with the experimental data. The dynamic behavior of the hybrid system during transients is investigated. Since the time scale for the engine operation is much shorter than that of the SOFC stack, the power generated by the engine is mainly dependent on the characteristics variation of the anode tail gas. Consequently, the overshoot behavior is appeared in the engine power generation during increase of the demand SOFC power. This model is useful to develop the optimal control strategy for the SOFC-engine hybrid system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanodes 3adynamic models 3afuel cells 3afuels 3aheat exchangers 3apower generation 0aHybrid system 0aSolid oxide fuel cell 0aDynamic modeling 0aEngine 0aOptimal control strategy1 aAhn, Kook-Young0 tApplied energy.g2017 June 01, v. 195 p.1086-1099dElsevier LtdwJournal:11876x0306-26197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2017.03.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01951naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245007400169300001400243520082000257592002801077653000701105653000701112653000801119653000801127653000801135653000801143653000801151653002701159653002601186653002201212653002501234653002701259653001501286653003001301653002401331700002001355773007401375856008301449852000901532655001201541IND60555324520221121173440.0161026e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055532452DNAL7 a10.1016/j.softx.2015.10.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerin, Greg R.10aMapping phylogenetic endemism in R using georeferenced branch extents  ap. 22-26.  aApplications are needed to map biodiversity from large-scale species occurrence datasets whilst seamlessly integrating with existing functions in R. Phylogenetic endemism (PE) is a biodiversity measure based on range-restricted phylogenetic diversity (PD). Current implementations use area of occupancy (AOO) or frequency to estimate the spatial range of branch-length (i.e. phylogenetic range-rarity), rather than extent of occurrence (EOO; i.e. georeferenced phylogenetic endemism), which is known to produce different range estimates. We present R functions to map PD or PE weighted by AOO or EOO (new georeferenced implementation), taking as inputs georeferenced species occurrences and a phylogeny. Non-parametric statistics distinguish PD/PE from trivial correlates of species richness and sampling intensity.  aPublisher supplied data 0aPE 0aPD 0aAOO 0aEOO 0aSIR 0aPRR 0aGPE 0aPhylogenetic diversity 0aPhylogenetic endemism 0aArea of occupancy 0aExtent of occurrence 0aMinimum convex polygon 0aR function 0aNon-parametric statistics 0aInterquartile range1 aLowe, Andrew J.0 tSoftwareX.g2015 Dec., v. 3-4 p.22-26dElsevier B.V.x2352-71107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2015.10.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024002800135040001800163100002100181245007000202300001800272506007600290520198600366592002802352506003702380650002202417650002002439650002602459650001302485650001402498650001002512650001402522650001202536650001102548650001202559650001402571650001302585650003302598650001602631650002502647650005202672650005702724650002302781653002202804653002002826653002602846653002302872653001802895653001602913653001902929653001702948653002202965773010202987856007403089852000903163655001203172IND60115131920221207084235.0150202e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011513192DNAL7 a232356982pmid7 aPMC38289402pmcid7 a10.1093/aob/mcs2582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrenner, Gerhard10aPapilionoid inflorescences revisited (Leguminosae-Papilionoideae)  ap. 1567-1576.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground and Aims The inflorescence structure determines the spatiotemporal arrangement of the flowers during anthesis and is therefore vital for reproductive success. The Leguminosae are among the largest angiosperm plant families and they include some important crop plants. In papilionoid legumes, the raceme is the most common type of inflorescence. However, a range of other inflorescence types have evolved via various developmental processes. A (re-)investigation of inflorescences in Swainsona formosa , Cicer arietinum , Abrus precatorius , Hardenbergia violacea and Kennedia nigricans leads to new insights into reduction mechanisms and to a new hypothesis on the evolution of the papilionoid pseudoraceme. Methods Inflorescence morphology and ontogeny were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Key Results The inflorescence in S. formosa is an umbel with a rare type of pendulum symmetry which may be triggered by the subtending leaf. Inflorescences in C. arietinum are reduced to a single flower. An early formed adaxial bulge is the sterile apex of the inflorescence (i.e. the inflorescence is open and not terminated by a flower). In partial inflorescences of A. precatorius , the axis is reduced and its meristem is relocated towards the main inflorescence. Flower initiation follows a peculiar pendulum pattern. Partial inflorescences in H. violacea and in K. nigricans show reduction tendencies. In both taxa, initiated but early reduced bracteoles are present. Conclusions Pendulum symmetry in S. formosa is probably associated with distichous phyllotaxis. In C. arietinum , strong reduction tendencies are revealed. Based on studies of A. precatorius , the papilionoid pseudoraceme is reinterpreted as a compound raceme with condensed lateral axes. From an Abrus -like inflorescence, other types can be derived via reduction of flower number and synchronization of flower development. A plea is made for uniform usage of inflorescence terminology.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAbrus precatorius 3aCicer arietinum 3aHardenbergia violacea 3aKennedia 3aSwainsona 3acrops 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aleaves 3alegumes 3ameristems 3aontogeny 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aterminology 2aBiological Evolution 2aFabaceaexgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aInflorescencexgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 2aModels, Biological 0aAbrus precatorius 0aCicer arietinum 0aHardenbergia violacea 0aKennedia nigricans 0ainflorescence 0aLeguminosae 0aPapilionoideae 0apseudoraceme 0aSwainsona formosa0 tAnnals of botany.g2013 Nov., v. 112, no. 8 p.1567-1576dOxford University Pressx0305-73647nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs2583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02879naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002400154245010800178300001600286500002000302520167200322592002801994650002502022650002902047650001502076650001502091650001502106650001602121650001802137650002302155650001702178650001302195650001402208650001402222651001002236700002102246773011702267856008802384852000902472655001202481IND60596396220221121113702.0180619e200310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059639622DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00813.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChristie, Duncan A.10aRegeneration microsites and tree species coexistence in temperate rain forests of Chiloé Island, Chile  ap. 776-784.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  a1 We studied the importance of fallen logs as recruitment sites for tree species, their role in species coexistence, and also the influence of canopy openness and litter depth on tree species establishment in mid‐successional and old‐growth temperate rain forests of Chiloé Island, southern Chile. 2 Old‐growth (OG) stands showed significantly more fallen logs than mid‐successional (MS) stands. Concomitantly, the proportion of seedlings and saplings established on logs was significantly greater in OG than MS stands. 3 Of 13 tree species found at our study sites, eight showed a significant bias towards establishment on logs, especially those in advanced stages of decomposition. 4 In some stands, all seedlings of Eucryphia cordifolia, Laureliopsis philippiana, Nothofagus nitida, Tepualia stipularis and Weinmannia trichosperma occurred on decaying logs, whereas all Podocarpus nubigena seedlings were found on undisturbed soil sites. 5 Small‐seeded species were more common on logs, whereas large‐seeded trees occurred on soil. 6 On soil, litter depth negatively affected local abundance of log‐dependent seedlings, suggesting that variation in litter accumulation influences species distributions across the forest floor mosaic. 7 The density of shade‐intolerant seedlings was more enhanced by the presence of fallen logs under closed canopy than by the occurrence of canopy gaps over soil sites. 8 Seed size plays an important role in successful establishment of species across the mosaic of fallen logs and different litter depth on the forest floor. We suggest that this mosaic of microsites is an important factor for species coexistence.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucryphia cordifolia 3aLaureliopsis philippiana 3aNothofagus 3aPodocarpus 3aWeinmannia 3acanopy gaps 3aforest litter 3aold-growth forests 3arain forests 3asaplings 3aseed size 3aseedlings 3aChile1 aArmesto, Juan J.0 tjournal of ecology.g2003 Oct., v. 91, no. 5 p.776-784dBlackwell Science LtdwJournal:jnl44660x0022-04777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.2003.00813.x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02735naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010400168300001800272520162200290592002801912650001501940650001301955650001201968650001301980650001701993650001502010650000902025650001902034650001302053650001702066650001502083700001802098700001602116700001502132773010402147856008902251852000902340655001202349IND60534270420221118140328.0160802e20150820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053427042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.5b001492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aMechanism Study of the Cross-Linking Reaction of Hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide/Ac3Cr in Formation Water  ap. 4701-4710.  aThe mechanism of the cross-linking reaction between hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) and chromium acetate in formation water was systematically studied by viscometry, ultraviolet-visual absorption spectrometry, and core flow experiments. The results show that the process and outcome of the cross-linking reaction between HPAM and chromium acetate is significantly affected by salinity. In formation water, chromium acetate cannot cross-link HPAM when the salinity is too low. With an increase of salinity, the cross-linking reaction occurs, and the degree of the reaction increases to a balance point. When the cross-linking reaction occurs, two different types of the reaction appear under different salinity. The intramolecular cross-linking reaction is the first to happen, whether under high salinity or under low salinity. In this stage, the cross-linking reaction is a first-order reaction and plays a greater role in the whole process of the reaction due to its higher reaction rate and higher reaction degree. Next, the intramolecular cross-linking continues to occur if the formation water is in the low salinity range, but the intermolecular cross-linking reaction occurs if the formation water is in the high salinity range. In this stage, the cross-linking reaction is a multistage reaction. Meanwhile, the experiments quantify a matching relationship between cations in the formation water and the profile control and oil displacement agent. The experimental results in this paper can provide theoretical guidance for the practical application of profile control and oil displacement using HPAM/Ac₃Cr.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aacetates 3acations 3achromium 3acrosslinking 3ahydrolysis 3aoils 3apolyacrylamide 3asalinity 3aspectroscopy 3aviscometry1 aPu, Chunsheng1 aSang, Haibo1 aZhao, Qing0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2015 Aug. 20, v. 29, no. 8 p.4701-4710dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.5b001493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245010700157300002000264520083000284592002801114650002001142650001201162650002301174650002101197650001201218650001401230650002101244700001901265700002001284773012401304856007401428852000901502655001201511IND60640518020221119171952.0190504e20160412xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064051802DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra04125f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHarinath, A.10aAlkali metal catalyzed dehydro-coupling of boranes and amines leading to the formation of a B–N bond  ap. 35648-35653.  aIn this report we describe catalytic B–N bond formation via cross-dehydrocoupling (CDC) of boranes with amines to construct aminoboranes with a high degree conversion (>90%) and chemo-selectivity using alkali metal hexamethyldisilazides [MN(SiMe₃)₂] (M = Li, and K) as pre-catalysts.

The genetically engineered EcN-IL has laid a foundation for degrading SDZ in broilers and their manure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aadsorption 3abiocatalysts 3adietary supplements 3adysbiosis 3aecosystems 3aenzyme activity 3afeces 3afungi 3aintestinal microorganisms 3alaccase 3apH 3apoultry manure 3asulfadiazine 3atemperature 3aurine 0aFungal laccase 0aGut microbiota 0aSulfonamide antibiotics 0aDegradation 0aEscherichia coli Nissle 19171 aZhou, Tuoyu1 aKhan, Aman1 aLing, Zhenmin1 aSharma, Monika1 aFeng, Pengya1 aGohar, Ali,1 aSaif, Irfan1 aWang, Haoyang1 aLi, Xiangkai1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2931-75651 aLiu, Pu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9777-62240 tJournal of hazardous materials.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 406 p.124440-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6200x0304-38947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2020.1244403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03181naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245010900209300001200318506007600330520175900406592002802165506003702193650000902230650002602239650001902265650000902284650002102293650001402314650001302328650001802341650002202359650001602381650001502397650001202412650001502424700002102439700002102460700001502481700002302496773010202519856008102621852000902702655001202711IND60550209120221207101409.0161031e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055020912DNAL7 a10.1007/s00227-016-2977-92doi7 aPMC50149062pmcid7 a276560032pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBergström, Lena10aDistribution of mesopredatory fish determined by habitat variables in a predator-depleted coastal system  ap. 201.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aShallow nearshore habitats are highly valued for supporting marine ecosystems, but are subject to intense human-induced pressures. Mesopredatory fish are key components in coastal food webs, and alterations in their abundance may have evident effects also on other parts of the ecosystem. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the abundance of coastal mesopredatory fish, defined as mid-trophic level demersal and benthic species with a diet consisting predominantly of invertebrates, and ambient environmental variables in a fjord system influenced by both eutrophication and overfishing. A field survey was conducted over a coastal gradient comprising 300 data points sampled consistently for fish community and environmental data. Results from multivariate and univariate analyses supported each other, demonstrating that mesopredatory fish abundance at species and functional group level was positively related to the cover of structurally complex vegetation and negatively related to eutrophication, as measured by water transparency. Contrary to other studies showing an inverse relationship to piscivore abundance over time, the spatial distribution of mesopredatory fish was not locally regulated by the abundance of piscivorous fish, probably attributed to piscivores being at historically low levels due to previous overfishing. Mesopredatory fish abundance was highest in areas with high habitat quality and positively related to the abundance of piscivores, suggesting a predominance of bottom-up processes. We conclude that, in parallel with ongoing regulations of fishing pressure, measures to restore habitat function and food web productivity are important for the recovery of coastal fish communities in the area.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aeutrophication 3afish 3afish communities 3afood webs 3ahabitats 3ainvertebrates 3amarine ecosystems 3aoverfishing 3apiscivores 3asurveys 3avegetation1 aKarlsson, Martin1 aBergström, Ulf,1 aPihl, Leif1 aKraufvelin, Patrik0 tMarine biology.g2016 Oct., v. 163, no. 10 p.201-201dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0025-31627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00227-016-2977-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03078naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001300143245010000156300001800256500000900274520150700283592002801790650002001818650001401838650001801852650001001870650001701880650001001897650001101907650002401918650002201942650001101964650001501975650002201990650001202012650001602024650001602040650002102056650001302077650002802090650000702118650001502125700001802140700001802158700001602176700001802192700001502210700001602225700001402241700001402255700001702269773012502286852000902411856008002420655001202500IND4440179020221118011359.0191226e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444017902DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2010.00222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Rui10aEffects of Saline and Alkaline Stress on Germination, Seedling Growth, and Ion Balance in Wheat  ap. 1252-1260.  aepub  aWe tested wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings under five different saline and alkaline stress (9:1 molar ratio of NaCl/Na₂SO₄ and 9:1 molar ratio of NaHCO₃/Na₂CO₃, respectively) regimes of differing severity for 7 d, comparing growth, germination, and ionic balance of wheat seedlings, to elucidate the mechanism of alkaline stress (high pH) damage to wheat, and it physiological adaptive mechanism to alkaline stress. We found that alkalinity had a more severe effect on wheat seedlings than salinity, preventing germination before and after recovery, and severely inhibiting shoot and root growth. Plants responded to both saline and alkaline stress by accumulating Na⁺ at the expense of K⁺, and by accumulating soluble osmolytes, but these effects were more pronounced under alkaline stress than saline stress. Alkaline stress also induced several specific responses such as the inhibition of fructan synthesis (fructan levels increased in response to salinity), the accumulation of organic acids, the accumulation of Ca²⁺ and the depletion of H₂PO₄ ⁻ The results suggest that specific damage caused by alkaline stress might reflect a massive influx of Na⁺, resulting in a severe deficit of negative charge. The plants respond by trying to restore the osmotic balance and synthesizing organic acids as counter-ions to address the intracellular ion imbalance. These data provide important leads in the development of engineered wheat plants with improved stress tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3aion transport 3awheat 3aplant damage 3aroots 3ashoots 3amechanism of action 3aTriticum aestivum 3asodium 3aphosphates 3auptake mechanisms 3acalcium 3aroot growth 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3asalinity 3aorganic acids and salts 3apH 3aalkalinity1 aShi, LianXuan1 aDing, Xuemei,1 aHu, Yongjun1 aTian, ShangYi1 aYan, Defu,1 aShao, Shuai1 aGao, Yuan1 aLiu, Rong1 aYang, YunFei0 tAgronomy journal.g2010 July, v. 102, no. 4 p.1252-1260dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2010.00223Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02640naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245012100163520131400284592002801598650001901626650001701645650001601662650001701678650001401695650001801709650003101727650001601758650001501774650000901789650001801798650002001816650001401836650001801850650002001868650001001888700001601898700001401914700001501928700001501943700001501958773012101973856007902094852000902173655001202182IND60781066820221120202921.0220623e20220614xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078106682DNAL7 a10.3390/plants111215702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Fangzhou 10aInsights into the Regulation of Rice Seed Storability by Seed Tissue-Specific Transcriptomic and Metabolic Profiling  aNon-dormant seeds are continuously aging and deteriorating during storage, leading to declining seed vigor, which is a challenge for the rice seed industry. Improving the storability of seeds is of great significance to ensure the quality of rice and national food security. Through a set of chromosome segment substitution lines population constructed using japonica rice NIP as donor parent and indica rice ZS97 as recurrent parent, we performed seed storability QTL analysis and selected four non-storable NILs to further investigate the storability regulatory mechanisms underlying it. The seeds were divided into four tissues, which were the embryo, endosperm, aleurone layer, and hull, and tissue-specific transcriptome and metabolome analyses were performed on them. By exploring the common differentially expressed genes and differentially accumulated metabolites, as well as the KEGG pathway of the four non-storable NILs, we revealed that the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway and diterpenoid biosynthesis pathway played a central role in regulating seed storability. Integrated analysis pinpointed 12 candidate genes that may take part in seed storability. The comprehensive analysis disclosed the divergent and synergistic effect of different seed tissues in the regulation of rice storability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaleurone layer 3abiosynthesis 3achromosomes 3aditerpenoids 3aendosperm 3afood security 3agene expression regulation 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3arice 3aseed industry 3astorage quality 3asynergism 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3avigor1 aLi, Nannan 1 aYu, Yuye 1 aChen, Wei 1 aYu, Sibin 1 aHe, Hanzi 0 tPlants.g2022 June 14, v. 11, no. 12dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111215703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02726naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001300141245017200154300001600326500001900342520140500361592002801766650002101794650001601815650002401831650003701855650001601892650001001908650002301918650001001941650002001951650001301971650001301984653001301997653002302010653002502033700001802058700001402076773013002090856007502220852000902295655001202304IND60727178720221121065608.0210209e20190901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072717872DNAL7 a10.3382/japr/pfz0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, J.10aEffects of Extra-Dosing Phytase in Combination with Multi-Carbohydrase on Growth Performance and Bone Mineralization Using Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry in Broilers  ap. 722-728.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effect of the combination of extra-dosing phytase and multi-carbohydrase (MC) on growth performance and bone mineralization in broilers. A total of 640 one-day-old Cobb male broilers were randomly allocated to 8 dietary treatments (4 replicates with 20 birds each) consisting of positive control (PC); negative control (NC; −0.15% Ca and non-phytate-P (nPP)); NC with phytase (500, 1000, and 1500 FTU/kg) with or without MC (500 mg/kg). Feed intake, BW, and FCR were measured at days 7, 21, and 35. At day 35, 3 birds per pen were euthanized to measure body composition using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and right femurs were collected for bone ash. Supplementation of 1000 and 1500 FTU/kg of phytase improved BWG (P < 0.05) from days 0 to 7 compared to NC. There were no differences in BWG, FI and FCR during periods 0–21 d and 0–35 days respectively. NC birds had reduced (P < 0.05) body mineral density, body mineral content, femur ash weight, femur ash percentage, and femur ash concentration compared to PC while phytase at 1,000 or 1,500 FTU/kg, and phytase plus MC restored these metrics to the same levels as PC birds. The results indicate that bone mineralization parameters are more sensitive to evaluate the P sufficiency, and extra-dosing phytase or combined phytase with MC could improve phytate-P release and bone health in broiler chickens.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody composition 3abone health 3abone mineralization 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afeed intake 3afemur 3agrowth performance 3amales 3amineral content 3aphytases 3aresearch 0abroilers 0amulti-carbohydrase 0aextra-dosing phytase1 aPatterson, R.1 aKim, W.K.0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 28, no. 3 p.722-728dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfz0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02307naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002300141245010100164300001600265500001900281520132600300592002801626650001801654650001201672650001101684650001501695650001801710650001301728650001701741650001001758773012901768856007501897852000901972655001201981IND60727187120221121222712.0210209e20160601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072718712DNAL7 a10.3382/japr/pfv0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWideman, Robert F.10aConfirming the promise to prevent physiological disorders of organs: urolithiasis in laying hens  ap. 292-304.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSeveral problems caused by organ system disorders, such as urolithiasis (kidney stone formation) in laying hens, occur sporadically in poultry flocks and are likely to remain unresolved unless the scientific method is rigorously applied to develop and validate a research model for inducing similar pathology in experimental flocks. Successful research models confirm key triggering mechanisms and stressors, reveal innate organ system limitations or susceptibilities, and provide a reliable test bed for evaluating practical prophylactic and therapeutic strategies. Researchers have a professional responsibility to confirm their research model's limitations and relevance before making recommendations to poultry producers. Our experiments confirmed that feeding diets containing high Ca with low available phosphorus (HCLP) to experimental groups of immature pullets consistently triggered the pathognomonic symptoms associated with field outbreaks of urolithiasis. The HCLP research model also demonstrated that affected hens would survive and remain in production when their dietary cation:anion balance was adjusted to acidify the urine and thereby solubilize the kidney stones. Urinary acidification was rapidly adopted as the method of choice for treating commercial flocks experiencing outbreaks of urolithiasis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidification 3akidneys 3amodels 3aphosphorus 3arenal calculi 3aresearch 3atherapeutics 3aurine0 tJournal of applied poultry research.g2016 June 01, v. 25, no. 2 p.292-304dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48935x1056-61717nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3382/japr/pfv0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01874naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002400143245017800167300001800345520076200363592002801125650002301153650002301176650002201199653002201221653002901243653001001272700001901282700002101301773015201322856007701474852000901551655001201560IND60522041120221123013801.0160601e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052204112DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1995-09222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHausen, Hans-Dieter10aNotizen: Zur Struktur des Diazadimethylstannetidinderivats [(CH3)2Sn(NC(CH3)3)2GaCH3]2/ The Structure of the Diazadimethylstannetidine Derivative [(CH3)2Sn(NC(CH3)3)2GaCH3]2  ap. 1419-1423.  aThe title compound Me₂Sn(NᵗBu)₂GaMe (Me = CH₃, ᵗBu = C(CH₃)₃) is formed in only low yield by the reaction of diazadistannetidine [Me₂SnNᵗBu]₂ with galliumtrimethyl.

This experimental study investigates the behaviour of two powders of similar density, Kaolin and SAE, in a small scale Stairmand cyclone with inlet velocities of 15, 30 and 45ms⁻¹. Initially evidence of agglomeration of fine particles occurring within the cyclone body is observed; however, as the inlet velocity increases, particle attrition dominates the behaviour of fine particles in the grade efficiency graphs. Both powders respond similarly to increased flow rates; however, Kaolin exhibits a greater tendency to agglomeration and attrition, which is manifested in the difference between the respective grade efficiency curves, thus demonstrating the complex effect of material properties on cyclone efficiency.  aPublisher supplied data 3acyclone separators 3aequipment performance 3agraphs 3akaolin 3apowders 3aseparation 0aCyclone 0aSeparation grade efficiency 0aParticle agglomeration 0aParticle attrition 0aDust loading1 aHursthouse, A.1 aMcIlwain, S.1 aSykes, D.0 tPowder technology.g2014 May, v. 258 p.110-124dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2014.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
