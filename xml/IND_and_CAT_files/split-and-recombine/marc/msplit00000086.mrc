The enzyme showed different kinetic and stability characteristics when compared to a commercially available batch of A. niger glucose oxidase. The gene encoding the new glucose oxidase was isolated and DNA sequence analysis of the coding region showed 80% identity to the sequence of a glucose oxidase gene previously published. However, the similarity of the non-coding sequences up- and downstream of the open reading frame was much less, showing only 66% and 50% identity respectively. Despite the low degree of similarity between the promotor region of the new gene and the previously published one, the new glucose oxidase was likewise induced by calcium carbonate. In addition, we showed that this induction occurred on the transcriptional level. Observations concerning the effect of gluconolactone and the levels of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase upon calcium carbonate induction suggested that the enhancement of glucose oxidase biosynthesis by calcium carbonate was accompanied by a metabolic shift from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate pathway. 3aAspergillus niger 3aDNA 3abiosynthesis 3acalcium carbonate 3agenes 3agluconolactone 3aglucose oxidase 3aglucose-6-phosphate isomerase 3aglycolysis 3aopen reading frames 3apentose phosphate cycle 3asequence analysis 3atranscription (genetics) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nigerxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCalcium Carbonatexpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungalxdrug effects 2aGenes, Fungalxgenetics 2aGluconatesxpharmacology 2aGlucose Oxidasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHot Temperature 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aKinetics 2aLactones 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aRNA, Fungalxbiosynthesis 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesis 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 0amolecular sequence data1 aHansen, O.C.1 aMacris, B.J.1 aTingey, A.1 aKekos, D.1 aGoodenough, P.1 aStougaard, P.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g1996 Nov., v. 46, no. 4 p.371-381x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0025300508323Available from publisher's Web site  a19970703b19970710c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle01999naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100001800141245010300159300001600262520101100278650002001289650001301309650001601322650001301338650001101351650001101362650002601373700001901399773009601418852000901514856008101523930003301604945001301637946001101650655001201661IND2057666520221118205442.0970612e199611  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205766652DNAL7 a10.1007/s0025300508252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarvituna, F.10aSomatic embryogenesis of pepper in bioreactors: a study of bioreactor type and oxygen-uptake rates  ap. 327-333.  aSomatic embryogenesis of pepper, Capsicum annuum var.

Bacterial spots appeared on the upper surface of middle size immature fruit and the spots became larger with the increase of fruit size. Spots were round or elongated, superficial and lightly sunken, 1.5-2 cm in diameter. The centre of the spots dried out and became progressively gray, brown to black-brown and had intensely coloured margins. The infected area did not develop into soft rot. The bacterium Pseudomonas viridiflava (Burkholder) Dowson was identified as the causal agent on the basis of morphological, physiological, biochemical and pathological characters. This appears to be the first time that these symptoms have been described on tomato fruit. 3aetiology 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aPseudomonas viridiflava 3anew host records 3abiochemistry 3aanatomy and morphology 3adisease course 3aSolanum lycopersicum var. lycopersicum 3aGreece 0asize 0aidentification 0apathological processes and conditions 0afruits 0asymptoms1 aMalathrakis, N.E.1 aChatzaki, A.K.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g1999 Dec., v. 105, no. 9 p.927-932x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03005naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003100133040001800164100003000182245010200212300001800314500002400332500001500356506007600371520118400447506003701631650002501668650001601693650001501709650001701724650003901741650001101780650002101791650001701812650001401829650003701843650001601880650001101896650004501907650002701952650003901979650004502018650001702063653003902080700002802119700002002147700002702167700001902194773011502213852000902328856008102337856003302418655001202451IND4394068320221207095418.0070812e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439406832DNAL7 a175455082pmid7 aPMC19499042pmcid7 a10.1104/pp.107.0982362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSandaklie-Nikolova, Linda10aSynergid Cell Death in Arabidopsis Is Triggered following Direct Interaction with the Pollen Tube  ap. 1753-1762.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDuring angiosperm reproduction, one of the two synergid cells within the female gametophyte undergoes cell death prior to fertilization. The pollen tube enters the female gametophyte by growing into the synergid cell that undergoes cell death and releases its two sperm cells within the degenerating synergid cytoplasm to effect double fertilization. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and many other species, synergid cell death is dependent upon pollination. However, the mechanism by which the pollen tube causes synergid cell death is not understood. As a first step toward understanding this mechanism, we defined the temporal relationship between pollen tube arrival at the female gametophyte and synergid cell death in Arabidopsis. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and real-time observation of these two events in vitro, we demonstrate that synergid cell death initiates after the pollen tube arrives at the female gametophyte but before pollen tube discharge. Our results support a model in which a signaling cascade triggered by pollen tube-synergid cell contact induces synergid cell death in Arabidopsis.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3apollination 3acell death 3agametophytes 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3amodels 3alight microscopy 3apollen tubes 3acytoplasm 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aspermatozoa 3apollen 2aArabidopsisxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aCell Deathxphysiology 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPollen Tubexphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aTime Factors 0aconfocal scanning laser microscopy1 aPalanivelu, Ravishankar1 aKing, Edward J.1 aCopenhaver, Gregory P.1 aDrews, Gary N.0 tPlant physiology.g2007 Aug., v. 144, no. 4 p.1753-1762dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.107.0982363Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/ 7aarticle02642naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009100130300001400221520144500235650003001680650004501710650002001755650002301775650001501798650001901813650002501832650004701857653001901904653002901923653002801952653002101980653002102001653002102022700001602043700001502059773009202074852000902166930003302175945001302208946001102221655001202232IND2206205220221118205635.0000803e200001  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220620522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacDonald, J.E.10aDifferentiation of Phoma foveata from P. exigua using a RAPD generated PCR-RFLP marker  ap. 67-75.  aPhoma foveata and P. exigua variety exigua both infect potatoes and are morphologically very similar. P. foveata produces a pigment which allows differentiation from P. exigua in culture. Discrimination of the two species based on the production of a secondary metabolite, which is dependent on the growth conditions, is not reliable. Therefore, there is a need to develop nucleic acid based identification markers. A 482 bp random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragment from P. foveata was isolated and sequenced. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, developed from the sequence of the RAPD product, amplified a 474 bp fragment for P. foveata and P. exigua varieties exigua, diversispora, inoxydibilis and sambuci-nigrae. The similarity of the PCR fragments was demonstrated by sequence analysis and by using the restriction enzymes DdeI and DpnII. P. foveata was distinguished from the four varieties of P. exigua on the basis of the RFLP patterns of the PCR fragment. Ten isolates of P. foveata and nine of P. exigua var. exigua from different geographic locations were tested and all isolates but one showed the restriction digest pattern of the PCR fragment (PCR-RFLP) specific to each species. One isolate of P. foveata demonstrated a PCR-RFLP pattern similar to P. exigua var. exigua leading to the conclusion that the isolate had been previously misidentified as a strain of P. foveata lacking the ability to produce pigment. 3aPhoma exigua var. foveata 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3aDNA fingerprinting 3ahost range 3afungal anatomy 3anucleotide sequences 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 0aidentification 0aphoma exigua var. exigua 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/af079896 0agenbank/af079897 0agenbank/af0798981 aWhite, G.P.1 aCote, M.J.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2000 Jan., v. 106, no. 1 p.67-75x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01915naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123100002300141245010100164300001600265520092400281650003201205650001101237650002201248650001401270650002401284650002001308700001801328773009601346852000901442856008101451930003301532945001301565946001101578655001201589IND2057669320221118205309.0970612e199611  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205766932DNAL7 a10.1007/s0025300508422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKay-Shoemake, J.L.10aLimitations of the lignin peroxidase system of the white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium  ap. 438-442.  aThe lignin peroxidase enzyme system of the white-rot fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, was assayed for its capacity to degrade two recalcitrant aliphatic ether compounds, high-molecular-mass polyethylene glycol (PEG 20000) and methyl tert-butyl ether. Ligninolytic cultures of Phanerochaete chrysosporium were spiked with each ether compound and incubated in reaction vessels. Separate incubations were conducted in which the ether compounds were present as sole carbon source. Other parameters, such as varying the methyl tert-butyl ether concentration and veratryl alcohol additions were tested. No significant degradation of either compound was observed under any of the conditions tested.

The amplified fragment of approximately 1 kb can vary in length for individual strains, easily seen in a digest with restriction enzymes Sau3A or HpaII. DNA fragments from this variable region were cloned and DNA sequence analysis revealed short-sequence DNA repeat (SSR) motifs which were reiterated to various extents. The SSR units consisted of eight nucleotides (ATTACAGA), and terminated with ATFA which is part of an SSR. The shortest repetition consisted of four units and the longest one in Austrian E. amylovora strains was 15 units. The number of SSR units was remarkably stable during propagation of strains, but was occasionally changed when a strain was stressed by exposure to antibiotics, copper sulphate or storage at low temperature. Changes in the SSR number could be due to adjustment in bacterial fitness to environmental pressure. We designed oligonucleotide PCR primers from DNA sequences adjacent to the SSR region of pEA29 for rapid analysis of SSR length variations. With this PCR assay, more than 130 strains were classified into at least 11 types based on the number of repeats. E. amylovora strains isolated in Germany carried mostly six repeats in pEA29, which never changed under laboratory conditions. E. amylovora strains from Hungary and the Netherlands were quite divergent for the SSRs and further changes were sometimes observed after plating on agar medium. Homology search of nucleotide sequence data libraries revealed similarities of the SSR motif to partition functions of low copy number plasmids. Amino acid homology searches showed similarity of the deduced amino acid sequence in the ORF adjacent to the SSR motif to replication proteins of plasmids. The SSR may play a role in regulation of plasmid replication and partition as assumed for iterons. 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aErwinia amylovora 3aopen reading frames 3ageographical variation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3astrain differences 3aplasmids 3agenetic variation 3adetection 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 0aidentification 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0astrains 0arepetitive sequences1 aGeider, K.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g1999 Oct., v. 105, no. 7 p.703-713x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02797naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245010600125300001600231500001500247520144500262650002901707650002401736650001101760650003601771650001401807650001601821650003001837650001801867650001501885650001801900650002201918650001401940653003301954653001901987653002802006653002302034653001502057700001402072700001502086700003202101700002102133773009502154852000902249930003302258945001302291946001102304655001202315IND2205692320221118205134.0000711e199909  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220569232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, S.10aBiological mode of action of the fungicide, flusulfamide, against Plasmodiophora brassicae (clubroot)  ap. 577-584.  a2019-12-05  aFlusulfamide (2',4-dichloro-alpha,alpha,alpha -trifluoro-4'-nitro-m- toluenesulfonanilide) was investigated for its mode of action against Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin. Seedlings of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. subsp. pekinensis) were grown for 14 and 21 days in soil infested with P. brassicae and then transplanted into soil containing flusulfamide (0.9 micrograms a.i. g-1 dry soil). Clubroot was not suppressed by this treatment, indicating that the fungicide is ineffective against P. brassicae established within cortical cells of the host root. Where seedlings were grown in soil infested with resting spores which had previously been treated with flusulfamide, root-hair infection and club formation were suppressed. This indicates that flusulfamide directly acts against resting spores. When placed in root exudates of Chinese cabbage, untreated resting spores germinated at a high frequency while flusulfamide-treated resting spores hardly germinated at all. Use of the Evan's blue staining assay indicated that flusulfamide-treated resting spores remained viable. Flusulfamide was detected by high performance liquid chromatography on resting spores treated with flusulfamide for 30 min. This indicates that the chemical is adsorbed onto resting spores. These results suggest that flusulfamide suppresses clubroot disease by inhibiting germination of P. brassicae resting spores through adsorption onto their cell walls. 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3amechanism of action 3acortex 3aBrassica rapa subsp. pekinensis 3aseedlings 3ahost plants 3afungal diseases of plants 3aroot exudates 3aroot hairs 3afungal spores 3aspore germination 3ainfection 0aplant diseases and disorders 0afungus control 0aexperimental infections 0aanilide fungicides 0ainhibition1 aKochi, S.1 aKunita, H.1 aItō, S.q(Satoshi),d1946-1 aKameya-Iwaki, M.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g1999 Sept., v. 105, no. 6 p.577-584x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02299naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245013000129300001600259520115600275650004001431650001401471650004501485650001101530650001901541650002201560650002101582650001001603650001801613650001401631650001301645653001301658653003301671653001901704700001801723773009401741852000901835930003301844945001301877946001101890655001201901IND2205758920221118205156.0000714e199912  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220575892DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChan, J.W.Y.F.10aDifferentiation of Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli from Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans by PFGE and RFLP  ap. 867-878.  aXanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli and X. campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans, the causal agents of the common and fuscous bacterial blight of beans, appear to be phenotypically identical except that the latter can produce a melanin-like pigment in culture. Ten isolates of X. campestris pv. phaseoli and 12 isolates of X. campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans were examined using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). The average genome sizes for X. campestris pv. phaseoli and X. campestris pv. phaseoli var. fuscans were 3850.6 +/- 48.9 and 3584.3 +/- 68.1 kb respectively. The genetic relatedness of the isolates was determined from macrorestriction patterns generated using XbaI. Cluster analysis indicated that the non-fuscous and fuscous strains are distinct. RFLP results, based on the highly conserved hrp genes and a pectate lyase gene from Xanthomonas, also indicated that the two bacteria are genetically different. The results obtained in this study suggest that this pathovar can be segregated into two subgroups under a recently proposed reclassification of the Xanthomonas genus. 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli 3avarieties 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3ablight 3acultured cells 3agenetic variation 3agenetic distance 3agenes 3achemotaxonomy 3aphenotype 3agenomics 0amelanins 0apulsed field electrophoresis 0aidentification1 aGoodwin, P.H.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g1999 Dec., v. 105, no. 9 p.867-878x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02763naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245017900125300001600304500001500320520161400335650001701949650001801966650003301984650002502017650000802042650001402050650002302064653001902087653005402106653002802160653002502188700001702213773009302230852000902323930003302332945001302365946001102378655001202389IND2322933520221118204542.0010906e200105  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232293352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRott, M.E.10aCharacterization and detection of several filamentous viruses of cherry: adaptation of an alternative cloning method (DOP-PCR), and modification of an RNA extraction protocol  ap. 411-420.  a2019-12-05  aFor the identification and analysis of new RNA plant viruses infecting fruit tre es, an initial step often involves the laborious procedure of isolation and cDNA synthesis and cloning from purified viral dsRNA. For subsequent RT-PCR detectio n of these and other viruses from tissue with high phenolic and polysaccharide c oncentrations, a simple and efficient extraction protocol for viral nucleic acid is also important. A method for rapid cDNA cloning from small amounts of purifi ed dsRNA using a modification of degenerate oligo primed polymerase chain reacti on (DOP-PCR), and a modification of a protocol for effective extraction of viral RNA for use in RT-PCR are presented. Both methods were used to analyze a number of mottling diseases described in cherry. The causal agents for two of these di seases have been previously described, Cherry green ring mottle virus, a tentati ve member of the foveaviruses, and Cherry mottle leaf virus, a member of the tri choviruses. For the diseases cherry rusty mottle and cherry necrotic rusty mottl e, data are presented identifying viruses associated with each disease. Viruses associated with cherry rusty mottle, cherry necrotic rusty mottle and European i solates of cherry mottle leaf diseases, are closely related to Cherry green ring mottle virus and can be tentatively included in the foveavirus genus. An additi onal virus, related to cherry green ring mottle virus, was discovered by RT-PCR cloning and appears to be a common latent virus of cherry. Finally, isolates of cherry necrotic mottle disease could be assayed positive by RT-PCR for a virus 3aPrunus avium 3aplant viruses 3aplant diseases and disorders 3anucleotide sequences 3aRNA 3adetection 3aphenolic compounds 0aidentification 0adegenerate oligo primed polymerase chain reaction 0amolecular sequence data 0aHealth and Pathology1 aJelkmann, W.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2001 May, v. 107, no. 4 p.411-420x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03380naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245013500161300001400296500002400310520211600334650002402450650000802474650001102482650001502493650001102508650002002519650002402539650001502563650001002578650001302588650002402601650000902625650001302634650001802647650001102665650001002676650001302686700001602699700001502715700001502730773012002745852000902865856004802874655001202922IND4386096320221118205327.0061217e200701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438609632DNAL7 a10.1007/s10658-006-9069-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarisse, O.10aHeterogeneity of the aerial concentration and deposition of ascospores of Venturia inaequalis within a tree canopy during the rain  ap. 13-24.  aIncludes references  aScab is an important disease of apple and its control depends almost exclusively on frequent use of fungicides. Primary scab infection in the spring assumes several steps: ascospore maturation, liberation of ascospores that become airborne, deposition on susceptible tissues, and infection. However, the spatial heterogeneity of ascospores within the tree canopy is unknown. Aerial concentration of ascospore (ACA), ascospore concentration in rain water (ACR) and ascospore deposition (AD) were therefore measured at six heights (20-257 cm from the ground) with rotating-arm air samplers, funnels, and greased glass slides, respectively, during five rain events in 2001 and in 2002. In addition, ACR and AD were measured at eight locations within tree canopy at 196 cm height. Apple scab was assessed at the end of the primary infection period in each sampling location within the apple tree. A similar experimental design was used in 2003 to study the spatial heterogeneity of both AD and primary scab lesions. ACA and AD decreased with increasing height, while ACR increased with increasing height. Based on both variance to mean ratio and the power law relationship in both years, the ACR was heterogeneous, while AD was heterogeneous only during the peaks of ascospore release. The ACR was significantly higher at the centre of the trees and the AD was significantly higher at the centre and at the western edge of the trees. Only the cumulative AD was significantly correlated with apple scab lesions at the same location (r = 0.83). In 2003, a similar pattern of spatial heterogeneity within the tree canopy was observed for AD and primary scab lesion counts and there was a linear relationship (R ² = 0.84) between these two variables. It was concluded that ACR and AD within the tree canopy are not randomly distributed at least during peaks of ascospore release and that AD is a good estimate of primary scab lesion development. This spatial heterogeneity should be considered when estimating ascospore deposition using mathematical models or when quantifying ascosporic inoculum using spore samplers. 3aVenturia inaequalis 3aair 3aapples 3aascospores 3acanopy 3adisease control 3aexperimental design 3afungicides 3aglass 3ainoculum 3amathematical models 3arain 3asamplers 3ascab diseases 3aspring 3atrees 3avariance1 aRolland, D.1 aTalbot, B.1 aSavary, S.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2007 Jan., v. 117, no. 1 p.13-24dKluwer Academic Publishersx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-006-9069-5 7aarticle02765naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245012700128300001600255520160700271650002201878650001301900650001901913650003001932650001701962650003001979653001802009653001302027653002002040653002802060653002002088653001902108700001702127700001702144700001702161700001802178773009302196852000902289930003302298945001302331946001102344655001202355IND2322933720221118205420.0010906e200105  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232293372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, D.R.10aDifferential control of head blight pathogens of wheat by fungicides and consequences for mycotoxin contamination of grain  ap. 421-431.  aFusarium head blight of wheat is caused by a disease complex comprised of toxige nic pathogens, predominantly Fusarium spp., and a non-toxigenic pathogen Microdo chium nivale, which causes symptoms visually indistinguishable from Fusarium and is often included as a causal agent of Fusarium head blight. Four field trials are reported here, including both naturally and artificially inoculated trials i n which the effect of fungicide treatments were noted on colonisation by Fusariu m and Microdochium, and on the production of deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin. The pathogen populations were analysed with quantitative PCR and samples were teste d for the presence of the mycotoxin DON. Application of fungicides to reduce Fus arium head blight gave a differential control of these fungi. Tebuconazole selec tively controlled F. culmorum and F. avenaceum and reduced levels of DON, but sh owed little control of M. nivale. Application of azoxystrobin, however, selectiv ely controlled M. nivale and allowed greater colonisation by toxigenic Fusarium species. This treatment also lead to increased levels of DON detected. Azoxystro bin application two days post-inoculation increased the production of DON mycoto xin per unit of pathogen in an artificially inoculated field trial. This result indicates the potential risk of increased DON contamination of grain following t reatment with azoxystrobin to control head blight in susceptible wheat cultivars . This is the first study to show differential fungicidal control of mixed natur al pathogen populations and artificial inoculations in field trials. 3aTriticum aestivum 3aFusarium 3adeoxynivalenol 3apolymerase chain reaction 3atebuconazole 3afungal diseases of plants 0acontamination 0asymptoms 0aeastern england 0aexperimental infections 0aazoxy compounds 0afungus control1 aWeston, G.E.1 aTurner, J.A.1 aJennings, P.1 aNicholson, P.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2001 May, v. 107, no. 4 p.421-431x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02664naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011800127300001600245520172100261650002201982650002802004650003002032650002602062650001402088650003002102700001502132700001502147700001702162773009302179852000902272930003302281945001302314946001102327655001202338IND2322932920221118205403.0010906e200105  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232293292DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCullen, D.W.10aConventional PCR and real-time quantitative PCR detection of Helminthosporium solani in soil and on potato tubers  ap. 387-398.  aSilver scurf is an economically important blemish disease of potato caused by th e fungus Helminthosporium solani. Two sets of PCR primers, Hs1F1/Hs2R1 (outer) a nd Hs1NF1/Hs2NR1 (nested) were designed to unique sequences of the nuclear ribos omal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1 and ITS2) regions of H. solani. Nested PC R was used to increase the specificity and sensitivity of single round PCR. Each primer set amplified a single product of 447 bp and 371 bp respectively, with D NA from 71 European and North American isolates of H. solani, and the specificit y of primers was confirmed by the absence of amplified product with DNA from oth er fungal and bacterial plant pathogens. A simple and rapid procedure for direct extraction of DNA from soils and potato tubers was modified and developed to yi eld DNA of a purity and quality suitable for PCR within 3 h. The sensitivity of PCR for the specific detection of H. solani in seeded soils was determined to be 1.5 spores g(-1) of soil. H. solani was also detected by PCR in naturally infes ted soil and from peel and peel extract from infected and apparently healthy tub ers. Specific primers and a TaqMan fluorogenic probe were designed using the ori ginal primer sequences to perform real-time quantitative (TaqMan) PCR. The same levels of sensitivity for specific detection of H. solani in soil and tubers wer e obtained during first round TaqMan-based PCR as with conventional nested PCR a nd gel electrophoresis. This rapid and quantitative PCR assay allows an accurate estimation of tuber and soil contamination by H. solani, thus providing a tool to study the ecology of the organism and to serve as a crucial component for dis ease risk assessments. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aHelminthosporium solani 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aquantitative analysis 3adetection 3afungal diseases of plants1 aLees, A.K.1 aToth, I.K.1 aDuncan, J.M.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2001 May, v. 107, no. 4 p.387-398x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02862naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015900129300001600288500001500304520173000319650001602049650001702065650003202082650001702114650001602131650001802147650001202165650002002177653002002197653002802217653001702245653001402262653001102276700001702287773009402304852000902398930003302407945001302440946001102453655001202464IND2205292620221118205433.0000616e199910  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220529262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, K.L.10aInfluence of abscisic acid and the abscisic acid biosynthesis inhibitor, norflurazon, on interactions between Phytophthora sojae and soybean (Glycine max)  ap. 651-658.  a2019-12-05  aA comparison was made of the effects of abscisic acid (ABA) and the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor, norflurazon on the interaction between soybean leaves and Phytophthora sojae. Inoculation of leaves of cv. Harosoy resulted in a compatible interaction typified by the presence of spreading, water soaked lesions with ill-defined margins while inoculation of cv. Haro 1272 resulted in an incompatible interaction with lesions restricted to the inoculation site. Activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) slowly increased in the compatible interaction but in the incompatible interaction there was a rapid rise in activity within 8 h after inoculation. When Haro 1272 plants were treated with ABA the normally incompatible interaction with race 1 was changed to what resembled a compatible interaction and activity of PAL was reduced to control levels. There was no visible effect on the compatible combination. In contrast when plants of cv. Harosoy were treated with norflurazon the normally compatible interaction with race 1 was changed to that which resembled an incompatible interaction and PAL activity increased to high levels rapidly. There was no effect of norflurazon on the incompatible interaction of cv. Haro 1272 with race 1. Stomata on leaves of cv.

On leaves of cv. Harosoy treated with norflurazon at sites 3 and 20 mm from the inoculation point stomata also closed. These results extend and confirm the idea that ABA is a molecule that may regulate the outcome of the interaction between soybeans and P. sojae. 3aGlycine max 3abiosynthesis 3aphenylalanine ammonia-lyase 3aPhytophthora 3anorflurazon 3aabscisic acid 3astomata 3aenzyme activity 0aincompatibility 0aexperimental infections 0ainteractions 0aepidermis 0aleaves1 aCahill, D.M.0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g1999 Oct., v. 105, no. 7 p.651-658x0929-18737nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03063naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245014400181300001600325500002400341520132000365650002101685650001901706650001601725650001701741650001001758650001201768650001001780650002701790650001101817650001101828650001401839650001901853650001101872650001601883650001201899650001701911650003101928650004901959650003802008650002402046650004002070650005402110650006002164650004102224650004702265700001902312700002202331773009902353852000902452856004802461655001202509IND4399411520221118205227.0071226e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439941152DNAL7 a179408442pmid7 a10.1007/s11248-007-9151-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Changfu10aNicotiana glauca engineered for the production of ketocarotenoids in flowers and leaves by expressing the cyanobacterial crtO ketolase gene  ap. 813-821.  aIncludes references  aNicotiana glauca is a tobacco species that forms flowers with carotenoid-pigmented petals, sepals, pistil, ovary and nectary tissue. The carotenoids produced are lutein, ß-carotene as well as some violaxanthin and antheraxanthin. This tobacco species was genetically modified for ketocarotenoid biosynthesis by transformation with a cyanobacterial crtO ketolase gene under the 35S CaMV promoter. In the transformants, ketocarotenoids were detected in both leaves and flowers. Although astaxanthin was not detected other ketocarotenoids such as 4'-ketolutein, echinenone, 3'-hydroxyechinenone and 4-ketozeaxanthin were present. Accumulation of ketocarotenoids in leaves decreased their photosynthetic efficiency moderately. Under the green house conditions used no impairment of growth and development compared to the wild type was observed. In the crtO-transformants, an unexpected up-regulation of total carotenoid biosynthesis in leaves and especially in flower petals was observed. This led to a total ketocarotenoid concentration in leaves of 136.6 (young) or 156.1 (older) μg/g dry weight and in petals of 165 μg/g dry weight. In our engineered plants, the ketocarotenoid pathway is one step short of astaxanthin. Strategies are discussed to improve N. glauca flowers as a biological system for astaxanthin. 3aNicotiana glauca 3aantheraxanthin 3aastaxanthin 3abiosynthesis 3acalyx 3acorolla 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3aleaves 3alutein 3anectaries 3aphotosynthesis 3apistil 3aplant ovary 3atobacco 3aviolaxanthin 2aCarotenoidsxbiosynthesis. 2aFlowersxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Engineering 2aOxygenasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlant Leavesxenzymologyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxenzymologyxmicrobiology. 2aSynechocystisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTobaccoxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aGerjets, Tanja1 aSandmann, Gerhard0 tTransgenic research.g2007 Dec., v. 16, no. 6 p.813-821dSpringer Netherlandsx0962-88197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-007-9151-6 7aarticle03678naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100003300152245020600185300001800391520172800409650002302137650003002160650001202190650001202202650001402214650001602228650001802244650003502262650001702297650002302314650002002337650001502357650001602372650001702388650001602405650001202421650002302433650001502456650001502471650001502486650002002501650001502521650001402536650001502550650002902565650002502594650001802619653001402637653002302651653002702674653003902701700002002740700002602760773012102786852000902907856009202916930003303008946001103041655001203052IND4426474320221118205546.0090925e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442647432DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02265.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl-Dohail, Mohammed Abdullah10aEffects of the probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus, on the growth performance, haematology parameters and immunoglobulin concentration in African Catfish (Clarias gariepinus, Burchell 1822) fingerling  ap. 1642-1652.  aThis experiment was carried out to evaluate the effects of the probiotic, Lactobacillus acidophilus, on the growth performance, haematology parameters and immunoglobulin concentration in African catfish Clarias gariepinus fingerling. Two experimental diets were formulated to contain 35 g kg⁻¹ crude protein and 10 g kg⁻¹ lipids accordingly and fed three times daily for 12 weeks to 25 C. gariepinus fingerlings per fibreglass tank in 12 replicates each. The control diet was prepared with no probiotic supplementation whereas the second diet was prepared supplemented with a probiotic, L. acidophilus, containing about 3.01 x 10⁷ colonies/g of diet. The results show that growth performance [specific growth rate (SGR) and relative growth rate (RGR)], nutrient utilization [protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR)] and survival were significantly (P<0.05) higher in fish maintained on the probiotic-supplemented diet compared with those on the control diet. Haematology parameters (packed cell volume, haemoglobin, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, red blood cell and white blood cell, total serum protein, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Cl⁻, glucose and cholesterol) and total immunoglobulin concentrations were also significantly better in fish fed the probiotic-supplemented diet than in the control. Although the water quality parameters monitored were better in the fish fed the probiotic-supplemented diet than in the control, the parameters were not significantly different (P>0.05). From the results of this experiment, we conclude that L. acidophilus can be used as a probiotic agent in African catfish culture, to enhance fish health, survival and better feed efficiency and growth performance. 3aClarias gariepinus 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3acalcium 3acatfish 3achlorides 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3aerythrocyte sedimentation rate 3aerythrocytes 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afiberglass 3afingerlings 3afish culture 3afish health 3aglucose 3agrowth performance 3ahematocrit 3ahematology 3ahemoglobin 3aimmunoglobulins 3aleukocytes 3amagnesium 3aprobiotics 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aspecific growth rate 3awater quality 0aprobiotic 0agrowth performance 0ahaematology parameters 0aClarias gariepinus (Burchell 1822)1 aHashim, Roshada1 aAliyu-Paiko, Mohammed0 tAquaculture research.g2009 Sept., v. 40, no. 14 p.1642-1652dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02265.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090925b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02895naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002700186245010400213300001600317520173000333650001002063650001002073653001002083653002002093653001002113653002402123700002302147700002302170700003002193700001902223773014102242852000902383856008502392930003302477946001102510655001202521IND4445155020221118205613.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444515502DNAL7 a10.1007/s11357-010-9150-z2doi7 aPMC29806012pmcid7 a205029692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPredmore, Benjamin L. 14aThe hydrogen sulfide signaling system: changes during aging and the benefits of caloric restriction  ap. 467-481.  aHydrogen sulfide gas (H₂S) is a putative signaling molecule that causes diverse effects in mammalian tissues including relaxation of blood vessels and regulation of perfusion in the liver, but the effects of aging on H₂S signaling are unknown. Aging has negative impacts on the cardiovascular system. However, the liver is more resilient with age. Caloric restriction (CR) attenuates affects of age in many tissues. We hypothesized that the H₂S signaling system is negatively affected by age in the vasculature but not in the liver, which is typically more resilient to age, and that a CR diet minimizes the age affect in the vasculature. To investigate this, we determined protein and mRNA expression of the H₂S-producing enzymes cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS), H₂S production rates in the aorta and liver, and the contractile response of aortic rings to exogenous H₂S. Tissue was collected from Fisher 344 × Brown Norway rats from 8-38 months of age, which had been maintained on an ad libitum (AL) or CR diet. The results demonstrate that age and diet have differential effects on the H₂S signaling system in aorta and liver. The aorta showed a sizeable effect of both age and diet, whereas the liver only showed a sizeable effect of diet. Aortic rings showed increased contractile sensitivity to H₂S and increased protein expression of CSE and CBS with age, consistent with a decrease in H₂S concentration with age. CR appears to benefit CSE and CBS protein in both aorta and liver, potentially by reducing oxidative stress and ameliorating the negative effect of age on H₂S concentration. Therefore, CR may help maintain the H₂S signaling system during aging. 3aaorta 3aliver 0aH₂S 0aGasotransmitter 0aAging 0aCaloric restriction1 aAlendy, Maikel J. 1 aAhmed, Khadija I. 1 aLeeuwenburgh, Christiaan 1 aJulian, David 0 tAge the journal of the American Aging Association.g2010 Dec., v. 32, no. 4 p.467-481dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0161-91527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11357-010-9150-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101113b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02558naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245011000184300001600294520095600310650001701266650000901283650001801292650001201310650002001322650000901342650002901351650005701380650002701437650001901464650002001483650002401503650004101527650001901568651001201587651001201599653002601611653002001637653003501657700002301692700003001715700002601745773014101771852000901912856008501921930003302006946001302039655001202052IND4442050620221118205539.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444205062DNAL7 a206522222pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-0082-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOje, Obinna A. 10aEnvironmental Pollution Levels of Lead and Zinc in Ishiagu and Uburu Communities of Ebonyi State, Nigeria  ap. 313-317.  aWater and soil samples from the area were therefore analyzed for their lead and zinc content.

Considering two different wage-regimes for the public firm, this paper examines the effects of wage regulation imposed on civil servants. It is shown that, when a public firm's union is prohibited from collective bargaining, the firm is more competitive, and the degree of differentiation is less. Moreover, regulation always reduces both the private firm's profit and the level of social welfare. 0aMixed duopoly 0aWage regulation 0aSpatial competition 0aProduct differentiation0 tJournal of economics Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie.g2011 Mar., v. 102, no. 2 p.123-136dVienna : Springer Viennax0931-86587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00712-010-0175-73Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02295naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245009700164300001400261520131000275650001801585653001201603653002401615653001601639653001701655700002401672700002001696773012501716852000901841856008501850930003301935946001301968655001201981IND4447503020221118205538.0110114e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444750302DNAL7 a10.1007/s00418-010-0766-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZádor, Ernő 10aSilencing SERCA1b in a few fibers stimulates growth in the entire regenerating soleus muscle  ap. 11-20.  aThe neonatal isoform of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ ATPase 1 (SERCA1b) is a dominant Ca²⁺ pump in the young fibers of regenerating muscle. In vivo transfection of about 1% of the fibers with SERCA1b RNAi plasmid resulted in no apparent change in the transfected fibers, but enhanced the increase of fresh weight and fiber size in the whole regenerating rat soleus muscle, until the normal size was reached. Co-transfection of calcineurin inhibitor cain/cabin-1 with SERCA1b RNAi was sufficient to cut down the widespread growth stimulation, but the subsequent transfection of cain into the SERCA1b RNAi transfected muscle did not inhibit muscle growth. The SERCA1b RNAi preferably upregulated the expression of the NFAT reporter lacZ compared to controls when co-transfected into the fibers. Notably, perimuscular injection of interleukin-4 (IL-4) antibody but not that of an unrelevant antibody completely abolished the growth-promoting effect of SERCA1b RNAi. This indicates that silencing SERCA1b in a few fibers stimulates the calcineurin-NFAT-IL-4 pathway and fiber growth in the whole regenerating soleus. These results suggest the presence of an autocrine-paracrine coordination of growing muscle fibers, and put forward a new method to stimulate skeletal muscle regeneration. 3ainterleukin-4 0aSERCA1b 0aMuscle regeneration 0aCalcineurin 0aFiber growth1 aOwsianik, Grzegorz 1 aWuytack, Frank 0 tHistochemistry and cell biology.g2011 Jan., v. 135, no. 1 p.11-20dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0948-61437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00418-010-0766-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02107naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009200166300001600258520083300274650001701107650001701124650002301141650001901164650002101183650002601204650002301230650001701253650001601270650001101286650002301297650001801320651001001338653002601348653002201374700002501396700001901421773009301440852000901533856008501542930003301627946001301660655001201673IND4429348420221118205648.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442934842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10745-009-9254-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMotti, Riccardo 10aTraditional Plant Use in the Phlegraean Fields Regional Park (Campania, Southern Italy)  ap. 775-782.  aThe Phlegraean Fields Regional Park in southern Italy has an especially long history of human exploitation. For our ethnobotanical studies we interviewed 39 people native to the area and recorded 962 use-reports. For each species, we provide scientific and vernacular names, plant parts used, and preparation and administration processes. In all, 69 species belonging to 35 families were classified. The species most frequently mentioned were Citrus limon, Chamomilla recutita, Malva sylvestris, Parietaria judaica, Ficus carica, Foeniculum vulgare and Laurus nobilis. The commonest plant use recorded is medicinal, followed by culinary and domestic; for 26% of the species inventoried, more than one use was recorded. The present study confirms the persistence of traditional plant use in regions of central and southern Italy. 3aCitrus limon 3aFicus carica 3aFoeniculum vulgare 3aLaurus nobilis 3aMalva sylvestris 3aMatricaria chamomilla 3aParietaria judaica 3acommon names 3aethnobotany 3ahumans 3aindigenous peoples 3aplant anatomy 3aItaly 0aTraditional plant use 0aPhlegraean Fields1 aAntignani, Vincenzo 1 aIdolo, Marisa 0 tHuman ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.775-782dBoston : Springer USx0300-78397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10745-009-9254-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02960naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003500133040001800168100002000186245012700206300001800333520136300351650001701714650001201731650002001743650001101763650002001774650002901794650002001823650002001843650002001863650001101883650001701894650002501911650003501936650000901971650003001980650003002010650002602040653001602066653002302082653002702105700001702132700002102149700001502170773010502185852000902290856008502299930003302384946001302417655001202430IND4420296320221118205621.0090508e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442029632DNAL7 a192597922pmid7 aPMC27981222pmcid7 a10.1007/s11095-009-9853-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Haiguang 10aCell Type-Specific Targeting with Surface-Engineered Lentiviral Vectors Co-displaying OKT3 Antibody and Fusogenic Molecule  ap. 1432-1445.  aPurpose The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of a T-cell-related targeting method using a lentiviral vector-based gene delivery system. Materials and Methods A lentiviral vector system was constructed by co-incorporating an anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3) and a fusogen into individual viral particles. The incorporation of OKT3 and fusogen was analyzed using confocal microscopy and the in vitro transduction efficiency was evaluated using flow cytometry. Blocking reagents (ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl) and soluble OKT3 antibody) were added into vector supernatants during transduction to study the mechanism of this two-molecule targeting strategy. To demonstrate the ability of targeted transduction in vivo, Jurkat.CD3 cells were xenografted subcutaneously into the right flank of each mouse and the lentiviral vector was injected subcutaneously on both sides of each mouse 8 h post-injection. Subsequently, the reporter gene (firefly luciferase) expression was monitored using a noninvasive bioluminescence imaging system. Results By co-displaying OKT3 and fusogen on the single lentiviral surface, we could achieve targeted delivery of genes to CD3-positive T-cells both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions These results suggest the potential utility of this engineered lentiviral system as a new tool for cell type-directed gene delivery. 3agene therapy 2aAnimals 2aCells, Cultured 2aFemale 2aGene Expression 2aGene Transfer Techniques 2aGenes, Reporter 2aGenetic Therapy 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHumans 2aJurkat Cells 2aLentivirusxgenetics 2aLuciferases, Fireflyxgenetics 2aMice 2aMuromonab-CD3ximmunology 2aT-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aTransduction, Genetic 0aCD3 antigen 0alentiviral vectors 0atargeted gene delivery1 aJoo, Kye-Il 1 aZiegler, Leslie 1 aWang, Bin.0 tPharmaceutical research.g2009 June, v. 26, no. 6 p.1432-1445dBoston : Springer USx0724-87417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11095-009-9853-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02883naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002300193245019600216300001800412520160000430650001702030653005702047653002102104653002602125653002502151700002102176700002002197700002302217700002202240773011402262852000902376856009202385930003302477946001102510655001202521IND4424203720221118205603.0090807e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442420372DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02946.x2doi7 aPMC27538922pmcid7 a197403072pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJacques, Alexandre10aMacrophage interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-α are induced by coronavirus fixation to Toll-like receptor 2/heparan sulphate receptors but not carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a  ap. e181-e192.  aA rapid antiviral immune response may be related to viral interaction with the host cell leading to activation of macrophages via pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) or specific viral receptors. Carcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) is the specific receptor for the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus known to induce acute viral hepatitis in mice. The objective of this study was to understand the mechanisms responsible for the secretion of high-pathogenic MHV3-induced inflammatory cytokines. We report that the induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in peritoneal macrophages does not depend on CEACAM1a, as demonstrated in cells isolated from Ceacam1a⁻/⁻ mice. The induction of IL-6 and TNF-α production was related rather to the fixation of the spike (S) protein of MHV3 on Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) in regions enriched in heparan sulphate and did not rely on viral replication, as demonstrated with denatured S protein and UV-inactivated virus. High levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were produced in livers from infected C57BL/6 mice but not in livers from Tlr2⁻/⁻ mice. The histopathological observations were correlated with the levels of those inflammatory cytokines. Depending on mouse strain, the viral fixation to heparan sulfate/TLR2 stimulated differently the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in the induction of IL-6 and TNF-α. These results suggest that TLR2 and heparan sulphate receptors can act as new viral PPRs involved in inflammatory responses. 3ainflammation 0acarcinoembryonic cell adhesion antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) 0aheparan sulphate 0amouse hepatitis virus 0aToll-like receptor 21 aBleau, Christian1 aTurbide, Claire1 aBeauchemin, Nicole1 aLamontagne, Lucie0 tImmunology.g2009 Sept., v. 128, no. 1pt2 p.e181-e192dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02946.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090808b20091002c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04131naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245017000190300001600360520195600376650001202332650006402344650001502408650001002423650000902433650003002442650005202472650002402524650003902548650001102587650003702598650001102635650003702646650004902683650000902732650003902741650001602780650003802796650004202834650005202876650002202928650001602950650001602966653002002982653001603002653001803018653002903036653001703065700001603082700001403098700001603112700001903128700001803147700001603165700001503181773012803196852000903324856009203333930003303425946001103458655001203469IND4440566020221118204934.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444056602DNAL7 a206496302pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01233.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatthews, D.R.10aVildagliptin add-on to metformin produces similar efficacy and reduced hypoglycaemic risk compared with glimepiride, with no weight gain: results from a 2-year study  ap. 780-789.  aAim: To show that vildagliptin added to metformin is non-inferior to glimepiride in reducing HbA1c levels from baseline over 2 years. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, active-comparator study of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled (HbA1c 6.5-8.5%) by metformin monotherapy. Patients received vildagliptin (50 mg twice daily) or glimepiride (up to 6 mg/day) added to metformin. Results: In all, 3118 patients were randomized (vildagliptin, n = 1562; glimepiride, n = 1556). From similar baseline values (7.3%), after 2 years adjusted mean (s.e.) change in HbA1c was comparable between vildagliptin and glimepiride treatment: -0.1% (0.0%) and -0.1% (0.0%), respectively. The primary objective of non-inferiority was met. A similar proportion of patients reached HbA1c <7% (36.9 and 38.3%, respectively), but with vildagliptin more patients reached this target without hypoglycaemia (36.0% vs. 28.8%; p = 0.004). The initial response (IR) was sustained for a mean (s.d.) of 309 (244) days with vildagliptin versus 270 (223) days for glimepiride (p < 0.001) (IR = nadir HbA1c where change from baseline ≥0.5% or HbA1c [less-than or equal to]6.5% within the first six months of treatment. After IR was detected, sustained response = time between nadir and an increase of >0.3% above IR). Independent of disease duration, age was a predictor of effect sustainability. Fewer patients experienced hypoglycaemia with vildagliptin (2.3% vs. 18.2% with glimepiride) with a 14-fold difference in the number of hypoglycaemic events (59 vs. 838). Vildagliptin had a beneficial effect on body weight [mean (s.e.) change from baseline -0.3 (0.1) kg; between-group difference -1.5 kg; p < 0.001]. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated and displayed similar safety profiles. Conclusions: Vildagliptin add-on has similar efficacy to glimepiride after 2 years' treatment, with markedly reduced hypoglycaemia risk and no weight gain. 3aelderly 2aAdamantanexadministration & dosagexanalogs & derivatives. 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aDouble-Blind Method 2aDrug Therapy, Combinationxmethods 2aFemale 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemiaxchemically induced 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aMetforminxadministration & dosage 2aMiddle Aged 2aNitrilesxadministration & dosage 2aPyrrolidinesxadministration & dosage 2aSulfonylurea Compoundsxadministration & dosage 2aTreatment Outcome 2aWeight Gain 2aYoung Adult 0aDPP-4 inhibitor 0aglimepiride 0ahypoglycaemia 0atype 2 diabetes mellitus 0avildagliptin1 aDejager, S.1 aAhren, B.1 aFonseca, V.1 aFerrannini, E.1 aCouturier, A.1 aFoley, J.E.1 aZinman, B.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2010 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.780-789dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01233.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02030naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245005000166300001600216520118100232653002701413653001701440653001101457653001901468700002001487700002301507773010301530852000901633856008501642946001301727655001201740IND4440719020221118204928.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444071902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10683-010-9241-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStöckl, Thomas 10aBubble measures in experimental asset markets  ap. 284-298.  aWe review bubble measures which are commonly used in the experimental asset market literature. It seems sensible to require that measures of mispricing should (i) relate the fundamental value and price, (ii) be monotone in the difference between fundamental value and price, and (iii) be independent of the total number of periods and the absolute level of fundamental value. We show that none of the measures currently used fulfills all these criteria. To facilitate comparability across different experimental settings with different parameterizations we propose two alternative measures which fulfill all evaluation criteria. The measure for mispricing, RAD (relative absolute deviation), is calculated by averaging absolute differences between the (volume-weighted) mean price and the fundamental value across all periods and normalizing it with the absolute value of the average FV of the market. The measure for overvaluation, RD (relative deviation), is calculated analogously, but uses raw difference between (volume-weighted) mean prices and fundamental values. Hence, it provides information on whether the mispricing stems from over- or undervaluation of the asset. 0aExperimental economics 0aAsset market 0aBubble 0aBubble measure1 aHuber, Jürgen.1 aKirchler, Michael 0 tExperimental economics.g2010 Sept., v. 13, no. 3 p.284-298dBoston : Springer USx1386-41577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10683-010-9241-93Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle01525naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245006200177300001400239520050200253650002500755650001500780650001400795653001900809653001700828653001900845700002100864700001700885700001900902773012100921852000901042856009201051930003301143946001101176655001201187IND4427971020221118204850.0091104e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442797102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2009.01792.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPapalexandratou, Zoi10a(GTG)₅-PCR reference framework for acetic acid bacteria  ap. 44-49.  aOne hundred and fifty-eight strains of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) were subjected to (GTG)₅-PCR fingerprinting to construct a reference framework for their rapid classification and identification.

For this purpose, three Carniolan colonies were used as sources of drones and two were used as nursery colonies. The drones were held either in cages or freely in the queenless part of the nursery colonies. Measurements were carried out on samples of drones taken at 3-day intervals from 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-12 and 13-15 days old. While the number of spermatozoa in drone testes decreased in both caged and free drones as the drone age increased, it increased gradually in the seminal vesicles. The results also showed that weight of drones and length of testes decreased, but the length of the mucus gland did not significantly differ with age. Further, the drones' weight, length of mucus gland and total number of spermatozoa tend to be slightly larger in the caged than in free drones. The total number of spermatozoa in all parts of the reproductive organs was lower in the older than younger drones; thus, the number of spermatozoa in the newly emerged drones does not help to predict the real number reaching the queen during mating. 3acages 3ahoney bees 3amucus 3aseminal vesicles 3aspermatozoa 3atestes 0adrone ages 0amucus gland1 aMOHANNY, Karem M.0 tEntomological research.g2010 Sept., v. 40, no. 5 p.245-250dMelbourne, Australia : Blackwell Publishing Asiax1738-22977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-5967.2010.00297.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02701naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002800152245015500180300001600335520118400351650001801535650002001553650001601573650001901589650000901608650001901617650003301636650001101669650001001680650002601690650001301716650001401729650001201743650001501755650001401770650001901784650001801803650001201821650002001833651002001853653001501873653001601888700002301904773012301927852000902050856009202059930003302151946001102184655001202195IND4428578720221118205240.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442857872DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01079.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDell'Arte, Graziella L.14aThe feeding choice of the Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) in a semi-arid fragmented landscape of North Africa in relation to water and energy contents of prey  ap. 729-736.  aIn semi-arid zones, the lack of surface water for drinking forced predators to obtain it from the body fluids of prey and this requires more different prey than that needed to provide energy alone. We examined Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) scats to ascertain if selective feeding compensates the shortage of free water by the ingestion of more prey rich in water such as insects. In addition, we discussed our results in light of increasing habitat fragmentation that, in turn, influences the prey availability. At different spatial levels, recombination of prey assemblages in the diet reaches a solution for variable shortage of water. This was true especially at the landscape level (different degree of aridity) and indirectly for habitat types. Nevertheless, the effects of landscape characteristics probably influenced foxes through the influence of suitable habitats, which partitioned prey species. In fact, increasing values of patchiness had a negative effect on measured energetic gain indices but foxes try to exploiting different patches including small and isolated ones because these surveys become important to obtain water moistures from alternative prey (Orthopters). 3aVulpes vulpes 3aadverse effects 3abody fluids 3achoice feeding 3adiet 3adrinking water 3adry environmental conditions 3aenergy 3afoxes 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3aingestion 3ainsects 3alandscapes 3apredators 3asemiarid zones 3asurface water 3asurveys 3awater shortages 3aNorthern Africa 0apatchiness 0aprey choice1 aLeonardi, Giovanni0 tAfrican journal of ecology.g2009 Dec., v. 47, no. 4 p.729-736dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-67077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2028.2009.01079.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03254naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245014400187300001600331500002400347520178600371650001002157650001102167650001202178650001302190650003102203650001102234650001302245650001502258650001002273650001402283650002002297650001102317650001002328650002802338650003202366650001402398650001402412650002202426650003402448650002902482650002802511700001602539700001902555773011002574852000902684856005502693655001202748IND4379443520221118205242.0060408e200605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437944352DNAL7 a170874662pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01452.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeuke, A.D.14aThe effect of drought on C and N stable isotopes in different fractions of leaves, stems and roots of sensitive and tolerant beech ecotypes  ap. 823-835.  aIncludes references  aBeech seedlings from 11 German climatic provenances were exposed to a realistically timed drought treatment in a greenhouse experiment. The stable isotope composition of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) was analysed in pooled bulk material of roots, stems and leaves, as well as in the aqueous extracts and starch fractions. The [delta]¹³C values increased in bulk samples (BS) of roots, stems and leaves by drought, although no leaf growth occurred during the experimental period. A clear drought effect on [delta]¹³C in aqueous extracts was detected in leaves. In aqueous extracts of stems and roots as well as in starch fractions of all organs, abundance of [delta]¹³C also tended to be increased by drought, but this effect was not statistically significant. For both [delta]¹³C and [delta]¹⁵N, enrichment was observed from the site of uptake/source to the site of use/sink. A gradient for [delta]¹³C in all fractions from leaves ([-]29.49, [-]28.89 and [-]27.85[per mille]) to stems ([-]28.81, [-]27.48 and [-]26.98[per mille]) and to roots ([-]27.60, [-]26.37 and [-]26.48[per mille]) was detected in BS, aqueous extracts and starch, respectively. An opposite gradient for [delta]¹⁵N was found in BS: 1.59[per mille], 1.84[per mille] and 3.05[per mille] in roots, stems and leaves, respectively. [delta]¹⁵N was neither affected by drought in the BS nor in aqueous extracts, but an effect of provenance was observed. Particularly in roots and stems, drought-sensitive provenances showed the strongest shifts in [delta]¹³C induced by drought and the lowest [delta]¹⁵N values. In the present experiment, [delta]¹³C values were more affected by the environmental factor drought, while [delta]¹⁵N values were more affected by the genetic factor provenance. 3aFagus 3acarbon 3adrought 3aecotypes 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3aprovenance 3aroots 3aseedlings 3astable isotopes 3astarch 3astems 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbon Isotopesxmetabolism 2aDisasters 2aEcosystem 2aFagusxmetabolism 2aNitrogen Isotopesxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Stemsxmetabolism1 aGessler, A.1 aRennenberg, H.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2006 May, v. 29, no. 5 p.823-835dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2005.01452.x 7aarticle01652naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010700130300001600237520087000253650000901123650002801132650002201160653001101182700001701193773009801210852000901308930003301317945001301350946001101363655001201374IND2039930620221118204620.0940601e199311  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203993062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastrillo, J.I.10aPatterns of energy metabolism and growth kinetics of Kluyveromyces marxianus in whey chemostat culture  ap. 386-393.  aThe influence of physiological parameters such as carbon substrate flux and O2 uptake rates on energy metabolism are reported with reference to biomass productivity in whey chemostat culture. The combined results show that oxidoreductive energy metabolism may be attained independently of the yeast reaching its maximum respiratory capacity. A novel metabolic interpretation is presented proposing that a relative imbalance between glycolysis and subsequent oxidative steps alone is sufficient to account for the observed results. By means of a mathematical model the results could be reproduced under all experimental conditions. The new interpretation provides an insight into the manner in which energy metabolism is regulated and influences growth-related processes in Kluyveromyces marxianus, as well as other yeasts with similar physiological characteristics. 3awhey 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aenergy metabolism 0agrowth1 aUgalde, U.O.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g1993 Nov., v. 40, no. 2/3 p.386-393x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL  a19940720b19940722c00000000  aINDdJFM  aNon-US 7aarticle03386naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001600158245012800174300001400302500002400316520135500340650002501695650002101720650001801741650000901759650004301768650001501811650001101826650002101837650003501858650001201893650003101905650002601936650002501962650002801987650002502015650001402040650002602054650002002080650002302100650000902123650003702132650005602169650003702225650002902262650005202291650003002343650002102373650003302394700001902427700001202446700001402458700002102472700002002493773008902513852000902602856007902611856005802690655001202748IND4381665420221118204603.0060703s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438166542DNAL7 a168163332pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.008872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTielens, S.10aGeneration of embryonic stem cell lines from mouse blastocysts developed in vivo and in vitro: relation to Oct-4 expression  ap. 59-66.  aIncludes references  aEmbryonic stem (ES) cells are the source of all embryonic germ layer tissues. Oct-4 is essential for their pluripotency. Since in vitro culture may influence Oct-4 expression, we investigated to what extent blastocysts cultured in vitro from the zygote stage are capable of expressing Oct-4 and generating ES cell lines. We compared in vivo with in vitro derived blastocysts from B6D2 mice with regard to Oct-4 expression in inner cell mass (ICM) outgrowths and blastocysts. ES cells were characterized by immunostaining for alkaline phosphatase (ALP), stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 (SSEA-1) and Oct-4. Embryoid bodies were made to evaluate the ES cells' differentiation potential. ICM outgrowths were immunostained for Oct-4 after 6 days in culture. A quantitative real-time PCR assay was performed on individual blastocysts. Of the in vitro derived blastocysts, 17% gave rise to ES cells vs 38% of the in vivo blastocysts. Six-day old outgrowths from in vivo developed blastocysts expressed Oct-4 in 55% of the cases vs 31% of the in vitro derived blastocysts. The amount of Oct-4 mRNA was significantly higher for freshly collected in vivo blastocysts compared to in vitro cultured blastocysts. In vitro cultured mouse blastocysts retain the capacity to express Oct-4 and to generate ES cells, be it to a lower level than in vivo blastocysts. 3aalkaline phosphatase 3ain vitro culture 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3astem cells 3azygote 2aActinsxanalysis 2aAlkaline Phosphatasexanalysis 2aAnimals 2aLewis X Antigenxanalysis. 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aBlastocystxcytology 2aCell Culture Techniques 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Line 2aEmbryonic Development 2aGene Expression 2aHistocytochemistry 2aMice 2aNeurofilament Proteinsxanalysis 2aOctamer Transcription Factor-3xanalysisxgenetics. 2aPluripotent Stem Cellsxcytology 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aStatistics, Nonparametric 2aZygotexcytology 2aalpha-Fetoproteinsxanalysis1 aVerhasselt, B.1 aLiu, J.1 aDhont, M.1 aVan der Elst, J.1 aCornelissen, M.0 tReproduction.g2006 July, v. 132, no. 1 p.59-66dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.008873Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle03575naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245015000189300001600339500002400355520182000379650000902199650001502208650002002223650001002243650001402253650001702267650001102284650001802295650001802313650001402331650001502345650001302360650000902373650001302382650002502395650001202420650004502432650004402477650004702521650003602568650004602604650002002650650003702670650003602707650005402743700001802797700002002815773012902835852000902964856004802973655001203021IND4448542820221118204558.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444854282DNAL7 a208785202pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-010-9608-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRowe, Christopher L.10aDifferential Patterns of Accumulation and Depuration of Dietary Selenium and Vanadium During Metamorphosis in the Gray Treefrog (Hyla versicolor)  ap. 336-342.  aIncludes references  aSelenium (Se) and vanadium (V) are contaminants commonly found in aquatic systems affected by wastes derived from fossil fuels. To examine their effects on a widely distributed species of amphibian, we exposed gray tree frogs (Hyla versicolor) to Se (as SeO₂) or V (as NaVO₃) in their diet from the early larval period to metamorphosis. Concentrations of Se in Se-enriched food were 1.0 (Se control), 7.5 (Se low), and 32.7 (Se high) μg/g dw. Concentrations of V in V-enriched food were 3.0 (V control), 132.1 (V low), and 485.7 (V high) μg/g dw. Although we observed bioaccumulation of both metals throughout the larval period, no effects on growth, survival, metabolic rate, or lipid content were observed. Se concentrations in tissues did not vary among life stages, neither in Se low nor Se high treatments, such that maximum accumulation had occurred by the mid-larval period. In addition, there was no evidence of depuration of Se in either the Se low or the Se high treatments during metamorphosis. A strikingly different pattern of accumulation and depuration occurred in V-exposed individuals. In treatments V low and V high, maximum body burdens occurred in “premetamorphs” (i.e., animals with developed forelimbs but in which tail resorption had not begun), whereas body burdens in animals having completed metamorphosis were much lower and similar to those in larvae. These results suggest that compared with Se-exposed animals, V-exposed animals were able to depurate a substantial amount of accumulated V during the metamorphic period. In an ecologic context, it appears that amphibians exposed to Se during the larval period may serve as a vector of the metal to terrestrial predators, yet potential transfer of accumulated V to predators would largely be restricted to the aquatic habitat. 3aHyla 3aamphibians 3aaquatic habitat 3afoods 3aforelimbs 3afossil fuels 3alarvae 3alipid content 3ametamorphosis 3apredators 3aresorption 3aselenium 3atail 3avanadium 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMetamorphosis, Biologicalxdrug effects 2aRanidaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSeleniumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSelenium Compoundsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSelenium Oxides 2aVanadatesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aVanadiumxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolismxtoxicity.1 aHeyes, Andrew1 aHilton, Jessica0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2011 Feb., v. 60, no. 2 p.336-342dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-010-9608-0 7aarticle01781naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012700127300001600254520075800270650002901028650001301057650001501070650001701085650000801102650002901110650002701139650001201166653003201178700001501210700001501225700001501240773009801255852000901353930003301362945001301395946001101408655001201419IND2049860720221118204528.0960214e199411  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204986072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamimura, N.10aConstruction of squalene-accumulating Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants by gene disruption through homologous recombination  ap. 353-357.  aSaccharomyces cerevisiae synthesizes ergosterol via squalene, but squalene is hardly detected in aerobically grown cells.

Indeed, the presence of nitrate has been shown to increase root hydraulic conductance in a few agricultural species characterized by high nitrate demand. Does a similar stimulation of root conductivity in response to external nitrate addition exist among wild type organisms? To answer this question, we studied and compared the effect of a sudden increase of nitrate concentration on root hydraulic properties in seven species. These included three agricultural species (Cucumis sativus L., Solanum esculentum L., Zea mays L.) and four wild type species (Arabidopsis thaliana L., Festuca arundinacea Schreb., Populus trichocarpa Torr.&Gray, Nephrolepis exaltata L.). The selected species differed in overall nitrate demand and specific nitrate uptake rates. Changes in root hydraulic conductance induced by nitrate varied from non-existent (N. exaltata L.) to more than 50% increases (Z. mays L.). The magnitude of the hydraulic response to nitrate presence was significantly correlated with species nitrate uptake rate. This finding suggests an emergent physiological trait that links together plant nitrate needs, nitrate availability and root hydraulic properties. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aZea mays 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aCucumis sativus 3aNephrolepis exaltata 3aPopulus trichocarpa 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3awater flow 3aSolanum 3aroots 3anitrates 0aRoot hydraulics 0aPopulus balsamifera subsp. trichocarpa 0aNitrate availability 0aNitrate uptake 0aRelative growth rate1 aLazor, Jillian W.1 aZwieniecka, Anna K.1 aBenway, Christopher1 aZwieniecki, Maciej A.0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Dec., v. 337, no. 1-2 p.447-455dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0540-x 7aarticle03281naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100001600158245013000174300001600304500002400320520148800344650001401832650001401846650001801860650002301878650001701901650001801918650001001936650002201946650001501968650001001983650001201993650001402005650002602019650002402045650002302069650003102092650002802123650003202151650001102183650002302194650002302217650003402240650001702274650003602291650003602327700001702363700001502380700001602395700001502411700001602426773009102442852000902533856007902542856005802621655001202679IND4381664520221118204914.0060703s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438166452DNAL7 a168163372pmid7 a10.1530/rep.1.010512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAguilar, J.10aTemporal relationship between proliferating and apoptotic hormone-producing and endothelial cells in the equine corpus luteum  ap. 111-118.  aIncludes references  aThe temporal relationship between endothelial cell death, vascular regression and the death of hormone-producing cells in the mare has not been established. To determine the dynamics of cell proliferation and death throughout the luteal phase, corpora lutea were studied at the early, mid- and late luteal phase, and after treatment with cloprostenol in the mid-luteal phase to induce premature luteolysis. Changes in cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated utilising specific markers (phosphorylated histone-3 and activated caspase-3 respectively). Histone-3 positive cells were most abundant during the early luteal phase, and were mainly present in endothelial cells. Histone-3 activity significantly increased in hormone-producing cells 36 h after cloprostenol treatment. Frequency of activated caspase-3 staining peaked on day 14, and was induced by 36 h after cloprostenol administration in mid-luteal phase. However, cell death occurred simultaneously in the endothelial and hormone-producing cells. These results show that a subset of hormone-producing cells enter the early stages of cell division around luteolysis, while the majority of cells are undergoing cell death. Natural and induced functional and structural luteal regression in the mare can be at least partially attributed to simultaneous apoptosis of endothelial and hormone-producing cells. However, there is no evidence that endothelial cell death is the trigger for naturally occurring luteolysis. 3aapoptosis 3acaspase-3 3acell division 3acell proliferation 3acloprostenol 3acorpus luteum 3adeath 3aendothelial cells 3aluteolysis 3amares 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aCaspase 3xanalysis 2aCell Proliferation 2aCloprostenolxpharmacology 2aCorpus Luteumxcytology 2aEndothelial Cellsxcytology 2aFemale 2aHistonesxanalysis 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aImmunohistochemistryxmethods 2aLuteal Phase 2aLuteolytic Agentsxpharmacology 2aNeovascularization, Physiologic1 aFraser, H.M.1 aWilson, H.1 aClutton, E.1 aShaw, D.J.1 aWatson, Ed.0 tReproduction.g2006 July, v. 132, no. 1 p.111-118dBioScientifica Ltdx1470-16267nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1530/rep.1.010513Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.srf-reproduction.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02133naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100001600136245012200152300001800274500002400292520133100316650001401647650002101661650001101682650001501693773011101708852000901819856003901828655001201867IND4397261520221118204819.0071028e20071101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439726152DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.65372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Do-Hun10aTesting a conceptual hillslope recession model based on the storage-discharge relationship with the Richards equation  ap. 3155-3161.  aIncludes references  aThe conceptual recession model based on the storage-discharge relationship was proposed to account for the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction. The recession model was formulated by combining the constitutive storage-discharge relationship with the integral balance equation for unsaturated and saturated water storage. The functional form of the constitutive storage-discharge relationship was determined from the spatial integration of the Richards equation. The performance of the recession model was tested by comparing with the solution of the Richards equation for different simulation geometric shapes and soil types. The conceptual recession model incorporating the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction was in good agreement with the recession response of the Richards equation. However, the recession model that neglected the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction was comparable to the Richards equation only for soils with the weak interaction between unsaturated water storage and saturated water storage. This result suggests the important role of the unsaturated-saturated water storage interaction in the formulation of the recession process when the derivative of the functional relationship between the unsaturated water storage and saturated water storage becomes significant. 3aequations 3amodel validation 3amodels 3asoil types0 tHydrological processes.g2007 Nov. 01, v. 21, no. 23 p.3155-3161dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0885-60877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6537 7aarticle02096naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100003100110245007000141300001600211520097500227650001501202650001501217650002501232650002501257650002201282650002101304650001501325650002301340653001101363653002101374653002401395653003701419700001401456700001401470700002101484700001701505773009801522852000901620930003301629945001301662946001101675655001201686IND2049862520221118204833.0960214e199411  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204986252DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCanizares-Villanueva, R.O.10aGrowth of Phormidium sp. in aerobic secondary piggery waste-water  ap. 487-491.  aThe potential of a cyanobacterium Phormidium sp., for the tertiary treatment of piggery wastewater chemical oxygen demand greater than or equal to 3000 mg.l-1, using an aerobically stabilized secondary effluent, was studied.

The purpose of this work was to clarify the effect of both ethanol and decanoic and dodecanoic acids on the growth and malolactic activity of a Leuconostoc oenos strain isolated from Portuguese red wine. Ethanol in concentrations up to 12% had no significant effect on malolactic activity but strongly inhibited cell growth. The fatty acids decanoic acid, in concentrations up to 12.5 mg l-1, and, dodecanoic acid up to 2.5 mg l-1 seemed to act as growth factors stimulating also malolactic activity; at higher concentrations they exerted inhibitory effect. We found clear pH dependence between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0, between decanoic acid concentration and its effect on malolactic activity, indicating that the undissociated molecule is the active form. At pH 3.0 the results can be explained by considering that fatty acids enter the cell as protonated molecules and dissociate in the cytoplasm due to the higher internal pH, leading to increased intracellular hydrogenous concentration. This may be the basis of two different effects that contribute to the observed inhibition: decrease in the intracellular pH and dissipation of the transmembrane proton gradient, thus inhibiting intracellular enzymes and delta pH-dependent transport systems. 3adodecanoic acid 3awines 3amalolactic fermentation 3apH 3amalic acid 3aLeuconostoc 3aethanol 3adecanoic acid 0afermentation1 aSan Romao, M.V.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g1994 Nov., v. 42, no. 2/3 p.391-395x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle02595naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245015600124300001600280500001500296520155300311650001301864650001801877650001201895650001601907650002001923650001501943650001901958650002001977650001601997653001802013653001202031700001402043773009802057852000902155930003302164945001302197946001102210655001202221IND2049862320221118204736.0960214e199411  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204986232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarre, S.10aPrecipitation potential as a major factor in the formation of granular sludge in an upflow sludge-blanket reactor for denitrification of drinking water  ap. 482-486.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of the chemical composition of water on granular sludge formation and characteristics in a denitrifying upflow sludge-blanket (USB) reactor were studied. Denitrification of drinking water showed different biomass sludge characteristics when the reactor was fed with groundwater as opposed to surface water. USB reactors fed with groundwater produced granules with good settling characteristics, SVI (sludge volume index) values lower than 30 ml/g, and high reactor biomass concentrations (20-25 g/l), while surface-water-fed reactors exhibited lower biomass concentrations (10-15 g/l) due to poor settling characteristics (SVI values of 50-90 ml/g). Sludge granules from the reactor fed with surface water had a low mineral content of between 10% and 20% as compared to a mineral content of 25%-50% in the groundwater reactor. The larger mineral content in the groundwater-fed reactor was due to a greater precipitation potential, i.e. higher concentrations of calcium and alkalinity present in groundwater combined with the release of alkalinity and subsequent increase in pH caused by biological denitrification. Verification for this phenomenon was established by enriching surface water with calcium and alkalinity, which increased the reactor's precipitation potential from 15 mg/l to 40 mg/l (as CaCO3). The granules obtained from the reactor fed with enriched surface water had a high mineral content of between 40% and 50% and very low SVI values, contributing to improved granule-settling characteristics and reactor stability. 3agranules 3asurface water 3acalcium 3abioreactors 3amineral content 3aalkalinity 3adrinking water 3adenitrification 3agroundwater 0aprecipitation 0asludges1 aGreen, M.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g1994 Nov., v. 42, no. 2/3 p.482-486x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL  a19960304b19960308c00000000  aINDdGHK  aNon-US 7aarticle03172naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001400156245009200170300001800262520146200280650002601742650001201768650001201780650002801792650001601820650001401836650001201850650001501862650002501877650002601902650002801928650001201956650002301968650003701991650003202028650001402060650002202074650003202096650002202128650002602150650004002176650002802216650004602244650003802290700001802328700001802346773009802364852000902462856007802471930003302549945001302582946001102595655001202606IND2055767720221118204739.0970307e199511  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205576772DNAL7 a85906512pmid7 a10.1007/BF001669172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhman, L.10aInduction of a metabolic switch in insect cells by substrate-limited fed batch cultures  ap. 1006-1013.  aInsect cell metabolism was studied in substrate-limited fed batch cultures of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf-9) cells. Results from a glucose-limited culture, a glutamine-limited culture, a culture limited in both glucose and glutamine and a batch culture were compared. A stringent relation between glucose excess and alanine formation was found. In contrast, glucose limitation induced ammonium formation, while, at the same time, alanine formation was completely suppressed. Simultaneous glucose and glutamine limitation suppressed both alanine and ammonium formation. Although the metabolism was influenced by substrate limitation, the specific growth rate was similar in all cultures. Alanine formation must involve incorporation of free ammonium, if ammonium formation is mediated by glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, as our data suggest. On the basis of the results, two possible pathways for the formation of alanine in the intermediary metabolism in insect cells are suggested. The cellular yield on glucose was increased 6.6 times during glucose limitation, independently of the cellular yield on glutamine, which was increased 50-100 times during glutamine limitation. The results indicate that alanine overflow metabolism is energetically wasteful and that glutamine is a dispensable amino acid for cultured Sf-9 cells. Preliminary data confirm that glutamine can be synthesised by the cells themselves in amounts sufficient to support growth. 3aSpodoptera frugiperda 3aalanine 3aglucose 3aglutamate dehydrogenase 3aglutaminase 3aglutamine 3ainsects 3ametabolism 3aspecific growth rate 2aAlaninexbiosynthesis 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aCell Divisionxdrug effects 2aCell Line 2aCitric Acid Cycle 2aCulture Mediaxpharmacology 2aEnergy Metabolism 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aGlutamate Dehydrogenasexmetabolism 2aGlutaminexpharmacology 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxmetabolism 2aSpodopteraxcytologyxmetabolism.1 aLjunggren, J.1 aHaggstrom, L.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g1995 Nov., v. 43, no. 6 p.1006-1013x0175-75987nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF001669173Available from publisher's Web site  a19970401b19970408c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle03404naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002600111040001800137100002400155245017000179300001800349500002400367520137400391650000901765650001201774650001601786650002401802650001001826650001201836650001301848650001601861650001701877650001901894650001001913650003701923650002601960650003001986650001202016650005002028650001402078650003002092650001102122650003802133650003002171650000902201650002502210650003202235650002802267650005502295650004502350650004902395650003602444700001802480700003002498700002302528700001702551700001402568700001602582773010802598852000902706856003902715655001202754IND4427244020221118205558.0091012e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442724402DNAL7 a192747702pmid7 a10.1002/ptr.27882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVermeersch, Marieke10aSelective antileishmania activity of 13,28-epoxy-oleanane and related triterpene saponins from the plant families Myrsinaceae, Primulaceae, Aceraceae and Icacinaceae  ap. 1404-1410.  aIncludes references  aMaesa saponins with the 13,28-epoxy-oleanane triterpene core skeleton were described recently to possess strong and selective in vitro and in vivo antileishmania activity. In the absence of direct chemical derivatization possibilities, a structure-based literature search was carried out to explore a structure-activity relationship. Crude alcohol extracts from several plant species of Myrsinaceae, Primulaceae, Aceraceae and Icacinaceae were evaluated for in vitro activity against Leishmania infantum intracellular amastigotes and cytotoxicity on MRC-5SV₂ cells, while the saponin content was evaluated qualitatively by TLC. A clear correlation was found between the presence of close analogue 13,28-epoxy-oleanane triterpene saponins and potent and selective antileishmania activity. This was most striking in Maesa species, except for M. macrosepala. Interesting activities were also found in extracts that did not exactly match the TLC characteristics of the Maesa saponin references, as was the case for Ardisia angusta, A. amherstiana, A. caudata, A. gigantifolia, A. roseiflora, Myrsine affinis, Acer brevipes and A. laurinum var. petelotii. This study indicates that the 13,28-epoxy-oleanane triterpene moiety is essential for selective antileishmania potential and that several other plant species could still be explored for antileishmania drug discovery. 3aAcer 3aArdisia 3aIcacinaceae 3aLeishmania infantum 3aMaesa 3aMyrsine 3aalcohols 3aamastigotes 3acytotoxicity 3aderivatization 3adrugs 3astructure-activity relationships 3atriterpenoid saponins 2aMagnoliopsidaxchemistry. 2aAnimals 2aAntiparasitic Agentsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aCell Line 2aFibroblastsxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLeishmania infantumxdrug effects 2aMacrophagesxparasitology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred Strains 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPrimulaceaexchemistry. 2aOleanolic Acidxanalysisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aSaponinsxanalysisxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aStructure-Activity Relationship1 aFoubert, Kenn1 aLuz, Raquel Inocêncio da1 aPuyvelde, Luc van.1 aPieters, Luc1 aCos, Paul1 aMaes, Louis0 tPhytotherapy research.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.1404-1410dJohn Wiley '' Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2788 7aarticle04448naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245015800189300001600347520212100363650002102484650002502505650007502530650002102605650004402626650002802670650002602698650003802724650002802762650001102790650005702801650001102858650002502869650002602894650001602920650002602936650003002962650001402992650003203006650003103038650003303069650003603102650002003138650001703158650001703175650002603192650004503218653001903263653002203282653002903304700002003333700002203353700002103375700002003396700001903416700001703435700002103452700002203473773011703495852000903612856008503621930003303706946001103739655001203750IND4442592520221118205139.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444259252DNAL7 a200201982pmid7 a10.1007/s10549-009-0672-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Takayuki 10aExpression pattern of stromal cell-derived factor-1 chemokine in invasive breast cancer is correlated with estrogen receptor status and patient prognosis  ap. 733-745.  aChemokine receptor CXCR4 is known to be crucially involved in tumor progression, but the role of its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), remains unclear. The present study was conducted to clarify the clinicopathological and prognostic impact of SDF-1 expression in invasive breast cancers. Expression of SDF-1 mRNA and protein was examined in five breast cancer cell lines with or without estradiol treatment. In 52 surgically resected breast cancers, the level of SDF-1 mRNA in frozen samples and the pattern of SDF-1 protein immunoreactivity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections were compared. In another cohort of 223 breast cancers, the correlation between SDF-1 immunoreactivity and clinicopathological parameters was examined using a tissue microarray. Estradiol treatment markedly increased the expression of SDF-1 mRNA and protein in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive cell lines, MCF-7 and T47D. Among the 52 resected breast cancers, those with a cytoplasmic-dominant pattern of SDF-1 expression showed higher SDF-1 mRNA levels (median 27.4) than those with a membrane-dominant or negative pattern (median 13.6, P = 0.0017). Accordingly, the cytoplasmic-dominant pattern was defined as “high SDF-1 expression,” and other patterns were defined as “low SDF-1 expression.” Among the cohort of 223 tumors, “high SDF-1 expression” was detected in 158 (70.9%) and was significantly correlated with ER positivity (P < 0.0001), HER2 negativity (P = 0.021), and lower grade (P < 0.0001). Univariate analysis demonstrated that “high SDF-1 expression” was a significant indicator of better clinical outcome in both the entire patient cohort (P = 0.017) and the 133 patients with ER-positive tumors (P = 0.036), but not in the 90 patients with ER-negative tumors. Multivariate analysis showed that SDF-1 status was an independent factor related to overall survival in patients with ER-positive tumors (P = 0.046). SDF-1 status is a significant prognostic factor and may be clinically useful for assigning adjuvant therapy to patients with ER-positive invasive breast cancers. 3abreast neoplasms 3aimmunohistochemistry 2aBreast Neoplasmsxgeneticsxmetabolismxmortalityxpathologyxtherapy. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aChemokine CXCL12xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aChi-Square Distribution 2aDisease-Free Survival 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aEstradiolxpharmacology 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Neoplasticxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aKaplan-Meier Estimate 2aMiddle Aged 2aNeoplasm Invasiveness 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPrognosis 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptor, ErbB-2xmetabolism 2aReceptors, Estrogenxmetabolism 2aRisk Assessment 2aRisk Factors 2aTime Factors 2aTissue Array Analysis 2aBiomarkers, Tumorxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aSDF-1 (CXCL12) 0aEstrogen receptor 0aEstrogen-regulated genes1 aTsuda, Hitoshi 1 aMoriya, Tomoyuki 1 aYamasaki, Tamio 1 aKikuchi, Ryoko 1 aUeda, Shigeto 1 aOmata, Jiro 1 aYamamoto, Junji 1 aMatsubara, Osamu 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2010 Oct., v. 123, no. 3 p.733-745dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-009-0672-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03053naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072000900140100001800149245013300167300001600300500002400316520175100340650001202091650002802103650001302131650001802144650002002162650001302182650002402195650001702219653002202236700001702258700001902275700001702294700001602311700001902327773011502346852000902461856008002470930003302550945002502583946001102608655001202619IND4433422420221118205136.0100302e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443342242DNAL7 a10.1038/ijo.2009.2442doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aGiugliano, G.14aThe prognostic impact of general and abdominal obesity in peripheral arterial disease [Erratum: 2010 Feb., v. 34, no. 2, p. 406]  ap. 280-286.  aIncludes references  aObjective: Obesity is an independent cardiovascular risk factor, but its prognostic role in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is not well defined. Accordingly, we assessed the impact of body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) on cardiovascular risk in a homogeneous cohort of PAD patients. Methods: BMI and WC were measured in 190 consecutive PAD patients with ABI <0.90, referred to our university hospital for intermittent claudication. The occurrence of cardiac, cerebrovascular and peripheral events was prospectively assessed. The ability to classify risk was determined by calculating the hazard ratios (HRs) and c-statistics. Results: During a median follow-up of 31.5 months, 63 patients (33.2%) had a cardiovascular event. Considered as continuous variables, both adiposity indices were significantly associated with increased cardiovascular risk, even after adjustment for possible confounding factors (HR=1.08, 95% CI 1.01-1.15, P=0.045 for BMI and HR=1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, P=0.004 for WC). When BMI and WC were included together in a fully adjusted Cox model, the significant association between BMI and cardiovascular risk disappeared (HR=0.98, 95% CI 0.88-1.10, P=0.772), whereas WC remained significantly associated with a worse outcome (HR=1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.08, P=0.033). The better discriminative ability of WC vs BMI was confirmed by the c-statistic, which was significantly higher for WC (0.63, 95% CI 0.56-0.70) than for BMI (0.56, 95% CI 0.51-0.63, P=0.038). Conclusions: Abdominal obesity and, to a lesser degree, general obesity worsen the prognosis of PAD patients independently of possible confounding factors. Weight reduction should be integrated in the active management of these patients. 3aobesity 3acardiovascular diseases 3aarteries 3aabdominal fat 3abody mass index 3apatients 3awaist circumference 3arisk factors 0adisease prognosis1 aBrevetti, G.1 aLaurenzano, E.1 aBrevetti, L.1 aLuciano, R.1 aChiariello, M.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2010 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.280-286dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2009.2443Available from publisher's Web site  a20100420b20100501c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03295naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001300171245009200184300001600276520175700292650004302049650001202092650002802104650003002132650004402162650001102206650001602217650003702233650001102270650005402281650005002335650000902385650001602394650002602410650002202436651001802458653002002476653001502496700001502511700001402526773012802540852000902668856009202677930003302769946001102802655001202813IND4441991720221118204608.0100903e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444199172DNAL7 a209200382pmid7 a10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01239.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOwen, V.10aPredictors of responders to insulin therapy at 1 year among adults with type 2 diabetes  ap. 865-870.  aBackground: The effectiveness of insulin therapy to lower blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) may depend on a variety of factors. This study aims to determine baseline parameters including body mass index (BMI) threshold that might predict responders to insulin therapy. Methods: This was a retrospective UK population-based study derived from 358 general practices electronic dataset. We included all patients with T2D, diagnosed at the age of >18 years old and who were initiated on insulin from January 2000 to December 2006. Insulin responders were defined as HbA1c <7.5% and/or HbA1c reduction by >1% at 12 months postinsulin initiation. Results: Results are expressed in mean (s.d.). A total of 6032 patients were identified. Baseline age was 63 years (11.7). In all, 61% of patients (3696) responded to insulin. At 1-year postinsulin initiation, HbA1c was significantly reduced (9.8 vs. 8.4%, p < 0.001) and weight increased (85.7 vs. 87.9 kg, p < 0.001). Using logistic regression model, older age (p < 0.001), lower BMI (p = 0.046), higher HbA1c (p < 0.001), basal-bolus insulin therapy and premixed insulin compared to basal insulin alone at baseline were independent predictors of responders to insulin. Gender and social class were not significant predictors of insulin responders. A BMI of <35.3 was derived as a cut-point for response to insulin (p = 0.038). Conclusion: Overall, insulin therapy confers significant HbA1c reduction and weight increase in patients with T2D. The responsiveness to insulin therapy however appears to depend on baseline age, BMI, HbA1c and insulin regime. Clinicians should take these factors into consideration when making a decision to initiate insulin therapy in patients with T2D. 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aobesity 2aBiomarkersxmetabolism. 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapy 2aFemale 2aForecasting 2aGlycated Hemoglobinxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aInsulinxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTreatment Outcome 0aGreat Britain 0ainsulin therapy 0aresponders1 aSeetho, I.1 aIdris, I.0 tDiabetes, obesity & metabolism.g2010 Oct., v. 12, no. 10 p.865-870dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1462-89027nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1326.2010.01239.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100903b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04628naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141072000900159100001800168245007300186300001600259500002400275520225600299650001202555650002002567650001702587650001402604650001002618650001302628650001002641650001202651650001602663650001502679650001902694650002002713650002302733650001702756650002002773650002802793650002502821650002302846650003202869650002002901650003502921650001102956650003002967650001102997650003503008650001603043650004003059650003903099650003003138650002803168650004203196650003303238650005803271650004403329650003903373653002703412653002103439653002403460700001503484700001503499700001703514700001403531700001603545773011503561852000903676856008003685930003303765945002503798946001103823655001203834IND4433422820221118204549.0100302e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443342282DNAL7 a198590762pmid7 a10.1038/ijo.2009.2272doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT3001 aGilardini, L.10aPredictors of the early impairment of renal disease in human obesity  ap. 287-294.  aIncludes references  aObjective: The mechanisms underlying the association of the increased albumin excretion rate (AER) with adiposity have yet to be clarified. We therefore investigated (1) the predictors of AER after 3 months of lifestyle intervention in a large cohort of nondiabetic obese women and (2) the relationships between AER and the adipose tissue gene expression of adipokines linked to inflammation and insulin resistance. Subjects: A total of 269 obese nondiabetic women (age 49.9 +/- 13.1 years, body mass index (BMI) 36.8 +/- 4.6 kg m-2) participated in this program. Measurements used were anthropometrics parameters, blood pressure, oral glucose tolerance test, lipids, creatinine, AER, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glomerular filtration rate at baseline and after 3 months of lifestyle intervention. At baseline, in a subgroup of 34 women, subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy was carried out for the analysis of mRNA expression levels of adiponectin, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), pentraxine 3 (PTX-3), angiotensinogen and angiotensin-converting enzyme, and a blood sample was also taken from this group for the measurement of circulating adiponectin, interleukin-6, TNF-α and PTX-3. Microalbuminuria was defined as albumin/creatinine ratio > or = 3.5 mg mmol-1. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mRNA. Results: Six percent of obese women had microalbuminuria. When dividing the whole cohort into three groups according to AER changes (decrease, stability and increase), we noted that 2 h glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR significantly decreased (P<0.05 for all) only in women who had a decrease in AER, whereas BMI and waist circumference significantly decreased in all the three groups (P<0.05). At baseline, higher AER was associated to significantly higher adipose tissue mRNA expression levels of SOCS-3 and PTX-3 (P<0.05) and to higher TNF-α and angiotensinogen expression. Conclusions: In obese women, weight loss alone is not sufficient to induce the AER decrease that occurs only with a concomitant improvement in glucose homeostasis. The adipose tissue gene expression profile seems to favor the early renal impairment often seen in obese subjects. 3aobesity 3akidney diseases 3arisk factors 3alifestyle 3awomen 3aalbumins 3aurine 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3aadipokines 3aadipose tissue 3agene expression 3ainsulin resistance 3ainflammation 3abody mass index 2aAdiponectinxmetabolism 2aAlbuminsxsecretion. 2aAlbuminuriaxurine 2aAngiotensinogenxmetabolism 2aBody Mass Index 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aFemale 2aGene Expressionxgenetics 2aHumans 2aInsulin Resistancexphysiology 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplicationsxmetabolism. 2aPeptidyl-Dipeptidase Axmetabolism 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aRisk Reduction Behavior 2aSerum Amyloid P-Componentxmetabolism 2aSubcutaneous Fatxmetabolism 2aSuppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteinsxmetabolism 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aWeight Lossxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aalbumin excretion rate 0amicroalbuminuria 0aglucose homeostasis1 aZulian, A.1 aGirola, A.1 aRedaelli, G.1 aConti, A.1 aInvitti, C.0 tInternational journal of obesity.g2010 Feb., v. 34, no. 2 p.287-294dNature Publishing Groupx0307-05657nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2009.2273Available from publisher's Web site  a20100410b20100501c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/03/18  aNon-US 7aarticle02496naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245008800184300001600272520088000288650001001168650001901178650001201197650001501209650002201224650001501246650001401261650003101275650001401306650001701320650000901337650004501346650001201391650003001403650004601433650004101479650002501520650006501545650003001610650001901640653003001659700002001689773014101709852000901850856008501859930003301944946001301977655001201990IND4442049720221118204603.0100903e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444204972DNAL7 a206582232pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-010-0089-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorreia, F.

The effects on earthworm growth, survival, and reproduction rates were verified for different exposure times. Earthworms kept in glyphosate-treated soil were classified as alive in all evaluations, but showed gradual and significant reduction in mean weight (50%) at all test concentrations. For 2,4-D, 100% mortality was observed in soil treated with 500 and 1,000 mg/kg. At 14 days, 30%-40% mortality levels were observed in all other concentrations. No cocoons or juveniles were found in soil treated with either herbicide. Glyphosate and 2,4-D demonstrated severe effects on the development and reproduction of Eisenia foetida in laboratory tests in the range of test concentrations. 3a2,4-D 3aEisenia fetida 3acocoons 3aearthworms 3aexposure duration 3aglyphosate 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory experimentation 3amortality 3areproduction 3asoil 2a2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acidxtoxicity 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aGrowth and Developmentxdrug effects 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aOligochaetaxdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSoil Pollutantsxtoxicity 2aToxicity Tests 0aTerrestrial ecotoxicology1 aMoreira, J.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally, and may have adverse consequences for the military: a worsening prevalence of obesity in young civilian adults could hinder the recruitment and maintenance of military manpower. This review explores the impact of obesity on suitability for employment in defence force careers and any potential impact on long-term occupational health. Studies containing data on obesity and the military were identified from an electronic database. Thirty-eight papers were identified and 17 were included in this review. There is a limited body of evidence available to ascertain whether or not obese individuals are suitable for employment in the military. There are a number of key issues that need to be addressed before a definitive conclusion can be drawn. These include the future health of obese personnel recruited into the military and subsequent implications for health services, costs to the organization and military readiness, and the ability of an obese person to be an active member of the military workforce. Future research should be targeted towards these areas in order to determine the implications of obesity for recruitment and retention of defence force personnel. 3aadults 3abody composition 3adatabases 3aemployment 3ahealth services 3ahuman resources 3alabor force 3along term effects 3aobesity 3aoccupational health and safety 2aHealth Status 2aHumans 2aMilitary Medicine 2aMilitary Personnel 2aObesityxcomplicationsxepidemiology. 2aPhysical Fitnessxphysiology 2aPrevalence 0amilitary 0arecruitment standards1 aWittert, G.0 tObesity reviews.g2009 Nov., v. 10, no. 6 p.693-699dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-78817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-789X.2009.00601.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091104b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01579naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245010300165300001400268520059800282650001700880650002200897653001500919653001400934700002700948700002200975700001800997773011001015852000901125856008501134930003301219946001301252655001201265IND4420602320221118205015.0090515e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442060232DNAL7 a10.1007/s11094-009-0225-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFedotov, A.

Ampelomyces quisqualis AQ10 inhibited the germination of conidia on leaves, but not on glass. Trichoderma harzianum T39 inhibited germination on both surfaces. Neither the examined biological control agents (BCAs) nor the two tested mineral oils (AddQ and JMS Stylet-Oil) affected the viability of conidia. Sulphur drastically limited the germination and viability of L. taurica. In experiments at 15-25°C, AQ10 alone reduced hyphal leaf colonisation at 25°C. T. harzianum T39 significantly reduced leaf colonisation at all temperatures but significantly reduced disease only at 20-25°C. The oils significantly reduced leaf colonisation and sulphur reduced both leaf colonisation and disease at all temperatures. Results were confirmed in an experimental greenhouse. In a field experiment, azoxystrobin, polyoxin AL, neem extract, and T39 were effective; sulphur was superior to them. Under severe epidemic conditions the disease had a negative impact on yield; late fungicide treatments at spring-time were found unnecessary. Chemical sprays applied in alternation was compared with the 'friendly' spray regime (alternation of Heliosoufre, T. harzianum T39 + JMS Stylet oil, A. quisqualis AQ10+AddQ oil and Neemgard) in two climates i.e. (i.) day warm climate and (ii.) regular (cool) day climate regimes. In the warm climate, there was no significant difference in the performance of the 'friendly' spray regime and the chemical spray regime. However, in the cooler climate, the 'friendly' spray programme was not as effective as the chemical spray programme. It was concluded that a change in the greenhouse climate may affect the development of powdery mildew and, at the same time, promote the activity of BCAs and render a pathogen more vulnerable to these control agents, allowing for better disease suppression. 3aAmpelomyces quisqualis 3aAzadirachta indica 3aCapsicum annuum 3aLeveillula taurica 3aTrichoderma harzianum 3aazoxystrobin 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclimate 3aconidia 3adisease control 3afield experimentation 3agermination 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3aoils 3apathogens 3apowdery mildew 3aspring 3asulfur 3asweet peppers 3atemperature 3aviability 0aCultural practices 0aIntegrated disease management1 aMessika, Yoel 1 aElad, Yigal 1 aRav David, Dalia 1 aSztejnberg, Abraham 0 tEuropean journal of plant pathology.g2009 June, v. 124, no. 2 p.309-329dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0929-18737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-008-9421-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090508b20090608c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02759naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245008800169300001600257520165000273650001201923650001001935650001601945650002201961653001601983653002301999653001702022653001702039653001402056700001702070700002102087700001402108773011602122852000902238856009202247930003302339946001302372655001202385IND4429215320221118204843.0091127e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442921532DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00626.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColman, J.E.10aActive land use improves reindeer pastures: evidence from a patch choice experiment  ap. 358-363.  aThe industrialization of agriculture in western societies has often led to either intensified use or abandonment of farmland and open pastures, but experimental evidence on how the dynamics of farmed ecosystems affect space use by large herbivores is limited. We experimentally manipulated farmland patches with cutting and (early summer) low- and high-intensity domestic sheep Ovis aries grazing according to traditional use in north Norway. After treatments, grazing reindeer Rangifer tarandus were exposed to the pastures the subsequent fall (2 months after treatments) and spring (11 months after treatments) as they typically do on their migratory route between summer and winter ranges. The experiment was conducted over 2 subsequent years. We predicted that sheep grazing on farmland during early summer may affect the critical fall and spring range conditions for reindeer either through negative (delayed competition) or positive (grazing facilitation) interactions. We found that the most marked effect of land use on the grazing pattern of reindeer was between no use (the control treatment) and all the other management options involving active land use. The grazing reindeer avoided the pastures no longer in use likely due to senescent plant material. There was a tendency that the lower intensity sheep grazing patches attracted more reindeer than the highest intensity use. These results highlight not only the general principle that large-scale agricultural changes may affect large herbivores in natural ecosystems, but they also increase our understanding of grazing facilitation as a mechanism in large herbivore assemblages. 3agrazing 3asheep 3aagriculture 3aRangifer tarandus 0acompetition 0acoupled ecosystems 0aencroachment 0afacilitation 0aspace use1 aMysterud, A.1 aJørgensen, N.H.1 aMoe, S.R.0 tJournal of zoology.g2009 Dec., v. 279, no. 4 p.358-363dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0952-83697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2009.00626.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245010200168300001600270520132000286650002201606653002801628653003001656653001201686700002301698700002201721700002301743773010101766852000901867856008501876930003301961946001301994655001202007IND4441876220221118204850.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444187622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10562-010-0386-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalaza, Florencia 10aKinetic Parameters for the Elementary Steps in the Palladium-Catalyzed Synthesis of Vinyl Acetate  ap. 135-142.  aThe kinetics of the reaction between gas-phase ethylene and adsorbed acetate species to form vinyl acetate monomer (VAM) on a Pd(111) surface are measured using infrared spectroscopy to monitor the rate of acetate removal, as well as the rates of VAM and ethylidyne formation, at various temperatures. The results are fit using a kinetic model first proposed by Samanos in which ethylene reacts with acetate species to form an acetoxyethyl intermediate that forms VAM via β-hydride elimination. The results of the kinetic model agree well with the experimental data and Arrhenius plots of the rate constants yield activation energies that are in good agreement with those predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT also predicts that the reaction activation energies should depend on the acetate coverage while the experimental data can be fit by constant values of the rate constants, suggesting that the reaction activation energies are similar for a reaction center surrounded either by acetate species, ethylidynes, or a combination of both. Finally, the kinetic parameters for VAM desorption are in good agreement with the experimental peak temperature measured by temperature-programmed desorption for VAM desorbing from an ethylidyne-covered surface.

The BCR has an autonomous signaling function also known as tonic signaling that allows for long-term survival of B cells in the immune system. Upon binding of antigen to the BCR, the tonic signal is amplified and diversified, leading to alteration in gene expression and B-cell activation. The spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) intimately cooperates with the signaling subunits of the BCR and plays a central role in the amplification and diversification of BCR signals. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which Syk activity is inhibited and activated at the BCR. Importantly, Syk acts not only as a kinase that phosphorylates downstream substrates but also as an adapter that can bind to a diverse set of signaling proteins. Depending on its interactions and localization, Syk can signal opposing cell fate decisions such as proliferation or differentiation of B cells. 3aprotein kinases 2aAdaptor Proteins, Signal Transducingximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aB-Lymphocytesxcytologyximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aCell Differentiation 2aCell Proliferation 2aHomeostasis 2aHumans 2aIntracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aProtein Multimerizationximmunology 2aProtein Subunitsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aProtein-Tyrosine Kinasesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Antigen, B-Cellximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transductionximmunology 0aadapters 0alymphocyte signaling 0apre-B-cell receptor signaling 0aautoinhibition 0aimmunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif1 aGrothe, Gesina1 aReth, Michael0 tImmunological reviews.g2009 Nov., v. 232, no. 1 p.286-299dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-065X.2009.00837.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091023b20091106c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02788naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003200145245017200177300001600349520163700365650003502002650003002037653002202067653003702089653002202126700001902148700001702167700002202184773011802206852000902324856008502333930003302418946001102451655001202462IND4444668820221118205401.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444466882DNAL7 a10.1007/s11010-010-0583-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChaturvedi, Nagendra Kumar 10aEndocrine disruptors provoke differential modulatory responses on androgen receptor and pregnane and xenobiotic receptor: potential implications in metabolic disorders  ap. 291-308.  aA systematic comparison of the impact of some potential endocrine disruptors (EDs) on modulation of androgen receptor (AR) and pregnane and xenobiotic receptor (PXR) function was conducted in a multi-step analysis. Promoter-reporter-based transcription assays were performed in conjunction with receptor dynamic studies in living cells that helped implicating the suspected EDs for their deleterious effects. We demonstrate that most of the selected EDs not only inhibit AR transcriptional activity, but also alter its subcellular dynamics. Conversely, some of these anti-androgenic compounds were potent activator of xeno-sensing nuclear receptor, PXR. Interestingly, agonist-activated AR that associates with the mitotic chromatin fails to achieve this association when bound to anti-androgenic EDs. Conclusively, most EDs (except BCH) behaved like pure antagonist for AR while as agonist for PXR. Subsequent experiments with DDT treatment in mice model indicated that in testis AR and its regulated genes PEM and ODC levels are down-regulated, whereas in liver of same mice PEM is up-regulated while AR and ODC remain unchanged. On the contrary, PXR and its regulated genes CYP3A11 and MDR1 levels in mice liver were up-regulated while in testis PXR remained unchanged, CYP3A11 up-regulated and MDR1 were down-regulated. Based on a novel “Biopit” concept it is speculated that long-term exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals may influence the epigenetic profile of target cells via transcription factors thereby making them vulnerable to onset of chemically induced endocrine-related malignancies or metabolic disorders. 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3agreen fluorescent protein 0aAndrogen receptor 0aPregnane and xenobiotic receptor 0aMitotic chromatin1 aKumar, Sanjay 1 aNegi, Seema 1 aTyagi, Rakesh K. 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2010 Dec., v. 345, no. 1-2 p.291-308dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0583-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20101105b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01941naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245006800174300001800242520093700260650001901197653002401216653001501240653002001255653002301275653002901298700001601327700002001343773010701363852000901470856009201479930003301571946001101604655001201615IND4422668020221118205406.0090703e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442266802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1368-423X.2009.00280.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelgado, MiguelA.10aDistribution-free specification tests for dynamic linear models  ap. S105-S134.  aThis article proposes goodness-of-fit tests for dynamic regression models, where regressors are allowed to be only weakly exogenous and arbitrarily correlated with past shocks. The null hypothesis is stated in terms of the lack of serial correlation of the errors of the model. The tests are based on a linear transformation of a Bartlett's [graphic removed] -process of the residuals. This transformation approximates the martingale component of the process so that it converges weakly to the standard Brownian motion under the null hypothesis. One feature of our setup is that we do not require to specify the dynamic structure of the regressors. Due to this, the transformation employs a semi-parametric correction that does not restrict the class of local alternatives that our tests can detect, in contrast with other works using smoothing techniques. A Monte Carlo study illustrates the finite sample performance of the tests. 3adynamic models 0aEmpirical processes 0aExogeneity 0aGoodness-of-fit 0aLocal alternatives 0aMartingale decomposition1 aHidalgo, J.1 aVelasco, Carlos0 tEconometrics journal.g2009 Jan., v. 12, no. s1 p.S105-S134dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1368-42217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1368-423X.2009.00280.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01950naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100004000145245006400185300001600249520090100265650001301166653002501179653001701204653002301221700001901244700002001263700002401283700002401307700002501331773011801356852000901474856008501483930003301568946001101601655001201612IND4446881620221118205035.0101224e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444688162DNAL7 a10.2478/s11536-010-0052-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelickovic-Radovanovic, Radmila M. 10aAcute renal failure after licorice ingestion: A case report  ap. 113-116.  aA 39-year-old female presented to the nephrology clinic emergency department with a complaint of muscle weakness and stomach pain.

As cereulide poses a health risk to humans, the development of an appropriate method for the analysis of this toxin is mandatory. Therefore, the reference material of cereulide as well as its 13C6-isotopologue was prepared by means of a biosynthetic approach using a B. cereus culture, followed by a rapid but efficient downstream purification. After structure confirmation by means of liquid chromatography (LC)−time-of-flight mass spectrometry, LC−tandem mass spectrometry, and one-/two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, a stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was developed for the quantification of cereulide in foods using the 13C6-cereulide as the internal standard. Validation experiments were performed, and the data were compared to the quantitative analysis using the structurally related valinomycin instead of the 13C6-cereulide as an internal standard. Trueness, repeatability, and reproducibility expressed as relative standard deviation showed values <10 or <8% for valinomycin or <8% for 13C6-cereulide, respectively. Furthermore, the MS response of the valinomycin was found to be significantly influenced by the food matrix, thus leading to rather low recovery rates of 91% from boiled rice and 80% from boiled rice supplemented with 10% sunflower oil. In comparison, the use of 13C6-cereulide as an internal standard gave good recovery rates of 104 and 111% from both matrices, thus demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of the developed SIDA. 3abiosynthesis 3aquantitative analysis 3afood analysis 3afood contamination 3afood pathogens 3afoodborne illness 3atoxins 3aBacillus cereus 3afood composition 3aproduct development 3astable isotopes 2aBacillus cereusxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aBacterial Toxinsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aCarbon Isotopesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDepsipeptidesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aIsotope Labelingxmethods 0astable isotope dilution analysis 0acereulide 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aStark, Timo1 aHofmann, Thomas1 aEhling-Schulz, Monika0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1420–1428-1420–1428dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf90330463Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle03236naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002100183245019400204300002000398500002400418500001500442520114600457650001801603650002601621650001701647650001501664650002301679650002101702650001701723650002001740650002401760650002201784650002301806650001201829650003701841650001101878650002901889650006401918650002001982650007502002650002802077650005602105653001602161653001602177700002202193700001902215700002202234700002102256773017602277852000902453856007702462930003302539945002502572946001302597655001202610IND4433444020221118210258.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344402DNAL7 a200780662pmid7 a10.1021/jf903362v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ201 0aT300 0aX3801 aSegura, Pedro A.10aHigh-Throughput Quantitation of Seven Sulfonamide Residues in Dairy Milk using Laser Diode Thermal Desorption-Negative Mode Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry  ap. 1442–1446.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSulfonamides are antibiotic compounds widely used in the dairy industry. Their presence in diary milk poses a risk to public health and may also contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Sulfonamide residues in dairy milk were quantified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) using a novel ionization source based on laser diode thermal desorption-negative mode atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (LDTD-APCI(−)). Seven sulfonamides spiked in milk were extracted with acetonitrile, which yielded high recoveries (77.5−101.5%). Calibration curves in the matrix showed good linearity (0.9977 >or= R2 >or= 0.9658) over the dynamic range (1.6−500 μg L−1), and limits of quantitation were between 2 and 14 μg L−1, lower than or of the same magnitude as maximum residue criteria set by several regulatory agencies (10−100 ng L−1). In addition, the run time using the LDTD-MS/MS system was 30 s per sample, as compared to actual methods running from 7 to 84 min for the same sulfonamide residue compounds, which gave the method the high screening throughput capacity necessary for monitoring milk production. 3amilk analysis 3aquantitative analysis 3asulfonamides 3aionization 3afood contamination 3amilk composition 3amilk quality 3aquality control 3aantibiotic residues 3amass spectrometry 3aproduct evaluation 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxchemistry 2aCattle 2aDrug Residuesxchemistry 2aHigh-Throughput Screening Assaysxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aMilkxchemistry 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionizationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aSulfonamidesxchemistry 2aTandem Mass Spectrometryxinstrumentationxmethods. 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aTremblay, Patrice1 aPicard, Pierre1 aGagnon, Christian1 aSauve, Sebastien0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1442–1446-1442–1446dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903362v3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle02899naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153072000900162100002400171245006300195300001600258500002400274500002300298520131800321650001601639650001401655650001301669650002001682650001401702650002201716650001601738650002701754650001401781650001601795650003201811650002301843651001401866651001901880653002301899700001801922700002301940700001901963700002301982700002402005700001902029773013202048852000902180856007502189930003302264945002502297946001102322655001202333IND4433458120221118210711.0100305e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443345812DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-1902doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK120 0aF600 0aJ500 0aK2501 aAlbaugh, Timothy J.10aLeaf area duration in natural range and exotic Pinus taeda  ap. 224-234.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aExotic Pinus taeda L. plantations may be more productive than native ones. Several hypotheses may explain this difference; however, process models with a light-interception-driving variable cannot test these hypotheses without foliage display first being quantified in native and exotic trees. We quantified leaf area duration in North Carolina, USA (natural), and Gobernador Virasoro, Argentina (exotic), with no additional nutrients and optimum fertilizer treatments. More (60%–100%) foliage was displayed but for a shorter (approximately 86 fewer days) time per fascicle in the exotics than in the naturals. Study inference was limited, with only one native and one exotic site. However, while the sites were markedly different in soils, climate, resource availability, and genetics, and we observed significant differences in fascicle display and longevity, most fascicles at both sites survived two growing seasons: the one in which they were produced and the subsequent one. This robust finding indicates it would be reasonable to use two growing seasons for fascicle longevity in process modeling to test hypotheses explaining growth differences in native and exotic loblolly. Fertilization had no effect on any exotic tree parameter, but it increased natural tree fascicle number (24%) and length (30%). 3aPinus taeda 3aleaf area 3aduration 3aconifer needles 3alongevity 3aintroduced plants 3afertilizers 3afertilizer application 3aequations 3atree growth 3atree and stand measurements 3aindigenous species 3aArgentina 3aNorth Carolina 0afascicle longevity1 aAllen, H.

The coding regions of AmLMWm1, AcLMWm1, AcLMWm2 and AcLMWm3 were 1,092, 1,119, 912 and 936 bp in length, encoding 39,168, 40,297, 31,961 and 33,396 Da LMW-GS, respectively. In order to confirm their authenticity, these LMW-GS genes were successfully expressed in E.coli. The four novel genes belong to LMW-m types and, according to the first and seventh cysteine positions, were further classified as types III, I, IV and V, respectively. Among these novel genes, AmLMWm1 and AcLMWm1 possessed a longer repetitive domain (20 and 22 repeats) than common LMW-GS genes, which was considered to be associated with good dough quality of wheat. Phylogenetic analysis showed C and D genomes of Aegilops involved in this study had LMW-GS loci similar to those of the A, B, and D genomes in common wheat. 3aAegilops cylindrica 3aAegilops markgrafii 3aDNA 3acysteine 3adough quality 3agenes 3aglutenins 3aloci 3amolecular weight 3aphylogeny 3awheat 0aLow-molecular-weight1 aLi, Ru 1 aZhou, Ruiyang 1 aE, Zhiguo 1 aHe, Guangyuan 0 tGenetic resources and crop evolution.g2010 Aug., v. 57, no. 6 p.881-890dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0925-98647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10722-009-9527-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03190naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001400174245016300188300002000351500002400371520128300395650001801678650002101696650000901717650001001726650001701736650002201753650001901775650002201794650002701816650003101843650002101874650002001895650001501915650001601930650002601946650002801972650002602000650004402026650006702070650004402137653001702181700001602198700001602214700002002230700001702250773017602267852000902443856007702452930003302529945002502562946001302587655001202600IND4433450520221118210445.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443345052DNAL7 a200506872pmid7 a10.1021/jf902676y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ2041 aJiao, Zhe10aUnintended Compositional Changes in Transgenic Rice Seeds (Oryza sativa L.)

Three kinds of transgenic rice with resistance to fungal diseases or insect pests were comparatively studied with the nontransgenic counterparts in terms of key nutrients such as protein, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, elements, and antinutrient phytic acid recommended by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The compositional profiles were discriminated by chemometrics methods, and the discriminatory compounds were protein, three amino acids, two fatty acids, two vitamins, and several elements. Significance of differences for these compounds was proved by analysis of variance, and the variation extent ranged from 20 to 74% for amino acids, from 19 to 38% for fatty acids, from 25 to 57% for vitamins, from 20 to 50% for elements, and 25% for protein, whereas phytic acid content did not change significantly. The unintended compositional alterations as well as unintended change of physical characteristic in transgenic rice compared with nontransgenic rice might be related to the genetic transformation, the effect of which needs to be elucidated by additional studies. 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3arice 3aseeds 3aOryza sativa 3aspectral analysis 3achromatography 3atransgenic plants 3agenetic transformation 3agenetically modified foods 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3atransgenes 3afood safety 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aChromatographyxmethods 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aOryzaxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0achemometrics1 aSi, Xiao-xi1 aLi, Gong-ke1 aZhang, Zhuo-min1 aXu, Xin-ping0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1746–1754-1746–1754dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf902676y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle03043naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002000183245006400203300002000267500002400287520159700311650002301908650001801931650002101949650001601970650002001986650002302006650001702029650002002046650001602066650002602082650002202108650002702130650002402157700002102181700002602202773017602228852000902404856007702413930003302490945002502523946001302548655001202561IND4433449020221118210509.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344902DNAL7 a200780672pmid7 a10.1021/jf903378x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ110 0aQ200 0aQ5001 aZamora, Rosario10aModel Reactions of Acrylamide with Selected Amino Compounds  ap. 1708–1713.  aIncludes references  aThe reaction of acrylamide with amines, amino acids, and polypeptides was studied in an attempt to understand the role of amino compounds on acrylamide fate. The obtained results showed that amino compounds are added to acrylamide by means of a Michael addition to produce the corresponding 3-(alkylamino)propionamides. Although 3-(alkylamino)propionamides can also be added to a new molecule of acrylamide to produce a new adduct, this last adduct was not detected under the employed conditions in which the concentration of acrylamide was much lower than the concentration of the amino compounds. The produced 3-(alkylamino)propionamides were not stable, and the addition reaction was easily reversed by heating. Thus, acrylamide was produced from 3-(alkylamino)propionamides by means of an elimination reaction. However, the activation energies (Ea) of both reactions are not the same. In fact, acrylamide seems to be converted into its Michael adduct with a lower activation energy than the elimination reaction of the Michael adduct. For this reason, when acrylamide was stored in the presence of glycine at 60 °C, acrylamide disappeared after 14 days. However, when these samples were heated again for 20 min at 180 °C, the equilibrium was reestablished and a significant amount of acrylamide was detected. All of these results suggest that amino compounds may play a significant role in the changes observed in acrylamide content in foods upon storage. In addition, they also point to 3-(alkylamino)propionamides as possible compounds in which acrylamide might be potentially hidden. 3amodel food systems 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aacrylamides 3aamino compounds 3achemical reactions 3afood storage 3astorage quality 3afood safety 2aAcrylamidexchemistry 2aAminesxchemistry 2aAmino Acidsxchemistry 2aPeptidesxchemistry1 aDelgado, Rosa M.1 aHidalgo, Francisco J.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1708–1713-1708–1713dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903378x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle03952naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174072000900183072000900192100001600201245017500217300002000392500002400412520156000436650001501996650001702011650002802028650001502056650002502071650002902096650002702125650001502152650002602167650002102193650002102214650002002235650001802255650002102273650007602294650007502370650006702445650003202512650005402544650004102598650001702639650003002656650001302686650002702699653001202726653002602738700002002764700002002784700001902804700002002823700002002843700001902863700001502882773017602897852000903073856007703082930003303159945002503192946001303217655001203230IND4433449220221118210450.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344922DNAL7 a200005752pmid7 a10.1021/jf903493b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ120 0aQ500 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aHe, Xinlong10aCombined Effects of Probiotic Fermentation and High-Pressure Extraction on the Antioxidant, Antimicrobial, and Antimutagenic Activities of Deodeok (Codonopsis lanceolata)  ap. 1719–1725.  aIncludes references  aThis study was designed to evaluate the combined effects of probiotic fermentation and high-pressure extraction (HPE) on the functional properties of Codonopsis lanceolata. The ground C. lanceolata samples were anaerobically fermented with Lactobacillus acidophilus ADH, Bifidobacterium longum B6, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, or Lactobacillus paracasei at 37 °C for 10 days and subjected to 500 MPa at 50 °C for 30 min. The extraction yields of C. lanceolata samples were noticeably increased to 29−32% by HPE. The B. longum-fermented C. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (BLF-HPE) exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity (MIC < 14 mg/mL) against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella boydii, and Salmonella typhimurium. The nonfermented C. lanceolata samples extracted with high pressure (NF-HPE) had the highest total phenolic content (13.3 mg of GAE/g). The lowest effective concentrations (EC50 and EC0.5) were 4.55 and 1.76 mg/mL, respectively, for NF-HPE extracts, indicating its highest antioxidant activity. The BLF-HPE and L. rhamnosus-fermented C. lanceolata samples extracted by high pressure (LRF-HPE) exhibited the highest antimutagenic activities in S. typhimurium TA 100, which were 82 and 83% inhibition, respectively. The use of probiotic fermentation and HPE can produce more biologically active compounds in C. lanceolata than the conventional solvent extraction method. The results provide pharmaceutically useful information for improving biological properties and an approach to drug discovery. 3aprobiotics 3afermentation 3ahigh pressure treatment 3aextraction 3aantioxidant activity 3aantimicrobial properties 3aantimutagenic activity 3aCodonopsis 3afunctional properties 3amedicinal plants 3afunctional foods 3afermented foods 3afood analysis 3afood composition 2aAnti-Infective Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAntimutagenic Agentsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aBifidobacteriumxmetabolism 2aChemical Fractionationxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aCodonopsisxchemistryxmicrobiology. 2aFermentation 2aLactobacillusxmetabolism 2aPressure 2aProbioticsxmetabolism 0adeodeok 0aCodonopsis lanceolata1 aKim, Seung-Seop1 aPark, Sung Jin.1 aSeong, Dong-Ho1 aYoon, Won-Byong1 aLee, Hyeon-Yong1 aPark, Dong-Sik1 aAhn, Juhee0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1719–1725-1719–1725dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903493b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/19  aOther US 7aarticle02009naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013500163300001500298500002400313520077600337650001101113650001401124650001701138650001001155650001601165650001601181650001501197650002501212650001401237650001501251650001901266650001801285650002201303651001001325700002201335700001901357700001701376700001801393773010701411852000901518856004801527655001201575IND4418395020221118210739.0090327e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441839502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-009-0146-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUchida, Keiko10aMorphological and molecular characterization of Oidium subgenus Reticuloidium (powdery mildew) newly occurred on cucumber in Japan  ap. 92-100.  aIncludes references  aIn 2002, a powdery mildew with catenate conidia lacking fibrosin bodies was found on cucumber in a greenhouse in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. Morphological observation revealed that the fungus belongs to Oidium subgenus Reticuloidium, anamorph of the genus Golovinomyces. Molecular phylogenetic analyses of the nucleotide sequences of the rDNA ITS regions and D1/D2 domains of the 28S rDNA indicated that the fungus belongs to the clade of G. orontii with other Golovinomyces fungi from a wide range of host plants, suggesting that the fungus was newly transported from abroad. Because there has been no prior report of cucumber powdery mildew caused by Reticuloidium, further research on the physiology, epidemiology, control and resistant cucumber varieties is required. 3aOidium 3acucumbers 3aepidemiology 3afungi 3agreenhouses 3ahost plants 3ahost range 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3aphysiology 3apowdery mildew 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3aJapan1 aTakamatsu, Susumu1 aMatsuda, Sanae1 aSo, Kazuhiro1 aSatō, Yukio.0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2009 Apr., v. 75, no. 2 p.92-100dSpringer Japanx1345-26307nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-009-0146-4 7aarticle03036naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013500166300001600301520169800317592002802015650001502043650002102058650002602079650001802105650002402123650002502147650002802172650001602200650001002216650002202226650002502248650001602273650001302289650001502302650001302317650001402330650001202344650001002356700002202366700002402388773010902412856004802521852000902569655001202578IND4434684920221118210624.0120726e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443468492DNAL7 a10.1007/s10327-009-0216-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarzgar, ʻAlī,10aComparison of the minor coat protein gene sequences of aphid-transmissible and -nontransmissible isolates of Citrus tristeza virus  ap. 143-151.  aThe nucleotide sequences for the minor coat protein (CPm) gene and its deduced amino acid sequences for two aphid-transmissible and two nontransmissible isolates of Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) from symptomless orchard trees of Miyagawa satsuma [Citrus unshiu (Macf.) Marc.] on trifoliate orange [Poncirus trifoliate (L.) Raf.] and declining Washington navel [C. sinensis (L.) Osb.] trees on sour orange (C. aurantium L.) rootstocks were analyzed and compared with those of highly transmissible CTV strains available in GenBank. The isolates produced severe symptoms on indicator plants and their aphid transmissibility was assayed through acquisition by A. gossypii of CTV and subsequent inoculation feeding on young Mexican lime seedlings. The CPm gene nucleotides and coded amino acid sequences were very similar among the nontransmissible isolates and among the transmissible. Five of 73 nucleotide substitutions that existed between CPm gene nucleotide sequence of nontransmissible and transmissible isolates caused changes in the deduced amino acid sequences of the nontransmissible isolates. Two nucleotide substitutions yielded new amino acids with similar properties. However, the three remaining mutations led to substitution of new amino acids with a different charge and polarity at positions 14, 238 and 239. The last two mutations occurred at the C-terminal region of the CPm, which is implicated in the formation of a salt bridge that helps to maintain the proteinâs tertiary structure. Amino acid substitutions can affect aphid transmission efficiency by altering the conformation of the proteins or masking motifs involved in the interaction between CPm and aphid stylets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aCitrus aurantium 3aCitrus tristeza virus 3aCitrus unshiu 3aPoncirus trifoliata 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acid substitution 3aamino acids 3agenes 3aindicator species 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleotides 3aproteins 3arootstocks 3asatsumas 3aseedlings 3astylets 3atrees1 aRahimian, Heshmat1 aHashemi Sohi, Haleh0 tJournal of general plant pathology.g2010 Apr., v. 76, no. 2 p.143-151dSpringer-Verlagx1345-26307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10327-009-0216-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02954naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135072000900144072000900153100001700162245008100179300001600260500002400276500002300300520142000323650001801743650001801761650002301779650002401802650001101826650001301837650001101850650001401861650002401875650002101899650001601920650001401936650002101950650002301971650002701994650002202021650001902043650002002062653002602082700001902108773013202127852000902259856007502268930003302343945002502376946001102401655001202412IND4433460420221118210655.0100305e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443346042DNAL7 a10.1139/X09-1992doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aK001 0aX1001 aCorrigan, C.10aInfluence of moisture and freeze–thaw on leaf microbial community dynamics  ap. 394-400.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aIn forest ecosystems, litterfall that collects in trapping devices, to quantify organic matter and nutrient inputs, is exposed to periods of wetting, drying, freezing, and thawing. These fluctuating environmental conditions may influence the microbial community structure inhabiting the leaves and may result in the loss of mobile nutrients, leading to an underestimation of actual organic matter and nutrient inputs. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the influence of (i) different quantities of moisture (LOW = 30 mm, MED = 60 mm, HI = 100 mm) and (ii) freeze–thaw (FT) on leaf (sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.), American basswood (Tilia americana L.), and American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.)) microbial activity and community structure. There was a significantly greater (p < 0.05) CO2 production rate in LOW and FT treatments for sugar maple and beech, and in HI and FT treatments for basswood. A similar trend occurred for leaf nitrogen concentration but not for carbon (C). Utilization of C substrates was up to 10% greater in the FT treatments. Principal components analysis on the activity of C source utilization showed a distinct clustering between leaf species and between treatments following a pattern similar to that of microbial respiration. Results from this study suggested that the collection of litter should take place more frequently during seasons when frost is imminent. 3awater content 3aforest litter 3amicrobial activity 3acommunity structure 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3acarbon 3anutrients 3asoil organic matter 3asoil respiration 3adegradation 3aequations 3aorganic horizons 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3aFagus grandifolia 3aAcer saccharum 3aTilia americana 0amicrobial respiration1 aOelbermann, M.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g2010 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.394-400dNational Research Council of Canadax0045-50677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X09-1993Available from publisher's Web site  a20100309b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/09  aNon-US 7aarticle02464naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002000174245007700194300002000271500002400291500001500315520080700330650002801137650001801165650002401183650001601207650002001223650002601243650002101269650002901290650003501319650005301354650004201407650005501449650004001504653001801544653001601562653002601578700002101604773017601625852000901801856007701810930003301887945002501920946001301945655001201958IND4433447920221118205823.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344792DNAL7 a200589232pmid7 a10.1021/jf903521b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ5001 aDemir, Ayhan S.10aChemoenzymatic Conversion of Linoleic Acid into Conjugated Linoleic Acid  ap. 1646–1652.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn efficient chemoenzymatic method for preparing conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) using free linoleic acid (LA) as a substrate is described. In the first step, LA was transformed into 10-hydroxy-cis-12-octadecenoic acid (HA) by the whole cells of Lactobacillus plantarum after 48 h of incubation. The preincubation of whole cells with 0.03% LA resulted in a better yield of HA (480 mg/g) compared to cells grown without LA. In a second fast microwave step, HA was converted to cis-9,trans-11-octadecadienoic acid in the presence of iodine as a catalyst over a silica gel surface. The advantage of this method in preparing cis-9,trans-11 CLA is simple via the whole cell bioconversion of LA into HA via L. plantarum followed by the fast microwave-assisted synthesis of cis-9,trans-11 CLA in higher yields. 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3aenzymatic treatment 3amethodology 3afood processing 3aequipment performance 3afood composition 3aconjugated linoleic acid 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aLactobacillus plantarumxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aLinoleic Acidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLinoleic Acids, Conjugatedxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aOleic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 0alinoleic acid 0anew methods 0achemoenzymatic method1 aTalpur, Farah N.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1646–1652-1646–1652dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903521b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle04117naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002000183245011200203300002000315500002400335500001500359520179900374650002102173650001802194650002302212650002202235650002602257650001802283650002202301650001602323650000902339650002502348650002102373650002402394650001202418650005702430650002502487650003902512650000902551650003502560650001902595650006302614650000902677650001702686650003702703653001902740700002102759700002102780700002302801700001802824700002202842700002002864700002002884700001502904700002002919700002102939700002602960700001902986700002103005773017603026852000903202856007703211930003303288945002503321946001303346655001203359IND4433448320221118205813.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344832DNAL7 a200588642pmid7 a10.1021/jf903710y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aT300 0aX3801 aPalikova, Irena10aLong-Term Effects of Three Commercial Cranberry Products on the Antioxidative Status in Rats: A Pilot Study  ap. 1672–1678.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. Ericaceae) fruits and juice are widely used for their antiadherence and antioxidative properties. Little is known however about their effects on clinical chemistry markers after long-term consumption. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three commercial cranberry products, NUTRICRAN90S, HI-PAC 4.0, and PACRAN on the antioxidative status of rodents, divided into three experimental groups. The products were given as dietary admixtures (1500 mg of product/kg of stock feed) for 14 weeks to male Wistar rats (Groups 2-4) and a control Group 1 which received only stock feed. There were no significant cranberry treatment-related effects on oxidative stress parameters, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, glutathione transferase, superoxide dismutase, total antioxidant capacity, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, advanced oxidation protein products, total SH-groups, or any other measured clinical chemistry markers. Hematological parameters, body weight, and food consumption were also unaffected by intake of cranberries. Only liver glutathione reductase activity and glutathione levels were significantly lower in Group 4 than in Group 1. Plasma alkaline phosphatase alone was significantly decreased in Group 2. No gross pathology, effects on organ weights, or histopathology were observed. No genotoxicity was found, and total cytochrome P450 level in liver was unaffected in all groups. The levels of hippuric acid and several phenolic acids were significantly increased in plasma and urine in Groups 2-4. The concentration of anthocyanins was under the detection threshold. The dietary addition of cranberry powders for 14 weeks was well tolerated, but it did not improve the antioxidative status in rats. 3afunctional foods 3afood analysis 3aexperimental diets 3along term effects 3aVaccinium macrocarpon 3aanimal models 3afruit composition 3acranberries 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3aoxidative stress 3adietary supplements 2aAnimals 2aAntioxidantsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPilot Projects 2aPlant Preparationsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aVaccinium macrocarponxchemistry 0afruit products1 aVostalova, Jitka1 aZdarilova, Adela1 aSvobodová, Alena.1 aKosina, Pavel1 aVecera, Rostislav1 aStejskal, David1 aProskova, Jitka1 aHrbac, Jan1 aBednář, Petr.1 aMaier, Vitezslav1 aCernochova, Drahomira1 aSimanek, Vilim1 aUlrichova, Jitka0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1672–1678-1672–1678dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903710y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100601b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle03294naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100001700183245014500200300002000345500002400365520120800389650001701597650001301614650002501627650001701652650001601669650002201685650002301707650001501730650002001745650002001765650002101785650001701806650004201823650001201865650001401877650002401891650002401915650005501939650000901994650003302003650003102036650002502067650003902092653001602131653001802147653002702165700001702192700002102209700001902230700001902249700001902268773017602287852000902463856007702472930003302549945002502582946001302607655001202620IND4433445520221118205816.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344552DNAL7 a200672882pmid7 a10.1021/jf903432b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ124 0aT300 0aX3801 aPark, Sunmin10aGlyceollins, One of the Phytoalexins Derived from Soybeans under Fungal Stress, Enhance Insulin Sensitivity and Exert Insulinotropic Actions  ap. 1551–1557.  aIncludes references  aGlyceollins are a category of phytoalexins that are produced by soybeans under fungal stress, but their effects on glucose homeostasis remain unknown. We hypothesized that glyceollins play an important role in glucose homeostasis by regulating glucose utilization in adipocytes and improving β-cell function and survival. Glyceollins improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist. They decreased triacylglycerol accumulation in adipocytes. In addition, glyceollins slightly improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion without palmitate treatment in Min6 cells, and they potentiated insulinotropic actions when 500 μM palmitate was used to induce β-cell dysfunction. This was associated with decreased β-cell apoptosis because of the attenuation of endoplasmic reticulum stress, as determined by mRNA levels of XBP-1, ATF-4, ATF-6, and CHOP. Glyceollins also potentiated GLP-1 secretion to enhance insulinotropic actions in enteroendocrine cells. In conclusion, glyceollins help normalize glucose homeostasis by potentiating β-cell function and survival and improving glucose utilization in adipocytes. 3aphytoalexins 3asoybeans 3aRhizopus microsporus 3aplant stress 3ahomeostasis 3aglucose tolerance 3ainsulin resistance 3aadipocytes 3aplant estrogens 3afermented foods 3afunctional foods 2a3T3-L1 Cells 2aAdipocytesxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aInsulinxmetabolism 2aInsulin-Secreting Cellsxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMice 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacology 2aPterocarpansxpharmacology 2aRhizopusxphysiology 2aSoybeansxchemistryxmicrobiology. 0aglyceollins 0afungal stress 0ainsulinotropic actions1 aAhn, Il Sung1 aKim, Chong-hwan.1 aLee, Mee Ryung1 aKim, Jong Sang1 aKim, Hyo-jung.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1551–1557-1551–1557dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903432b3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle02727naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001800174245007900192300002000271500002400291500001500315520086000330650002501190650001801215650002501233650001401258650002001272650002101292650002201313650004701335650002201382650004501404650003901449650003601488650003901524653004201563653001701605653001401622700001401636700001801650700001401668700001901682700001501701700001701716700001801733700002101751700002001772773017601792852000901968856007701977930003302054945002502087946001302112655001202125IND4433445920221118210126.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344592DNAL7 a200506842pmid7 a10.1021/jf903434h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF833 0aS2001 aYan, Xiao-Hui10aAnti-Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV) Quassinoids from Brucea javanica (L.)

Individual phenolic compounds, including phenolic acids, flavan-3-ols, flavones, and anthocyanins, were further quantitatively investigated by HPLC. Cellular antioxidant activities (CAA) and peroxyl radical scavenging capacity (PRSC) were evaluated by fluorescence microplate reader. Cultivar Morton exhibited the highest individual flavan-3-ols (catechin and epicatechin) and total flavonoids, as well as the highest antioxidant properties (PRSC and CAA) among all lentils tested. Five phenolic acids of the benzoic types and their derivates (gallic, protocatechuic, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and protocatechualdehyde) and four phenolic acids of the cinnamic type (chlorogenic, p-coumaric, m-coumaric, and sinapic acid) were detected in all lentil cultivars. Two flavan-3-ols [(+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin] and one flavone (luteolin) were detected in all lentil cultivars. Among all phenolic compounds detected, sinapic acid was the predominant phenolic acid, and (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin were the predominant flavonoids. These results showed that different phenotype lentils possessed considerable variations in their individual phenolic compounds, as well as chemical and cellular antioxidant activities. Caffeic acid, catechin, epicatechin, and total flavonoids significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with peroxyl radical scavenging assay. Cellular antioxidant assay significantly correlated with chemical antioxidant assay ORAC. The results from this study could be very interesting for breeding programs to improve lentils for use as functional foods. 3afunctional foods 3acultivars 3afood analysis 3aphenotype 3afood composition 3aflavonoids 3aantioxidant activity 3aLens culinaris 3alentils 3aphenolic compounds 2aAntioxidantsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferationxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aLens Plantxchemistry 2aPhenolsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aphysicochemical properties1 aChang, Sam K.C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1509–1517-1509–1517dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903532y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle03476naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165072000900174100002200183245014600205300002000351500002400371500001500395520099700410650001301407650002901420650001801449650001801467650001701485650001101502650001001513650001901523650001701542650002801559650001801587650001901605650002501624650001201649650002201661650001501683650002701698650001101725650004701736650008201783650003501865650000901900650001701909650005901926650007301985650007202058650002202130650002102152653002502173653002402198653002002222653002602242653001302268700001702281700001702298700001602315700002002331700002202351773017602373852000902549856007702558930003302635945002502668946001302693655001202706IND4433444820221118210222.0100304e20100210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443344482DNAL7 a200780722pmid7 a10.1021/jf903573g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aCheng, Ming-Ching10aChemical Synthesis of 9(Z)-Octadecenamide and Its Hypolipidemic Effect: A Bioactive Agent Found in the Essential Oil of Mountain Celery Seeds  ap. 1502–1508.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe unusual hypolipidemic activity of the methanolic fractionate of the essential oil (EOM) obtained from the mountain celery seed was previously reported. The most enriched 9(Z)-octadecenamide (oleamide) was speculated to be responsible for the relevant bioactivity. Chemically syntheized oleamide (CSO) yielded 85.1% with a purity of 98.6% when identified by RP-HPLC, FTIR, HREIMS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR. CSO was tested for its antioxidative and hypolipidemic bioactivities. Results indicated CSO was potently hypolipidemic with regard to serum TG, TC, LDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C, and hepatic TG (p < 0.05), but not for serum HDL-C and hepatic TC. In addition, CSO exhibited only poor antioxidative activity, implicating the possibility that the hypolipidemic and antioxidative bioactivity of original EOM was due to another coexisting constituent, probably γ-selinene. Conclusively, oleamide is a potent hypolipidemic agent as regarding its effects on decreasing serum TG, TC, LDL-C and hepatic TG. 3ahamsters 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3aseed extracts 3afractionation 3abiosynthesis 3acelery 3aseeds 3aessential oils 3aCryptotaenia 3afree radical scavengers 3aanimal models 3alipemic effect 3aantioxidant activity 2aAnimals 2aApiumxchemistry. 2aCricetinae 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aHumans 2aHyperlipidemiasxdrug therapyxmetabolism. 2aHypolipidemic Agentsxadministration & dosagexchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aLipid Metabolismxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMesocricetus 2aOils, Volatilexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aOleic Acidsxadministration & dosagexchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aPlant Oilsxadministration & dosagexchemical synthesisxchemistry. 2aRandom Allocation 2aSeedsxchemistry 0abioactive properties 0a9(Z)-octadecenamide 0amountain celery 0aCryptotaenia japonica 0aoleamide1 aKer, Yaw-Bee1 aYu, Tung-Hsi1 aLin, Liyun.1 aPeng, Robert Y.1 aPeng, Chiung-Huei0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2010 Feb. 10, v. 58, no. 3 p.1502–1508-1502–1508dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf903573g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100528b20100605c00000000  aINDd3CTe2010/05/16  aOther US 7aarticle02178naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010400128300001600232500002400248520127400272650001901546650001701565650001401582650001201596650001001608650001501618650001101633650001201644650001201656650001301668651001001681700001201691700001601703773010001719852000901819655001201828IND4463215520221118210541.0120514e200304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446321552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOttaviani, D.12aA multidimensional approach to understanding agro-ecosystems. A case study in Hubei Province, China  ap. 207-225.  aIncludes references  aUnderstanding agro-ecosystems implies acknowledging its complexity and its heterogeneity. Complexity refers to different hierarchical levels at which agriculture can be described; heterogeneity refers to the variability recorded within each hierarchical level considered. When dealing with valuation aimed at sustainability it is essential to assess multi-criteria and multi-scale descriptions and to find a way to bridge them. For this reason and to support the decision processes, it is fundamental to understand the role of households in this system. Here we suggest a multivariate statistical approach to the definition of household types with a case study of five rural villages in Hubei province, China. In each village, 50 random households were sampled and interviewed. Results show five distinct household types, differing in size and composition, economic activities, technical development, cereal productivity, food sufficiency, education and overall income. However, the analysis pointed out a recent and still on-going process of polarisation as equality seems still the main feature of Chinese society. Severe constraints existing in the socio-economic boundary conditions could provide very limited possibilities for rural farmers to emerge from poverty. 3aagroecosystems 3acase studies 3aeducation 3afarmers 3afoods 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3apoverty 3asociety 3avillages 3aChina1 aLi, Ji.1 aPastore, G.0 tAgricultural systems.g2003 Apr., v. 76, no. v p.207-225dElsevier Science Ltdx0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01439naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013700127300001400264520069400278650001100972650001100983650001300994653001301007700001901020773008101039852000901120939003301129946001101162655001201173IND9302705120221118205658.0930505e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930270512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTester, R.F.10aSwelling and gelatinization of cereal starches.

No changes in amylopectin structure or crystallinity were detected. Variation in resistance to acid hydrolysis (lintnerization), in swelling at 80 degrees C and in peak gelatinization temperature were attributed primarily to the different levels of LAM and FAM. 3abarley 3astarch 3agelation 0aswelling1 aMorrison, W.R.0 tJournal of cereal science.g1993 Jan., v. 17, no. 1 p.11-18x0733-52107nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01549naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001400249520081400263650001001077650001401087650001601101700001701117700001501134773008101149852000901230939003301239946001101272655001201283IND9302705620221118205651.0930505e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930270562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFouques, D.10aCharacterization and quantification of high Mr subunits of wheat glutenin by amino acid analysis after electroblotting  ap. 63-70.  aThe amino acid compositions of the high relative molecular mass (Mr) or high molecular weight (HMW) subunits of wheat glutenin were determined by the phenylthiocarbamyl (PTC) derivative procedure with polypeptides separated by sodium-dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes.

Effects of aggregate size distribution  ap. 85-107.  aSpecial Issue: Modelling Flow and Transport in the Unsaturated Zone: Scale Problems and Spatial Variability.  aThe influence of various aggregate size distributions on solute transport is analysed from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. Uniform, normal, log-normal and discrete aggregate size distributions are considered. The model described in Part 1 is used to calculate the breakthrough curves. The second-order moments and the sum of squared differences are used to compare the responses calculated with the distributions and with the mean radius. The influence of a distribution depends on the velocity, and consequently on the proportion of aggregates in situations of local equilibrium or physical non-equilibrium. Breakthrough curves calculated from normal distributions, whatever their spread, do not differ significantly from those calculated using the mean radii, while slightly skewed narrow distributions generate significant differences. Thus, the skewness and not only the spreading of the distribution seem to modify the spreading of solute. The problem of using a unique 'mean radius' instead of a distribution is also considered. It is shown that the problem does not have a simple answer. For a given distribution, the existence of an acceptable mean radius depends strongly on the contrast between the mobile phase residence time and the distribution of characteristic diffusion times. Also, intuitively, acceptable mean radii are more easily found for narrow distributions. In most cases, it appears that a mean radius cannot be used instead of the distribution. The analysis of the way the distributions modify the breakthrough curves suggests that simple bimodal distributions presenting fast- and slow-reacting sites could be used in lieu of complete distributions. 3aparticle size distribution 3adiffusion 3amathematical models 3asoil aggregates 3aporosity 0atransport processes 0aparticle velocity1 aLafolie, F.0 tJournal of hydrology.g1993 Mar. 1, v. 143, no. 1/2 p.85-107x0022-16947nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02170naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007600164300001600240520116800256650002301424653002701447653002301474653002001497653001601517700002101533700001701554700002801571773010701599852000901706856008501715930003301800946001101833655001201844IND4441637620221118210731.0100820e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444163762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11069-009-9463-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, Tiago 10aOverwash vulnerability assessment based on long-term washover evolution  ap. 225-244.  aAn integrated methodology for evaluation of overwash vulnerability is developed with respect to the historical washover evolution of a barrier island system. Three different aspects of overwash are addressed in the vulnerability indices developed: overwashed shoreline ratio, maximum overwash intrusion recurrence, and complete barrier overwash. The indices were applied to the barriers in the Ria Formosa system in Southern Portugal using an aerial photography catalogue covering the period 1947-2001. Historical trends of washover evolution were observed to be different between the barriers analysed, but generally, there was a decrease in washover number and dimensions throughout the analysed period. The final overwash diagnostic obtained allowed an integrated overwash vulnerability rating to be defined for each barrier, with vulnerabilities ranging from low to extreme. The methodology has produced results that may assist coastal managers with information concerning barrier island system overwash hazard, define the temporal and geographical distributions of overwash, and provide indications as to where overwash is most likely to occur in the future. 3aaerial photography 0aOverwash vulnerability 0aWashover evolution 0aBarrier islands 0aRia Formosa1 aFerreira, Oscar.1 aMatias, Ana 1 aDias, João Alveirinho 0 tNatural hazards.g2010 Aug., v. 54, no. 2 p.225-244dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx1573-08407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11069-009-9463-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100821b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03295naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001800166245011500184300001800299500002400317500001500341520175100356650001102107650001502118650001102133650001602144650001402160650002202174650002502196650002402221650002302245650002102268650001902289650001402308650002402322650001302346650001102359650001202370651001902382653001802401653001502419700002402434700001802458773011102476852000902587856008802596930003302684945002502717946001102742655001202753IND4433242920221118204109.0100228e20100320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aK0011 aZou, Chris B.10aStreamflow responses to vegetation manipulations along a gradient of precipitation in the Colorado River Basin  ap. 1268-1276.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe Colorado River Basin has been, and continues to be, the focus of a wide diversity of research efforts to learn more about the effects of natural and human-induced disturbances on the processes and functioning of the basin's upland watersheds. These watersheds are situated at the headwaters of streams and rivers that supply much of the water to downstream users in the western United States. Responses of streamflow to vegetation manipulations have been, and are, one of the research foci in this water-deficient part of the country. The watershed-scale research, led by the U.S. Forest Service and its cooperators, has spanned nearly a century and included an array of vegetation types along a wide range of precipitation gradients. Results from this research have shown that vegetation can be managed to enhance annual water yields while still providing the other natural resource benefits. Analyses of the research results suggest that the effect of vegetation manipulation on streamflow is associated with precipitation-elevational gradient and, therefore, vegetation type. An annual water yield increase between 25 and 100mm could be achieved by implementing vegetation manipulations in the high elevation subalpine and mixed conifer forests, the ponderosa pine forests (in the Lower Basin), and portions of the low elevation chaparral shrublands. Negligible effects or small increases in water yield were observed for treating sagebrush, pinyon-juniper woodland and desert scrubs. Results from this research have improved our understanding of the basin's hydrology and provided much needed insights to manage forest to mitigate global climate change induced hydrologic impact and meet the increased needs of people living in the basin. 3abasins 3ashrublands 3arivers 3astream flow 3aArtemisia 3aplant communities 3awatershed management 3aforested watersheds 3aconiferous forests 3avegetation cover 3apinyon-juniper 3achaparral 3awatershed hydrology 3aaltitude 3arunoff 3adensity 3aColorado River 0aprecipitation 0awatersheds1 aFfolliott, Peter F.1 aWine, Michael0 tForest ecology and management.g2010 Mar. 20, v. 259, no. 7 p.1268-1276dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.08.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100308b20100403c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/03/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03021naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002100195245009700216300001600313500002400329500001500353520113500368650001201503650002301515650002001538650001201558650001701570650001701587650001301604650001501617650001801632650002401650650001801674650001001692650001301702650001901715650001701734650001201751650001101763650001301774650001001787650001201797650002701809650002801836650002401864650003601888650001001924650001001934650001701944653003101961653002301992700001902015700001702034700001702051773008802068852000902156856008902165930003302254945002502287946001102312655001202323IND4433241220221118203537.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324122DNAL7 a203748482pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.10.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ112 0aQ5021 aMercadante, A.Z.10aEffect of natural pigments on the oxidative stability of sausages stored under refrigeration  ap. 718-726.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective was to use natural pigments to replace sodium erythorbate (NaEry), a synthetic compound used as an antioxidant in sausage formulations, and to evaluate the oxidative stability of the samples. Six assays were prepared in which sodium erythorbate (ERY) at 0.05g/100g was substituted by norbixin (NOR), lycopene (LYC), zeaxanthin (ZEA), β-carotene (CAR) or dextrose (used as a control (CON)). Physical, chemical, color, texture and sensory parameters were measured on the first day and after 45days of storage at 4°C. All pigments used in the sausage formulations were able to maintain the oxidative stability of the sausages (MDA equivalents <0.38mg/kg). Zeaxanthin and norbixin were the most efficient antioxidants of those tested. This antioxidant effect might be associated with the intermediate polarities of these two compounds, which would allow them to concentrate in the membrane lipids or emulsion interface, where lipid oxidation is most prevalent. Other volatile secondary products of oxidation besides MDA should be evaluated in further studies involving natural pigments and sensory oxidative stability. 3atexture 3asensory evaluation 3amalondialdehyde 3aglucose 3afood storage 3ameat quality 3alycopene 3azeaxanthin 3abeta-carotene 3aoxidative stability 3arefrigeration 3acolor 3asausages 3afood additives 3aantioxidants 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aChickens 2aColor 2aCooking 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aMeat Productsxanalysis 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPigments, Biologicalxchemistry 2aSwine 2aTaste 2aTime Factors 0aphysicochemical properties 0asodium erythorbate1 aCapitani, C.D.1 aDecker, E.A.1 aCastro, I.A.0 tMeat science.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.718-726dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.10.0313Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03285naa a2200781 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002700195245010800222300001600330500002400346500001500370520097500385650001501360650002201375650001901397650001201416650003301428650002301461650001501484650002101499650001601520650001901536650001901555650004801574650000801622650001801630650002001648650002701668650001801695650001701713650001601730650000701746650001901753650001201772650002701784650003101811650003401842650002901876650003501905650002401940650003501964650003101999650003002030650001002060650001602070650004602086650002102132653000902153700002002162700001802182700001802200700001802218773008802236852000902324856008902333930003302422945002502455946001102480655001202491IND4433241620221118203504.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324162DNAL7 a203748522pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ302 0aQ5021 aRomero de Ávila, M.D.10aMicrobial transglutaminase for cold-set binding of unsalted/salted pork models and restructured dry ham  ap. 747-754.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe viability of using microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) as a cold-set binder for restructuring and manufacturing deboned dry ham (RDH) was evaluated. The influence of meat pre-treatment, preparation of the MTGase, packing system and set temperature on the binding rate and force was tested using pork models and deboned legs. The best binding parameters were obtained when meat surfaces were evenly distributed with salts (NaCl, KNO₃, NaNO₂) and then washed with a saline solution (W), afterwards powder (P) or liquid (L) MTGase was applied, and simultaneous salting and vacuum packing (S) set at 7°C were performed. The RDH manufactured following these procedures (WPS and WLS) was stable during drying and could resist the handling and production process. Binding force increased (p <0.05) during 8weeks of drying. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed an increase of cross-links during the drying period of RDH related to the increase in binding force. 3adried meat 3apotassium nitrate 3afood packaging 3asalting 3ascanning electron microscopy 3adry matter content 3ahot boning 3abinding proteins 3acured meats 3amicrostructure 3asodium nitrate 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 3aham 3awater content 3asodium chloride 3awater holding capacity 3alipid content 3ameat quality 3aash content 3apH 3awater activity 2aAnimals 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Preservationxmethods 2aFood Preservativesxchemistry 2aMeat Productsxstandards 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aNitratesxchemistry 2aPotassium Compoundsxchemistry 2aSodium Chloridexchemistry 2aSodium Nitritexchemistry 2aSwine 2aTemperament 2aTransglutaminasesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWaterxchemistry 0apork1 aOrdóñez, J.A.1 ade la Hoz, L.1 aHerrero, A.M.1 aCambero, M.I.0 tMeat science.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.747-754dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03283naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001400195245011200209300001600321500002400337520120400361650000801565650001501573650001601588650001901604650002401623650002101647650003401668650001301702650001901715650001101734650001701745650002401762650001701786650001701803650001701820650000701837650001001844650002401854650002301878650002301901650001801924650001201942650001501954650002101969650001001990650002702000650002802027650003102055650000902086650001002095650001702105650001002122653002002132700001602152700001702168700001602185700001902201700002002220700001802240773008802258852000902346856008902355930003302444945002502477946001102502655001202513IND4433241820221118203524.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324182DNAL7 a203748542pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ112 0aQ302 0aQ5021 aParra, V.10aModified atmosphere packaging and vacuum packaging for long period chilled storage of dry-cured Iberian ham  ap. 760-768.  aIncludes references  aDry-cured Iberian ham slices were stored under vacuum and under four different modified atmospheres (60/40=60%N₂ +40%CO₂; 70/30=70%N₂ +30%CO₂; 80/20=80%N₂ +20%CO₂; argon=70%argon+30%CO₂) at 4±1°C during 120days. Gas composition, moisture content, pH, colour, pigment content, and lipid stability were measured, as well as sensory and microbial analysis were carried out throughout storage. A loss of intensity of red colour (a *-values) was observed during storage in ham slices (P <0.05). Consistently, MbFe(II)NO content also decreased throughout storage (P >0.05). Slices of ham packed in 40%CO₂ (60/40) and 30%CO₂ (70/30) showed lower a *-values than the rest of the batches after 60days (P <0.05), though differences were not evident after 120days (P >0.05). TBARs values showed an upward trend during the storage of packaged slices (P <0.05). Vacuum-packed slices showed the lowest TBARs values and those packed with 40%CO₂, the highest. Sensory attributes did not vary significantly (P >0.05) throughout storage under refrigeration and packed either in vacuum or in modified atmospheres. No safety problems were detected in relation to the microbial quality in any case. 3aham 3adried meat 3acured meats 3afood packaging 3apackaging materials 3avacuum packaging 3amodified atmosphere packaging 3anitrogen 3acarbon dioxide 3aoxygen 3afood storage 3astorage temperature 3astorage time 3ameat quality 3acold storage 3apH 3acolor 3aoxidative stability 3alipid peroxidation 3asensory evaluation 3arefrigeration 2aAnimals 2aAtmosphere 2aCold Temperature 2aColor 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Packagingxmethods 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMeat 2aSwine 2aTime Factors 2aWater 0alipid oxidation1 aViguera, J.1 aSánchez, J.1 aPeinado, J.1 aEspárrago, F.1 aGutierrez, J.I.1 aAndrés, A.I.0 tMeat science.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.760-768dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03190naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001700195245010100212300001600313500002400329500001500353520138100368650002801749650002301777650003001800650001601830650001101846650001701857650002201874650002801896650001601924650001201940650000901952650001501961650001401976650001701990650001202007650001302019650002002032650002002052650001002072650001202082650001102094650002702105650002202132650002002154650002102174650001002195653001402205700001502219700001302234700001402247773008802261852000902349856008902358930003302447945002502480946001102505655001202516IND4433240220221118203553.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324022DNAL7 a203748382pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ202 0aQ5021 aLennon, A.M.10aMechanical tenderisation of beef muscles for use in re-formed joints made with a cold-set binder  ap. 651-654.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree treatments, blade tenderisation (BT), needle tenderisation (NT) and enhancement by brine injection+vacuum-pulsing (VP), were applied to each of two muscles from beef forequarter, M. pectoralis profundus and M. supraspinatus, and two from the round of the hindquarter, M. semimembranosus and M. vastus lateralis. The tenderised muscles and non-treated controls were re-formed into joints using a cold-set bonding agent and tested as steaks cut from the joints. NT and VP gave a similar degree of tenderisation, as indicated by W-B shear force and taste panel, while BT had a lesser but still significant effect. Cook loss from steaks was increased by BT and NT treatments for the, tougher, forequarter but not the hindquarter muscles. The overall conclusion was that NT and VP treatments are more effective than BT but that the 3 methods are satisfactory for tenderisation of beef for production of re-formed steaks. Reduced redness and higher bacterial numbers arising from VP could render this treatment more suitable for re-formed steaks for catering than for retail sale. A supplementary trial showed that slices from roasted VP-treated re-formed joints(as distinct from grill-cooked steaks tested in the main trial) were better in sliceability and equal to or better in sensory quality than those from commercial whole-muscle round roasts purchased in a supermarket. 3abacterial contamination 3asensory evaluation 3afood processing equipment 3atenderizing 3asteaks 3abeef quality 3avacuum processing 3amicrobiological quality 3aplate count 3abrining 3abeef 3amarinating 3ainjection 3ashear stress 3aslicing 3agrilling 3ameat tenderness 3acooking quality 3acolor 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFood Handlingxmethods 2aFood Microbiology 2aMeatxstandards 2aMuscle, Skeletal 2aWater 0ameat cuts1 aMoon, S.S.1 aWard, P.1 aKenny, T.0 tMeat science.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.651-654dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.10.0263Available from publisher's Web site  a20110620b20110701c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03566naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001800186245014600204300001600350500002400366500001500390520147000405650000901875650002301884650003601907650001301943650000901956650000901965650002301974650002501997650002002022650001702042650002702059650002402086650002602110650002102136650002502157650001702182650004402199650001202243650002502255650003902280650002302319650003702342650001902379650004502398650002402443650002102467650003702488653003402525700001402559700001802573700001802591700001602609773008802625852000902713856008902722930003302811945002502844946001102869655001202880IND4433241020221118203518.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324102DNAL7 a203748462pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aQ5021 aTerevinto, A.10aOxidative status, in vitro iron-induced lipid oxidation and superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities in rhea meat  ap. 706-710.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aRhea (Rhea americana) muscles Obturatorius medialis (OM) Iliotibialis lateralis (IL) and Iliofibularis (I), obtained from farmed animals, were evaluated regarding their oxidative/antioxidant status. The mean level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) expressed as malonaldehyde (MDA) content was of 0.84mg MDA/kg wet tissue for the three muscles. TBARS level was significantly higher in IL than OM and I, with the two latter showing similar levels. The mean level of carbonyl proteins expressed as dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) was 1.59nmol DNPHmg⁻¹. Carbonyl protein levels were significantly different (P <0.05) between the three muscles (IL>OM>I). Iron-induced TBARS generation was not significantly different between the three muscles at any time, nor for each muscle during the 5h of the experiment. Superoxide dismutase activity in IL muscle was significantly higher (P <0.05) than in I muscle. However, the difference between IL and OM muscles was not significant. The differences between the three muscles became not significant when the results were expressed by mg of protein contained in the extract, instead by g of wet tissue. No differences were found for catalase (μmol of discomposed H₂O₂ min⁻¹ g⁻¹ wet tissue or by mg of protein contained in the extract) and glutathione peroxidase (μmol of oxidized NADPH min⁻¹ g⁻¹ of wet tissue or by mg of protein contained in the extract) activities between the three muscles. 3aRhea 3amuscle development 3aglutathione-disulfide reductase 3acatalase 3ameat 3airon 3alipid peroxidation 3asuperoxide dismutase 3aenzyme activity 3ameat quality 3aglutathione peroxidase 3aoxidative stability 3afarmed animal species 3ain vitro studies 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3athiobarbituric acid-reactive substances 2aAnimals 2aCatalasexmetabolism 2aGlutathione Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aIronxpharmacology 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMeatxanalysis 2aMuscle, Skeletalxchemistryxenzymology. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aStruthioniformes 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 0aglutathione reductase (NADPH)1 aRamos, A.1 aCastroman, G.1 aCabrera, M.C.1 aSaadoun, A.0 tMeat science.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.706-710dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02831naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001900213245008000232300001600312500002400328500001500352520082500367650000901192650001801201650001601219650002301235650001801258650001401276650001501290650002001305650001601325650001901341650001101360650001901371650001001390650001701400650001601417650001401433650002301447650001201470650004401482650001601526650004701542650001201589650000901601650001101610650002201621650002001643650002701663650003701690650001001727650001001737653001101747700002401758700002201782700002601804773008801830852000901918856008901927930003302016945002502049946001102074655001202085IND4433240920221118203542.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324092DNAL7 a203748452pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ102 0aQ5021 aLeong, Jasmine14aThe production of pork with garlic flavour notes using garlic essential oil  ap. 699-705.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGarlic essential oil (GEO) added directly to pork mince or to the diet of pigs was evaluated for its effectiveness in masking undesirable mutton flavour. Pork was from 31 female pigs (Duroc×(Large White×Landrace)) grown on diets containing either animal-plus-plant products (AP diet) or plant products only (P diet) with four levels of GEO: 0, 0.55, 1.44 and 1.84g/kg feed and 0, 0.55, 1.44 and 2.15g/kg feed in the AP and P diet, respectively. Garlic flavour increased and mutton flavour decreased in pork from pigs that consumed more than about 150g and 220g of GEO in P and AP diets, respectively over the 57-day feeding period. The garlic flavour was stronger and the mutton flavour less intense for pork from pigs on the P diet. When GEO was added to pork mince at 125ppm, it significantly reduced mutton flavour. 3apork 3aanimal growth 3aminced meat 3asensory evaluation 3aswine feeding 3alandraces 3acrossbreds 3afeed conversion 3aoff flavors 3aessential oils 3agarlic 3aplant extracts 3aDuroc 3ameat quality 3aLarge White 3afinishing 3aanimal performance 3afemales 2aAllyl Compoundsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aGarlicxchemistry 2aMeatxstandards 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aSulfidesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSwine 2aTaste 0aflavor1 aMorel, Patrick C.H.1 aPurchas, Roger W.1 aWilkinson, Brian H.P.0 tMeat science.g2010 Apr., v. 84, no. 4 p.699-705dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.11.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100406b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/02  aNon-US 7aarticle03863naa a2200997 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186072000900195072000900204100001600213245014300229300001600372500002400388520103300412650001301445650000901458650001601467650001501483650002201498650002201520650002301542650001101565650002001576650001101596650001101607650001701618650001901635650001901654650001701673650002501690650002901715650001401744650002301758650004401781650001001825650000701835650002701842650002301869650001901892650003401911650001101945650001901956650001701975650002401992650001702016650002302033650001502056650001702071650002402088650002802112650001602140650001202156650001102168650001002179650003702189650003102226650002202257650004902279650002502328650002002353650002002373650004502393650002802438650001702466653001202483653002002495653001702515700001802532700001402550700001802564700001602582773008802598852000902686856008902695930003302784945002502817946001102842655001202853IND4433239620221118203556.0100228e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443323962DNAL7 a203748322pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.10.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ402 0aQ112 0aQ302 0aQ5021 aHayes, J.E.10aEffect of lutein, sesamol, ellagic acid and olive leaf extract on the quality and shelf-life stability of packaged raw minced beef patties  ap. 613-620.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of lutein (100 and 200μg/g muscle), sesamol (250 and 500μg/g muscle), ellagic acid (300 and 600μg/g muscle) and olive leaf extract (100 and 200μg/g muscle) on total viable counts (TVCs), lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, TBARS), colour, oxymyoglobin oxidation, pH, water-holding capacity (WHC), sensorial properties of raw beef patties (M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum) stored in modified atmosphere packs (80% O2:20% CO2) (MAP) aerobically at 4°C for up to 8 and 12days, respectively, were examined.

(Compositae). It is an important antimalarial component, but as of present remains quite expensive due to its low content in the plant, the only commercial source of the compound. In this study, we found a 49% increase of the artemisinin content in A. annua SP18 on day 8 after treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), together with an 80% increase in artemisinic acid and 28% in dihydroartemisinic acid, the two potential precursors of artemisinin. In addition, the effects of exogenous MeJA on other secondary metabolites were evaluated by metabolite profiling using orthogonal signal correction partial least square discriminant analysis (OSC-PLS). Six sesquiterpenoids and three triterpenoids were selected as marker compounds in OSC-PLS. Their content also changed significantly after MeJA treatment, including a 50% increase in methyl artemisinic acid, a 67% increase in squalene and a 60% increase in peak 51 (an unidentified sesquiterpenoid). These compounds are promising targets for further studies on artemisinin biosynthesis and metabolic engineering. 3atemporal variation 3amedicinal plants 3amethyl jasmonate 3abiochemical pathways 3achemical structure 3asecondary metabolites 3aArtemisia annua 3aaerial parts 3ametabolomics 3ametabolome 3atriterpenoids 3amedicinal properties 3asqualene 3aartemisinin 0asesquiterpenoids 0aantimalarials1 aMa, Chenfei1 aLi, Zhenqiu1 aMa, Lanqing1 aWang, Hong1 aYe, Hechun1 aXu, Guowang1 aLiu, Benye0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2010 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.214-218dElsevier Sciencex0926-66907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2009.10.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03259naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002000158245008100178300001600259500002400275520132700299650001301626650001701639650001601656650001701672650002601689650003101715650002001746650002701766650003001793650002001823650002201843650002101865650001401886650001401900650001901914650001201933650002001945650001301965650000901978650001601987650002302003650001902026650001902045650002102064651001002085653002002095653002202115653002302137653001502160700002302175700002002198700001802218700002102236700002402257700002002281773010502301852000902406856008902415930003302504945002502537946001102562655001202573IND4433246720140725000000.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2009.10.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aFurlan, Lorenzo14aThe efficacy of biofumigant meals and plants to control wireworm populations  ap. 245-254.  aIncludes references  aThe effectiveness of biofumigant defatted seed meals and plants to control wireworm populations (Agriotes brevis Candeze, Agriotes sordidus Illiger, and Agriotes ustulatus Schäller) was evaluated under both semi-natural (pot assays) and field conditions in Veneto (Italy). Laboratory studies to evaluate the efficacy against wireworms of chopped fresh plants from Brassica juncea, sel. ISCI 99 and biofumigant meals derived from defatted seeds of Brassica carinata sel. ISCI 7 were done using wireworms placed in pots filled with sandy loam soil and planted with maize or lettuce. The treatments were made as simulated broadcast applications, approximating different field conditions and agronomic strategies. The defatted seed meals caused a very high larval mortality and prevented wireworms from seriously damaging crop seedlings. A clear rate effect was demonstrated, with sufficient seed meal to supply approximately 160μmoles of glucosinolatel⁻¹ of soil resulting in significant wireworm mortality. The insecticidal effect of the chopped whole plants of B. juncea was less consistent. A high level of efficacy against wireworms sufficient to protect susceptible crops from damage was also observed under field conditions following accurate incorporation of the defatted seed meals into wireworm-infested fields. 3aAgriotes 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3asoil insects 3afield experimentation 3agreenhouse experimentation 3asoil fumigation 3abotanical insecticides 3abiological control agents 3aBrassica juncea 3aBrassica carinata 3asandy loam soils 3amortality 3aseedlings 3aLactuca sativa 3alettuce 3avegetable crops 3aZea mays 3acorn 3agrain crops 3abiological control 3asoil treatment 3ainsect control 3aplant protection 3aItaly 0aAgriotes brevis 0aAgriotes sordidus 0aAgriotes ustulatus 0aseed meals1 aBonetto, Christian1 aFinotto, Andrea1 aLazzeri, Luca1 aMalaguti, Lorena1 aPatalano, Giampiero1 aParker, William0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2010 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.245-254dElsevier Sciencex0926-66907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2009.10.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20100514b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03608naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181100002700190245008700217300001500304500002400319500001500343520162900358650002301987650002302010650001502033650001602048650002002064650001702084650001402101650001002115650001902125650001702144650001602161650001502177650002802192650001802220650001202238650002502250650001202275650001502287650000902302650001602311650000902327650002502336650004002361650004402401650003202445650003402477651001102511653002302522653001402545653002102559700001802580700001902598700001802617773010402635852000902739856009302748930003302841945002502874946001102899655001202910IND4433245820221118203352.0100228e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324582DNAL7 a200184662pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.11.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aP0501 aCordeiro-Júnior, D.A.10aSpermatogenic efficiency in the spiny rat, Trinomys moojeni (Rodentia: Echimyidae)  ap. 97-105.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe spiny rat (Trinomys moojeni) is a rodent found in the Atlantic Forest, which is considered one of the most diverse and threatened biomes in the world. Knowledge on reproductive biology and physiology is critical to conservation and species management, allowing the prevention of extinction and the use of males in natural and artificial reproduction programs. The main objectives of the present study were to investigate the testis structure as well as spermatogenic and Sertoli cell efficiency in the spiny rat captured in the Caraça Natural Reserve, a fragment of the Atlantic Forest located in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. Ten sexually mature spiny rats were analyzed. Intraperitoneal injections of tritiated thymidine were administered to estimate duration of spermatogenesis. The testes were perfused-fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde and routinely processed for histological and morphometric analyses as well as the characterization of the stages of seminiferous epithelium cycle. Volume density (%) of seminiferous tubules and Leydig cells were 97±0.3 and 0.3±0.02, respectively. The duration of one spermatogenic cycle and total duration of spermatogenesis were 8.6±0.1 and 38.5±0.5 days, respectively. Due to the very great volume density of the seminiferous tubules, short duration of spermatogenesis, tubule length per gram of testis (∼40m), great Sertoli cell efficiency (∼15 spermatids per Sertoli cell) and large number of Sertoli cells per testis gram (53 million), spermatogenic efficiency in the spiny rat (82 million) is by far the greatest of the mammalian species investigated thus far. 3atemporal variation 3aendangered species 3acell cycle 3amorphometry 3aspermatogenesis 3aLeydig cells 3ahistology 3amales 3amale fertility 3awild animals 3aspermatozoa 3aEchimyidae 3aseminiferous epithelium 3aSertoli cells 3arodents 2aAcrosomexphysiology 2aAnimals 2aEfficiency 2aMale 2aPeriodicity 2aRats 2aRodentiaxphysiology 2aSeminiferous Epitheliumxphysiology 2aSpermatidsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aSpermatogenesisxphysiology 2aTestisxcytologyxphysiology. 3aBrazil 0athreatened species 0aspiny rat 0aTrinomys moojeni1 aCosta, G.M.J.1 aTalamoni, S.A.1 aFrança, L.R.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 May, v. 119, no. 1-2 p.97-105dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.11.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle04148naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004300111040001800154072000900172072000900181072000900190100001400199245009900213300001600312500002400328500001500352520205700367650002002424650001402444650002102458650002002479650001602499650002202515650002302537650002802560650001902588650001102607650001902618650002302637650001902660650002002679650001202699650001602711650002702727650000902754650002202763650001202785650003002797650003102827650003002858650000902888650001202897650002202909650001902931650006202950650001003012650003903022650001703061653001003078700001603088700001403104700002003118773010503138852000903243856009303252930003303345945002503378946001103403655001203414IND4433244320221118203308.0100228e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324432DNAL7 a200893742pmid7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL200 0aL3001 aLeahy, T.10aSeasonal variation in the protective effect of seminal plasma on frozen-thawed ram spermatozoa  ap. 147-153.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe response of ram spermatozoa to seminal plasma is highly variable, in part due to the presence of both stimulatory and inhibitory factors. The aim of this study was to assess variation in the protection of ram spermatozoa during freezing by seminal plasma. The seminal plasma variables studied were season of collection, fractionation and method of supplementation. Spermatozoa were supplemented before freezing with 4mg of seminal plasma proteins (SPPs) per 10⁸ cells, and their motility and viability were assessed during post-thaw incubation (37°C). In Experiment 1, semen was (a) frozen with no supplementation (Control) (b) extended with a Tris-based diluent (C+TRIS), or (c) supplemented with seminal plasma collected throughout the year (in the Southern Hemisphere) and pooled for January-March, April-June, July-August and October-December, and either fractionated to produce a concentrated >10kDa seminal plasma protein retentate (>10kDa SPP), or kept as crude seminal plasma (CP). There was no effect of season or seminal plasma type (CP or >10kDa SPP) on motility of spermatozoa. CP and >10kDa SPP improved the viability of spermatozoa when collected from January-September compared to Control. Supplementation with >10kDa SPP increased viability of spermatozoa, compared to CP, when collected from January to July. In Experiment 2, >10kDa SPP were either added directly to the spermatozoa or included in the cryodiluent or >10kDa SPP were not supplemented (Control). Both supplementation methods improved the motility and the proportion of viable, acrosome-intact spermatozoa but direct supplementation resulted in more viable, acrosome-intact spermatozoa compared with supplementation of the cryodiluent. These results show that supplementation of ram spermatozoa with CP, or its protein component (>10kDa SPP), before freezing protects them from freeze-thaw damage. The protective effect is greatest when seminal plasma is collected during the breeding season, fractionated with >10kDa filters and added directly to the spermatozoa. 3asemen extenders 3aviability 3acryopreservation 3aanimal proteins 3aphotoperiod 3aacrosome reaction 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aartificial insemination 3asperm motility 3aMerino 3aseminal plasma 3aseasonal variation 3amale fertility 3abreeding season 3athawing 3aspermatozoa 3agermplasm conservation 3arams 3aprotective effect 2aAnimals 2aCell Survivalxphysiology 2aCytoprotectionxphysiology 2aFreezingxadverse effects 2aMale 2aSeasons 2aSemenxphysiology 2aSemen Analysis 2aSemen Preservationxadverse effectsxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSheep 2aSpermatozoaxcytologyxphysiology. 2aTime Factors 0asemen1 aMarti, J.I.1 aEvans, G.1 aMaxwell, W.M.C.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2010 May, v. 119, no. 1-2 p.147-153dElsevier Sciencex0378-43207nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2009.12.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/04/20  aNon-US 7aarticle03199naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001500176245014600191300001600337500002400353500001500377520143900392650002201831650001901853650001801872650001501890650002001905650002601925650001801951650001201969650002101981650002802002650002102030650002402051650001902075650001802094650002502112650002102137650000902158650002402167651001002191653001702201653001602218700001402234700001402248700001902262700001602281700001602297773010502313852000902418856008902427930003302516945002502549946001102574655001202585IND4433247320221118203757.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2009.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF140 0aJ700 0aJ5001 aSingh, Man10aCowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.

Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp.) was intercropped with transplanted menthol mint (Mentha arvensis L.) for green manuring (GM) and for fodder plus green manuring (F+GM) with four levels of urea N (0, 30, 60, 90kgNha⁻¹). In GM, cowpea was incorporated in the soil 30 days after sowing (DAS), while in F+GM 50% (alternate) cow pea plants were used for fodder at 30 DAS and 50% were incorporated in soil at 35 DAS. No significant differences were found between GM and F+GM with respect to herb and oil yield of menthol mint and succeeding palmarosa crop and nitrogen economy. Fresh biomass yield of menthol mint increased by 23.4% and essential oil yield by 25.2% by cowpea green manure (mean of GM and F+GM) as compared to without GM across all N levels. The contribution of green manure, as a nitrogen source, was equivalent to 30kgNha⁻¹ when no fertilizer nitrogen was applied in menthol mint. The residual effect of cowpea GM was studied in a succeeding crop of fast growing essential oil yielding palmarosa (Cymbopopogon martinii (Roxb.)Wats. var motia Burk.) over two harvests (July and December). Averaged across N levels green manure resulted in an increase of 18.5% in the fresh biomass and 17.7% in essential oil yield of palmarosa over no green manuring. 3aVigna unguiculata 3aessential oils 3agreen manures 3acrop yield 3aMentha arvensis 3afield experimentation 3aintercropping 3acowpeas 3aresidual effects 3adry matter accumulation 3anutrient balance 3aCymbopogon martinii 3aforage legumes 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aurea 3aessential oil crops 3aIndia 0aforage crops 0afield crops1 aSingh, A.1 aSingh, S.1 aTripathi, R.S.1 aSingh, A.K.1 aPatra, D.D.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2010 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.289-293dElsevier Sciencex0926-66907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2009.11.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100513b20100605c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/04/19  aNon-US 7aarticle05086naa a2201057 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001600195245008800211300001600299500002400315500001500339520171400354650001902068650001902087650004302106650002102149650002502170650002002195650001802215650001702233650003202250650002602282650001802308650001902326650002502345650001702370650002502387650001702412650002302429650000902452650002502461650001902486650000902505650005202514650002802566650002002594650002602614650002102640650001202661650002802673650001402701650004802715650010002763650007802863650004502941650002202986650001103008650004803019650006703067650003703134650000903171650004303180650002203223650005003245650004403295650001603339650003103355650002203386650000903408650001703417650003703434650005603471653001703527653002803544700001403572700001503586700001903601700001303620700001203633700001503645700001503660700001503675700001803690700001603708700001203724773011103736852000903847856008903856930003303945945002503978946001304003655001204016IND4433251320221118204400.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325132DNAL7 a193690542pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2008.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aTang, Yunan10aZinc supplementation partially prevents renal pathological changes in diabetic rats  ap. 237-246.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe have demonstrated that Zn supplementation mediated up-regulation of cardiac metallothionein (MT) as a potent antioxidant prevented the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. The present study was undertaken to test whether induction of renal MT synthesis by Zn supplementation protects the kidney from diabetes-induced damage. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were treated with and without Zn supplementation at 5 mg/kg in drinking water for 3 months. Diabetic renal damage was detected by examining renal pathological alterations and 24-h urinary protein levels. Three-month Zn supplementation immediately after the onset of diabetes, partially but significantly, prevented the kidney from diabetes-induced increases in 24-h urinary proteins and pathological alterations. Diabetes-induced renal oxidative damage, inflammation and up-regulated expression of profibrosis mediator connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were also markedly attenuated by Zn supplementation, along with significant increases in Zn levels concomitant with MT expression in renal tubular cells. Direct exposure of renal tubular (HK11) cells to high levels of glucose (HG) induced CTGF up-regulation predominantly through ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase)1/2-dependent, and partially through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-dependent pathways. Pretreatment of HK11 cells with Zn or cadmium induced MT expression and also significantly suppressed HG-induced CTGF expression. These results provide the first evidence for Zn supplementation to attenuate diabetes-induced renal pathological changes, likely through prevention of hyperglycemia-induced CTGF expression by Zn-induced MT in renal tubular cells. 3agrowth factors 3arenal function 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoxidative stress 3aimmunohistochemistry 3amalondialdehyde 3arenal tubules 3apathogenesis 3adietary mineral supplements 3aanimal disease models 3amessenger RNA 3acardiomyopathy 3adiabetic nephropathy 3acell culture 3asuperoxide dismutase 3arisk factors 3aconnective tissues 3arats 3aantioxidant activity 3ahistopathology 3azinc 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3afree radical scavengers 3ametallothionein 3aplasminogen activator 3adietary minerals 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aCell Line 2aConnective Tissue Growth Factorxmetabolism 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxchemically inducedxcomplicationsxpathologyxphysiopathology. 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxpathologyxphysiopathologyxprevention & control. 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aGlucosextoxicity 2aHumans 2aKidneyxchemistryxdrug effectsxpathology. 2aKidney Tubules, Proximalxchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMetallothioneinxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOrgan Specificity 2aPlasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1xmetabolism 2aProtein Isoformsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteinuria 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRandom Allocation 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aZincxanalysisxbloodxdeficiencyxtherapeutic use. 0aantioxidants 0acardiovascular diseases1 aYang, Qin1 aLu, Jiayin1 aZhang, Xiaolin1 aSuen, Di1 aTan, Yi1 aJin, Litai1 aXiao, Jian1 aXie, Rujia1 aRane, Madhavi1 aLi, Xiaokun1 aCai, Lu0 tJournal of nutritional biochemistry.g2010 Mar., v. 21, no. 3 p.237-246dElsevier Sciencex0955-28637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jnutbio.2008.12.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100423b20100501c00000000  aINDdPNNe2010/04/20  aOther US 7aarticle03959naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002200166245020200188300001600390500002400406500001500430520212000445650004402565650002302609650001802632650001602650650001802666650001502684650002302699650001802722650001702740650001702757650001302774650001802787650002402805650002302829650001902852650002402871650003002895650002202925650002302947650001902970650001302989650001603002651001203018653002403030700002103054700002003075773009603095852000903191856008803200930003303288945002503321946001103346655001203357IND4433249820221118204333.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443324982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.12.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ2001 aDouterelo, Isabel10aSoil microbial community response to land-management and depth, related to the degradation of organic matter in English wetlands: Implications for the in situ preservation of archaeological remains  ap. 219-227.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWetlands are important habitats not only for their unique ecological value but also because they contain organic material that is fundamental to our understanding of precedent landscape and human past. This study compares the effects of two different land-management regimes on metabolic diversity and bacterial community structure with depth in order to relate them to the process of organic matter degradation and the potential for preservation in situ of organic archaeological artefacts in wetland soils. Soil cores were collected at five depths down to 100cm from two wetlands sites in England. Environmental variables were monitored and the metabolic capabilities of the microbial community were studied using Biolog Ecoplates®. DNA was extracted from soil, and the bacterial community structure was examined by polymerase chain reaction followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). To determine compositional changes in the bacterial community with depth, information about specific groups of bacteria at the site with higher water table (Hatfield Moor) was obtained by cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes. Biolog and DGGE analyses showed depth variation and between-site variation. Carbon substrate utilization and bacterial diversity decreased with increasing depth. The wetland soil under an arable regime in which the water levels were kept elevated, showed higher metabolic capability and bacterial richness when compared with the soil under pasture and subjected to long-standing drainage. Cloning and sequencing showed that Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the predominant taxa within the soil profile, but there was a clear shift in bacterial community composition with increasing depth as several taxonomic groups (δ-Proteobacteria and Spirochaetes) were only detectable at 50cm depth. Because the site with a high and stable water table presented higher metabolic activity and bacterial diversity, it may be that saturated conditions and a high water table are not sufficient to guarantee the preservation in situ of organic material such as archaeological artefacts. 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3aagricultural soils 3aribosomal RNA 3aSpirochaeta 3aAcidobacteria 3asoil depth 3aDNA fingerprinting 3awetland soils 3asoil ecology 3apaleontology 3apastures 3asoil bacteria 3acommunity structure 3asoil water content 3aProteobacteria 3asoil organic matter 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aspecies diversity 3amicrobial activity 3abiodegradation 3ahabitats 3awater table 3aEngland 0agel electrophoresis1 aGoulder, Raymond1 aLillie, Malcolm0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.219-227dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.12.0093Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/04/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04653naa a2200877 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100003000195245009900225300001600324500002400340500001500364520176500379650003102144650002302175650002102198650002102219650002202240650002202262650001502284650001802299650003002317650001302347650003202360650002502392650001902417650002002436650002502456650002402481650001402505650002802519650001802547650001202565650005302577650004302630650003302673650004502706650002502751650002902776650003302805650000902838650003202847650003502879650002702914650004402941650005302985650003103038650000903069650001703078650004903095650006803144650004403212650006803256653002903324653001003353653001403363653001703377700002103394700002603415700001903441700002303460773011103483852000903594856008903603930003303692945002503725946001303750655001203763IND4433251220140725000000.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325122DNAL7 a192691512pmid7 a10.1016/j.jnutbio.2008.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aT200 0aX3801 aEsteban-Pretel, Guillermo10aVitamin A deficiency alters rat lung alveolar basement membrane Reversibility by retinoic acid  ap. 227-236.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVitamin A is essential for lung development and pulmonary cell differentiation and its deficiency results in alterations of lung structure and function. Basement membranes (BMs) are also involved in those processes, and retinoic acid, the main biologically active form of vitamin A, influences the expression of extracellular matrix macromolecules. Therefore, we have analyzed the ultrastructure and collagen content of lung alveolar BM in growing rats deficient in vitamin A and the recovering effect of all-trans retinoic acid. Male weanling pups were fed a retinol-adequate or -deficient diet until they were 60 days old. A group of vitamin A-deficient pups were recovered by daily intraperitoneal injections of all-trans retinoic acid for 10 days. Alveolar BM in vitamin A-deficient rats doubled its thickness and contained irregularly scattered collagen fibrils. Immunocytochemistry revealed that these fibrils were composed of collagen I. Total content of both collagen I protein and its mRNA was greater in vitamin-deficient lungs. In agreement with the greater size of the BM the amount of collagen IV was also increased. Proinflammatory cytokines, IL-1α, IL-1β and TNF-α, did not change, but myeloperoxidase and TGF-β1 were increased. Treatment of vitamin A-deficient rats with retinoic acid reversed all the alterations, but the BM thickness recovered only partially. Retinoic acid recovering activity occurred in the presence of increasing oxidative stress. In conclusion, vitamin A deficiency results in alterations of the structure and composition of the alveolar BM which are probably mediated by TGF-β1 and reverted by retinoic acid. These alterations could contribute to the impairment of lung function and predispose to pulmonary disease. 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3alipid peroxidation 3aWestern blotting 3aoxidative stress 3abasement membrane 3apulmonary alveoli 3aperoxidase 3ainterleukin-1 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acollagen 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avitamin deficiencies 3aultrastructure 3aenzyme activity 3aantioxidant activity 3aimmunocytochemistry 3avitamin A 3afree radical scavengers 3aretinoic acid 2aAnimals 2aBasement Membranexdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aCollagen Type Ixgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCollagen Type IVxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulationxdrug effects 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aInterleukinsxmetabolism 2aLungxmetabolismxpathology. 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexmetabolism 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aProtein Subunitsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPulmonary Alveolixdrug effectsxultrastructure. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta1xmetabolism 2aTretinoinxadverse effectsxbloodxmetabolismxtherapeutic use. 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxmetabolism 2aVitamin A Deficiencyxdrug therapyxpathologyxphysiopathology. 0amyeloperoxidase activity 0alungs 0acytokines 0aantioxidants1 aMarín, M.

Up to 94.7Asmgkg⁻¹, 417Pbmgkg⁻¹, 498Znmgkg⁻¹, 5.8Cdmgkg⁻¹ and 27.7Cumgkg⁻¹ in shoots of C. dactylon were recorded. The plant was colonized consistently by AM fungi (33.0-65.5%) at both uncontaminated site and metal-contaminated sites. Based on morphological characteristics, fourteen species of AM fungi were identified in the rhizosphere of C. dactylon, with one belonging to the genus of Acaulospora and the other thirteen belonging to the genus of Glomus. Glomus etunicatum was the most common species associated with C. dactylon growing at metal-contaminated sites. Spore abundance in the rhizosphere of C. dactylon growing at the metal-contaminated soils (22-82 spores per 25g soil) was significantly lower than that of the uncontaminated soils (371 spores per 25g soil). However, AM fungal species diversity in the metal-contaminated soils was significantly higher than that in the uncontaminated soils. This is the first report of AM status in the rhizosphere of C. dactylon, the dominant plant survival in metal-contaminated soils. The investigation also suggests that phytorestoration of metal-contaminated sites might be facilitated using the appropriate plant with the aid of tolerant AM fungi. 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aCynodon dactylon 3aClaroideoglomus etunicatum 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ainoculum density 3arhizosphere fungi 3aroots 3ashoots 3asoil ecology 3asoil pollution 3acadmium 3aquantitative analysis 3acopper 3aarsenic 3aAcaulospora 3aspecies diversity 3aphytotoxicity 3azinc 3aecological restoration 3achemical constituents of plants 3aChina 0aGlomus etunicatum 0asoil fungi 0asymbiosis1 aBi, Y.L.1 aLeung, H.M.1 aYe, Z.H.1 aLin, X.G.1 aWong, M.H.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.213-218dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.12.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/04/08  aNon-US 7aarticle04471naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184072000900193100001800202245016000220300001600380500002400396500001500420520256600435650002303001650002403024650002003048650001703068650001703085650002103102650001603123650001003139650001703149650002103166650002003187650002403207650001603231650002003247650001303267650000903280650001903289650000803308650002303316650001803339650001803357650002703375650001903402650001303421651001203434653001903446653002003465700002003485700001803505773009603523852000903619856008803628930003303716945002503749946001103774655001203785IND4433250320221118204324.0100228e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.01.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF120 0aJ700 0aJ100 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aF6001 aGarland, J.L.10aOrganic waste amendment effects on soil microbial activity in a corn-rye rotation: Application of a new approach to community-level physiological profiling  ap. 262-269.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOrganic fertilizers provide long-term benefits to agronomic soils, but sometimes cause short-term reductions in crop yield due to microbially mediated nitrogen (N) immobilization. A simple, rapid method to assess the integrated use of both, carbon (C) and N by soil microbial communities will be a useful monitoring tool in production agriculture. The present study evaluated a new platform for performing community-level physiological profiles (CLPP) using fluorescent-based detection of O₂ consumption by soil slurries within microtiter plates. Response of a spodic Florida soil to 3 organic fertilizer amendment treatments; (1) control with no organic amendment, (2) pelletized class A-A municipal biosolids amendment, and (3) fresh dairy waste solids amendment was measured in soils taken from a corn-rye crop rotation. The CLPP assay was used to assess endogenous and substrate induced (∼75μgC as acetate, casein, coumaric acid, mannose, or asparagine g⁻¹ soil) respiration, with and without assay N additions (8μgN-NH₄ g⁻¹ soil). Endogenous and substrate-induced respiration were generally greater in the dairy waste-amended soils, as quantified by a reduced lag period and greater response peak. Stimulatory effects from biosolid-amended soils were less extensive and consistent. The degree of N limitation on microbial activity was determined by comparing the response peak with and without N amendment. This difference in response (Ndiff) was greatest for all treatments during the rye exponential growth phase (prior to heading), when extractable soil NH₄-N and NO₃-N concentrations were lowest (i.e.,<10mgkg⁻¹). The dairy waste treated soils had greater Ndiff values during the rye crop as compared to the other treatments, particularly for endogenous respiration and mannose-induced respiration. Ndiff was low in all treatments during the corn crop, where extractable soil NH₄-N+NO₃-N remained at or above 20mgNkg⁻¹. Plant yield data coincided with our estimates of N-limited microbial activity, with less mid-season rye biomass under dairy waste and no yield response with corn. Overall, these data indicate that this new method allows for a rapid, ecologically relevant evaluation of organic amendment impacts on microbial soil respiration and thereby plant yield response. Further characterization and interpretation of the variation in microbial respiration among specific C substrates and the relative impact of N amendments (i.e., Ndiff), will provide insight to C and N cycling in soils receiving organic N inputs. 3aagricultural soils 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil amendments 3adairy manure 3aMSW composts 3asoil respiration 3ameasurement 3aroots 3asoil ecology 3anitrogen content 3anutrient uptake 3asoil microorganisms 3agrain yield 3aspodic horizons 3aZea mays 3acorn 3aSecale cereale 3arye 3amicrobial activity 3acrop rotation 3arapid methods 3asoil nutrient dynamics 3abiodegradation 3anitrates 3aFlorida 0aorganic wastes 0acrop production1 aMackowiak, C.L.1 aZabaloy, M.C.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2010 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.262-269dElsevier Sciencex0929-13937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2010.01.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/04/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03225naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100001900187245008900206300001800295500002400313520142700337650002401764650000901788650001501797650001701812650002001829650001201849650002001861650002401881650001601905650001401921650001901935650001901954650002101973650003401994650002702028650003002055650003002085650003002115650001002145650003102155650002102186650000902207650002402216650001602240653001902256653001702275700002002292700001802312773009902330852000902429856009002438930003302528945002502561946001302586655001202599IND4433257020221118203651.0100228e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325702DNAL7 a201387562pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2010.01.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aW0001 aFillat, Amanda12aA new approach to the biobleaching of flax pulp with laccase using natural mediators  ap. 4104-4110.  aIncludes references  aThe phenols syringaldehyde (SA), acetosyringone (AS) and p-coumaric acid (PCA) were used as natural laccase mediators in combination with a laccase from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus to bleach flax fibres. Their performance was compared with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HBT) in terms of enzyme stability, and pulp and effluent properties. HBT and PCA were found to inactivate laccase in the absence of pulp. However, in the presence of unbleached flax pulp stability was increased; for example with PCA, laccase retained 77% of its initial activity, in contrast with complete inactivation in the absence of pulp. This suggests a protective effect of the pulp against denaturalization of the enzyme. All natural mediators resulted in a reduced kappa number after the subsequent alkaline treatment with hydrogen peroxide; the reduction being especially marked with SA (about 2 units - with respect to the control sample) and comparable to that obtained by HBT. Brightness was significantly increased by all natural mediators, but especially by AS and SA (23% with both), which performed very similarly to HBT in this respect. Natural mediators therefore might constitute an effective alternative to synthetic mediators for flax pulp biobleaching. This paper demonstrates for the first time the use of natural mediators in the laccase-assisted delignification of flax pulp and their effect on the properties of the resulting effluents. 3aLinum usitatissimum 3aflax 3apulp fiber 3abiobleaching 3adelignification 3alaccase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme inactivation 3apapermaking 3aaldehydes 3aacetosyringone 3acoumaric acids 3aalkali treatment 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3achemical oxygen demand 2aAcetophenonesxmetabolism 2aBasidiomycotaxenzymology 2aBenzaldehydesxmetabolism 2aColor 2aCoumaric Acidsxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Stability 2aFlax 2aLaccasexmetabolism 2aTemperature 0asyringaldehyde 0anonwood pulp1 aColom, Josep F.1 aVidal, Teresa0 tBioresource technology.g2010 June, v. 101, no. 11 p.4104-4110dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2010.01.0573Available from publisher's Web site  a20100510b20100605c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/05/10  aOther US 7aarticle02523naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100002800187245010100215300001800316500002400334500001500358520096700373650002601340650001801366650001701384650002201401650001401423650001301437650002401450650001401474650002001488650003601508650002601544650002501570650004501595653002901640653003901669700002001708700002001728773009901748852000901847856009001856930003301946945002501979946001302004655001202017IND4433257920221118204435.0100228e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325792DNAL7 a201331322pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.1372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aP1201 aIslam, Mohammad Rofiqul10aProperties of sugarcane waste-derived bio-oils obtained by fixed-bed fire-tube heating pyrolysis  ap. 4162-4168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAgricultural waste in the form of sugarcane bagasse was pyrolyzed in a fixed-bed fire-tube heating reactor under different pyrolysis conditions to determine the role of final temperature, sweeping gas flow rate and feed size on the product yields. Final temperature range studied was between 375 and 575°C and the highest liquid product yield was obtained at 475°C. Liquid products obtained under the most suitable conditions were characterized by physical properties, elemental analysis, GCV, FT-IR, ¹H NMR analysis and distillation. The empirical formula of the bio-oil with heating value of 23.5MJ/kg was established as CH₁.₆₈O₀.₅₅₇N₀.₀₁₂. Comparison with other approaches showed that the liquid product yield by this simpler reactor system was higher with better physico-chemical properties as fuel. These findings show that fixed-bed fire-tube heating pyrolysis is a good option for production of bio-oils from biomass solid wastes. 3aSaccharum officinarum 3araw materials 3asolid wastes 3asugarcane bagasse 3asugarcane 3abiofuels 3aagricultural wastes 3apyrolysis 2aHot Temperature 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aPlant Oilsxchemistry 2aSaccharumxchemistry 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 0arenewable energy sources 0afixed-bed fire-tube heating ractor1 aParveen, Momtaz1 aHaniu, Hiroyuki0 tBioresource technology.g2010 June, v. 101, no. 11 p.4162-4168dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.1373Available from publisher's Web site  a20100510b20100605c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/05/10  aOther US 7aarticle02898naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178100002000187245011600207300001800323500002400341520107400365650002701439650001501466650001301481650001401494650001801508650001101526650001901537650001301556650003201569650002601601650005201627650002601679650004901705650001501754650002301769650000901792653002101801653002401822653002901846700002101875700002101896700001501917700001301932700001801945700001801963700001401981700002001995773009902015852000902114856009002123930003302213945002502246946001302271655001202284IND4433256420221118204403.0100228e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325642DNAL7 a201228242pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX350 0aW0001 aHuang, Dan-Lian10aChanges of microbial population structure related to lignin degradation during lignocellulosic waste composting  ap. 4062-4067.  aIncludes references  aMicrobial populations and their relationship to bioconversion during lignocellulosic waste composting were studied by quinone profiling. Nine quinones were observed in the initial composting materials, and 15 quinones were found in compost after 50days of composting. The quinone species Q-9(H2), Q-10 and Q-10(H2) which are indicative of certain fungi appeared at the thermophilic stage but disappeared at the cooling stage. Q-10, indicative of certain fungi, and MK-7, characteristic of certain bacteria, were the predominant quinones during the thermophilic stage and were correlated with lignin degradation at the thermophilic stage. The highest lignin degradation ratio (26%) and good cellulose degradation were found at the cooling stage and were correlated with quinones Q-9, MK-7 and long-chain menaquinones attributed to mesophilic fungi, bacteria and actinomycetes, respectively. The present findings will improve the understandings of microbial dynamics and roles in composting, which could provide useful references for development of composting technology. 3alignocellulosic wastes 3acomposting 3acomposts 3acellulose 3ahemicellulose 3alignin 3abiodegradation 3aquinones 3aligninolytic microorganisms 3athermophilic bacteria 2aBacteriaxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aCellulosexmetabolism 2aFungixisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aHydrolysis 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aSoil 0amesophilic fungi 0amesophilic bacteria 0amesophilic actinomycetes1 aZeng, Guang-Ming1 aFeng, Chong-Ling1 aHu, Shuang1 aLai, Cui1 aZhao, Mei-Hua1 aSu, Feng-Feng1 aTang, Lin1 aLiu, Hong-Liang0 tBioresource technology.g2010 June, v. 101, no. 11 p.4062-4067dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.12.1453Available from publisher's Web site  a20100508b20100605c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/05/08  aOther US 7aarticle02907naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100001800205245012400223300001800347500002400365500001500389520086400404650001801268650002201286650001101308650001701319650000901336650001201345650002501357650002401382650001901406650002501425650001501450650002501465650001501490650001501505650001201520650002301532650002001555650003101575650002101606650002401627650001401651650002701665650001601692650001001708650000901718653001701727653002901744653001601773653003101789653001601820653004201836700002001878700001801898773009901916852000902015856009002024930003302114945002502147946001302172655001202185IND4433253320221118204350.0100228e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443325332DNAL7 a201496472pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.0642doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK590 0aK001 0aW000 0aX1001 aOfomaja, A.E.10aCompetitive modeling for the biosorptive removal of copper and lead ions from aqueous solution by Mansonia wood sawdust  ap. 3844-3852.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aMansonia wood sawdust is applied as a biosorbent for the removal of copper and lead ions from single and binary aqueous solution.

The Langmuir isotherm provided a better fit to experimental data for lead ion sorption with a higher monolayer capacity, while copper ion sorption was best described by the Freundlich and BET isotherms. The combined effect of adsorbing one metal ion in the presence of the other metal ion reduced the adsorption capacity of either metal ion. In a binary solution, removal of lead ions in the presence of copper ions followed the Langmuir isotherm model while the removal of copper ions in presence of lead ions followed both the Langmuir and BET isotherm models. 3alinear models 3aaqueous solutions 3acopper 3aheavy metals 3alead 3asawdust 3awastewater treatment 3aregression analysis 3athermodynamics 3aindustrial effluents 3aadsorbents 3aMansonia (Malvaceae) 3ametal ions 2aAdsorption 2aCations 2aCopperxmetabolism 2aEnergy Transfer 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLeadxmetabolism 2aModels, Theoretical 2aSolutions 2aMalvaceaexmetabolism. 2aTemperature 2aWater 2aWood 0aelectrolytes 0aLangmuir isotherm models 0abiosorbents 0aFreundlich isotherm models 0abiosorption 0aBrunner Emmert Teller isotherm models1 aUnuabonah, E.I.1 aOladoja, N.A.0 tBioresource technology.g2010 June, v. 101, no. 11 p.3844-3852dElsevier Ltd.x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2009.10.0643Available from publisher's Web site  a20100427b20100501c00000000  aINDdRSCe2010/04/27  aOther US 7aarticle02022naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245008000135300001600215300002400231500001500255520110700270650002001377650001101397650002201408650001601430650001501446651001801461653001601479700001801495700001501513773008101528852000901609939003301618945000801651946001301659655001201672991563418850742620221119142322.0870810e198611  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI870015852DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlinsmann, W.H.10aEvaluation of health aspects of sugars contained in carbohydrate sweeteners  ap.

It does not constitute GRAS approval of the sugars being discussed. The review, composed of a variety of topics, is divided into two parts: estimates of present levels of sugars intake and of recent trends in nutritive carbohydrate sweetener content of the food supply; and a review of recent scientific literature addressing potentially adverse health effects associated with sugars consumption. Estimates of consumer exposure to sugars were obtained from two sources: per capita disappearance data of sweeteners entering commercial channels; and from data from the 1977-78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey. Additionally, a data base was created for the study. Some included topics are dental caries, glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, heart disease, gallstones, food allergies and carcinogenicity.(jd-b) 3anutrient intake 3asugars 3afood availability 3afood safety 3asweeteners 3aUnited States 0afood supply1 aIrausquin, H.1 aPark, Y.K.0 tJournal of nutrition.g1986 Nov., v. 116, no. 11S p.S1-S216x0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19870810c00000000  aFNC  aOther US 7aarticle02105naa a2200505 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245014300150300001600293300003000309520066700339650001601006650002001022650001301042650002001055650001901075650001901094650002001113650001001133650000901143650002201152650001101174650001101185650002201196650002101218650002501239650002101264650002801285650002701313650002301340650002901363700001801392700001601410700001901426773007901445852000901524939003301533945000801566946001301574655001201587991563418300742620221119142509.0860505e198506  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI860104362DNAL7 a39988702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFinley, D.A.10aInorganic constituents of breast milk from vegetarian and nonvegetarian women: relationships with each other and with organic constituents  ap. 772-781.  ap. 772-781. ill., charts.  aA study of nutrient levels (minerals, trace elements, protein, lactose, total lipids) in breast milk from 52 women (half being vegetarians) during 20 months of lactation revealed similar levels Fe, Cu, Zn, Na, K, Ca, Mg, lactose and K decreased for the first 6 months of lactation; lipid, Na and Zn increased during later months while Ca decreased.

The molecular structure/property–affinity relationships of dietary polyphenols noncovalently binding to CHPP were investigated by comparing the binding constants obtained from the fluorescence titration method. An additional methoxy group in flavonoids increased their binding affinities for CHPP by 1.05 to 72.27 times. The hydroxylation on the 4′ position (ring B) of flavones and flavonols and the 5 position (ring A) of isoflavones weakened the binding affinities; however, the hydroxylation on other positions of flavonoids slightly enhanced or little affected the binding affinities for CHPP. The glycosylation of flavonoids weakened or slightly affected the affinities for CHPP by 1 order of magnitude. The hydrogenation of the C2═C3 double bond of flavone, 6-hydroxyflavone, 6-methoxyflavone and myricetin decreased the binding affinities about 10.02 to 17.82 times. The galloylation of catechins significantly improved the binding affinities with CHPP about 10 to 1000 times. The esterification of gallic acid increased its binding affinity. The binding affinities with CHPP were strongly influenced by the structural differences of dietary polyphenols. Polyphenols with higher affinities for purified HSA also showed stronger affinities with CHPP. The hydrophobic force played an important role in binding interaction between polyphenols and CHPP. 3agallic acid 3amyricetin 3apolyphenols 3aisoflavones 3ablood proteins 3ahumans 3aglycosylation 3afluorescence 3aesterification 3ablood plasma 3aflavanols 3abinding capacity 3ahydrogenation 3atitration 3ahydroxylation 2aBlood Proteinsxmetabolism 2aDiet 2aEsterification 2aFlavonoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGlycosylation 2aHumans 2aHydrogenation 2aHydroxylation 2aPolyphenolsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSerum Albuminxmetabolism 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0aflavonols1 aZhao, Yaru1 aWang, Hui1 aYuan, Yongming1 aYang, Fan1 aZhang, Chao1 aYamamoto, Kōichirō.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 59, no. 19 p.10747–10754-10747–10754x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20298293Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02293naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001900137245007400156300001600230500002400246520088800270650002501158650002201183650001801205650002501223650002101248650002001269650002401289650001401313650002301327650001001350650001101360650002101371650001401392650001101406650000901417650001101426650001401437700002001451700001901471700002201490773009001512852000901602856009301611930003301704945002501737946001301762655001201775IND4436046920221119142509.0100425e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443604692DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF200 0aF6001 aKrug, Brian A.10aGeranium leaf tissue nutrient sufficiency ranges by chronological age  ap. 339-350.  aIncludes references  aTwo cultivars of geranium (Pelargonium hortorum) were grown under five different fertilizer regimes, 50, 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg·L-1 nitrogen (N).

The dark-colored leaf cultivar contained higher nutrient concentrations, with the exception of magnesium, sulfur, iron, and copper, than the light-colored leaf cultivar. Compared to concentrations previously published for geraniums, concentration ranges observed in this study were narrower. In addition, this study accounted for differences in concentrations over the entire crop cycle and reflects levels associated with current fertilization practices. 3aPelargonium hortorum 3aornamental plants 3anursery crops 3anitrogen fertilizers 3afertilizer rates 3aplant nutrition 3areference standards 3aplant age 3atemporal variation 3acolor 3aleaves 3anutrient content 3amagnesium 3asulfur 3airon 3acopper 3acultivars1 aWhipker, Brian.1 aMcCall, Ingram1 aCleveland, Brenda0 tJournal of plant nutrition.g2010 , v. 33, no. 1-4 p.339-350dDekkerx0190-41677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/titles/01904167.asp3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100613b20100703c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/05/21  aOther US 7aarticle03302naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245015800129300001600287500017600303500001500479520207700494650002602571650001502597650002402612653002002636700002302656700002402679700002202703700002002725700001402745700001802759773009702777852000902874930003302883945001302916946001102929655001202940IND2061785720221119142348.0980210e199411  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206178572DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDidden, W.A.M.10aSoil meso- and macrofauna in two agricultural systems: factors affecting population dynamics and evaluation of their role in carbon and nitrogen dynamics  ap. 171-186.  aIn the special issue: Soil ecology of conventional and integrated arable farming systems / edited by L. Brussaard. Paper presented at a symposium held December 8-11, 1992.  a2019-12-05  aData on soil meso- and macrofauna from winter wheat fields in the Netherlands under conventional and integrated management were analysed to explain their population dynamics and to evaluate their contribution to carbon and nitrogen dynamics. To compare the functioning of the soil fauna in both systems, respiration and mineralisation were calculated on a daily basis, and canonical correspondence analysis was used to analyse the response of soil fauna to abiotic factors and to biotic factors of the previous sample date. Mainly because of the occurrence of earthworms, which were absent in the conventional system, soil fauna was clearly more important in the integrated system: integrated/conventional ratios of biomass and respiration were 58.43 and 6.49, respectively for soil meso- and macrofauna. An indication of a shift of bacterivorous to fungivorous fauna was found in the integrated system under the assumption that earthworms were 80% microbivorous and 20% saprophagous, but not when it was assumed that they were 100% saprophagous. It was calculated that meso- and macrofauna mineralised 3.3 kg N ha -1 year-1 in the conventional and 39.8 kg N ha-1 year-1 in the integrated system, or 4.3% and 39.4% of the total in situ mineralisation, respectively. Total faunal mineralisation was 49.1% and 86.6% of the total in situ mineralisation in conventional and integrated systems' respectively. It was found that in both systems, seasonal factors played an important role in explaining biomass dynamics and that in the course of time, the upper layer in the integrated system increased in importance. It appeared from the analyses that food relations may differ in the two systems, with probably more complicated and diverse relations occurring in the integrated system. Analysis of the results of this study in comparison with the results of a food web approach showed general agreement; the largest deviations occurred on lower trophic levels, which may be associated with the greater sensitivity of the food web approach to the accuracy of parameter estimates. 3alow input agriculture 3asoil fauna 3apopulation dynamics 0afarming systems1 aMarinissen, J.C.Y.1 aVreeken-Buijs, M.J.1 aBurgers, S.L.G.E.1 aFluiter, R. de.1 aGeurs, M.1 aBrussaard, L.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g1994 Nov., v. 51, no. 1/2 p.171-186x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03062naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001900175245012900194300001400323500002400337520154000361650001101901650001701912650002501929650002201954650002001976650002101996650001702017650001202034650002002046650005202066650002002118650003102138700001902169700001902188700001702207700001902224700001902243700001802262773010802280852000902388856008802397930003302485945002502518946001302543655001202556IND4436077820221119142434.0100427e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443607782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aF600 0aF2001 aHwang, In-Taek10aValidation of 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase as a potential herbicide target with lead compound triphenyltin acetate  ap. 24-31.  aIncludes references  aThe validation of potential herbicide target, 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid synthase (KAPAS) in the early step of biotin biosynthesis pathway, was performed in vitro and in vivo with lead chemical triphenyltin acetate (TPTA). KAPAS activity was completely inhibited by TPTA with an IC50 of 19.85 μM. 40-day-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants were killed with foliar treatment of 125 g ha−1 TPTA under the greenhouse conditions. The germination of A. thaliana seeds was also completely inhibited with 62.5 μM TPTA, but it was rescued to 85–92% with the supplement of biotin biosynthesis intermediates such as 0.5 mM of biotin, dethiobiotin, and 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, but not by 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). However, additional supplement of 0.5 mM S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) with 0.5 mM KAPA rescued up to 91% of the germination previously inhibited by the 50 μM TPTA. Also, biotin supplements alleviated the growth inhibition of 40-day-old A. thaliana plant. Foliar application of TPTA induced 8-fold higher substrate (l-alanine) accumulation in the treated A. thaliana plants. RNA expression for KAPAS transcripts were much fainter in the lane representing leaf tissue treated with TPTA. With these results, we report that SAM is an essential donor of amino groups for synthesis of the biotin precursor KAPA to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) synthesis in plants, that KAPAS is a potential herbicidal target site in the biotin biosynthesis pathway, and that TPTA might be one of the potential KAPAS inhibitors. 3abiotin 3abiosynthesis 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aenzyme inhibition 3aenzyme activity 3aseed germination 3aplant growth 3aalanine 3abioaccumulation 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agene expression 3agreenhouse experimentation1 aChoi, Jung-Sup1 aSong, Ha-Young1 aCho, Soo-Jin1 aLim, Hee-Kyung1 aPark, No-Joong1 aLee, Dong-Hee0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2010 May, v. 97, no. 1 p.24-31dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.11.0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/05/06  aOther US 7aarticle01721naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245011500171246013000286300001600416520075800432650001701190700001901207700001601226773009101242852000901333856005701342939003301399946001101432655001201443IND8205317620221119142703.0820604e198205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND820531762DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0862962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHutton, M.J.10aCytokinins in germinating seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris L.

Under conditions which stimulated germination and cotyledon expansion, the level of these cytokinins decreased rapidly in both intact embryos and excised cotyledons. In the excised cotyledons the decrease was continuous, resulting in very low levels of cytokinin being detected after 4 days of incubation. With the embryonic axis present, however, the initial decrease was arrested and reversed after 3 days. This suggests that the cotyledons do not synthesize cytokinins but that these hormones are imported from the embryonic axis, particularly once radicle growth is well under way. 3akidney beans1 aVan Staden, J.1 aDavey, J.E.0 tAnnals of botany.g1982 May, v. 49, no. 5 p.685-691wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a086296  a00000000b19820604c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03310naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008700127300001600214500002400230520209200254650002002346650001502366650001402381650001202395650002202407650001202429650001402441650001902455650002602474650001302500650001602513650001502529650001102544651001802555700001702573700001702590700001802607700001702625700001802642700001802660700001602678700001802694700001802712773010102730852000902831655001202840IND4462290620221119142604.0111116s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446229062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVories, E.D.10aDetermining the Optimum Timing for the Final Furrow Irrigation on Mid-South Cotton  ap. 737-745.  aIncludes references  aA common question from cotton farmers in the U.S. Mid-South is when to stop irrigating the crop. U.S. Cotton growers are adopting COTMAN to monitor crop development and aid in making end-of-season decisions concerning the optimal dates for safe termination of insect control and application of defoliants. The objective of this research was to investigate a similar crop-based recommendation for timing the final irrigation on cotton. Data sets from 28 Mid-South cotton fields conducting irrigation termination studies during the 2000 through 2007 growing seasons were analyzed. Day of year, days after planting, and growing degree days after planting, all until the last irrigation, did not provide a strong enough relationship with yield to guide late-season irrigation decisions. Days after nodes above white flower (NAWF)=5 (DA5) and growing degree days after NAWF=5 (GDDA5) of the last irrigation in the northern portion of the Mid-South did provide a yield impact estimate suitable for developing recommendations, but a relationship for fields south of 34°N latitude could not be established. Based on the resulting equations for a cotton price of $1.15 kg -1 of lint, an irrigation applied after 18 days or 192 GDD, 15.6°C base, after NAWF=5 would not be expected to produce enough additional yield to be profitable. The derived equations can also be used to determine the GDDA5 and DA5 of the last profitable irrigation for a known lint price and diesel cost, allowing the producer to react to his or her individual situation. Six of the fields were harvested twice and a later crop (i.e., a lower % first harvest) was associated with later irrigation, though the differences were not always significant. When fiber quality was measured, significant differences were seldom observed and no consistent trend relating to final irrigation was observed. However, because of the price discounts associated with low or high micronaire and the relationship between micronaire and crop maturity, additional research is needed to refine the fiber-quality relationship for the Mid-South. 3adata collection 3adefoliants 3aequations 3aflowers 3afurrow irrigation 3agrowers 3aheat sums 3ainsect control 3airrigation scheduling 3alatitude 3alint cotton 3amicronaire 3aprices 3aUnited States1 aGreene, J.K.1 aTeague, T.G.1 aStewart, J.H.1 aPhipps, B.J.1 aPringle, H.C.1 aClawson, E.L.1 aHogan, R.J.1 aO'Leary, P.F.1 aGriffin, T.W.0 tApplied engineering in agriculture.g2011, v. 27, no. 5 p.737-745wJournal:2058x0883-85427nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100001800175245008100193300001400274500002400288520152000312650001901832650002101851650001901872650001501891650000901906650002301915650002301938650002501961700002001986700002502006700002202031773010802053852000902161856008802170930003302258945002502291946001302316655001202329IND4436078320221119142601.0100427e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443607832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.11.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aL600 0aS2001 aKanbur, Murat14aThe effects of Saw palmetto on flumethrin-induced lipid peroxidation in rats  ap. 43-46.  aIncludes references  aIn the present study, 40 male Wistar albino rats were used and divided into 4 groups. The first group served as the control group; the second group was administered Saw palmetto extract at the dose of 20 mg/kg/bw; the third group was administered flumethrin at the dose of 15 mg/kg/bw; and the fourth group was administered a combination of 20 mg/kg/bw Saw palmetto extract and 15 mg/kg/bw flumethrin, for 21 days, orally. After the trial period, blood and tissue (liver, kidney and brain) samples were taken from the rats. Saw palmetto extract did not cause significant alterations in plasma and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, serum and tissue nitric oxide (NO) levels, erythrocyte and tissue superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities when compared to the controls (p > 0.05). Flumethrin led to increased plasma and tissue MDA levels, serum and tissue NO levels, tissue GSH-Px activities and decreased erythrocyte and tissue SOD and CAT activities, and erythrocyte GSH-Px activity, compared to the controls (p < 0.05). The flumethrin and Saw palmetto extract combination increased erythrocyte SOD activity and decreased brain GSH-Px activity as compared to flumethrin (p < 0.05). In conclusion, it was determined that Saw palmetto extract did not cause any negative effect on the prooxidant–antioxidant balance. While flumethrin stimulated lipid peroxidation; Saw palmetto extract at the dose of 20 mg/kg/bw did not exhibit enough antioxidant effect in rats. 3aSerenoa repens 3amedicinal plants 3aplant extracts 3aflumethrin 3arats 3alaboratory animals 3alipid peroxidation 3aantioxidant activity1 aErasian, Gokhan1 aSarica, Zeynep Soyer1 aAltinordulu, Sule0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2010 May, v. 97, no. 1 p.43-46dAcademic Pressx0048-35757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2009.11.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100506b20100605c00000000  aINDdGAYe2010/05/06  aOther US 7aarticle03082naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245013300134300001600267520185200283650001902135650001002154650001902164650001302183650001502196650002002211650001502231650002402246650001302270650001802283650001802301650002602319651001602345653001502361653001602376700002002392700002302412700001902435700001902454773009702473852000902570930003302579945001302612946001102625655001202636IND2332030720221119142552.0030417e200211  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233203072DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOndersteijn, C.J.M.14aThe Dutch Mineral Accounting System and the European Nitrate Directive: implications for N and P management and farm performance  ap. 283-296.  aAgricultural nutrients can be a significant source of groundwater pollution. This paper studies the possible effects on farm management of a newly introduced policy instrument to control nitrogen and phosphorus pollution of groundwater bodies in The Netherlands. Ecological, technical, political, as well as financial issues, associated with the agricultural nutrient pollution problem, are considered. In response to the concern of the European Community (EC) for pollution of groundwater, The Netherlands implemented the Mineral Accounting System (MINAS), which focusses on nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus flows) on individual farms, and taxes farms whose nutrient surplus exceeds a defined limit. To investigate the implications of MINAS for individual farm performance, financial and nutrient bookkeeping data of 194 farms, distributed over five farm types, were collected from 1997 through 1999. This paper shows that nutrient management performance of farmers varied largely between and within farm types, not only in absolute figures but also in terms of nutrient efficiency. The study also indicated that levies or taxes for excess nutrient surpluses could be high, ranging from euro 179 ha(-1) for arable farmers to euro 404 ha(-1) for mixed dairy and intensive livestock producers. These levies would reduce gross margin (GM) by 8% on average and can threaten continuity on an individual farm level. Therefore, current performance has to change considerably for farmers to be able to make the final surplus standards in 2003. Furthermore, as a consequence of objections of the EC to the Dutch policy, application standards for manure were introduced. This study showed that this does not prove to guarantee safe nutrient management as well as MINAS does, but will impact financial performance more, due to higher manure disposal costs. 3aanimal manures 3afarms 3asoil fertility 3anitrogen 3aphosphorus 3asoil management 3acrop yield 3aagricultural policy 3aleaching 3adata analysis 3aprofitability 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aNetherlands 0aefficiency 0aperformance1 aBeldman, A.C.G.1 aDaatselaar, C.H.G.1 aGiesen, G.W.J.1 aHuirne, R.B.M.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2002 Nov., v. 92, no. 2/3 p.283-296x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02090naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245006400168300001600232500001500248520088300263653002501146653001801171653002701189653002001216653002201236653004401258653001401302653002101316653002701337653001701364653000901381653002801390700002601418773011001444852000901554856008501563930003301648946001101681655001201692IND4429363520221119142331.0091127e201002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442936352DNAL7 a10.1007/s00199-008-0420-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCann, Robert J. 10aOptimal partition of a large labor force into working pairs  ap. 375-395.  a2019-12-11  aKremer and Maskin (Wage inequality and segregation by skill.

They used it to analyze the impact of technological change and widening skill gaps on labor market segregation. The present paper extends their model to a workforce with multidimensional skill types, continuously distributed, and gives a mathematical analysis of the extension. Pure and mixed notions of optimal pairing are introduced, which play an important role in the formulation and analysis of the model. The existence and uniqueness of such pairings are established using techniques from the theory of optimal transportation and infinite-dimensional linear programming. 0aAssortative matching 0aFree boundary 0aOptimal transportation 0aTask allocation 0aMonge-Kantorovich 0aInfinite-dimensional linear programming 0aMarginals 0aWage segregation 0aMultidimensional types 0aproductivity 0aRole 0aOptimal decision theory1 aTrokhimtchouk, Maxim 0 tEconomic theory.g2010 Feb., v. 42, no. 2 p.375-395dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0938-22597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00199-008-0420-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20091127b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02074naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110024003200131040001800163100001800181245007000199300001800269520060600287650002900893650002500922650002700947650001200974650001500986650000801001650002601009650001801035650003901053650002001092650002801112650003701140650005901177650004101236653001701277653002401294700001701318773008601335852000901421856008201430930003301512945001301545946001101558990002301569655001201592IND2037509120221119142400.0940224e19930811enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203750912DNAL7 a83673022pmid7 aPMC3099072pmcid7 a10.1093/nar/21.16.38512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaymond, W.E.10aRAD50 protein of S. cerevisiae exhibits ATP-dependent DNA binding  ap. 3851-3856.  aRAD50 function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required during vegetative growth for recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks, and during meiosis for initiation of meiotic recombination and formation of synaptonemal complex.

We report the sequence of RIM1 and functional analysis of its coding region. The RIM1 gene product (RIM1) contains three regions similar to C2H2 zinc fingers. Serine substitutions for cysteine in each of the putative zinc fingers abolish RIM1 function. The carboxyl-terminus of RIM1 is enriched in acidic amino acids and is required for full RIM1 activity. RIM1 also contains two putative cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) phosphorylation sites. At one site, substitution of alanine for serine does not affect RIM1 activity; at the other site, this substitution impairs activity. This analysis of RIM1 suggests that the protein may function as a transcriptional activator. We have used the cloned RIM1 gene to create a complete rim1 deletion. This null allele, like previously isolated rim1 mutations, causes a partial meiotic defect. In addition to RIM1, maximum IME1 expression requires the MCK1 and IME4 gene products. Defects associated with rim1, mck1, and ime4 mutations in expression of a meiotic reporter gene (ime2- lacZ) and in sporulation are additive. These findings suggest that RIM1 acts independently of MCK1 and IME4 to stimulate IME1 expression. 3astructural genes 3aDNA 3amutagenesis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3abinding sites 3anucleotide sequences 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aphosphorylation 3ameiosis 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungal 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgenetics 2aDiploidy 2aExons 2aFungal Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenes, Regulator 2aMeiosis 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNuclear Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aPhenotype 2aRepressor Proteins 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSpores, Fungal 2aTranscription Factors 0aime1 gene 0arim1 gene 0agenetic regulation 0atranscriptional activators 0amutation 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x72960 0adeletions 0arim1 protein1 aMitchell, A.P.0 tNucleic acids research.g1993 Aug. 11, v. 21, no. 16 p.3789-3797x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/21.16.37893Available from publisher's Web site  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02044naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245010500170300001600275520100700291653001801298653000901316653001701325653000901342653001601351700002101367700001701388700001801405700002401423773012101447852000901568856008501577930003301662946001101695655001201706IND4422843720221119142539.0090703e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442284372DNAL7 a10.1007/s12145-009-0022-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSom de Cerff, W.

All could be accomplishable using Grid. Different Grid middleware solutions exist and are being developed. In DEGREE (Dissemination and Exploitation of Grids in Earth sciencE) the aim was to disseminate and promote uptake of Grid in ES and to create a bridge between ES and Grid communities. DEGREE identified key ES requirements and has disseminated these to Grid projects, evaluated Grid middleware tools and standards regarding ES requirements and provided feedback to Grid developers. In order to convey requirements to the Grid community, test suite specifications were developed. Test suites provide real applications for testing functional and non-functional aspects of Grid, contrary to typical whiteboard tests or use cases. In this paper the GOMEVAL test suite is explained in detail and the results obtained are discussed. 0aEarth science 0aGrid 0aRequirements 0aTest 0aTest suites1 aPetitdidier, M. 1 aGemünd, A. 1 aHorstink, L. 1 aSchwichtenberg, H. 0 tEarth science informatics.g2009 June, v. 2, no. 1-2 p.117-131dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1865-04817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12145-009-0022-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090703b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02753naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117072000900135100002200144245008700166300001600253500002400269500001500293520139600308650002301704650001701727650002801744650002601772650002201798650001701820650001801837651001001855653003301865653002801898653001501926653003501941653002101976653001801997700002102015773010602036852000902142856007502151930003302226945002502259946001102284655001202295IND4436036220221119142355.0100423e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443603622DNAL7 a10.1002/ird.4652doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP2101 aBatt, Hussein Aly10aWater management and user association analysis for irrigation improvement in Egypt  ap. 150-160.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA participatory irrigation management policy has been adopted by the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation over the past two decades to support agricultural productivity, decrease open-channel conveyance losses, and increase agricultural water distribution equity. Two recent projects that dealt with the introduction of this policy in the Nile Delta through improvement projects are the irrigation improvement project (IIP) by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in Bahr El-Nor, and the integrated water management districts (IWMDs) by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in El-Ibrahimia. The implementation of these projects and their associated policies promoted the evolution and sustainability of these policies.An analysis of case studies for these projects, taking into account four dimensions of improvement and sustainability, shows that farmers were reluctant to accept the policies because they lacked training on various irrigation system improvement techniques, as introduced through the projects. Thus, the current focus should be on the reform of irrigation system improvement policies so that they are more realistic, and ultimately more successful, supporting agriculture and encouraging Ministry personnel to adopt and support participatory water management as implemented in the targeted Egyptian irrigation projects. 3afarmers' attitudes 3awater policy 3asustainable agriculture 3airrigation management 3airrigated farming 3acase studies 3aorganizations 3aEgypt 0airrigation management policy 0awater user associations 0airrigation 0aparticipatory water management 0awater management 0aparticipation1 aMerkley, Gary P.0 tIrrigation and drainage.g2010 Apr., v. 59, no. 2 p.150-160dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1531-03537nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ird.4653Available from publisher's Web site  a20110531b20110603c00000000  aINDdRHFe2010/05/10  aNon-US 7aarticle03754naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100003000178245010000208300001800308500002400326506007600350520183000426506003702256650004702293650002002340650000902360650001902369650001402388650002202402650001302424650001402437650001002451650001902461650001202480650001202492650001102504650001502515650001202530650002402542650000902566650001302575650001002588650001502598650001902613650001002632650001902642650002202661650001102683650001102694650000902705650001202714650003702726650000902763700002802772700001302800700001702813700002302830700002402853773010502877852000902982856007702991655001203068IND4384179720221207100808.0061007s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438417972DNAL7 a170032982pmid7 aPMC32108332pmcid7 a10.2337/dc06-09742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMayer-Davis, Elizabeth J.10aBreast-Feeding and Risk for Childhood Obesity: Does maternal diabetes or obesity status matter?  ap. 2231-2237.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE:-- We sought to evaluate whether maternal diabetes or weight status attenuates a previously reported beneficial effect of breast-feeding on childhood obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-- Growing Up Today Study (GUTS) participants were offspring of women who participated in the Nurses' Health Study II. In the present study, 15,253 girls and boys (aged 9-14 years in 1996) were included. Maternal diabetes and weight status and infant feeding were obtained by maternal self-report. We defined maternal overweight as BMI >=25 kg/m2. Childhood obesity, from self-reported height and weight, was based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions as normal, at risk for overweight, or overweight. Maternal status categories were nondiabetes/normal weight, nondiabetes/overweight, or diabetes. Logistic regression models used generalized estimating equations to account for nonindependence between siblings. RESULTS:-- For all subjects combined, breast-feeding was associated with reduced overweight (compared with normal weight) in childhood. Compared with exclusive use of formula, the odds ratio (OR) for exclusive breast-feeding was 0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.82), adjusted for age, sex, and Tanner stage. Results did not differ according to maternal status (nondiabetes/normal weight OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.49-1.09]; nondiabetes/overweight 0.75 [0.57-0.99]; and diabetes 0.62 [0.24-1.60]). Further adjustment for potential confounders attenuated results, but results remained consistent across strata of maternal status (P value for interaction was 0.50). CONCLUSIONS:-- Breast-feeding was inversely associated with childhood obesity regardless of maternal diabetes status or weight status. These data provide support for all mothers to breast-feed their infants to reduce the risk for childhood overweight.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3abody mass index 3aboys 3abreast feeding 3achildhood 3achildhood obesity 3adiabetes 3aequations 3agirls 3ainfant feeding 3ainfants 3amothers 3anurses 3aodds ratio 3aprogeny 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3asiblings 3awomen 2aAdolescent 2aBreast Feeding 2aChild 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMothers 2aObesityxepidemiologyxetiology. 2aRisk1 aRifas-Shiman, Sheryl L.1 aZhou, Li1 aHu, Frank B.1 aColditz, Graham A.1 aGillman, Matthew W.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.2231-2237dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-09743Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02218naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007100127300001400198520123700212650002201449650002701471650002201498650001601520650002901536650002101565650002101586650001901607653002101626653002001647653001401667653001401681700001401695700002001709773006201729852000901791939003301800946001101833655001201844IND9303604520221119142533.0930614e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrallert, B.12aA study of integrative trasnformation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe  ap. 26-32.  aUsing the one-step gene disruption technique, we studied the effect of various parameters on the disruption frequency (percentage of homologous integrants) and transformation efficiency (number of transformants per microgram of input DNA) of integrative transformation in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We used suc1 as the target gene for disruption and ura4 as the selectable marker. Our results are as follows. 1) Use of the strong adh1 promoter to drive the expression of ura4 did not affect the disruption frequency but modestly increased the transformation efficiency. 2) The transformation method had a profound effect, with the lithium acetate method yielding both a 10-fold higher disruption frequency compared to the protoplast method and a 5- to 10-fold higher transformation efficiency. 3) The presence of increasing amounts of non-homologous sequences at the ends of the transforming DNA decreased the disruption frequency by up to 5-fold but had no effect on the transformation efficiency. We also describe the use of the sup3-5 allele in an ade6-704 genetic background to discriminate between the products of homologous versus non-homologous integration, thereby promoting the identification of rare homologous integrants. 3aSaccharomycetales 3agenetic transformation 3adirect DNA uptake 3amutagenesis 3ahomologous recombination 3astructural genes 3apromoter regions 3agene targeting 0aacetates (salts) 0alithium acetate 0asuc1 gene 0aura4 gene1 aNurse, P.1 aPatterson, T.E.0 tMGG.g1993 Apr., v. 238, no. 1/2 p.26-32x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012700130300001400257520145900271650002601730650002701756650001901783650002001802650001801822650002201840650002101862650001301883650004501896650002501941653002301966653001401989653001302003653001302016700001802029700002002047773006202067852000902129939003302138946001102171655001202182IND9303605020221119142651.0930614e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuren, F.H.J.12aA homologous gene-reporter system for the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune based on internally deleted homologous genes  ap. 91-96.  aProblems encountered in our attempts to achieve expression of heterologous genes, driven by ascomycetous regulatory sequences, in homobasidiomycetes led us to develop a gene-reporter system based on the expression of homologous genes in Schizophyllum commune. Internal deletions were made in the coding sequences of the regulated Sc4 gene and the constitutively expressed GPD gene. After introduction of these constructs into S. commune it was found that the expected truncated transcripts were produced. The internally deleted Sc4 gene, containing 1140 bp of upstream and 200 bp of downstream sequences, was only expressed in dikaryons at the time of fruiting (as was the resident Sc4 gene) but not at all in monokaryons, indicating that the construct contained all regulatory sequences necessary and sufficient to confer control by the mating-type genes and expression during fruiting. The internally deleted GPD gene, containing 1300 bp of upstream and 150 bp of downstream sequences, was expressed both in monokaryons and dikaryons at levels similar to those of the resident GPD gene, indicating that all sequences necessary for proper expression were present. This reporter-gene system may be applicable to the analysis of cis-regulatory sequences of these genes. Furthermore, heterologous genes may be inserted into the well-expressed GPD deletion construct to obtain expression of such genes in S. commune and possibly in other homobasidiomycetes. 3aSchizophyllum commune 3agenetic transformation 3areporter genes 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aplant development 3astructural genes 3aproteins 3aglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3acell wall components 0agenetic regulation 0adeletions 0agpd gene 0asc4 gene1 aHarmsen, M.C.1 aWessels, J.G.H.0 tMGG.g1993 Apr., v. 238, no. 1/2 p.91-96x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03495naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245013200177300001700309500002400326520210000350650001102450650001702461650001902478650001202497650001302509650001202522650002602534650001802560650001802578650001902596650002002615650002402635653002902659653001002688653002302698653001902721653002502740700002002765700002202785700002702807773010202834852000902936856009202945655001203037IND4404228820221119142334.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440422882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01959.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEFFENBERGER, MICHAEL10aDisturbance history influences the distribution of stream invertebrates by altering microhabitat parameters: a field experiment  ap. 996-1011.  aIncludes references  a1. We investigated the effects of local disturbance history and several biotic and abiotic habitat parameters on the microdistribution of benthic invertebrates after an experimental disturbance in a flood-prone German stream. 2. Bed movement patterns during a moderate flood were simulated by scouring and filling stream bed patches (area 0.49 m²) to a depth of 15-20 cm. Invertebrates were investigated using ceramic tiles as standardized substrata. After 1, 8, 22, 29, 36 and 50 days, we sampled one tile from each of 16 replicates of three bed stability treatments (scour, fill and stable controls). For each tile, we also determined water depth, near-bed current velocity, the grain size of the substratum beneath the tile, epilithic algal biomass and standing stock of particulate organic matter (POM). 3. Shortly after disturbance, total invertebrate density, taxon richness and density of the common taxa Baetis spp. and Chironomidae were highest in stable patches. Several weeks after disturbance, by contrast, Baetis spp. and Hydropsychidae were most common in fill and Leuctra spp. in scour patches. The black fly Simulium spp. was most abundant in fill patches from the first day onwards. Community evenness was highest in scour patches during the entire study. 4. Local disturbance history also influenced algal biomass and POM standing stock at the beginning of the experiment, and water depth, current velocity and substratum grain size throughout the experiment. Scouring mainly exposed finer substrata and caused local depressions in the stream bed characterized by slower near-bed current velocity. Algal biomass was higher in stable and scour patches and POM was highest in scour patches. In turn, all five common invertebrate taxa were frequently correlated with one or two of these habitat parameters. 5. Our results suggest that several 'direct' initial effects of local disturbance history on the invertebrates were subsequently replaced by 'indirect' effects of disturbance history (via disturbance-induced changes in habitat parameters such as current velocity or food). 3aBaetis 3aChironomidae 3aHydropsychidae 3aLeuctra 3aSimulium 3abiomass 3afield experimentation 3ainvertebrates 3amicrohabitats 3aorganic matter 3astream channels 3asurface water level 0aexperimental disturbance 0aflood 0ahabitat parameters 0apatch dynamics 0astream invertebrates1 aEngel, Johanna.1 aDiehl, Sebastian.1 aMATTHAEI, CHRISTOPH D.0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.996-1011dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01959.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02718naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245016200125300001600287500001500303520120500318650002701523650002101550650002001571650002101591650001701612650001301629650001901642650002501661650001501686650002301701650001901724650001201743650002001755650002001775650002901795650002101824653001901845653002801864653001401892653002701906653001401933653002301947653002501970653001401995700001902009700001502028700001602043773006402059852000902123939003302132946001102165655001202176IND9303605420221119142509.0930614e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBecker, A.10aAnalysis of the Rhizobium meliloti exoH/exoK/exoL fragment: ExoK shows homology to excreted endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases and ExoH resembles membrane proteins  ap. 145-154.  a2019-12-04  aNucleotide sequencing of a 4.15 kb DNA fragment from megaplasmid 2 of Rhizobium meliloti 2011 revealed the location of the genes exoH, exoK and exoL. The putative proteins encoded by these genes have molecular weights of 41, 30, and 44 kDa, respectively. The hydrophobicity profile of the ExoH amino acid sequence resembles that of transmembrane proteins. The predicted exoL gene product does not contain hydrophobic regions, indicating a cytoplasmic localization. The exoK gene product is characterized by a putative signal peptide and exhibits significant homology to endo-beta-1,3-1,4-glucanases of bacilli and Clostridium thermocellum. R. meliloti exoK mutants induced pink nodules and synthesized a reduced amount of exopolysaccharide (EPS). Colonies of this mutant showed a delay in the appearance of the Calcofluor white fluorescence. In addition, the formation of the characteristic halo was strongly delayed. R. meliloti exoL and exoH mutants induced pseudonodules. The exoH, but not the exoL mutant, synthesized an EPS that could be precipitated by cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) and also by ethanol.

The Z locus was shown to be located in a 482 bp sequence in the 5' upstream region of an open reading frame, P, by subcloning various DNA fragments in a plasmid replicating via the ARS1 sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome. Northern analysis revealed that the Z region is not transcribed in either the native host Z. rouxii or the heterologous host S. cerevisiae. The Z region is protected from micrococcal nuclease attack in Z. rouxii but not in S. cerevisiae, its protection depending on the product of the S gene encoded by pSR1. Gel retardation assays suggested that a factor present in nuclear extracts of Z. rouxii cells, irrespective of the presence or absence of a resident PSR1 plasmid, binds to a 111 bp RsaI-SacII sequence in the Z region. These findings suggest that a host protein binds to the Z locus and that the S product interacts with this DNA-protein complex and stabilizes pSR1. 3aloci 3arestriction mapping 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aplasmids 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3achromatin 0aSaccharomycetales 0az locus 0as protein 0astability 0as gene1 aAwane, K.1 aIrie, K.1 aKaisho, Y.1 aNaito, A.1 aOshima, Y.0 tMGG.g1993 Apr., v. 238, no. 1/2 p.120-128x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02796naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245010200183300001600285500002400301520115400325650002201479650002201501650002801523650001001551650001901561650002401580650001901604650002201623650001601645650002401661650003201685650001801717650004201735650004201777650001801819650002801837650003101865650003801896650001401934650003101948650003601979650003602015700002402051700001902075773009002094852000902184856008502193655001202278IND4404342720221119142410.0080412s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440434272DNAL7 a183477982pmid7 a10.1007/s00294-008-0185-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBraumann, Ilka10aRepeat induced point mutation in two asexual fungi, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum  ap. 287-297.  aIncludes references  aRepeat induced point mutation (RIP) is a gene silencing mechanism present in fungal genomes. During RIP, duplicated sequences are efficiently and irreversibly mutated by transitions from C:G to T:A. For the first time, we have identified traces of RIP in transposable elements of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysogenum, two biotechnologically relevant fungi. We found that RIP in P. chrysogenum has affected a large set of sequences, which also contain other mutations. On the other hand, RIP in A. niger is limited to only few sequences, but literally all mutations are RIP-like. Surprisingly, RIP occurred only in transposon sequences that have disrupted open reading frames in A. niger, a phenomenon not yet reported for other fungi. In both fungal species, we identified two sequences with strong sequence similarity to Neurospora crassa RID. RID is a putative DNA methyltransferase and the only known enzyme involved in the RIP process. Our findings suggest that both A. niger and P. chrysogenum either had a sexual past or have a sexual potential. These findings have important implications for future strain development of these fungi. 3aAspergillus niger 3aNeurospora crassa 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3afungi 3agene silencing 3aopen reading frames 3apoint mutation 3asequence homology 3atransposons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nigerxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Modification Methylasesxgenetics 2aDNA Transposable Elementsxphysiology 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aPenicillium chrysogenumxgenetics 2aPhylogeny 2aPoint Mutationxphysiology 2aReproduction, Asexualxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid1 avan den Berg, Marco1 aKempken, Frank0 tCurrent genetics.g2008 May, v. 53, no. 5 p.287-297dSpringer-Verlagx0172-80837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-008-0185-y3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02133naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012200127300001300249520112100262650001301383650002901396650002101425650002501446650002501471650001501496650001201511650002901523653002301552653002001575653002801595653001901623700001501642773006101657852000901718939003301727946001101760655001201771IND9303604320221119142633.0930614e199304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsuura, A.10aCharacterization of the MKS1 gene, a new negative regulator of the Ras-cyclic AMP pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 6-16.  aIn order to isolate genes that function downstream of the Ras-cAMP pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a YEp13-based genomic library was screened for clones that inhibit growth of cells with diminished A-kinase activity. One such gene, MKS1, was found to encode a hydrophilic 52 kDa protein that shares weak homology with the yeast SPT2/SIN1 gene product. Three lines of evidence suggest that the MKS1 gene product is a negative regulator downstream of the Ras-cAMP pathway: (i) overexpression of MKS1 inhibits growth of cyr1 disruptant cells on YPD medium containing a low concentration of cAMP; (ii) overexpression of MKS1 does not affect TPK1 expression; and (iii) the temperature-sensitive cyr1-230 mutation is partially suppressed by mks1 disruption. The mks1 mutant shows similar phenotypes to gal11/spt13, i.e., it cannot grow on YPGal containing ethidium bromide at 25 degrees C, or on YPGly or SGal at 37 degrees C. The mks1 gal11 double mutant shows more marked phenotypic changes than the single mutants. These results suggest that MKS1 is involved in transcriptional regulation of several genes by cAMP. 3aproteins 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3acyclic AMP 3amutants 3atranscription (genetics) 0agenetic regulation 0ainhibitor genes 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/d137151 aAnraku, Y.0 tMGG.g1993 Apr., v. 238, no. 1/2 p.6-16x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02370naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245011100177300001600288500002400304520120300328650001001531650001001541650001301551650001501564650001501579650001701594650001701611650001201628651001501640653002101655653001801676653001201694653002501706700001501731700002501746773010001771852000901871856009201880655001201972IND4405437920221119142610.0080509s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440543792DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01908.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFREEMAN, AMANDA N.D.14aThe impact of Tropical Cyclone Larry on bird communities in fragments of the endangered rainforest Type 5b  ap. 532-540.  aIncludes references  aBird surveys were conducted to assess the impact of a severe cyclone on bird communities in three fragments of the endangered rainforest Type 5b on the Atherton Tablelands of far north Queensland. Bird communities were surveyed using timed area searches in three sites in each of the three fragments and were undertaken prior to and following Tropical Cyclone Larry. Cyclone Larry caused short-term changes in the abundance of some species of birds in Type 5b rainforest fragments. Two weeks after the storm, in two of three fragments surveyed, abundance of the frugivorous wompoo fruit-dove (Ptilinopus magnificus) and figbird (Sphecotheres viridis) had decreased while the omnivorous Macleay's honeyeater (Xanthotis macleayana) and Lewin's honeyeater (Meliphaga lewinii) decreased in abundance in all three locations. Most insectivorous species increased in some sites and decreased in others following Cyclone Larry. Rapid recovery of bird communities to approximately their pre-cyclone state after only 7 months appeared to reflect the capacity of species to either modify their foraging behaviour, switch foods, or to move within or between fragments or to other food sources in the landscape. 3abirds 3afoods 3aforaging 3afrugivores 3ahurricanes 3ainsectivores 3arain forests 3asurveys 3aQueensland 0abird communities 0aCyclone Larry 0aType 5b 0arainforest fragments1 aPIAS, KYLE1 aVINSON, MAGDALENA F.0 tAustral ecology.g2008 June, v. 33, no. 4 p.532-540dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01908.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03560naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245014100124300001600265500017600281520242500457650002402882650002602906651001602932700001602948700001602964700001802980700002202998700001803020700002103038773009703059852000903156930003303165945001303198946001103211655001203222IND2061785420221119142546.0980210e199411  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206178542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBloem, J.10aDynamics of microorganisms, microbivores and nitrogen mineralisation in winter wheat fields under conventional and integrated management  ap. 129-143.  aIn the special issue: Soil ecology of conventional and integrated arable farming systems / edited by L. Brussaard. Paper presented at a symposium held December 8-11, 1992.  aTo reduce environmental problems, integrated farming has been proposed, which may involve a considerable reduction of fertiliser-N input. A reduced fertiliser-N input must be compensated for by a higher N mineralisation from organic matter. To reduce losses and to facilitate optimal use of the N mineralised for crop growth, knowledge of the effects of management on soil organisms and on their role in N cycling is needed. Therefore, biomass and activity of bacteria, biomasses of fungi, bacterivorous amoebae, flagellates and nematodes, and in situ N mineralisation were monitored during a full year in a winter wheat field under conventional management (CONY) and integrated management (INT). Fungal biomass was about 100-fold lower than bacterial biomass. The average bacterial biomass was not significantly higher in INT than in CONY, whereas amoebae and nematodes were 64% and 22% higher, respectively. Average N mineralisation was 30% higher in INT. The differences are attributed to the approximately 30% higher organic matter content of INT. Bacterial biomass and frequency of dividing-divided cells (FDDC) were relatively low in December and January, probably owing to temperatures just above 0 degrees C. At about 5 degrees C in February and March, relatively high FDDC values and a doubling of bacteria occurred. During summer, FDDC values were relatively low and bacterial numbers were stable, probably owing to nutrient limitation. After harvest and skim ploughing, rapid increases in FDDC and bacteria were found. In the non-fumigated INT field, protozoan peaks coincided with the bacterial peak, whereas in CONV bacterivorous fauna were drastically reduced by soil fumigation. Nevertheless, the bacterial peaks were similar in CONV and INT, indicating that bacteria were not controlled by bacterivores. Nitrogen mineralisation was relatively low in winter. The increased bacterial growth in February and March, and in September appeared to enhance immobilisation rather than mineralisation of N. During the growing season from April to the end of August, bacterial growth was relatively low and N mineralisation was relatively high. This probably resulted from bacterivore feeding and from substrate- or nutrient-limited bacteria with a low growth efficiency. Considerable mineralisation rates after harvest confirmed the need for measures to stimulate immobilisation during periods without crop uptake. 3asoil microorganisms 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aNetherlands1 aLebbink, G.1 aZwart, K.B.1 aBouwman, L.A.1 aBurgers, S.L.G.E.1 aVos, J.A. de.1 aRuiter, P.C. de.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g1994 Nov., v. 51, no. 1/2 p.129-143x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle03510naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002100156245013900177300001800316500002400334520196800358650001202326650001302338650002602351650004302377650001302420650001802433650000902451650002402460650002802484650003802512650005702550650001102607650001102618650000902629650001902638650001602657650001402673650001702687650002202704700002502726700002302751700002002774700001902794773010502813852000902918856007702927655001203004IND4384180220221119142359.0061007s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438418022DNAL7 a170033032pmid7 a10.2337/dc06-06172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThoolen, Bart J.10aPsychological Outcomes of Patients With Screen-Detected Type 2 Diabetes: The influence of time since diagnosis and treatment intensity  ap. 2257-2262.  aIncludes references  aOBJECTIVE:--The objective of this study was to investigate how time since diagnosis and treatment intensity influence psychological outcomes in patients with screen-detected type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--A 2 x 2 factorial cross-sectional design was used to examine psychological outcomes in 196 patients with screen-detected diabetes diagnosed 3-33 months previously who were receiving usual care or intensive multifactorial pharmacological treatment. Outcomes included anxiety, depression, diabetes-related distress, perceived seriousness and vulnerability, self-efficacy, and self-care. Multivariate analysis was used to examine variations in outcomes based on time since diagnosis (<1 vs. 2-3 years) and treatment intensity. RESULTS:--Most patients reported little distress, low perceived seriousness and vulnerability, high self-efficacy, and low self-care, but outcomes varied considerably across conditions. Time effects were found for perceived vulnerability, which increases significantly with time since diagnosis. Time x treatment interactions were found for anxiety, diabetes-related distress, and self-efficacy; notably, intensively treated patients showed more distress and less self-efficacy in the 1st year, and usual-care patients reported more distress and less self-efficacy 2-3 years after diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS:--Screen-detected patients generally do not experience much difficulty with their condition in the first few years, but early and intensive treatment can influence patients' psychological outcomes, leading to relatively more anxiety and less self-efficacy in the 1st year after diagnosis but not necessarily improving self-care. This suggests that intensive treatments confront patients with their diabetes earlier on whereas milder treatments may delay confrontation. This finding should be taken into account in the development and timing of psychological interventions for patients with newly diagnosed diabetes. 3aanxiety 3adistress 3amultivariate analysis 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aself-efficacy 2aAged 2aAnxietyxpsychology 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDepressionxetiologyxpsychology. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xdrug therapyxpsychology. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMass Screening 2aMiddle Aged 2aSelf Care 2aTime Factors 2aTreatment Outcome1 ade Ridder, Denise T.1 aBensing, Jozien M.1 aGorter, Kees J.1 aRutten, Guy E.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.2257-2262dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-06173Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02025naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245008100132300001400213500017600227500001500403520097100418650001501389650001301404650002201417650002601439650001001465653002001475653001101495700002001506773009501526852000901621930003301630945001301663946001101676655001201687IND2061785120221119142215.0980210e199411  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206178512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchoonderbeek, D.10aRoot and root-soil contact of winter wheat in relation to soil macroporosity  ap. 89-98.  aIn the special issue: Soil ecology of conventional and integrated arable farming systems / edited by L.

Macroporosity was measured on vertically oriented thin sections, whereas root parameters were quantified on horizontal thin sections. Macroporosity was quantified using porosity photograms. Roots were quantified directly on the thin sections using a microscope with several light sources. The micromorphometric measurements were performed with a Quantimet 970 image analyser. Two hypotheses were tested: (a) different farm management systems are responsible for different soil macroporosities; (b) a relationship exists between macroporosity and root-soil contact in the topsoils of conventional and integrated farm management systems. 3amacropores 3aporosity 3aTriticum aestivum 3alow input agriculture 3aroots 0afarming systems 0agrowth1 aSchoute, J.F.T.0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g1994 Nov., v. 51, no. 1/2 p.89-98x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02613naa a2200253 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245012800133300001400261500017600275520167200451650002002123650002602143653001702169773009502186852000902281930003302290945001302323946001102336655001202347IND2061785020221119142404.0980210e199411  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206178502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarinissen, J.C.Y.10aEarthworm populations and stability of soil structure in a silt loam soil of a recently reclaimed polder in the Netherlands  ap. 75-87.  aIn the special issue: Soil ecology of conventional and integrated arable farming systems / edited by L. Brussaard. Paper presented at a symposium held December 8-11, 1992.  aEarthworms are believed to be beneficial to the quality of the soil structure. An important aspect of quality of soil structure is the stability of aggregates. The influence of earthworms on soil structure stability was investigated in a silt loam soil under "conventional" (high-input) and "integrated" (reduced-input) management. Aggregates from the top 5 cm of soil were sampled, air dried and analysed for their size distribution and water stability. Drysieved aggregate size distribution did not differ appreciably among fields and between years, so aggregates of a certain size represented a similar fraction of the soil for all fields. The wet-sieving procedure, used to measure aggregate stability, yielded highly reproducible results. Within-field variability of the stability was lower than between-field variability, so in further sampling only one mixed sample per field was analysed for soil structure stability. Analysing only a large and a small aggregate fraction was enough to evaluate aggregate stability in this study, as there was a gradual increase in stability from large to smaller aggregates. A 2 year time series of samples was analysed for earthworm population density and aggregate stability. Aggregate stability showed a seasonal pattern and was correlated significantly with earthworm density. Other factors influencing aggregate stability were management history in the conventional and integrated fields and, for a wider range of fields, organic matter content of the soil. The lower plastic limit, another stability parameter, was influenced mainly by organic matter and clay content, and not by any of the seasonally changing factors. 3areclaimed soils 3alow input agriculture 0apolder soils0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g1994 Nov., v. 51, no. 1/2 p.75-87x0167-88097nnas  aDNAL  a19980301b19980309c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02981naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100003000156245012000186300001800306500002400324500001500348520130300363650001501666650001301681650001801694650001701712650001301729650001001742650001401752650000901766650002201775650003701797650001901834650003601853650001101889650004901900650001101949650001701960650000901977650003201986650002902018650002602047651002802073653000902101700001902110700002602129700002602155700002202181700002102203773010502224852000902329856007702338655001202415IND4384180120221119142213.0061007s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438418012DNAL7 a170033022pmid7 a10.2337/dc06-09262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchofield, Christopher J.10aMortality and Hospitalization in Patients After Amputation: A comparison between patients with and without diabetes  ap. 2252-2256.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aOBJECTIVE:--We sought to compare the risk of mortality and hospitalization between patients with and without diabetes following incident lower-extremity amputation (LEA). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We performed a retrospective data-linkage review of all incident amputations between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1995. Patients were categorized according to their diabetes status. Follow-up for mortality was until 1 January 2005 and until 31 March 1996 for hospitalization. RESULTS:--Of 390 major-incident LEAs performed during the study period, 119 (30.5%) were in patients with diabetes and 271 (69.5%) were in nondiabetic subjects. The median time to death was 27.2 months in patients with diabetes compared with 46.7 months for patients without (P = 0.01). Diabetic subjects had a 55% greater risk of death than those without diabetes. The risk of developing congestive cardiac failure with diabetes was 2.26 (95% CI 1.12-4.57) and of further amputation was 1.95 (1.14-3.33) times that of a patient without diabetes after incident LEA. CONCLUSIONS:--After LEA, patients with diabetes have an increased risk of death compared with nondiabetic patients. Efforts should be made to minimize these risks with aggressive treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and management of cardiac failure. 3aamputation 3adiabetes 3aheart failure 3arisk factors 3apatients 3adeath 3amortality 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAmputation, Surgicalxmortality. 2aCohort Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitusxepidemiology 2aFemale 2aHospitalizationxstatistics & numerical data 2aHumans 2aLegxsurgery 2aMale 2aProportional Hazards Models 2aPsychosocial Deprivation 2aRetrospective Studies 0aScotlandxepidemiology. 0arisk1 aLibby, Gillian1 aBrennan, Geraldine M.1 aMacAlpine, Ritchie R.1 aMorris, Andrew D.1 aLeese, Graham P.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.2252-2256dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-09263Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03820naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245005800147300001600205500001500221520250200236650000902738650001602747650001902763650001202782650003502794650003702829650000902866650004202875650004902917650001602966650001102982650003202993650000903025650003403034650003103068650003703099653001503136653001403151700001603165700001703181773009703198852000903295939003303304946001303337655001203350IND9303612120221119142330.0930614e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930361212DNAL7 a84309322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoriello, K.A.10aIsolation of feline eosinophils via peritoneal lavage  ap. 223-227.  a2019-12-04  aFourteen cats were inoculated orally with 1 of 2 infective doses of Toxocara canis to induce eosinophilia.

However, in cats given antigen prep-1, eosinophil count was significantly (P = 0.005) greater in fluid obtained from lavage 3, compared with eosinophil count from lavage 2. Mean +/- SEM percentage of eosinophils in the fluid from lavage 3 in all cats was 70.8 +/- 2.2%. Other cell types included macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells. Gross postmortem findings were mild. One- to 3-mm nodular white foci of inflammation were observed on the serosal surfaces of the liver, spleen, kidneys, and omentum. Microscopic examination of tissues revealed pulmonary artery hypertrophy (n = 4), eosinophilic peribronchitis and perivasculitis (n = 10), mild granulomatous interstitial nephritis (n = 6), interstitial pancreatitis (n = 1), focal lymphocytic myocarditis (n = 1), focal eosinophilic granulomatous hepatitis (n = 1), and eosinophilic hyperplasia of bone marrow (n = 14). Large numbers of eosinophils could be harvested from the peritoneal cavity of cats inoculated orally with 500 embryonated T canis eggs and subsequently challenge-exposed intraperitoneally with preparations of parasite antigens. After the second challenge exposure, at least 108 eosinophils could be harvested from each cat, yielding eosinophils in the quantity required to begin isolation of granule constituents. 3acats 3aeosinophils 3aToxocara canis 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Helminthximmunology 2aCat Diseasesxbloodximmunology. 2aCats 2aCell Separationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aEosinophiliaxbloodximmunologyxveterinary. 2aEosinophils 2aFemale 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aMale 2aPeritoneal Lavagexveterinary 2aToxocara canisximmunology 2aToxocariasisxbloodximmunology. 0acollection 0aisolation1 aYoung, K.M.1 aCooley, A.J.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1993 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.223-227x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02850naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010100145300001600246520168800262650000901950650000901959650001601968650001401984650001201998650002802010650003402038650000902072650002702081650003102108650005202139650001202191650001302203653001402216653001302230700001602243700001702259773009702276852000902373939003302382946001302415655001202428IND9303611920221119142532.0930614e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930361192DNAL7 a84309302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeyman, S.J.10aBiomechanical study of the effect of coxofemoral positioning on passive hip joint laxity in dogs  ap. 210-215.  aTen coxofemoral joints from 5 dog cadavers were used to study the effect of coxofemoral positioning on passive hip laxity. A material test system was used to measure lateral translation when force was between 20 N of compression and 40 N of distraction. Using the orthogonal coordinate system imposed in this study, neutral position was empirically defined at 15 degrees of extension and 10 degrees of abduction, relative to the plane of the pelvis, and no internal or external rotation of the femur. The hips were mounted in a custom-designed jig that allowed 1 rotational degree of freedom (ie, either flexion/extension, adduction/abduction, or internal/external rotation), while holding the other 2 constant. Lateral translation of the hips was tested at 10 degrees intervals from 30 degrees of flexion to 70 degrees extension, 40 degrees of adduction to 60 degrees of abduction, and 30 degrees of internal rotation to 40 degrees of external rotation. Lateral displacement was maximal at 10 degrees of extension, 20 degrees of abduction, and 10 degrees of external rotation, approximating the neutral coxofemoral position during stance. As the hips were rotated into extreme positions, the amount of lateral displacement occurring with the same applied load decreased significantly to 32.0 to 65.3% of the maximal displacement. Determining the position of the hip associated with maximal passive laxity in vitro is essential to the design of a precise and accurate clinical stress-radiographic method to quantitate joint laxity in dogs. Our results confirm earlier work that passive hip joint laxity is at a maximum with the hip approximately in a neutral weight-bearing position. 3adogs 3ahips 3ameasurement 3amechanics 2aAnimals 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aDog Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aDogs 2aFemurxphysiopathology 2aHip Jointxphysiopathology 2aJoint Instabilityxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 2aPosture 2aRotation 0astability 0aposition1 aSmith, G.K.1 aCofone, M.A.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1993 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.210-215x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02964naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245006900180300001400249500002400263520114800287650002101435650002101456650002301477650002401500650002101524650001901545650001101564650002601575650001801601650002501619650001301644650002601657650001801683650001501701650002101716650002301737650001901760650003001779650001101809650002601820650002801846650003001874650004201904650003901946650003901985653001602024653000902040653001002049653001802059700001202077700001902089700001602108700001702124773010302141852000902244856008502253655001202338IND4406032120221119142543.0080523s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440603212DNAL7 a173518202pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-007-9055-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXiang, Yang10aKnocking down Wnt9a mRNA levels increases cellular proliferation  ap. 73-79.  aIncludes references  aWnts are secreted lipid-modified signaling proteins. Activation of Wnt signalling in many tissues has also been associated with cancer. In many eukaryotes, expression of nuclear-encoded mRNA can be strongly inhibited by the presence of a small double-stranded RNA corresponding to exon sequences in the mRNA. In this study we used pAVU6+27 vectors, which have SalI and XbaI clone sites, to construct the siRNA expression vectors for human Wnt9a. Two kinds of small interfering RNA inserts were designed, synthesized and visually tested for efficacy by in situ hybridization, the results demonstrated that in the cells, transfected with U6+27 cassettes with anti-Wnt9a hairpin siRNA inserts, dramatically reduced Wnt9a signals were observed as compared to the untransfected cells. The results of flow cytometry analysis showed that the cell proliferation was promoted after lowering expression of the human Wnt9a in MCF-7 cells by RNAi, but was inhibited after over-expression of human Wnt9a. These results suggests the expression level of human Wnt9a in MCF-7 that breast cancer may play a role in adjusting the rate of cellular proliferation. 3aRNA interference 3abreast neoplasms 3acell proliferation 3adouble-stranded RNA 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflow cytometry 3ahumans 3ain situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3anucleotide sequences 3aproteins 3asmall interfering RNA 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Cycle 2aCell Line, Tumor 2aCell Proliferation 2aGene Silencing 2aGenetic Vectorsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Small Interferingxmetabolism 2aWnt Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 0aHuman Wnt9a 0aRNAi 0aMCF-7 0aProliferation1 aLin, Ge1 aZhang, Qianjun1 aTan, Yueqiu1 aLu, Guangxiu0 tMolecular biology reports.g2008 June, v. 35, no. 2 p.73-79dSpringer Netherlandsx0301-48517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11033-007-9055-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02733naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002000156245009000176300002200266500002400288500001500312520123800327650002001565650002201585650001301607650002501620650002201645650002301667650002101690650002301711650001201734650001101746650002401757650002101781650004601802650002001848650003801868653003401906700002001940700001701960700001901977700001701996700001602013773012402029852000902153856007702162655001202239IND4462094520221119142654.0111021s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446209452DNAL7 a218993592pmid7 a10.1021/jf201925g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiao Dan10aProtein-Binding Affinity of Leucaena Condensed Tannins of Differing Molecular Weights  ap. 10677–10682.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aDepending on their source, concentration, chemical structure, and molecular weight, condensed tannins (CTs) form insoluble complexes with protein, which could lead to ruminal bypass protein, benefiting animal production. In this study, CTs from Leuceana leucocephala hybrid were fractionated into five fractions by a size exclusion chromatography procedure. The molecular weights of the CT fractions were determined using Q-TOF LC-MS, and the protein-binding affinities of the respective CT fractions were determined using a protein precipitation assay with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard protein. The calculated number-average molecular weights (M(n)) were 1348.6, 857.1, 730.1, 726.0, and 497.1, and b values (the b value represents the CT quantity that is needed to bind half of the maximum precipitable BSA) of the different molecular weight fractions were 0.381, 0.510, 0.580, 0.636, and 0.780 for fractions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The results indicated that, in general, CTs of higher molecular weight fractions have stronger protein-binding affinity than those of lower molecular weights. However, the number of hydroxyl units within the structure of CT polymers also affects the protein-binding affinity. 3aprotein binding 3aproanthocyanidins 3aLeucaena 3abovine serum albumin 3aanimal production 3agel chromatography 3amolecular weight 3achemical structure 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aMolecular Weight 2aProanthocyanidinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aSerum Albumin, Bovinexmetabolism 0asize exclusion chromatography1 aLiang, Juan Boo1 aTan, Hui Yin1 aYahya, Rosiyah1 aLong, Ruijun1 aHo, Yin Wan0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 59, no. 19 p.10677–10682-10677–10682x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf201925g3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02380naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002800156245010100184300002200285500002400307520090800331650001501239650001001254650002601264650002101290650002101311650001501332650000901347650002001356650001001376650001201386650002801398650001401426650001101440650006701451650001301518650002101531650002001552650001501572650001001587700002401597700003201621700002301653773012401676852000901800856007701809655001201886IND4462093720221119142529.0111021s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446209372DNAL7 a218190802pmid7 a10.1021/jf20206552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil-Diaz, Maria Del Mar10aPotential Diffusion of Doramectin into a Soil Amended with Female Pig Manure.

The concentration of doramectin in feces peaked at 143.0 ng/g in the dry feces 4 days after treatment. On day 62, the drug was still detected in the pig feces. After the land application of pig manure, the maximum concentration of doramectin in soil (ppb level) was detected 6 days after treatment. Seven months after the manure application, traces of doramectin were detected in the soil from the surface to a depth of 90 cm. Successive applications of manure from pigs treated with doramectin in a specific area could produce an accumulation of this drug in the soil. 3adoramectin 3afeces 3afield experimentation 3aland application 3amanure spreading 3apig manure 3asoil 3asoil amendments 3aswine 2aAnimals 2aAnthelminticsxanalysis 2aDiffusion 2aFemale 2aIvermectinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxpharmacokinetics. 2aKinetics 2aManurexanalysis 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSus scrofa 2aSwine1 aPerez-Sanz, Araceli1 aMartín Velasco, Margarita.1 aLobo, Maria Carmen0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2011 Oct. 12, v. 59, no. 19 p.10635–10640-10635–10640x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf20206553Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01575naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245003900129300001600168520073700184650001100921650002400932650002300956650001300979650002400992651001101016653003501027653002501062700001901087773010001106852000901206939003301215946001301248655001201261IND9303610320221119142508.0930615e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930361032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDeVoretz, D.J.10aMarket structure for farmed salmon  ap. 227-233.  aFarmed salmon represents 20% of the total volume of the world's salmon supply.

We specify and test models with varying degrees of market power, including third-degree price discrimination, using Norwegian export data from 1983 to 1988. Results indicate that Norwegian exporters have limited ability to engage in regional price discrimination, although they may have discriminated after the third quarter of 1987. Seasonal price discrimination, however, may have taken place because demand is more inelastic in periods when fresh wild-caught salmon are unavailable. 3asalmon 3amarket segmentation 3amarket competition 3amonopoly 3amathematical models 3aNorway 0asimultaneous equation analysis 0aprice discrimination1 aSalvanes, K.G.0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1993 Feb., v. 75, no. 1 p.227-233x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02033naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001500154245009600169300001400265500001500279520093800294650001301232650001001245650001401255650001301269650001601282650002301298650002601321653001301347653001901360700001501379700001301394773007801407852000901485856009401494930003301588945001301621946001301634655001201647IND2202719420221119142356.0000224e199908  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220271942DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.1999.tb00236.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, M.J.10aEdible coating as preservative carriers to inhibit yeast on Taiwanese-style fruit preserves  ap. 89-96.  a2019-12-04  aEdible coatings composed of methyl cellulose, glycerol, and fatty acid (stearic acid or palmitic acid) were tested as the preservative carriers for inhibition of surface microbial growth on Taiwanese-style fruit preserves. These intermediate moisture foods, preserved by high sugar concentrations, spoil mainly by osmophilic yeasts growing on the surface. Two types of fruit preserves (Ten-shing mei and Ching-shuan mei) prepared from plum were covered with edible coatings containing benzoic acid. Two osmophilic yeasts (Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and Zygosaccharomyces mellis) were used as testing microorganisms. Yeast growth was inhibited when both fruit preserves contained 50-100 microgram of benzoic acid (per gram). Furthermore, fruit preserves covered with edible coating showed no differences compared to uncoated samples in sensory evaluation. The results suggested that edible coating could serve as food additive carriers. 3acoatings 3aplums 3apreserves 3asurfaces 3afood safety 3afood preservatives 3aantifungal properties 0acarriers 0afruit products1 aWeng, Y.M.1 aChen, W.0 tJournal of food safety.g1999 Aug., v. 19, no. 2 p.89-96x0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.1999.tb00236.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01655naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245004100115300001400156500001500170520088500185650002401070650001801094650002701112653001501139653001501154653002701169653002501196773007101221852000901292939003301301945000801334946001101342655001201353991563390350742620221119142521.0800702s1980    xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800013822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aVegetables.

Not only are they rich in vitamins and minerals, they contain protein and fiber, and can yield more food per hectare than any other crop. Consumption of fresh vegetables is lagging behind that of processed vegetables; considering their nutritional importance, efforts should be made to improve the education of consumers and producers. Tropical countries in particular seem to ignore the potential of vegetables. Productivity is uncontrollably influenced by climatic conditions, but soil fertility, pests, water needs and marketing can be controlled. Proper handling cuts post-harvest losses and while it is not always feasible to incorporate crop remains into the soil, they can be used to feed farm animals. Other useful converters of vegetables are earthworms and snails. A garden plot is an economically rewarding way to produce food for home consumption. 3anutrition education 3aeating habits 3agreen leafy vegetables 0aFood usage 0avegetables 0aPlant sources of foods 0aconsumption patterns0 tNutrition and food science.g1980 , v. 62 p.18-19x0034-66597nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19800702c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle04162naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245012400205300001800329500002400347506007600371520158000447506003702027650002602064650001802090650001702108650001302125650001402138650001302152650001102165650002502176650000902201650002602210650001402236650001902250650002502269650001202294650001702306650001402323650001202337650009602349650008702445650008502532650001402617650004202631650001502673650008202688650008102770650001102851650000902862650002102871650001502892700002402907700002502931700002302956700002302979700002103002700001903023700001703042700002103059700002103080700002403101700002703125773011803152852000903270856008003279856004503359655001203404IND4384621020221207111118.0061022s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438462102DNAL7 a169664092pmid7 aPMC16954902pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00982-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBabcock, Gregory J.10aHuman Monoclonal Antibodies Directed against Toxins A and B Prevent Clostridium difficile-Induced Mortality in Hamsters  ap. 6339-6347.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aClostridium difficile is the leading cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhea, and recent outbreaks of strains with increased virulence underscore the importance of identifying novel approaches to treat and prevent relapse of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD). CDAD pathology is induced by two exotoxins, toxin A and toxin B, which have been shown to be cytotoxic and, in the case of toxin A, enterotoxic. In this report we describe fully human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAbs) that neutralize these toxins and prevent disease in hamsters. Transgenic mice carrying human immunoglobulin genes were used to isolate HuMAbs that neutralize the cytotoxic effects of either toxin A or toxin B in cell-based in vitro neutralization assays. Three anti-toxin A HuMAbs (3H2, CDA1, and 1B11) could all inhibit the enterotoxicity of toxin A in mouse intestinal loops and the in vivo toxicity in a systemic mouse model. Four anti-toxin B HuMAbs (MDX-1388, 103-174, 1G10, and 2A11) could neutralize cytotoxicity in vitro, although systemic toxicity in the mouse could not be neutralized. Anti-toxin A HuMAb CDA1 and anti-toxin B HuMAb MDX-1388 were tested in the well-established hamster model of C. difficile disease. CDA1 alone resulted in a statistically significant reduction of mortality in hamsters; however, the combination treatment offered enhanced protection. Compared to controls, combination therapy reduced mortality from 100% to 45% (P < 0.0001) in the primary disease hamster model and from 78% to 32% (P < 0.0001) in the less stringent relapse model.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium difficile 3aanimal models 3acytotoxicity 3adiarrhea 3aexotoxins 3ahamsters 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin genes 3amice 3amonoclonal antibodies 3amortality 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3arelapse 3atherapeutics 3avirulence 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxadministration & dosagexisolation & purificationxtherapeutic use. 2aBacterial Proteinsxadministration & dosagexantagonists & inhibitorsximmunology. 2aBacterial Toxinsxadministration & dosagexantagonists & inhibitorsximmunology. 2aCell Line 2aClostridioides difficileximmunology. 2aCricetinae 2aEnterocolitis, Pseudomembranousximmunologyxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aEnterotoxinsxadministration & dosagexantagonists & inhibitorsximmunology. 2aHumans 2aMice 2aMice, Transgenic 2aRecurrence1 aBroering, Teresa J.1 aHernandez, Hector J.1 aMandell, Robert B.1 aDonahue, Katherine1 aBoatright, Naomi1 aStack, Anne M.1 aLowy, Israel1 aGraziano, Robert1 aMolrine, Deborah1 aAmbrosino, Donna M.1 aThomas, William D.

Serum samples from 90 patients diagnosed with leptospirosis were analysed by Dot-ELISA test incorporating Glycolipoprotein (GLP) antigen from serovars Copenhageni and Patoc. Results were compared with those obtained with microscopic agglutination test, currently, the gold standard reference serological method. Serum samples from healthy blood bank donors and patients diagnosed with diseases other than leptospirosis were used as negative controls. The specificities of both GLP-based assays were 97·1% and 100% with serum samples from patients with other diseases and with serum samples from healthy control group, respectively. With serum samples from patients with acute leptospirosis, sensitivity was 76·6% with Dot-ELISA Copenhageni and 90·0% with Dot-ELISA Patoc. With serum samples from patients in convalescence, sensitivity was 100% with both GLP-based assays. This Dot-ELISA provides a candidate antigen for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis during all phases of illness and could be a good alternative method for the early diagnosis of leptospirosis. The Dot-ELISA test is simple, specific, rapid and inexpensive. It is suitable for identifying a large number of samples and, hence, reducing the death rate of patients with leptospirosis. 3aagglutination tests 3aantigens 3ablood serum 3aearly diagnosis 3ahumans 3aleptospirosis 3amortality 3apatients 3aserodiagnosis 3aserotypes 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aAntigens, Bacterialxdiagnostic useximmunology. 2aBacterial Proteinsxdiagnostic useximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxeconomicsxmethods. 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Mxblood 2aLeptospirosisxdiagnosis 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 0acandidate antigen 0aglycolipoprotein 0aLeptospira sp1 aTakei, K.1 aRomero, E.C.0 tLetters in applied microbiology.g2009 Aug., v. 49, no. 2 p.267-273dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0266-82547nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02650.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090714b20090801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01227naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097245002600115300001100141500001500152520057000167650001300737650001200750650001800762653001000780653002700790773007100817852000900888939003300897945000800930946001100938655001200949991563389790742620221119142440.0821012e198201  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI820011732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL10aAnti-vitamin C agents  ap. 22.  a2019-12-05  aPapers at a recent vitamin C symposium showed evidence that vitamin C intakes should be increased when other influences may be destroying vitamin C in the body.

In the presence of phospholipid precursors inositol and choline, Ino2-dependent activation is inhibited by the Opi1 repressor which interacts with Ino2. In this work, we systematically investigated the importance of regulatory mechanisms possibly affecting ICRE-dependent gene expression. Autoregulatory expression of INO2, INO4 and OPI1 was abolished by promoter exchange experiments, showing that autoregulation of regulators contributes to the degree of differential gene expression but is not responsible for it. Using GFP fusion proteins, Ino2 and Ino4 were found to localize to the nucleus under conditions of repression and derepression. Interestingly, nuclear localization of Ino2 required a functional INO4 gene. Targeting of a lexA-Ino2 fusion to a heterologous promoter containing lexA operator motifs revealed a constitutive gene activation which was not influenced by phospholipid precursors. We could show that Ino2-dependent activation of a lexA-Ino4 fusion is affected by inositol and choline. Since gene activation required interaction of Ino2 and Ino4 mediated by their helix-loop-helix domains, formation/dissociation of the heterodimer must be considered as an important step of target gene regulation. 3abiosynthesis 3acholine 3adimerization 3adissociation 3agene activation 3agene expression 3amyo-inositol 3aphospholipids 3astructural genes 3atranscription factors 3ayeasts 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors 2aDimerization 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHomeostasis 2aModels, Biological 2aPhospholipidsxbiosynthesis 2aProtein Structure, Quaternary 2aRepressor Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTrans-Activatorsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factors 2aTranscriptional Activation1 aDietz, Martin1 aWagner, Christian1 aSchüller, Hans-Joachim0 tCurrent genetics.g2008 July, v. 54, no. 1 p.35-45dSpringer-Verlagx0172-80837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00294-008-0197-73Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02778naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245011700171300001600288500001500304520169400319650001702013650001702030650002802047650000902075650002702084650001602111651001202127653001802139700001702157773008002174852000902254856009402263930003302357945001302390946001302403655001202416IND2205356920221119142328.0000620e199910  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220535692DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.1999.tb00245.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmoril, J.G.10aImmunological and cytopathogenic properties of Listeria monocytogenes isolated from naturally contaminated meats  ap. 195-207.  a2019-12-04  aMeat products have been implicated as the potential source of Listeria monocytogenes infection in humans. Here, we investigated the incidence of this organism in raw beef and poultry meat products and assessed their biochemical, immunological and cytopathogenic properties. Forty meat samples (20 beef and 20 poultry) were analyzed and the isolates were tested for sugar fermentation, hemolysin production, phospholipase activity, serotype profile, abilities to react with Listeria-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) EM-7G1 and C11E9, and cytotoxic effects on hybridoma Ped-2E9 cells. Thirteen (6 beef and 7 poultry) meat samples (32.5%) were positive for L. monocytogenes. A total of 276 Listeria isolates were obtained, of which 182 (66%) were confirmed to be L. monocytogenes, 80 (29%) were L. innocua, 12 (4.3%) were L. welshimeri and 2 (0.7%) were identified as L. grayi. Fifty six percent of the L. monocytogenes isolates were serotype 4, while 42% were serotype 1, and 2% were untypeable. All but two L. monocytogenes isolates were hemolytic and phospholipase positive (99%). In the ELISA assay, MAb C11E9 showed reaction with L. monocytogenes isolates from all 13 positive meat samples (100%), while MAb EM-7G1 reacted positively with 12 of 13 positive meat samples (92.3%). Hemolysin-positive L. monocytogenes isolates were cytopathogenic to Ped-2E9 cells, while hemolysin-negative strains showed no effect. This study demonstrated that 32.5% of commercially purchased raw meat products were contaminated with cytopathogenic L. monocytogenes strains, and could be a potential source for infection in susceptible populations if these meats were not processed or cooked properly. 3asupermarkets 3achicken meat 3amicrobial contamination 3abeef 3aListeria monocytogenes 3afood safety 3aAlabama 0ameat products1 aBhunia, A.K.0 tJournal of food safety.g1999 Oct., v. 19, no. 3 p.195-207x0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.1999.tb00245.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000802b20000808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02464naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004400097040001800141100002000159245013700179246017200316300001600488520148000504650002401984773009202008852000902100856005702109939003302166946001102199655001202210991563388020742620221119142333.0840817e198404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL840966352DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0867112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatkinson, A.R.10aYield-density relationships: the influence of resource availability on growth and self-thinning in populations of Vulpia fasciculata3 aYield-density relationships: the influence of resource availability on growth and self-thinning in populations of Vulpia fasciculata [Dune fescue, mathematical models]  ap. 469-482.  aMonocultures of Vulpia fasciculata were grown over a wide range of densities to investigate the influence of crowding and nutrient supply on growth and self-thinning. For a given time and density series the relationship between mean yield per plant (w) and the density of survivors (N) could be described by the equation w= wm (1+aN)−b. where wm is the yield of an isolated plant, a is the area required to achieve a yield of wm and b describes the effectiveness with which resources are taken up from the area. All three parameters increased with time. Adding nutrients changed not only the rate at which the effects of crowding occurred but also the intensity of crowding since wm = C(ab)D. where C and D are constants. The addition of nutrients resulted in an increase in the value of C. Such an increase means that a larger weight can be supported by a given area because the resources within that area are greater. During the early phases of growth, populations of V. fasciculata conformed to the −3/2 power law, w = cN−3/2, but only at very high densities with a plentiful supply of nutrients. However, once the maximum standing crop had been reached the trajectory of the thinning line switched to a slope of just less than −1 when weight was ploted against density on logarithmic scales. The intercept of the −3/2 thinning line was considerably higher (log c = 5.74) than those for most trees and forbs but was similar to those of a number of other grasses. 3amathematical models0 tAnnals of botany.g1984 Apr., v. 53, no. 4 p.469-482wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a086711  a00000000b19840817c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01311naa a2200289 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245005200132300001200184500001500196520053400211650002400745650001800769650002400787650003200811650001500843653001700858773007300875852000900948939003300957945000800990946001100998655001201009991563387960742620221119142403.0800522e197803  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800007382DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPesek, John.10aNutrition education - a caterer's point of view  ap. 6-7.  a2019-12-05  aA caterer should always aim to present food in an appetizing manner while preserving the nutritional value as much as possible.

These changes will impact on the dynamics of riverine carbon cycles and food web structure and function. Here we investigate the principal sources of organic carbon supporting local shredder communities across a gradient in different levels of anthropogenic development along riverine reaches, in South Australia. In forested/wooded reaches with minimum to limited development, semi-emergent macrophytes were the principal sources of organic carbon supporting the local shredder communities. However, in developed reaches, course particulate organic matter and filamentous algae were the principal food sources. The C:N ratios of the food sources in developed reaches were higher than those of their consumers indicating a stoichiometric mismatch. This imbalanced consumer-resource nutrient ratio in those developed reaches is likely to impose constraints on the growth and reproduction of their aquatic shredder communities with probable knock-on effects to higher trophic levels.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amacrophytes 3afood webs 3afoods 3arivers 3areproduction 3ahumans 3aorganic matter 3aplant communities 3acarbon 3aSouth Australia 0astable isotope 0aaquatic macrophyte 0aAlgae 0aorganic carbon 0aecological stoichiometry 0ashredder1 aGANF, GEORGE G.0 tAustral ecology.g2008 Aug., v. 33, no. 5 p.672-683dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1442-99857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2008.01834.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01594naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245003900135300001100174500001500185520075200200650000900952650001500961650001300976650001200989650001701001651001801018653002101036653002101057653001301078653002101091773007101112852000901183939003301192945000801225946001101233655001201244991563387300742620221119142630.0800903e197909  xx ||||go|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI800020832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGunston, David.10aPeas--today's number one vegetable  ap. 18.  a2019-12-05  aPeas have been consumed by man since prehistoric times and came to Britain from France where peas in the pod were once considered a delicacy to be dipped in butter.

Peas are particularly suited to quick freezing, and frozen peas account for over 50% of the annual crop. In 1978, Britains consumed 123,200 tons of the vegetable. The traditional French method of cooking peas requires very little water, some butter, small onions, a few lettuce leaves and one or two pieces of boiled bacon.

This can partially beattributed to the lack of diagnostic markers for different clinicalstates of the disease and the consequent implementation ofdifferential, optimal drug therapeutic strategies. Accordingly,comparative bioinformatics and Mycobacterium leprae proteinmicroarrays were applied to investigate whether leprosy patients withdifferent clinical forms of the disease can be categorized based ondifferential humoral immune response patterns. Evaluation of sera from20 clinically diagnosed leprosy patients using native protein andrecombinant protein microarrays revealed unique disease-specific,humoral reactivity patterns. Statistical analysis of the serologicalpatterns yielded distinct groups that correlated with phenolicglycolipid I reactivity and clinical diagnosis, thus demonstrating thatleprosy patients, including those diagnosed with the paucibacillary,tuberculoid form of disease, can be classified based on humoralreactivity to a subset of M. leprae protein antigens producedin recombinantform.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium leprae 3aantigens 3abioinformatics 3adrug therapy 3ahumoral immunity 3aleprosy 3amicroarray technology 3apatients 3astatistical analysis 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxbiosynthesisxblood. 2aAntigens, Bacterialxbiosynthesisxbloodximmunology. 2aGlycolipidsxbloodximmunology. 2aHumans 2aLeprosyxbloodxclassificationxdiagnosisximmunology. 2aLeprosy, Lepromatousxbloodxclassificationximmunology. 2aLeprosy, Tuberculoidxbloodxclassificationximmunology. 2aProtein Array Analysis 2aSerologic Tests1 aAmin, Amol1 aMarques, Maria Angela M.1 aSpencer, John S.1 aGelber, Robert1 aKnudson, Dennis L.1 aBelisle, John T.1 aBrennan, Patrick J.1 aSlayden, Richard A.0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.6458-6466dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00041-063Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle04029naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002000181245009700201300001800298500002400316500001500340506007600355520161900431506003702050650001302087650003202100650001502132650002702147650001602174650001102190650003802201650001302239650002602252650001602278650002202294650002102316650001202337650002102349650006002370650003202430650006102462650005902523650006202582650004702644650001102691650002102702650003202723650003102755650000902786653001002795700001702805700001702822700002202839700002002861700002102881700001902902700002502921700002702946700002402973700002502997700002103022773011803043852000903161856008003170856004503250655001203295IND4384619620221207112736.0061022s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438461962DNAL7 a169664072pmid7 aPMC16955262pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00722-062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aErwin, Alice L.10aRole of lgtC in Resistance of Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae Strain R2866 to Human Serum  ap. 6226-6235.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe are investigating a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) strain, R2866, isolated from a child with meningitis. R2866 is unusually resistant to killing by normal human serum. The serum 50% inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) for this strain is 18%, approaching that of encapsulated H. influenzae. R3392 is a derivative of R2866 that was found to have increased sensitivity to human serum (IC₅₀, 1.5%). Analysis of tetrameric repeat regions within lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthetic genes in both strains indicated that the glycosyltransferase gene lgtC was out of frame ("off") in most colonies of R3392 but in frame with its start codon ("on") in most colonies of the parent. We sought antigenic and biochemical evidence for modification of the LOS structure. In a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, strain R3392 displayed reduced binding of the Galα1,4Gal-specific monoclonal antibody 4C4. Mass spectrometry analysis of LOS from strain R2866 indicated that the primary oligosaccharide glycoform contained four heptose and four hexose residues, while that of R3392 contained four heptose and three hexose residues. We conclude that the R2866 lgtC gene encodes a galactosyltransferase involved in synthesis of the 4C4 epitope, as in other strains, and that expression of lgtC is associated with the high-level serum resistance that has been observed for this strain. This is the first description of the genetic basis of high-level serum resistance in NTHI, as well as the first description of LOS composition in an NTHI strain for which the complete genome sequence has been determined.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aepitopes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ameningitis 3aHaemophilus influenzae 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3achildren 3amonoclonal antibodies 3astart codon 3amass spectrometry 3aoligosaccharides 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBacterial Proteinsxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBlood Bactericidal Activity 2aGalactosyltransferasesxbiosynthesisxbloodxphysiology. 2aHaemophilus Infectionsxbloodxenzymologyximmunology. 2aHaemophilus influenzaexenzymologyxgeneticsximmunology. 2aHexosyltransferasesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aHumans 2aImmunity, Innate 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLipopolysaccharidesxblood 2aRats 0agenes1 aAllen, Simon1 aHo, Derek K.1 aBonthius, Paul J.1 aJarisch, Justin1 aNelson, Kevin L.1 aTsao, David L.1 aUnrath, William C.T.1 aWatson, Michael E.

Here, we applied a comparative analysis to test factors associated with the origin and maintenance of black chest and throat patches, which in some taxa are referred to as 'badges-of-status'. Specifically, we tested whether the evolution of black colour patches in Old and New World sparrows is consistent with a signalling function during the nonbreeding season or breeding season. We found no positive associations between patch evolution and polygyny or summer sociality. Instead, patch evolution is significantly associated with sociality during the nonbreeding season. Additionally, unlike typical plumage characteristics under sexual selection, these patches are visible throughout the nonbreeding season. Further, the pattern of patch dimorphism uncovered in this study does not match expectations for a trait that evolved in a reproductive context. In particular, patch dimorphism is not associated with polygyny or the presence of extra-pair mating although other types of plumage dimorphism are strongly associated with nonmonogamous mating systems. Overall, patterns of patch evolution suggest that they are more strongly associated with social competition during the nonbreeding season than sexual competition during the breeding season. These results clarify why some previous work has uncovered puzzling relationships between black plumage patches and reproductive behaviour. We discuss these findings in the context of signal theory and previous work on badges-of-status. 3aPasseriformes 3abirds 3abreeding season 3achest 3acoevolution 3acolor 3adimorphism 3amating systems 3aphenotypic variation 3aplumage 3apolygyny 3areproductive behavior 3asexual selection 3asocial behavior 3asummer 3athroat 2aAnimal Communication 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aFeathersxphysiology 2aFemale 2aMale 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aSeasons 2aSex Characteristics 2aSexual Behavior, Animal 2aSocial Behavior 2aSparrowsxgeneticsxphysiology. 0aconcentrated changes test 0aconventional signals 0aEmberizidae 0aPasseridae 0asocial selection1 aSAFRAN, R.J.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2009 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.2376-2386dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01861.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02411naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245007600188300001800264520101100282650001201293650002401305650002301329650002101352650001001373650001301383650001401396650002201410650001201432650002501444650001101469650000901480650002301489650002401512653001301536653002301549653001601572653003101588653001601619700001801635773013101653852000901784856009201793930003301885946001101918655001201929IND4428603920221119142309.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442860392DNAL7 a198744402pmid7 a10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01862.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPOISSANT, J.14aThe ontogeny of cross-sex genetic correlations: an analysis of patterns  ap. 2558-2562.  aThe independent evolution of males and females is typically constrained by shared genetic variance. Despite substantial research, we still know little about the evolution of cross-sex genetic covariance and its standardized measure, the cross-sex genetic correlation (rMF). In particular, it is unclear if rMF tend to vary with age. We compiled 28 traits for which ontogenetic trends in rMF were documented. Decreases in rMF with age were observed significantly more often than increases and the mean effect size for the relationship between rMF and age was large and negative. This suggests that sexual dimorphism (SD) may typically evolve more readily for phenotypes expressed later in ontogeny and that evolutionary inferences related to the evolution of SD should be limited to the ontogenetic stage at which rMF was estimated. Knowledge about ontogenetic variation in rMF should help improving our understanding of evolutionary patterns related to SD and the resolution of intralocus sexual conflicts. 3afemales 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic covariance 3agenetic variance 3amales 3aontogeny 3aphenotype 3asexual dimorphism 2aAnimals 2aBiological Evolution 2aFemale 2aMale 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Characteristics 0aG matrix 0agenetic constraint 0aintersexual 0aintralocus sexual conflict 0aontogenetic1 aCOLTMAN, D.W.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2009 Dec., v. 22, no. 12 p.2558-2562dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2009.01862.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03183naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100001700154245003700171300001600208520214400224650001602368650002302384650001802407650001502425650001302440650001302453650001402466650000902480653001702489653001102506653002202517700001602539773008002555852000902635856009402644930003302738945001302771946001302784655001202797IND2200812020221119142346.0990929e199812  ctu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220081202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4565.1998.tb00222.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Keeffe, M.10aResidues--a food safety problem?  ap. 297-319.  aConsiderable time, regulation and consumer concern is associated with the question of chemical residues in food. Potential residues in food span a broad range from natural contaminants (mycotoxins) through environmental contaminants (dioxins, PCBs), agrochemicals (nitrates, pesticides), veterinary drugs (anthelmintics, antibiotics), prohibited substances (hormonal growth promoters), chemicals arising in processing (nitrosamines), packaging components (plasticisers) to contaminants arising in domestic food preparation (heavy metals). The occurrence or avoidance of these chemicals as residues in food is to a greater or lesser extent under the control of the food producer, processor and consumer in the activities of growing/producing, treating, storing, processing, packaging and cooking. The fundamental question is to what extent do or can residues in food constitute a food safety hazard for the consumer. Many of these substances are regulated as to their use and as to their acceptable levels in food while others, by their nature, arise as more random occurrences and, as such, are less prone to regulation. Of particular concern to the producer, processor and retailer of food is what steps may be taken to ensure that the food supply is safe. Best practice in plant and animal husbandry by the producer, in sourcing of material and in control of food manufacturing by the processor, and in sourcing of food products by the retailer combine to assure the safety of food to the consumer. This paper describes the various classes of chemicals which can arise as residues in food, particularly agrochemicals and veterinary drugs, the usage patterns which decrease/increase the likelihood of the occurrence of residues at unacceptable levels, how and in what form(s) residues can occur in foods, and the contribution of food processing to a reduction or otherwise of residue levels in food consumed. Consideration will be given, also, to quantifying the risk posed by chemical residues in food and to a study of the results from a Residue Database and from residue monitoring/surveillance as an indicator of risk to the consumer. 3afood safety 3apesticide residues 3adrug residues 3amycotoxins 3anitrates 3anitrites 3adatabases 3arisk 0acontaminants 0aintake 0aresidue databases1 aKennedy, O.0 tJournal of food safety.g1998 Dec., v. 18, no. 4 p.297-319x0149-60857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4565.1998.tb00222.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000202b20000208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01425naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245009000132300001800222300003200240520044300272650001100715650000900726650001400735650001700749650001800766653002400784653002500808700001400833700001700847700001300864700001700877700001300894773008100907852000900988939003300997945000801030946001301038655001201051991563384720742620221119142303.0880613e198406  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI880012152DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZerlauth, G.10aVitamin A deficiency and serum or plasma fibronectin in the rat and in human subjects  ap. 1169-1172.  ap. 1169-1172. ill., charts.  aThis study examines fibronectin (FN) levels in the plasma/serum of vitamin A deficient rats and humans.

However, whether the enterocyte itself responds innately to T. muris is unknown. This study investigated for the first time whether colonic intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) produce cytokines or chemokines following T. muris infection and whether divergence of the innate response could explain differentially polarized adaptive immune responses in resistant and susceptible mice. Increased expression of mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor and the chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) were seen after infection of susceptible and resistant strains, with the only difference in expression being a delayed increase in CCL2 in BALB/c IEC. These increases were ablated in MyD88⁻/⁻ mice, and NF-κB p65 was phosphorylated in response to T. muris excretory/secretory products in the epithelial cell line CMT-93, suggesting involvement of the MyD88-NF-κB signaling pathway in IEC cytokine expression. These data reveal that IEC respond innately to T. muris. However, the minor differences identified between resistant and susceptible mice are unlikely to underlie the subsequent development of a susceptible type 1 (IFN-γ-dominated) or resistant type 2 (interleukin-4 [IL-4]/IL-13-dominated) adaptive immune response.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrichuris muris 3aadaptive immunity 3aburrowing 3achemokines 3aepithelial cells 3agene expression 3aimmune response 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-4 3aintestinal mucosa 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3asignal transduction 3atumor necrosis factors 2aAnimals 2aCell Line 2aColonximmunologyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aDisease Susceptibilityximmunology 2aImmunity, Active 2aImmunity, Innate 2aImmunity, Mucosal 2aIntestinal Mucosaximmunologyxparasitologyxpathology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred AKR 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, SCID 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTrichuriasisximmunologyxpathology. 2aTrichurisximmunology1 aManku, Harinder1 aElse, Kathryn J.0 tInfection and immunity.g2006 Nov., v. 74, no. 11 p.6280-6286dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01609-053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://iai.asm.org/3electronic resource 7aarticle02442naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127072001700144100001600161245010400177300001400281500001500295520119400310650001901504650001401523650002301537650000801560650002301568650002201591650002001613650001701633650002501650650001401675650001101689651001201700653001601712653001201728700001601740700001601756700001701772773009001789852000901879930003301888945001301921946001301934961001301947655001201960IND2046613620221119142235.0950628e199501  scu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204661362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Three levels of irrigation designed to produce low, moderate, or high plant water stress (at the end of irrigation interval) were tested each year. The seasonal average numbers of immatures of B. argentifolii on fifth main stem node leaves was greater in biweekly-furrow irrigated than in drip-irrigated plots in 1988 and 1993 but not in 1991. Plants irrigated biweekly with additional supplemental irrigations during mid-season or full season weekly irrigations had intermediate numbers of immatures. Leaf water potentials (-bars) measured in 1993 indicated plant water stress was greatest prior peak blooming and increased whitefly infestations. The 'Deltapine 50' (DPL-50) cultivar had a similar density of leaf trichomes but half as many nymphs per leaf as DPL-77 in the 1991 test. These results indicate that selecting a less susceptible cultivar and avoiding plant water stress may be useful in management of whiteflies. 3aBemisia tabaci 3acultivars 3asurface irrigation 3aova 3aGossypium hirsutum 3afurrow irrigation 3amicroirrigation 3awater stress 3aleaf water potential 3amortality 3anymphs 3aArizona 0ainfestation 0aBemisia1 aRadin, J.W.1 aParks, N.J.1 aReaves, L.L.0 tJournal of agricultural entomology.g1995 Jan., v. 12, no. 1 p.25-32x0735-939X7nnas  aDNAL  a20120312b20120504c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle01580naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245005900128300001600187520064800203650001100851650002000862650001800882650002000900650001600920651001800936653001200954653001400966653001500980653002800995700001801023700001601041773011801057852000901175939003301184946001301217655001201230IND9303609320221119142658.0930615e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrunewald, O.10aLive cattle futures response to cattle on feed reports  ap. 131-137.  aKnight-Ridder surveys provide prerelease expectations of the information in the Cattle on Feed reports.

However, the synergistic effects of SNPs have not been evaluated in detail. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-- We measured the average IMT of the common and internal carotid artery in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients (n = 690) (>50 years old) using ultrasonography. We also determined their genotypes regarding 106 SNPs in candidate genes responsible for cardiovascular diseases. Among the 106 SNPs, we selected 40 common (frequency of minor allele >=10%) SNPs. We compared the average IMT of subjects with and without any pairs of four genotypes selected from the 40 common SNPs. RESULTS:-- The combination of methylen-tetrahydrofolate reductase 677 TT genotype and lymphotoxin-α (LTA) 252 GG genotype and that of ACE DD genotype and LTA 252 GG genotype were evaluated as responsible for a statistically significant (P = 2.7 x 10⁻⁹ and 3.5 x 10⁻⁶, respectively) increase in average IMT (mean [±SD] 1.54 ± 0.60 and 1.43 ± 0.58 mm, respectively) compared with those of the subjects without these combinations (1.04 ± 0.34 and 1.04 ± 0.34 mm, respectively). No single genotype was shown to be responsible for the statistically significant difference in average IMT after Bonferroni's multiple comparison procedure. CONCLUSIONS:-- The present analysis demonstrates an approach to evaluate combinations of multiple genetic risk factors that are synergistically associated with carotid atherosclerosis. 3aalleles 3aatherosclerosis 3acarotid arteries 3agenotype 3alymphotoxin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3arisk factors 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3asynergism 3aultrasonography 2aAged 2aCarotid Artery Diseasesxethnologyxgeneticsxultrasonography. 2aCarotid Artery, Commonxultrasonography. 2aCarotid Artery, Internalxultrasonography. 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xethnologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Diseasexepidemiology 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aLymphotoxin-alphaxgenetics 2aMale 2aMethylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)xgenetics 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotide 2aRisk Factors 2aTunica Intimaxultrasonography. 2aTunica Mediaxultrasonography. 0aJapanxepidemiology.1 aKatakami, Naoto1 aSakamoto, Ken'ya1 aKaneto, Hideaki1 aMatsuhisa, Munehide1 aSato, Hiroshi1 aHori, Masatsugu1 aHaneda, Masakazu1 aKashiwagi, Atsunori1 aTanaka, Yasushi1 aKawamori, Ryūzō.1 aKuno, Shin-ichi0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.2445-2451dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-08713Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03496naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245013400181300001600315500002400331520147400355650001501829650002501844650002301869650002501892650004201917650003701959650004501996650005802041650003102099650001102130650001402141650001802155650001602173650003702189650002902226650001702255650001202272650002402284651001202308651002702320653003802347653003502385653002902420653002102449653003202470700001802502700002102520700002002541700002302561700001902584700001702603700002202620700001902642773011502661852000902776856008502785655001202870IND4409356520221119142358.0080822s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440935652DNAL7 a185238132pmid7 a10.1007/s00484-008-0163-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDidyk, L.

Over an entire year, the average integral amplitudes of APF in the range of periods from 3 s to 120 s over each hour (HA) were measured. Daily dynamics of HA averaged over the year revealed a wave shape with smooth increase from night to day followed by decrease from day to night. The total daily number of EEC within the city of Kiev, Ukraine, was related to the daily mean of HA (DHA) and to the ratio of HA averaged over the day time to HA averaged over the night time (Rdn), and was checked for confounding effects of classical meteorological variables through non-parametric regression algorithms. The number of EEC were significantly higher on days with high DHA (3.72-11.07 Pa, n = 87) compared to the low DHA (0.7-3.62 Pa, n = 260, p = 0.01), as well at days with low Rdn (0.21-1.64, n = 229) compared to the high Rdn (1.65-7.2, n = 118, p = 0.03). A difference between DHA and Rdn effects on the emergency events related to different categories of circulatory diseases points to a higher sensitivity of rheumatic and cerebro-vascular diseases to DHA, and ischaemic and hypertensive diseases to Rdn. Results suggest that APF could be considered as a meteorotropic factor capable of influencing circulatory system diseases. 3aalgorithms 3aatmospheric pressure 3acirculatory system 2aAtmospheric Pressure 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxepidemiology 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aEmergency Medical Servicesxutilization. 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxstatistics & numerical data 2aEpidemiological Monitoring 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInfrared Rays 2aPeriodicity 2aRheumatic Diseasesxepidemiology 2aRisk Assessmentxmethods 2aRisk Factors 2aSeasons 2aStatistics as Topic 3aUkraine 0aBelgiumxepidemiology. 0aAtmospheric pressure fluctuations 0aFar infrasound frequency range 0aMeteorological variables 0aEmergency events 0aCirculatory system diseases1 aGorgo, Yu.

Furthermore, it is often reported in surveys as a grouped variable (the number of visits reported falling into one of several classes). This paper develops a travel cost model which takes account of discreetness and grouping in both demand and benefit estimation. A case study and associated simulations are then reported which indicate the potential extent of bias that may arise from ignoring discreetness/grouping in demand and benefit estimation. The information loss involved in varying the size of visit classes is also examined. 3aforest recreation 3adecision making 3ademand functions 3aconsumer attitudes 3aeconometric models 3acase studies 3awillingness to pay 3aGreat Britain 0anon-market benefits 0avisits 0arecreational benefits0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1993 Feb., v. 75, no. 1 p.84-94x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01269naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008400123300001400207500001500221520031600236650002200552650002400574650000900598650002200607650001600629650001600645650001100661650002300672650001100695653002200706653002000728773011600748852000900864939003300873946001300906655001200919IND9303608420221119142408.0930615e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930360842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsur, Y.12aA simple procedure to evaluate ex ante producer welfare under price uncertainty  ap. 44-51.  a2019-12-04  aA simple procedure is proposed for evaluating producer welfare under price uncertainty.

We have investigated the interplay between ambient temperature and hormone action during the regulation of hypocotyl elongation, and we have found that gibberellins (GAs) and auxin are quickly and independently recruited by temperature to modulate growth rate, whereas activity of brassinosteroids (BRs) seems to be required later on. Impairment of GA biosynthesis blocked the increased elongation caused at higher temperatures, but hypocotyls of pentuple DELLA knockout mutants still reduced their response to higher temperatures when BR synthesis or auxin polar transport were blocked. The expression of several key genes involved in the biosynthesis of GAs and auxin was regulated by temperature, which indirectly resulted in coherent variations in the levels of accumulation of nuclear GFP-RGA (repressor of GA1) and in the activity of the DR5 reporter. DNA microarray and genetic analyses allowed the identification of the transcription factor PIF4 (phytochrome-interacting factor 4) as a major target in the promotion of growth at higher temperature. These results suggest that temperature regulates hypocotyl growth by individually impinging on several elements of a pre-existing network of signaling pathways involving auxin, BRs, GAs, and PIF4. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA microarrays 3aambient temperature 3aauxins 3abiosynthesis 3abrassinosteroids 3agenes 3agibberellins 3agrowth promotion 3ahormonal regulation 3ahypocotyls 3aknockout mutants 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Plantxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aHypocotylxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aSignal Transduction 2aSteroidsxmetabolism 2aTemperature 0aPIF4 0across-regulation1 aGallego-Bartolomé, Javier1 aGómez, María D.1 aYoshida, Shigeo1 aAsami, Tadao1 aOlsen, Jorunn E.1 aGarcía-Martínez, José L.1 aAlabadí, David1 aBlázquez, Miguel A.0 tPlant journal.g2009 Nov., v. 60, no. 4 p.589-601dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03983.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03474naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100001800205245012800223300001600351520167500367650001102042650001602053650001202069650001102081650001002092650003202102650001002134650001202144650001202156650001302168650001202181650006802193650007902261650001102340650002202351650006502373650001102438650001402449650003802463650000902501650005902510650001502569650002602584650002202610700002002632773007202652852000902724856009202733930003302825945002502858946001302883655001202896IND4378290020221119142331.0060302e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437829002DNAL7 a163431542pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2005.00099.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Study Design-Retrospective study. Sample Population-Horses that had previous LDDLC. Methods-Medical records of horses that had LDDLC and subsequent laparoscopic nephrosplenic space closure between 2002 and 2004 were retrieved. Follow-up information was obtained by telephone interview of owners. Preoperative versus postoperative comparisons were: incidence of LDDLC, incidence of colic signs, and incidence of ventral celiotomy. Data were analyzed using a chi2-square test with significance set at P<.05. Results-Ten horses met the inclusion criteria. Mean follow-up was 22 months. No horses had recurrence of LDDLC; however, 3 horses had colic signs subsequently that required surgical intervention. Over the follow-up period there was a significant decrease in the total incidence of colic and ventral celiotomy. Technique modifications included use of different cannula site locations, use of polyglyconate suture material for nephrosplenic space closure, and development of a custom cannula. Conclusions-Laparoscopic nephrosplenic space closure prevented recurrence of LDDLC, and significantly lowered the overall incidence of colic and ventral celiotomy. The custom-designed cannula provided good access to the operative site and no complications were encountered with use of polyglyconate suture material for nephrosplenic space closure. Clinical Relevance-Closure of the nephrosplenic space will prevent LDDLC; however, other surgical lesions can occur. 3ahorses 3alaparoscopy 3akidneys 3aspleen 3acolon 3apostoperative complications 3acolic 3arelapse 3asutures 3acannulas 2aAnimals 2aColicxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aColonic Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxsurgeryxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHorse Diseasesxepidemiologyxprevention & controlxsurgery. 2aHorses 2aIncidence 2aLaparoscopyxmethodsxveterinary. 2aMale 2aPostoperative Complicationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aRecurrence 2aRetrospective Studies 2aTreatment Outcome1 aHendrickson, D.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2005 , v. 34, no. 6 p.642-645x0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2005.00099.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/10  aOther US 7aarticle02464naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100001800193245006100211300001600272520143800288650001601726650001401742650001801756653000901774653001401783653001801797700002001815700001601835773011801851852000901969856009201978930003302070946001102103655001202114IND4436201520221119142405.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443620152DNAL7 a10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00898.x2doi7 aPMC37601552pmcid7 a205365672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAraki, Koichi14aThe role of mTOR in memory CD8⁺ T-cell differentiation  ap. 234-243.  aThe mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an intracellular kinase that regulates cell growth and metabolism. Its specific inhibitor rapamycin is currently used in transplant recipients as an immunosuppressive drug to prevent allograft rejection. Studies have shown complex and diverse mechanisms for the immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin. The drug has been reported to inhibit T-cell proliferation, induce anergy, modulate T-cell trafficking, promote regulatory T cells, and also prevent maturation of dendritic cells as well as production of type I interferon. However, several other studies have paradoxically demonstrated immunostimulatory effects of rapamycin by improving antigen presentation and regulating cytokine production from macrophages and myeloid dendritic cells. Recently, it has been shown that rapamycin also exhibits immunostimulatory effects on memory CD8⁺ T-cell differentiation. The drug improved both quantity and quality of memory CD8⁺ T cells induced by viral infection and vaccination, showing that mTOR is a major regulator of memory CD8⁺ T-cell differentiation. These discoveries have implications for the development of novel vaccine regimens. Here, we review the role of mTOR in memory CD8⁺ T-cell differentiation and compare the effect of rapamycin among CD8⁺ T cells, CD4⁺ T cells, and dendritic cells. Also, we discuss potential application of these findings in a clinical setting. 3avaccination 3ainfection 3aT-lymphocytes 0amTOR 0arapamycin 0aimmune memory1 aYoungblood, Ben1 aAhmed, Rafi0 tImmunological reviews.g2010 May, v. 235, no. 1 p.234-243dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0105-28967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0105-2896.2010.00898.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100430b20100501c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02586naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245011500189300001600304520075700320650001901077650004301096650001901139650001801158650002201176650002401198650003301222650002401255650001201279650001801291650002801309650003201337650001701369650004701386650002401433650001901457650002901476650002801505650003101533650002901564650002001593650003201613650002701645650003301672653001601705653001401721700001901735773012101754852000901875856009201884930003301976946001102009655001202020IND4428599520221119142423.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442859952DNAL7 a198179092pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2583.2009.00906.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhnesorge, S.10aBegomovirus coat protein interacts with a small heat-shock protein of its transmission vector (Bemisia tabaci)  ap. 693-703.  aTomato yellow leaf curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSV) is transmitted from plant to plant by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci in a persistent-circulative manner.

A member of the small heat-shock protein family (termed BtHSP16) was identified and its interaction with the CP was verified by an in vitro pull-down assay. The binding domain was located at the variable N-terminal part of the CP, while full-length BtHSP16 is required for the interaction.

These molecular fossils draw parallels with present-day exogenous retroviruses and have been linked previously with immunopathology within rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mechanisms of pathogenesis for HERV-K in RA such as molecular mimicry were investigated. To clarify a role for HERVs in RA, potential autoantigens implicated in autoimmunity were scanned for sequence identity with retroviral epitopes. Short retroviral peptides modelling shared epitopes were synthesized, to survey anti-serum of RA patients and disease controls. A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was also developed to quantify accurately levels of HERV-K (HML-2) gag expression, relative to normalized housekeeping gene expression. Both serological and molecular assays showed significant increases in HERV-K (HML-2) gag activity in RA patients, compared to disease controls. The real-time PCR assay identified significant up-regulation in HERV-K mRNA levels in RA patients compared to inflammatory and healthy controls. Exogenous viral protein expression and proinflammatory cytokines were also shown to exert modulatory effects over HERV-K (HML-2) transcription. From our data, it can be concluded that RA patients exhibited significantly elevated levels of HERV-K (HML-2) gag activity compared to controls. Additional factors influencing HERV activity within the synovium were also identified. The significant variation in RA patients, both serologically and transcriptionally, may be an indication that RA is an umbrella term for a number of separate disease entities, of which particular HERV polymorphisms may play a role in development. 3aarthritis 3aautoimmunity 3aviruses 2aAdult 2aAged 2aArthritis, Rheumatoidximmunologyxmetabolismxpathologyxvirology. 2aAutoantigensximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aEndogenous Retrovirusesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aEpitopesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aGene Expression Regulation, Viralximmunology 2aGene Products, gagxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMolecular Mimicry 2aPeptidesximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aPolymorphism, Geneticximmunology 2aRNA, Messengerxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aRNA, Viralxbiosynthesisximmunology. 2aSynovial Membraneximmunologyxmetabolismxvirology. 2aTranscription, Geneticximmunology 0aretrovirus 0arheumatology1 aHooley, P.1 aEjtehadi, H.

All the regenerated transformants (R0) were diploid and either homozygous or heterozygous for the hygromycin resistance gene used to select primary transformants. The Ac excision frequency was determined using the phenotypic assay of restoration of neomycin phosphotransferase activity and expression of kanamycin resistance among progeny seedlings. Some of the R0 plants segregated kanamycin-resistant seedlings in selfed progeny at a high frequency (34 to 100%) and contained one or more transposed Ac elements. In the primary transformants Ac transposition probably occurred during plant regeneration or early development. Other R0 transformants segregated kanamycin-resistant plants at a low frequency (less than or equal to 4%). Two transformants of this latter class, containing a unique unexcised Ac element, were chosen for further study in the expectation that their kanamycin resistant progeny would result from independent germinal transposition events. Southern blot analysis of 32 kanamycin-resistant plants (R1 or R2), selected after respectively one or two selfings of these primary transformants, showed that 27 had a transposed Ac at a new location and 5 did not have any Ac element. Transposed Ac copy number varied from one to six and almost all transposition events were independent. Southern analysis of the R2 and R3 progeny of these kanamycin-resistant plants showed that Ac continued to transpose during four generations, and its activity increased with its copy number. The frequency of Ac transposition, from different loci, remained low (less than or equal to 7%) from R0 to R3 generations when only one Ac copy was present. The strategy of choosing R0 plants that undergo a low frequency of germinal excision will provide a means to avoid screening non-independent transpositions and increase the efficiency of transposon tagging. 3agenetic transformation 3aZea mays 3akanamycin 3akanamycin kinase 3atransgenic plants 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3aphosphotransferases (phosphomutases) 3areporter genes 3aNicotiana plumbaginifolia 3atransposons 3adrug resistance 0asegregation 0agenetic change 0aac element 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens1 aMarin, E.1 aBonnefoy, N.1 aPautot, V.0 tMGG.g1993 Apr., v. 238, no. 1/2 p.209-217x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03326naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004200133040001800175100003000193245008200223300001600305506007600321520149100397506003701888650001601925650000801941650001501949650001501964650001201979650001301991650001402004650001302018650001702031650001102048650001602059650001702075650001302092650001702105650001102122650001102133650003902144650001502183650004402198650001502242650002902257650006902286650002302355653001702378700002502395700002802420700002102448773011002469852000902579856009202588930003302680946001102713655001202724IND4428599120221207104616.0091113e200911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442859912DNAL7 a196822842pmid7 aPMC29544392pmcid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03994.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCórdoba-Cañero, Dolores10aSingle-nucleotide and long-patch base excision repair of DNA damage in plants  ap. 716-728.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBase excision repair (BER) is a critical pathway in cellular defense against endogenous or exogenous DNA damage. This elaborate multistep process is initiated by DNA glycosylases that excise the damaged base, and continues through the concerted action of additional proteins that finally restore DNA to the unmodified state. BER has been subject to detailed biochemical analysis in bacteria, yeast and animals, mainly through in vitro reproduction of the entire repair reaction in cell-free extracts. However, an understanding of this repair pathway in plants has consistently lagged behind. We report the extension of BER biochemical analysis to plants, using Arabidopsis cell extracts to monitor repair of DNA base damage in vitro. We have used this system to demonstrate that Arabidopsis cell extracts contain the enzymatic machinery required to completely repair ubiquitous DNA lesions, such as uracil and abasic (AP) sites. Our results reveal that AP sites generated after uracil excision are processed both by AP endonucleases and AP lyases, generating either 5'- or 3'-blocked ends, respectively. We have also found that gap filling and ligation may proceed either through insertion of just one nucleotide (short-patch BER) or several nucleotides (long-patch BER). This experimental system should prove useful in the biochemical and genetic dissection of BER in plants, and contribute to provide a broader picture of the evolution and biological relevance of DNA repair pathways.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3aDNA repair 3aanimals 3abacteria 3aevolution 3aexcision 3aglycosylases 3alyases 3anucleotides 3aplant damage 3aproteins 3areproduction 3auracil 3ayeasts 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aDNA Damage 2aDNA Glycosylasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aDNA Repair 2aDNA, Plantxbiosynthesis 2aDNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUracilxmetabolism 0aabasic sites1 aMorales-Ruiz, Teresa1 aRoldán-Arjona, Teresa.1 aAriza, Rafael R.0 tPlant journal.g2009 Nov., v. 60, no. 4 p.716-728dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03994.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04264naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171100001400188245010800202300001600310520210400326650001102430650001402441650001902455650001702474650002602491650002102517650001102538650001802549650002002567650001202587650006902599650002102668650003702689650003802726650006202764650006302826650002302889650003702912650004302949650002302992650003903015650004003054650003203094650000903126650003203135650002203167650004203189700001703231700001503248700001503263700001703278700001703295700001803312700001603330773007203346852000903418856009203427930003303519945002503552946001303577655001203590IND4378288920221119142422.0060302e200511  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437828892DNAL7 a163431492pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2005.00095.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aPille, F.10aSynovial fluid and plasma concentrations of ceftiofur after regional intravenous perfusion in the horse  ap. 610-617.  aObjective-To determine radiocarpal (RC) joint synovial fluid and plasma ceftiofur concentrations after regional intravenous perfusion (RIP) and systemic intravenous (IV) administration. Study Design-Experimental cross-over study. Animals-Five normal adult horses. Methods-One RC joint was randomly selected for RIP and the contralateral RC joint was sampled to determine intrasynovial ceftiofur concentrations after IV administration. Wash-out between IV and RIP was greater than or equal to 14 days. After surgical introduction of an intraarticular catheter, ceftiofur (2 g) was administered under general anesthesia either IV or by RIP after tourniquet application. Plasma and synovial fluid were collected over 24 hours. Samples were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection and the results were statistically analyzed using a linear mixed effect model. Results-Mean synovial fluid ceftiofur concentrations were consistently higher after RIP than after IV administration and were > 1 microgram/mL (minimal inhibitory concentration MIC for common pathogens) for >24 hours. Mean synovial fluid peak concentration of ceftiofur after RIP and IV administration was 392.7 +/- 103.29 microgram/mL at 0.5 hours postinjection (HPI) and 2.72 +/- 0.31 microgram/mL at 1 HPI, respectively. Large variations in synovial fluid and plasma ceftiofur concentrations were observed between horses regardless of administration technique. RIP did not cause adverse effects. Conclusions-Under the present experimental conditions RIP with ceftiofur (2 g) induced significantly higher intraarticular antibiotic concentrations in the RC joint in comparison with IV administration. Moreover, after RIP, synovial fluid ceftiofur concentrations remain above the MIC for common pathogens (1 microgram/mL) for > 24 hours. No adverse effects from the technique or the antibiotic were observed. Clinical relevance-RIP with high doses of ceftiofur may be a beneficial adjunctive therapy when treating equine synovial infections which are caused by cephalosporin susceptible microorganisms. 3ahorses 3aceftiofur 3asynovial fluid 3ablood plasma 3aintravenous injection 3apharmacokinetics 3acarpus 3aradius (bone) 3aadverse effects 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxadverse effectsxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aArea Under Curve 2aCartilage, Articularxmetabolism 2aCatheters, Indwellingxveterinary 2aCephalosporinsxadverse effectsxbloodxpharmacokinetics. 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aDrug Administration Routesxveterinary 2aHorsesxmetabolism 2aInfusions, Intravenousxveterinary 2aInjections, Intravenousxveterinary 2aLeukocyte Countxveterinary 2aMale 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aRandom Allocation 2aSynovial Fluidxcytologyxmetabolism.1 aBaere, S. de1 aCeelen, L.1 aDewulf, J.1 aCroubels, S.1 aGasthuys, F.1 aBacker, P. de1 aMartens, A.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2005 , v. 34, no. 6 p.610-617x0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2005.00095.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/10  aOther US 7aarticle01521naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245005400160300001600214520064400230653002400874653002200898653002600920653002400946700002000970773010300990852000901093856008501102930003301187946001101220655001201231IND4433995420221119142449.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443399542DNAL7 a10.1007/s10544-009-9378-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Lei 10aDNA nanowire translocation phenomena in nanopores  ap. 235-245.  aOne recent application of nanopores is to use them as detectors and analyzers for fast DNA sequencing.

The sequences of the cdc22(+) gene and of a multicopy suppressor of cdc22(ts) mutations, suc22(+), have been determined. The cdc22(+) open reading frame, which is interrupted in the genome by a single intron very close to its 5' end, encodes a protein of 811 amino acids, which has an amino acid sequence highly similar to that of the large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase from several species. The suc22(+) gene contains an uninterrupted open reading frame of 391 amino acids, very similar to the sequence of the small subunit of ribonucleotide reductase. Disruption of either gene is lethal. Upstream of the cdc22(+) coding region are seven short sequence elements similar to the recognition sequence for MluI, which are involved in regulating periodic transcription of the gene. Inhibition of DNA synthesis by hydroxyurea results in a several-fold increase in the level of the cdc22(+) transcript. In contrast, hydroxyurea does not induce the 1.5 kb transcript of suc22(+), but results in the induction of a 1.9 kb mRNA which hybridises to suc22(+) DNA. 3aSaccharomycetales 3amessenger RNA 3astructural genes 3acell division 3aamino acid sequences 3aribonucleotide reductase 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3abinding sites 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aintrons 0agenetic regulation 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aMcInerny, C.1 aHarris, P.1 aC, Gordon.1 aFantes, P.0 tMGG.g1993 Apr., v. 238, no. 1/2 p.241-251x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03444naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072001700171072001700188100001400205245013300219300001600352500001500368520153200383650002001915650001401935650000901949650001101958650001301969650001201982650002301994650001102017650001202028650000902040650001402049650001302063650001202076650005102088650002802139650004402167650002902211650003002240650000902270650004002279650004802319650001302367650003002380650001402410650003202424650001202456653001702468653003002485700001702515700001802532773007202550852000902622856009202631930003302723945002502756946001302781655001202794IND4376607520221119142536.0051209e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437660752DNAL7 a162663352pmid7 a10.1111/j.1532-950X.2005.00067.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

To compare the sensitivity of force platform gait analysis and visual observation at detecting gait abnormalities in Labradors after surgery for rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL). Animals-All dogs were adult Labrador Retrievers: 17 free of orthopedic and neurologic abnormalities, 100 with unilateral CCL rupture, and 131 studied 6 months after surgery for unilateral CCL injury, 15 with observable lameness. Procedure-Dogs were walked over a force platform with GRF recorded during the stance phase. Analytic properties of force platform gait analysis were calculated for several combinations of forces. The probability of visual observation detecting a gait abnormality was compared with that of force platform gait analysis. Results-We determined that a combination of peak vertical force (PVF) and falling slope were optimal for discriminating sound and lame Labradors. After surgery, many dogs (75%) with no observable lameness failed to achieve GRFs consistent with sound Labradors. Conclusion-A force platform is an accurate method of assessing lameness in Labradors with CCL rupture and is more sensitive than visual observation. Assessing lameness with a combination of GRFs is better than using univariate GRFs. Clinical Relevance-Therapies for stifle lameness can be accurately and objectively evaluated using 2 vertical ground reaction forces obtained from a force platform. 3aanimal injuries 3aligaments 3adogs 3astifle 3alameness 3asurgery 3aLabrador Retriever 3aforces 3awalking 3agait 3adetection 3aaccuracy 2aAnimals 2aAnterior Cruciate Ligamentxinjuriesxsurgery. 2aBiomechanical Phenomena 2aDog Diseasesxphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aDogsxinjuriesxsurgery. 2aExercise Testxveterinary 2aGait 2aImage Processing, Computer-Assisted 2aLameness, Animalxphysiopathologyxsurgery. 2aPedigree 2aPredictive Value of Tests 2aROC Curve 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aWalking 0aoptimization 0acranial cruciate ligament1 aHorstman, C.1 aConzemius, M.0 tVeterinary surgery.g2005 , v. 34, no. 5 p.445-449x0161-34997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950X.2005.00067.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDd5CTe2006/07/11  aOther US 7aarticle03309naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245019600163300001600359500002400375520202700399650002402426650001502450650001602465650002202481650001502503650001502518650001702533650001602550650002502566650001402591650001202605651001502617700002602632700001802658700002402676700002002700773010102720852000902821856006902830655001202899IND4384717620221119142600.0061025s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438471762DNAL7 a10.1007/s10533-006-9048-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTriska, Frank10aSoluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport and retention in tropical, rain forest streams draining a volcanic landscape in Costa Rica: in situ SRP amendment to streams and laboratory studies  ap. 145-157.  aIncludes references  aSoluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transport/retention was determined in two rain forest streams (Salto, Pantano) draining La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. There, SRP levels can be naturally high due to groundwater enriched by geothermal activity within the surfically dormant volcanic landscape, and subsequently discharged at ambient temperature. Combined field and laboratory approaches simulated high but natural geothermal SRP input with the objective of estimating the magnitude of amended SRP retention within high and low SRP settings and determining the underlying mechanisms of SRP retention. First, we examined short-term SRP retention/transport using combined SRP-conservative tracer additions at high natural in situ concentrations. Second, we attempted to observe a DIN response during SRP amendment as an indicator of biological uptake. Third, we determined SRP release/retention using laboratory sediment assays under control and biologically inhibited conditions. Short-term in situ tracer-SRP additions indicated retention in both naturally high and low SRP reaches. Retention of added SRP mass in Upper Salto (low SRP) was 17% (7.5 mg-P m-² h-¹), and 20% (10.9 mg-P m-² h-¹) in Lower Salto (high SRP). No DIN response in either nitrate or ammonium was observed. Laboratory assays using fresh Lower Salto sediments indicated SRP release (15.4 ± 5.9 μg-P g dry wt.-¹ h-¹), when incubated in filter sterilized Salto water at ambient P concentration, but retention when incubated in filter sterilized river water amended to 2.0 mg SRP l-¹ (233.2 ± 5.8 μg-P g dry wt.-¹ h-¹). SRP uptake/release was similar in both control- and biocide-treated sediments indicating predominantly abiotic retention. High SRP retention even under biologically saturated conditions, absence of a DIN response to amendment, patterns of desorption following amendment, and similar patterns of retention and release under control and biologically inhibited conditions all indicated predominantly abiotic P flux. 3aambient temperature 3adesorption 3agroundwater 3aindicator species 3alandscapes 3aphosphorus 3arain forests 3ariver water 3asaturated conditions 3asediments 3astreams 3aCosta Rica1 aPringle, Catherine M.1 aDuff, John H.1 aAvanzino, Ronald J.1 aZellweger, Gary0 tBiogeochemistry.g2006 Nov., v. 81, no. 2 p.145-157dKluwer Academic Publishersx0168-25637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10533-006-9048-03electronic resource 7aarticle02600naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245011000144300001600254520113200270650000901402650001701411650001101428650002501439650001501464650002001479650007101499650004701570650003701617650001201654650003301666650002101699650001101720650002901731650005601760650006701816650001701883653002401900700001901924700001901943700001601962773009701978852000902075939003302084946001302117655001202130IND9303613420221119142637.0930614e199302  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930361342DNAL7 a80942772pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwing, K.K.10aReduction of isoflurane anesthetic requirement by medetomidine and its restoration by atipamezole in dogs  ap. 294-299.  aThe isoflurane-sparing effect of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist medetomidine (30 micrograms/kg of body weight, IV) was tested in 7 dogs, using a blinded, randomized-block study design. The baseline minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of isoflurane was 1.18 vol% (95% confidence interval [0.97,1.39]). Medetomidine significantly (P < 0.003) reduced isoflurane MAC by 47.2%. Atipamezole (0.3 mg/kg, IV), an alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, completely reversed the effect of medetomidine on isoflurane MAC. Atipamezole alone did not significantly alter isoflurane MAC. After medetomidine administration, marked bradycardia developed in all dogs and persisted for more than 2 hours. Mean arterial blood pressure increased acutely, but later decreased, and hypotension persisted for more than 2 hours. Atipamezole reversed the bradycardic and hypotensive effects of medetomidine. Results of this study indicate that medetomidine may be useful in clinical cases in which isoflurane MAC-reduction is desirable and that atipamezole might be used to reverse desirable and undesirable effects of medetomidine during isoflurane anesthesia. 3adogs 3amedetomidine 3adosage 3anarcotic antagonists 3aanesthesia 3adrug antagonism 2aAdrenergic alpha-Agonistsxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aAdrenergic alpha-Antagonistsxpharmacology 2aAnesthesiaxmethodsxveterinary. 2aAnimals 2aBlood Pressurexdrug effects 2aDogsxphysiology 2aFemale 2aHeart Ratexdrug effects 2aImidazolesxantagonists & inhibitorsxpharmacology. 2aIsofluranexadministration & dosagexantagonists & inhibitors. 2aMedetomidine 0ainhaled anesthetics1 aMohammed, H.O.1 aScarlett, J.M.1 aShort, C.E.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1993 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.294-299x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02503naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245012100166300001600287520115900303650002401462650001901486650001701505650002001522650001201542650001901554650001401573650002201587653000801609653001001617653003201627653001301659653002101672653002801693700001801721700001601739700001801755700001601773773012301789852000901912856009201921930003302013946001102046655001202057IND4428558020221119142612.0091113e200912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442855802DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1744-7348.2009.00341.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNunes, C.10aPhotosynthesis light curves: a method for screening water deficit resistance in the model legume Medicago truncatula  ap. 321-332.  aThe photosynthetic performance of two transgenic Medicago truncatula lines engineered for water deficit (WD) resistance and a non-transformed line was assessed in a growth chamber experiment in well-watered, WD and stress recovery conditions. Direct gas exchange measurements showed that the transgenic plants had lower photosynthetic rates under well-hydrated conditions when compared to the non-transformed line. Photosynthesis light curves confirmed this difference but more importantly showed a progressive change in photosynthetic behaviour with intensity of dehydration. Dehydration led to sharp decreases of maximum photosynthesis (Amax), photosynthetic apparent quantum yield (Φ) and apparent light compensation point. The recovery rates showed that all plant lines had a similar capacity to regain control photosynthetic values. Furthermore, results suggested that light was more limiting for photosynthesis than atmospheric CO₂ concentration. The results are discussed in terms of the use of photosynthesis light response curves as a non-destructive and expeditious approach to select M. truncatula transformants with improved WD resistance. 3aMedicago truncatula 3acarbon dioxide 3agas exchange 3agrowth chambers 3alegumes 3aphotosynthesis 3ascreening 3atransgenic plants 0aAdc 0aDsp22 0aphotosynthesis light curves 0arecovery 0atransgenic lines 0awater deficit screening1 aAraújo, S.S.1 aSilva, J.M.1 aFevereiro, P.1 aSilva, A.B.0 tAnnals of applied biology.g2009 Dec., v. 155, no. 3 p.321-332dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0003-47467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7348.2009.00341.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20091113b20091204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02636naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001800156245011900174300002200293500002400315520098900339650002801328650001701356650001401373650001701387650002501404650001501429650002301444650001201467650001501479650002201494650001101516650001401527650003101541650003201572650002101604650006001625650004001685650003001725700002001755700002401775700002001799700003601819700003301855700002001888773012401908852000902032856007702041655001202118IND4462091720221119142716.0111021s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446209172DNAL7 a218428322pmid7 a10.1021/jf202358m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYing, DanYang10aTocopherol and Ascorbate Have Contrasting Effects on the Viability of Microencapsulated Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG  ap. 10556–10563.  aIncludes references  aThe antioxidants, sodium ascorbate and tocopherol, have contrasting effects on the viability of microencapsulated Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) spray-dried powders during storage (4 and 25 °C; 32, 57, and 70% relative humidity). The addition of tocopherol improved probiotic viability during storage, while the incorporation of Na-ascorbate alone or in combination with tocopherol had detrimental effects on probiotic survival. The beneficial effect of tocopherol is a consequence of its chemical antioxidative action. The reduced viability in Na-ascorbate containing microcapsule formulations is hypothesized to be due primarily to the production of acetic acids arising from chemical degradation reactions and the catabolism of ascorbate by LGG. This study highlights the importance of considering the detrimental consequences of degradative chemical reactions and the metabolic fate of additives on the viability of probiotics when designing probiotic encapsulant formulations. 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aacetic acids 3aadditives 3aantioxidants 3achemical degradation 3ametabolism 3amicroencapsulation 3apowders 3aprobiotics 3arelative humidity 3asodium 3aviability 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aDrug Compounding 2aLacticaseibacillus rhamnosusxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aProbioticsxadministration & dosage 2aTocopherolsxpharmacology1 aSanguansri, Luz1 aWeerakkody, Rangika1 aSingh, Tanoj K.1 aLeischtfeld, Susette Freimuller1 aGantenbein-Demarchi, Corinne1 aAugustin, M.

Plants grown for 5 days in soil infested with C. foecundissimum and transplanted to the soil infested with the pathogen showed a reduction in disease incidence ranging from 45.5 to 70.0% for isolate S8 and from 33.4 to 63.4% for isolate A32. The content of phenolic compounds in 15-day-old seedlings colonised by C. foecundissimum S8 was almost twice that found in 5-day-old seedlings colonised by this fungus.

Serum T3 AA concentrations defined 2 groups of sera; 28 sera had low T3 AA concentration (less than or equal to 20 ng/ml) and 17 sera had high T3 AA concentration (greater than or equal to 250 ng/ml). Direct linear correlation between T3 AA concentration and apparent serum T3 concentration was observed (r = 0.75). Serum with low T3 AA concentration had apparent T3 concentration that was significantly (P < 0.01) lower than that in serum with high T3 AA concentration. Mean serum T4 concentration was not significantly different between serum with low or high T3 AA concentration. Mean Tg AA activity was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in serum with low T3 AA concentration than in serum with high T3 AA concentration. Addition of free T3 to serum significantly (P < 0.05) decreased detectable activity of Tg AA in both groups of sera. However, significant difference in magnitude of the reduction was not observed between sera with low or high T3 AA concentration. Results indicate that a fraction of Tg AA recognizes T3-containing epitopes in Tg. Increased prevalence of T3 AA for serum with high Tg AA activity indicates that T3 AA may be another valid indicator of lymphocytic thyroiditis. These antibodies may be generated against the hormonogenic epitopes of Tg. 3aepitopes 3ablood serum 3athyroglobulin 3adogs 3atriiodothyronine 3aautoantibodies 2aAnimals 2aAutoantibodiesxbloodximmunology. 2aDogsxbloodximmunology. 2aEpitopesxblood 2aThyroglobulinxbloodximmunology. 2aThyroxinexblood 2aTriiodothyroninexbloodximmunology. 0athyroxine1 aThompson, J.1 aBeale, K.1 aKeisling, K.0 tAmerican journal of veterinary research.g1993 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.244-247x0002-96457nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02750naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245013700166300001600303500002400319520135900343650002101702650002901723650002701752650002701779650001701806650003101823650002101854650001301875650001801888650001101906650002201917650001601939700002501955700002301980700002502003700002302028700003002051700002302081700002202104773010002126852000902226856006902235655001202304IND4384732320221119142126.0061025s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438473232DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-006-0147-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGursky, Lucas J.10aProduction of piscicolin 126 by Carnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL26 is controlled by temperature and induction peptide concentration  ap. 317-325.  aIncludes references  aCarnobacterium maltaromaticum UAL26 produces the antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) piscicolin 126, first isolated from C. maltaromaticum JG126, and carnobacteriocin BM1, first isolated from C. maltaromaticum LV17. C. maltaromaticum UAL26 is especially inhibitory to strains of Listeria monocytogenes. Bacteriocin activity is not observable in the supernatant of cultures of UAL26 grown in liquid media at 25°C, but at temperatures less than 19°C bacteriocin activity can be detected. In contrast to JG126, the piscicolin 126 operon is downregulated in UAL26 at higher temperature, and piscicolin 126 mRNA is not detected when UAL26 is grown at 25°C. Bacteriocin production in UAL26 grown at 15°C can be induced by addition of 10-¹⁰ M of chemically synthesized piscicolin 126 induction peptide (PisN). However, induction of bacteriocin production in UAL26 grown at 25°C requires 10-⁷ M of PisN. The sequence of the piscicolin 126 operon in UAL26 contains 34 single nucleotide differences compared with the piscicolin 126 operon in JG126, including single nucleotide differences in the immunity, histidine kinase, dedicated ABC-transporter and accessory genes, as well as a single nucleotide deletion in the transport accessory gene. This deletion causes a frameshift, resulting in truncation of the PisE transport accessory protein in UAL26. 3aABC transporters 3aCarnobacterium piscicola 3aListeria monocytogenes 3aantimicrobial peptides 3abacteriocins 3agene expression regulation 3ahistidine kinase 3aimmunity 3amessenger RNA 3aoperon 3asequence deletion 3atemperature1 aMartin, Nathaniel I.1 aDerksen, Darren J.1 avan Belkum, Marco J.1 aKamalajīta Kaura.1 aVederas, J.

MÃ¼ller, is a devastating disease of European hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) in the USAâs Pacific Northwest. Complete resistance from âGasawayâ, controlled by a dominant allele at a single locus, has been extensively used in the hazelnut breeding program at Oregon State University (OSU) since its discovery in 1975. Most advanced selections and the cultivars âSantiamâ, âYamhillâ and âJeffersonâ carry resistance from âGasawayâ. Concern over the breakdown of a single resistance gene prompted a continuing search for new sources of resistance. Greenhouse inoculation studies identified several sources of qualitative resistance, including accessions of C. avellana, other Corylus species and interspecific hybrids. The challenges of breeding for resistance to a pathogen absent in Corvallis, state quarantine regulations to slow its spread, its two-year life cycle, and difficulties in determining disease response stimulated a search for molecular markers linked to resistance. We have used the robust RAPD markers 152-800 and 268-580 in marker-assisted selection for âGasawayâ resistance for more than a decade. Molecular markers have also been identified linked to resistance from âRatoliâ, OSU 759.010 and OSU 408.040. Using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers as anchor loci, we assigned resistance from âGasawayâ, âRatoliâ, OSU 759.010, OSU 408.040 and âCulplaâ to linkage groups 6, 7, 2, 6 and 6, respectively. In this paper, we summarize the current status of the EFB resistance sources being used in the OSU hazelnut breeding program. For resistance loci on different linkage groups, we intend to use pyramiding with an expectation that the combined resistance will be more durable.

Molecular markers detect differences in DNA sequence, and are thus less ambiguous than phenotypic markers, which require gene expression. We have demonstrated a molecular approach to the mapping of mutant genes using RAPD markers and pooling of individuals based on phenotype. To map genes by phenotypic pooling a strain carrying a mutation is crossed to a strain that is homozygous for the wild-type allele of the corresponding gene. A set of primers corresponding to mapped RAPDs distributed throughout the genome and in coupling phase with respect to the wild type parent is then used to amplify DNA from wild type and mutant pools of F2 individuals. Linkage between the mutant gene and the RAPD markers is visualized by the absence of the corresponding RAPD DNA bands in the mutant pool. We developed a mathematical model for calculating the probability of linkage between RAPDs and target genes and we succesfully tested this approach with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3asimulation models 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aphenotype 3alinkage (genetics) 3amutation 3achromosome mapping 3amutants 3acomputer software 3agenetic markers 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDNAxgenetics 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenetic Markers 2aMathematics 2aModels, Genetic 2aMutation 2aPhenotype 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 2aProbability 2aSoftware 0amathematical models 0acomputer simulation1 aReiter, R.S.1 aYoung, R.M.1 aScolnik, P.A.0 tNucleic acids research.g1993 June 11, v. 21, no. 11 p.2697-2702x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/21.11.26973Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02994naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110024003200131040001800163100001800181245007400199300001800273500001500291520123000306650001501536650001301551650002101564650001701585650001601602650000801618650002901626650002501655650002501680650002501705650001501730650001501745650001201760650002101772650003701793650001001830650001201840650003001852650001801882650001101900650002301911650002701934650002401961653001601985653001102001653001702012653001902029653003702048700001402085773008602099852000902185856008202194930003302276945001302309946001102322990002302333655001202356IND2037054220221119142957.0940202e19930625enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203705422DNAL7 a83324932pmid7 aPMC3096642pmcid7 a10.1093/nar/21.12.28372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFickett, J.W.10aEstimation of protein coding density in a corpus of DNA sequence data  ap. 2837-2844.  a2019-12-04  aA number of experimental methods have been reported for estimating the number of genes in a genome, or the closely related coding density of a genome, defined as the fraction of base pairs in codons. Recently, DNA sequence data representative of the genome as a whole have become available for several organisms, making the problem of estimating coding density amenable to sequence analytic methods. Estimates of coding density for a single genome vary widely, so that methods with characterized error bounds have become increasingly desirable. We present a method to estimate the protein coding density in a corpus of DNA sequence data, in which a 'coding statistic' is calculated for a large number of windows of the sequence under study, and the distribution of the statistic is decomposed into two normal distributions, assumed to be the distributions of the coding statistic in the coding and noncoding fractions of the sequence windows. The accuracy of the method is evaluated using known data and application is made to the yeast chromosome III sequence and to C. elegans cosmid sequences. It can also be applied to fragmentary data, for example a collection of short sequences determined in the course of STS mapping. 3aestimation 3aproteins 3astructural genes 3agenetic code 3achromosomes 3aDNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3anucleotide sequences 3astatistical analysis 3aalgorithms 3aprediction 2aAnimals 2aBase Composition 2aCaenorhabditis elegansxgenetics 2aCodon 2aCosmids 2aDNAxanalysisxchemistry. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHumans 2aProteinsxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aStatistics as Topic 0agene number 0agenome 0agene density 0achromosome iii 0amax codon usage coding statistic1 aGuigo, R.0 tNucleic acids research.g1993 June 25, v. 21, no. 12 p.2837-2844x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/21.12.28373Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03375naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245013400131300001400265500010700279520229200386650001302678650001402691650002402705650001402729650001302743650001102756650001402767650001002781651001002791651001102801700002202812773014402834856005002978852000903028655001203037IND4491899120221119142547.0150202e20140923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND449189912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrau Beretta, P.10aPreliminary performance of new introduced and commercially grown hazelnut cultivars in the bio bio region, Central-South of Chile  ap. 61-66.  aPaper presented VIII International Congress on Hazelnut held on March 19-22, 2012, Temuco City (Chile)  aNew hazelnut cultivars introduced from the Hazelnut Breeding Program at Oregon State University (Corvallis), and commercially grown cultivars were evaluated from 2007 to 2011 at Santa Rosa, Experimental Farm at Centro Regional de InvestigaciÃ³n Quilamapu, Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias (latitude 36Â°31â34âS; longitude 71Â°54â40âW), Chillan, Chile. Plantings established in 2005 and 2007 are discussed in this paper. The 2005 trial were ten cultivars; âMontebelloâ, âWillametteâ, âLewisâ, âMortarellaâ, âButlerâ, âCasinaâ, âEnnisâ, âHallâs Giantâ, âNegretâ, âTonda delle Langheâ. During the first years of evaluation, the cultivars; âEnnisâ, âMortarellaâ, âButlerâ, âMontebelloâ and âWillametteâ had cumulative nut production greater than âHallâs Giantâ, âNegretâ and âTonda delle Langheâ, which had the lowest cumulative nut production. The yield efficiency of the cultivar âCasinaâ was the highest (54.8%), while âMontebelloâ was the lowest (33.35%).

The distribution of this non-universal genetic code in various yeast species was studied using an in vitro translation assay system with a synthetic messenger RNA containing CUG codons in-frame. It was found that CUG is used as a serine codon in six out of the fourteen species examined, while it is used for leucine in the remaining eight. The tRNA species responsible for the translation of codon CUG as serine was detected in all the six species in which CUG is translated as serine. The grouping according to the CUG codon assignments in these yeast species shows a good correlation with physiological classification by the chain lengths of the isoprenoid moiety of ubiquinone and the cell-wall sugar contained in the yeasts. The six Candida species examined in which CUG is used as serine belong to one distinct group in Hemiascomycetes. 3aleucine 3amessenger RNA 3aserine 3agenetic code 3atransfer RNA 3aCandida 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAscomycotaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCandidaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aCodon 2aDNA, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aKinetics 2aLeucinexgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Transfer, Serxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSerinexgenetics 0agenbank/d12941 0aSaccharomycetales 0agenbank/d14940 0amolecular sequence data 0atranslation 0agenbank/d14890 0agenbank/d148911 aSuzuki, T.1 aMori, M.1 aOsawa, S.1 aUeda, T.1 aWatanabe, K.1 aNakase, T.0 tNucleic acids research.g1993 Aug. 25, v. 21, no. 17 p.4039-4045x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/21.17.40393Available from publisher's Web site  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdLDP  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle01131naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001400139245009900153300001800252520019600270650001100466650001300477650002200490653001400512653001600526700001500542700001400557773008700571852000900658856007900667930003300746945001300779946001300792655001200805IND2036197620221119140906.0931209e199307  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203619762DNAL7 a10.1021/np50097a0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Y.L.12aA novel 12-deoxorotenone, 12-deoxo-12-alpha-acetoxyelliptone, from the roots of Derris oblonga  ap. 1187-1189.  aThe structure of 12-deoxo-12 alpha-acetoxyelliptone[1],a novel 12-denxorotenone isolated from Derris oblonga (Leguminosae), has been determined on the basis of its spectral and chemical data. 3aDerris 3arotenone 3aspectral analysis 0astructure 0aderivatives1 aChen, Y.L.1 aKuo, Y.H.0 tJournal of natural products.g1993 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.1187-1189x0163-38647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/np50097a0293Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01191naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002900092040001800121100001700139245005400156300001800210520028200228650001400510650001300524650002300537650002200560653001400582700001900596700001600615773008700631852000900718856007900727930003300806945001300839946001300852655001200865IND2036197020221119140800.0931209e199307  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203619702DNAL7 a10.1021/np50097a0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNelson, G.J.10a1-phenylheptane-1,5-dione from Phellinus tremulus  ap. 1182-1183.  a1-phenylheptane-1,5-dione [1], which has not been previously reported as a natural product, has been isolated from Phellinus tremulus.

One of the disadvantages of this cultivar is the high suckersâ emission, causing high maintenance costs yearly. In 2000, a trial to select new and non-suckers emission rootstocks for hazelnut was established at IRTA-Mas de Bover. âNegret-Nâ¢9â selection was grafted onto four clonal rootstocks (âDundeeâ and âNewbergâ, two open pollinated C. colurna seeds; the low suckers emission cultivar âTonda Biancaâ and âIRTA-MBâ¢69â selection) and compared to the own-rooted âNegret-Nâ¢9â. The trial was statistically designed by randomized complete block with ten replications, and one tree per replication and clonal rootstock. Vigor, suckers emission, production and nut characteristics have been evaluated during nine years. The last five years of the trial, kernel quality properties were added to the characterization. Results showed that some rootstocks have a strong influence on vigor and yield of âNegret - Nâ¢9â during the period 2003-2011. âDundeeâ and âTonda Biancaâ rootstocks showed the highest vegetative growth, whereas âDundeeâ, âNewbergâ and âMB-69â showed the lowest suckers emission. Yield performance was highest in âDundeeâ and contrary to âTonda Biancaâ that showed the lowest yield. Referring to kernel quality studies, rootstocks have a positive influence on oil stability and induces a brown light color in the kernel pellicle, in contrast with the brown dark color in own-rooted âNegret Nâ¢9â. Kernel fatty acid composition was also influenced by the kind of material used (own-rooted or grafted trees). 3acolor 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3ahazelnuts 3aoils 3aopen pollination 3arootstocks 3aseeds 3atrees 3avegetative growth 3avigor 3aSpain1 aCristofori, V.1 aSilvestri, C.1 aCelli, T.1 aHermoso, J.

By removal of anionic polysaccharides in a first stage of dereplication, we have eliminated from further consideration a considerable number of these extracts. However, a still substantial proportion of the active extracts remained, from which we wished to select and prioritize a small percentage for our detailed bioassay-directed fractionation studies. Therefore, a chemical screening protocol, utilizing various solid-phase extraction cartridges, has been developed for a second-stage dereplication and to assist in prioritization of these extracts for our further investigations. 3aantiviral properties 3aalgae 3aplant extracts 3apolysaccharides 3ascreening 3aseparation 2aCD4-Positive T-Lymphocytesxdrug effects 2aCells, Cultured 2aDrug Evaluation, Preclinical 2aHIV-1xdrug effects 2aHumans 2aPlant Extractsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aTanninsxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aVirus Replicationxdrug effects 0ahuman immunodeficiency virus 0aanionic polysaccharides 0aalgae and seaweeds 0aplants1 aMunro, M.H.G.1 aFuller, R.W.1 aManfredi, K.P.1 aMcKee, T.C.1 aTischler, M.1 aBokesch, H.R.1 aGestafson, K.R.1 aBeutler, J.A.1 aBoyd, M.R.0 tJournal of natural products.g1993 July, v. 56, no. 7 p.1123-1129x0163-38647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/np50097a0163Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03851naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100002300156245013300179300001800312500002400330520172900354650002102083650001202104650004002116650001402156650004302170650001302213650001802226650001102244650001702255650001002272650002102282650000902303650005502312650007202367650005502439650004102494650001102535650006302546650001102609650000902620650001602629650006002645650005602705650001702761650002802778650004502806700002202851700001302873700002202886700002202908700002402930700002602954700002002980700002203000773010503022852000903127856007703136655001203213IND4384823520221119140657.0061030s2006    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438482352DNAL7 a170656712pmid7 a10.2337/dc06-08722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeil, H.

Lipid-lowering statin therapy reduces the proportional risk as effectively in older patients as in younger individuals; however, limited data are available for elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. We conducted a post hoc analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin among 1,129 patients aged 65-75 years at randomization with 1,709 younger patients in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--CARDS was a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 10 mg/day atorvastatin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients aged 40-75 years with LDL cholesterol concentrations <=4.14 mmol/l followed for a median of 3.9 years. The primary end point was time to first occurrence of acute coronary heart disease events, coronary revascularizations, or stroke. RESULTS:--Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a 38% reduction in relative risk ([95% CI -58 to -8], P = 0.017) of first major cardiovascular events in older patients and a 37% reduction ([-57 to -7], P = 0.019) in younger patients. Corresponding absolute risk reductions were 3.9 and 2.7%, respectively (difference 1.2% [95% CI -2.8 to 5.3], P = 0.546); numbers needed to treat for 4 years to avoid one event were 21 and 33, respectively. All-cause mortality was reduced nonsignificantly by 22% ([-49 to 18], P = 0.245) and 37% ([-64 to 9], P = 0.98), respectively. The overall safety profile of atorvastatin was similar between age-groups. CONCLUSIONS:--Absolute and relative benefits of statin therapy in older patients with type 2 diabetes are substantial, and all patients warrant treatment unless specifically contraindicated. 3acoronary disease 3aelderly 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amortality 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3arelative risk 3astroke 3atherapeutics 2aAdult 2aAge Distribution 2aAged 2aAngina, Unstablexmortalityxprevention & control. 2aAnticholesteremic Agentsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aCoronary Diseasexmortalityxprevention & control. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xmortality 2aFemale 2aHeptanoic Acidsxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMyocardial Infarctionxmortalityxprevention & control. 2aPyrrolesxadministration & dosagexadverse effects. 2aRisk Factors 2aRisk Reduction Behavior 2aStrokexmortalityxprevention & control.1 aDeMicco, David A.1 aLuo, Don1 aBetteridge, John.1 aColhoun, Helen M.1 aDurrington, Paul N.1 aLivingstone, Shona J.1 aFuller, John H.1 aHitman, Graham A.0 tDiabetes care.g2006 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.2378-2384dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc06-08723Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03753naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146100001700163245012500180300001400305520181300319650002302132650001302155650002002168650001002188650002002198650001302218650001202231650001002243650001802253650002202271650002202293650002502315650001202340650002102352650001702373650001102390650004102401650003102442650005602473650004502529650003202574650005602606650001402662650002502676650003202701653003602733700001802769700001302787700001602800700001802816700001302834700002502847700001502872700001502887773010902902852000903011930003303020945002503053946001303078655001203091IND4399338720221119140646.0071223e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439933872DNAL7 a181564052pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aWang, Junjun10aIntrauterine Growth Restriction Affects the Proteomes of the Small Intestine, Liver, and Skeletal Muscle in Newborn Pigs  ap. 60-66.  aEfficiency of nutrient utilization is high in neonates with normal birth weights but is reduced in those with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). However, the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. This study was conducted with the piglet model and proteomics technology to test the hypothesis that IUGR affects expression of key proteins that regulate growth and development of the small intestine, liver, and muscle, the major organs involved in the digestion, absorption, and metabolism of dietary nutrients. Jejunum, liver, and gastrocnemius muscle were obtained from IUGR and normal birth-weight piglets at birth for analysis of proteomes using the 2-dimensional-PAGE MS technology. The results indicate that IUGR decreased the levels of proteins that regulate immune function (immunoglobulins and annexin A1), oxidative defense (peroxiredoxin 1, transferrin, and ζ-crystallin), intermediary metabolism (creatine kinase, alcohol dehydrogenase, L-lactate dehydrogenase, prostaglandin F synthase, apolipoprotein AI, catecho O-methyltransferase, and phosphoglycerate kinase 1), protein synthesis (eukaryotic translation initiation factor-3), and tissue growth (β-actin, desmin, and keratin 10) in a tissue-specific manner. In addition, IUGR increased the levels of proteins that are involved in proteolysis (proteasome α-5 and α-1 subunits), response to oxidative stress (scavenger-receptor protein and α-1 acid glycoprotein), and ATP hydrolysis (F1-ATPase). These novel findings suggest that cellular signaling defects, redox imbalance, reduced protein synthesis, and enhanced proteolysis may be the major mechanisms responsible for abnormal absorption and metabolism of nutrients, as well as reduced growth and impaired development of the small intestine, liver, and muscle in IUGR neonates. 3agrowth retardation 3aproteome 3asmall intestine 3aliver 3askeletal muscle 3aneonates 3apiglets 3afetus 3aanimal models 3afetal development 3aprotein synthesis 3anutrient utilization 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aBirth Weight 2aFemale 2aFetal Growth Retardationxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Profiling. 2aIntestine, Smallxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLiverxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aMuscle Proteinsxmetabolism 2aMuscle, Skeletalxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy 2aProteomexmetabolism 2aSwinexgrowth & development 0aintrauterine growth restriction1 aChen, Lixiang1 aLi, Defa1 aYin, Yulong1 aWang, Xiaoqiu1 aLi, Peng1 aDangott, Lawrence J.1 aHu, Weixin1 aWu, Guoyao0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 Jan., v. 138, no. 1 p.60-66dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle01746naa a2200337 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001300115245005700128300001400185500001500199520083300214650001101047650001301058650001101071650002601082653001101108653001501119653001401134653002901148700001401177773013301191852001301324939003301337945000801370946000901378852000901387655001201396991563360440742620221119140437.0851206e198307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859262882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZepp, G.10aPotato prices' relation to supply and demand factors  ap. 29-30.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Relatively large price changes are required to bring consumer purchases of potatoes in line with changes in potato production. Consequently, the U.S. average farm price changes 4 to 5 percent for each 1-percent change in total potato production. Increasing consumer incomes in United States have resulted in greater potato use. Each 1-percent change in the U.S. average per capita income causes about 1-percent change in potato prices. Higher consumer income boosts the demand for processing potatoes more than for fresh potatoes. Increases of women in the work force also raise the demand for processing potatoes, and reduce the demand for fresh. Potato farmers cope with cost-price squeezes by stressing production efficiency, forward contracting a portion of their crop, and supporting industry promotion activities. 3aprices 3apotatoes 3aincome 3aprocessing technology 0ademand 0aproduction 0aconsumers 0acash forward contracting1 aJones, E.0 tVegetable situation - United States Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.g1983 July, v. 229 p.29-30x0042-30847nnas  aDNAL AGE  a00000000b19851206c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01782naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100002000115245007300135300001400208500001500222520088300237650001501120650001101135650001301146650001501159653001101174653002001185653001501205700001901220773013301239852001301372939003301385945000801418946000901426852000901435655001201444991563360150742620221119140804.0850702e198408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859256042DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmallwood, D.M.10aHousehold characteristics and the demand for vegetables and potatoes  ap. 11-13.  a2019-12-05  aExtract: Income and other household characteristics affect per person at-home expenditures for 18 vegetable and potato product groups. Data comes from USDA's 1977-78 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey, which offers the most recent and comprehensive data available on household food consumption patterns. Generally, higher income households spend less per person on dried vegetables; fresh, canned, and dehydrated potatoes; and canned vegetables for at-home use than do lower income households, but spend more on fresh and frozen vegetables; vegetable juice; and potato chips, sticks, and salads. For example, a 10-percent increase in income is associated with about a 3.3-percent decline in at-home dried vegetable expenditures, but nearly a 5-percent increase for frozen vegetables. Geographic location, season, race, and the age composition of households also affect spending. 3ahouseholds 3aincome 3apotatoes 3ademography 0ademand 0acharacteristics 0avegetables1 aBlaylock, J.R.0 tVegetable situation - United States Dept. of Agriculture, Economic Research Service.g1984 Aug., v. 233 p.11-13x0042-30847nnas  aDNAL AGE  a00000000b19850702c00000000  aAGE  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01359naa a2200325 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001100115245004300126300001400169520045100183650001500634650001300649650001900662650002400681650002400705650002300729653002400752653002100776700001600797773013600813852001300949939003300962945000800995946000901003852000901012655001201021991563359790742620221119140722.0850627e198502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE859255962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJLove.10aMarket characteristics of bell peppers  ap. 13-17.  aExtract: Regression analysis is employed to estimate properties of the demand for fresh-market bell peppers.

  1 aMcNaughton, Sarah A.13aAn Index of Diet and Eating Patterns Is a Valid Measure of Diet Quality in an Australian Population  ap. 86-93.  a2019-12-05  aDiet indices represent an integrated approach to assessing eating patterns and behaviors. The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive food-based dietary index to reflect adherence to healthy eating recommendations, evaluate the construct validity of the index using nutrient intakes, and evaluate this index in relation to sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, risk factors, and self-assessed health status. Data were analyzed from adult participants of the Australian National Nutrition Survey who completed a 108-item FFQ and a food habits questionnaire (n = 8220). The dietary guideline index (DGI) consisted of 15 items reflecting the dietary guidelines, including dietary indicators of vegetables and legumes, fruit, total cereals, meat and alternatives, total dairy, beverages, sodium, saturated fat, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars. Diet quality was incorporated using indicators relating to whole-grain cereals, lean meat, reduced/low fat dairy, and dietary variety. We investigated associations between the DGI score, sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, chronic disease risk factors, and nutrient intakes. We found associations between the DGI scores and sex, age, income, area-level socioeconomic disadvantage, smoking, physical activity, waist:hip ratio, systolic blood pressure (males only), and self-assessed health status (females only) (all P < 0.05). Higher DGI scores were associated with lower intakes of energy, total fat, and saturated fat and higher intakes of fiber, β-carotene, vitamin C, folate, calcium, and iron (P < 0.05). This food-based dietary index is able to discriminate across a variety of sociodemographic factors, health behaviors, and self-assessed health and reflects intakes of key nutrients. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aeating habits 3amen 3awomen 3ahealth status 3agender differences 3anutrition assessment 3adietary surveys 3adietary recommendations 3aadults 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aDietxstandardsxstatistics & numerical data. 2aDietary Carbohydrates 2aDietary Fats 2aDietary Proteins 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFoodxstandards 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Assessment 2aNutrition Surveys 2aSurveys and Questionnaires. 2aSocioeconomic Factors 3aAustralia 0aAustralia 0adiet 0aAustralian National Nutrition Survey1 aBall, Kylie1 aCrawford, David1 aMishra, Gita D.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 Jan., v. 138, no. 1 p.86-93dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle01236naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001600115245004000131300001400171520051200185650001100697650002200708650001200730653001200742653001100754773013400765852000900899939003300908945000800941946000900949655001200958991563358760742620221119140717.0791018e197808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aAGE799141992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRaleigh, S.10aLettuce--prices, costs, and margins  ap. 31-35.  aThe retail value of Iceberg lettuce sold in Chicago and New York City has increased an average of 55 cents per 24-head carton each year between 1967 and 1977.

  1 aSolís, Claudia.10aFolate Intake at RDA Levels Is Inadequate for Mexican American Men with the Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase 677TT Genotype  ap. 67-72.  aSince the establishment of the 1998 folate recommended dietary allowance (RDA), the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C[rightward arrow]T variant has emerged as a strong modifier of folate status. This controlled feeding study investigated the adequacy of the RDA, 400 μg/d as dietary folate equivalents (DFE), for Mexican American men with the MTHFR 677CC or TT genotype. Because of the interdependency between folate and choline, the influence of choline intake on folate status was also assessed. Mexican American men (n = 60; 18-55 y) with the MTHFR 677CC (n = 31) or TT (n = 29) genotype consumed 438 μg DFE/d and total choline intakes of 300, 550 (choline adequate intake), 1100, or 2200 mg/d for 12 wk. Folate status response was assessed via serum folate (SF), RBC folate, plasma total homocysteine (tHcy), and urinary folate. SF decreased (P < 0.001) 66% to 7.9 ± 0.7 nmol/L (means ± SEM) in men with the 677TT genotype and 62% to 11.3 ± 0.9 nmol/L in the 677CC genotype. Plasma tHcy increased (P < 0.0001) 170% to 31 ± 3 μmol/L in men with the 677TT genotype and 18% to 11.6 ± 0.3 μmol/L in the 677CC genotype. At the end of the study, 34% (677TT) and 16% (677CC) had SF concentrations <6.8 nmol/L and 79% (677TT) and 7% (677CC) had tHcy concentrations >14 μmol/L. Choline intake did not influence the response of the measured variables. These data showed that the folate RDA is not adequate for men of Mexican descent, particularly for those with the MTHFR 677TT genotype, and demonstrated a lack of influence of choline intake on the folate status variables measured in this study. 3afolic acid 3aRecommended Dietary Allowances 3aMexican Americans 3amen 3agenotype 3acholine 3anutrition-genotype interaction 3anutritional status 2aAdult 2aCholinexpharmacology 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFolic Acid Deficiencyxmetabolism 2aGenetic Variation 2aGenotype 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMethylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)xgenetics 2aMexican Americansxgenetics 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Policy 2aVitamin B Complexxadministration & dosagexpharmacology.1 aVeenema, Kristin1 aIvanov, Alexandre A.1 aTran, Sally1 aLi, Rui1 aWang, Wei1 aMoriarty, David J.1 aMaletz, Charles V.1 aCaudill, Marie A.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 Jan., v. 138, no. 1 p.67-72dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20080402b20080502c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/03/05  aOther US 7aarticle02112naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003300147245012100180300001800301520093700319592002801256650002801284650002801312650002601340650001601366650002201382650001001404650001101414650001501425650001101440650001201451650001701463700002401480773015501504856008201659852000901741655001201750IND60627357320221118010952.0190816e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062735732DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-1130-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubrahmanyam, Aryasomayajula10aIndium doped silver oxide thin films prepared by reactive electron beam evaporation technique: electrical properties  ap. 6041-6045.  aThe indium doped silver oxide thin films have been prepared at 275 °C on soda lime glass and silicon substrates by reactive electron beam evaporation technique; the deposition rate has been varied (by varying the electron beam current) in the range 0.94–16.88 nm/s keeping the oxygen flow rate constant. These films are polycrystalline. The electrical resistivity for these films decreases with increasing deposition rate. The AIO films prepared with a deposition rate of 5.7 nm/s show near p-type conductivity. The work function has been measured on these films by contact potential method using Kelvin Probe. The surface morphology of the films has been evaluated using atomic force microscopy (AFM).

Dilute sulfuric acid (SA)-catalyzed pretreatment fractionates the first biomass into cellulose and hemicellulose-derived xylose, and these are then converted separately to levulinic acid (LA) using 2-sec-butylphenol (SBP) and lignin-derived (LD) alkylphenol solvents, respectively. LA is upgraded catalytically to butene oligomers via γ-valerolactone (GVL) and butene intermediates. Separation subsystems are designed to recover the alkylphenol solvents and biomass-derived intermediates (LA and GVL) for combination with the catalytic conversion subsystems of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin. In addition, a heat exchanger network (HEN) design is presented to satisfy the energy requirements of the integrated process from combustion of biomass residues (degradation products). Finally, a technoeconomic analysis shows that the proposed process ($3.37/gallon of gasoline) is an economically competitive alternative to current biofuel production approaches.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiomass 3acellulose 3acombustion 3aenergy requirements 3afuel production 3agasoline 3aheat exchangers 3ahemicellulose 3alevulinic acid 3alignin 3alignocellulose 3asolvents 3asulfuric acid 3axylose 0aBiofuels 0aAlkylphenol solvents 0aLevulinic acid 0aProcess design 0aTechnoeconomic evaluation1 aHan, Jeehoon0 tBioresource technology.g2016 Mar., v. 204 p.1-8dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2015.12.0753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03038naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008900155300001800244500002000262520180100282592002802083650001402111650000902125650002502134650002202159650001502181650001702196650001202213650002402225650001302249650001302262650001502275650002202290650001302312651001102325651001802336700001702354700001802371773013202389856007402521852000902595655001202604IND60587551520221118235529.0180319e200712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058755152DNAL7 a10.1890/06-1509.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiha, Henna10aAmphibian occurrence is influenced by current and historic landscape characteristics  ap. 2298-2309.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aHuman‐induced habitat loss and degradation are major threats to wetland species as reflected in the fact that wetlands have declined by more than 50% in Europe and North America during the last century. Both current and historic land‐use patterns are likely to be significant determinants of wetland species' distributions; however their relative importance is often unknown. We studied the importance of local (study pond) and landscape (current and 18th‐century landscape) characteristics in explaining the occurrence and species richness of amphibians (Rana arvalis, Bufo bufo, and Triturus vulgaris) on the Swedish island of Gotland, where more than 40% of wetlands have been lost since the 18th century. Current local habitat characteristics were the strongest determinants of occurrence for all study species. Additionally, species occurrence was related to current and historic landscape characteristics, which generally explained equal amounts of the variation in species‐occurrence data. The proportions of both current and historic arable land were negative determinants of amphibian occurrence and species richness, indicating that agricultural land use may have an overall negative impact on amphibians, and that amphibians may occur less frequently in areas with a long agricultural history. Likewise, historic forest area was positively related to B. bufo occurrence and species richness, whereas current forests had no significant effects, suggesting that there may be a lag in the response of amphibians to agriculture‐mediated habitat loss. Our results suggest that historic land‐use patterns may influence current amphibian populations and that inclusion of historic land‐use information could be a valuable tool in future studies on amphibian–habitat relations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBufo bufo 3aRana 3aagricultural history 3aagricultural land 3aamphibians 3aarable soils 3aforests 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3aland use 3alandscapes 3aspecies diversity 3awetlands 3aEurope 3aNorth America1 aLuoto, Miska1 aMerilä, Juha0 tEcological applications.g2007 Dec., v. 17, no. 8 p.2298-2309dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1509.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02878naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003600135040001800171100001700189245011900206300002000325506007600345520099200421592002801413506003701441650001501478650000801493650002901501650002401530650001701554650001901571650002501590653001601615653001201631653001701643653001801660653002401678700001301702700001701715700001801732700002501750700002101775700002201796700001301818700001701831700001301848700002501861700002501886700002301911700001801934700002701952700002201979700002002001700001402021700002502035773010002060856008302160852000902243655001202252IND60589552620221207100801.0200523e20180222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058955262DNAL7 a294749222pmid7 aPMC59738422pmcid7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.02.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Zhaoming10aElectron Cryo-microscopy Structure of Ebola Virus Nucleoprotein Reveals a Mechanism for Nucleocapsid-like Assembly  ap. 966-978.e12.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aEbola virus nucleoprotein (eNP) assembles into higher-ordered structures that form the viral nucleocapsid (NC) and serve as the scaffold for viral RNA synthesis. However, molecular insights into the NC assembly process are lacking. Using a hybrid approach, we characterized the NC-like assembly of eNP, identified novel regulatory elements, and described how these elements impact function. We generated a three-dimensional structure of the eNP NC-like assembly at 5.8 Å using electron cryo-microscopy and identified a new regulatory role for eNP helices α22–α23. Biochemical, biophysical, and mutational analyses revealed that inter-eNP contacts within α22–α23 are critical for viral NC assembly and regulate viral RNA synthesis.

Three species native to the Neotropical region (Cochliomyia macellaria, Chloroprocta idioidea, Lucilia eximia) and 3 exotic species (Chrysomya albiceps, C. putoria and C. megacephala) are reported to occur simultaneously associated with pig carcasses in the semiarid region of Brazil. The invasive potential of Chrysomya species is likely to produce deleterious effects on native blow fly populations in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomya albiceps 3aCochliomyia macellaria 3aLucilia 3aecosystems 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced species 3ainvasive species 3apig carcasses 3apopulation 3asemiarid zones 3asurveys 3atropical forests 3atropics 3aBrazil 0aChrysomya albiceps 0aCochliomyia macellaria 0aforensic entomology 0acaatinga 0anecrophagous insects1 aSalgado, Roberta Luiza0 tFlorida entomologist.g2014 June, v. 97, no. 2 p.814-816dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1896/054.097.02673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012500171300001600296520096700312592002801279650002101307650001301328650001701341650001701358650001001375650001001385650001801395650002501413650001501438650001301453650002001466650001401486653002901500653002401529653001801553653001501571653001101586653003601597700001701633700001701650773011201667856008501779852000901864655001201873IND60610037720221116161119.0180824e20170110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061003772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jbiotec.2016.11.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Kyoung-Rok10aComplete genome sequence of Stenotrophomonas sp.

Stenotrophomonas sp. KACC 91585, which was isolated from lake sediment, is an efficient bacterium for unsaturated fatty acid hydration that produces 10-HSA and 10-HOD from oleic acid and linoleic acid, respectively, with high conversion rates. The complete genome of this strain is 4,541,729bp with 63.83% GC content and devoid of plasmids. Sets of genes involved in the fatty acid biosynthesis and modification as well as modified lipids were identified in the genome, and these genes were concerned with HFA production. This genome sequence provides molecular information and elucidation for HFA production, and will be used as an efficient biocatalyst source for the biotechnological production of HFA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStenotrophomonas 3abacteria 3abiocatalysts 3abiosynthesis 3agenes 3alakes 3alinoleic acid 3anucleotide sequences 3aoleic acid 3aplasmids 3aricinoleic acid 3asediments 0aComplete genome sequence 0aHydroxy fatty acids 0aLinoleic acid 0aOleic acid 0aPacbio 0aStenotrophomonas sp.

However, very recent advances in the processing of ultrafine-grained (UFG) metals have provided an opportunity to extend the understanding of flow behavior to include UFG materials with submicrometer grain sizes. In practice, processing through the application of severe plastic deformation (SPD), as in equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and high-pressure torsion (HPT), has permitted the fabrication of relatively large samples having UFG microstructures. Since the occurrence of superplastic flow generally requires a grain size smaller than ~10 μm, it is reasonable to anticipate that materials processed by SPD will exhibit superplastic ductilities when pulled in tension at elevated temperatures. This review examines recent results that demonstrate the occurrence of exceptional superplastic flow in a series of UFG aluminum and magnesium alloys after ECAP and HPT. The results are analyzed to evaluate the superplastic flow mechanism and to compare with materials processed using different techniques. The critical issue of microstructural inhomogeneity is examined in two-phase UFG materials after SPD processing and the influence of microstructural homogeneity on the superplastic properties is also demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalloys 3aaluminum 3amagnesium 3aplastic deformation 3apressing 3atemperature1 aLangdon, Terence G.0 tJournal of materials science.g2016 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.19-32dSpringer USx0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-015-9176-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009900172300001600271520123900287592002801526650002201554650001901576650001501595650001301610650000901623650002601632650001901658650003301677650001101710650002101721700002001742773010201762856008601864852000901950655001201959IND60578264820180713000000.0170812e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057826482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b025602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlattmann, Hannes10aMultifunctional POSS Cyclic Carbonates and Non-Isocyanate Polyhydroxyurethane Hybrid Materials  ap. 742-751.  aThe solvent-free chemical fixation of carbon dioxide with glycidyl ether functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) yields mono- and polydisperse multifunctional POSS cyclic carbonates. The silica equivalent content of POSS carbonates varies between 28.5 and 42.1 wt %, whereas 15.4–20.8 wt % carbon dioxide is incorporated. On cure with hexamethylenediamine and isophoronediamine, POSS carbonates and their blends with polyol-based cyclic carbonates produce organic/inorganic hybrid polyhydroxyurethane thermosets without requiring the need of isocyanate monomers. These blends prolong both gel and pot life time of NIPU formulations, thus allowing the preparation of tailored NIPU/POSS hybrid materials for casting and coating applications. Young’s modulus and tensile strength improve with increasing POSS content as a result of higher cross-link density and silica content. Submicron phases are formed during polymerization due to self-assembly and nanophase separation as was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Moreover, the incorporation of POSS significantly improves scratch resistance of optically transparent and colorless NIPU/POSS coatings as examined by the surface gloss and SEM images.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1,6-hexanediamine 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbonates 3acoatings 3agels 3amodulus of elasticity 3apolymerization 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilica 3atensile strength1 aMülhaupt, Rolf0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Feb. 09, v. 49, no. 3 p.742-751dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b025603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03965naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006000148245011700208300001600325520169800341592002802039650002002067650001502087650002502102650001102127650002202138650002202160650002202182650001502204650001102219650001502230650001702245650002102262650001502283650002402298651002602322700006102348700005602409700006202465700006402527700006402591700006102655700006102716700001802777700002202795700006302817700002202880700001702902700006402919700006102983700006203044700006003106773011703166856008303283852000903366655001203375IND60686284020221121085410.0200417e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068628402DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-020-00970-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarter, Sarah K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3778-861510aBridging the research-management gap: landscape science in practice on public lands in the western United States  ap. 545-560.  aCONTEXT: Landscape science relies on foundational concepts of landscape ecology and seeks to understand the physical, biological, and human components of ecosystems to support land management decision-making. Incorporating landscape science into land management decisions, however, remains challenging. Many lands in the western United States are federally owned and managed for multiple uses, including recreation, conservation, and energy development. OBJECTIVE: We argue for stronger integration of landscape science into the management of these public lands. METHODS: We open by outlining the relevance of landscape science for public land planning, management, and environmental effects analysis, including pertinent laws and policies. We identify challenges to integrating landscape science into public land management, including the multijurisdictional nature and complicated spatial pattern of public lands, the capacity of agencies to identify and fill landscape science needs, and perceptions about the meaning of landscape approaches to management. RESULTS: We provide several recent examples related to landscape monitoring, restoration, reclamation, and conservation in which landscape science products were developed specifically to support decision-making. CONCLUSIONS: We close by highlighting three actions—elevating the importance of science-management partnerships dedicated to coproducing actionable landscape science products, identifying where landscape science could foster efficiencies in the land-use planning process, and developing scenario-based landscape models for shrublands—that could improve landscape science support for public land planners and managers.  aPublisher supplied data 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3aland use planning 3alandscape ecology 3alandscapes 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apublic lands 3apublic ownership 3arecreation 3aresearch management 3aWestern United States1 aPilliod, David S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4207-35181 aHaby, Travis1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2204-99671 aPrentice, Karen L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7210-25221 aAldridge, Cameron L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3926-69411 aAnderson, Patrick J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2281-389X1 aBowen, Zachary H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8656-18311 aBradford, John B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9257-63031 aCushman, Sam,1 aDeVivo, Joseph C.1 aDuniway, Michael C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9643-27851 aHathaway, Ryan S.1 aNelson, Lisa1 aSchultz, Courtney A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9972-78021 aSchuster, Rudy M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2353-85001 aTrammell, E.

The characteristics of a biofilm that favor its use in monitoring include the relatively rapid development of biofilms and their capacity to sorb hydrophobic compounds. Some fecal sterols considered to be biomarkers for human and animal feces have relatively high octanol–water partitioning coefficients (log KOW); thus, sterols were expected to be readily sorbed in the biofilms. The biofilms were developed on glass plates (0.48 m²) previously coated with a fine layer of stearic acid and supported by a PVC tube that was submersed in the river 20 cm above the river bottom. After a certain period of incubation time, the biofilm growth was scraped from the plates and analyzed for the following fecal steroids: coprostanol (5β-cholestan-3β-ol), epicoprostanol (5β-cholestan-3α-ol), cholesterol (5,6-cholesten-3β-ol), cholestanol (5α-cholestan-3β-ol), stigmastanol (24β-ethyl-5α-cholestan-3β-ol) and coprostanone (5β-cholestan-3-one). Six samples were collected between March 2012 and June 2012. All analyzed compounds were detected, and in general, cholesterol was present in high amounts (23 160–41.9 ng g⁻¹ dry biofilm). Variation among campaigns was observed in the distribution of sterols, with cholestanol showing the least variation among the samples. Sterol ratios that are commonly used for evaluating sewage contamination were calculated; these ratios indicated some periods of potential sewage influence. However, these sterol ratios are intended to be applied primarily for sediments and not for biological compartments; thus, the results must be carefully interpreted. Biofilms developed under natural conditions can be a tool for monitoring some important sterols that are used as biomarkers of fecal pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiofilm 3abiomarkers 3acholesterol 3acoprostanol 3afeces 3aglass 3ahumans 3ahydrophobicity 3amonitoring 3apollution 3apoly(vinyl chloride) 3arivers 3asediments 3asewage 3astearic acid 3aBrazil1 aSánez, Juan0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 Oct. 23, v. 15, no. 11 p.2080-2086dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00025g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02005naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002300189245008800212300001800300506007600318520071900394592002801113506003701141650000801178650002701186650002701213650001201240650001301252650001101265650001501276650001201291650002201303650001401325650001401339650001701353700002201370773009901392856008301491852000901574655001201583IND60614393620221207091414.0181127e20180906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061439362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0272doi7 aPMC61364292pmcid7 a301931092pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBakhoum, Samuel F.14aThe Multifaceted Role of Chromosomal Instability in Cancer and Its Microenvironment  ap. 1347-1360.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of human cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. In addition to generating genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection, CIN promotes inflammatory signaling by introducing double-stranded DNA into the cytosol, engaging the cGAS-STING anti-viral pathway. These multipronged effects distinguish CIN as a central driver of tumor evolution and as a genomic source for the crosstalk between the tumor and its microenvironment, in the course of immune editing and evasion.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3achromosome aberrations 3achromosome segregation 3acytosol 3agenomics 3ahumans 3ametastasis 3amitosis 3anatural selection 3aneoplasms 3aprognosis 3atherapeutics1 aCantley, Lewis C.0 tCell.g2018 Sept. 06, v. 174, no. 6 p.1347-1360dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04025naa a2201021 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245004500163300002000208520115700228592002801385650001501413650001601428650002001444650002001464650002701484650001901511650002101530650001501551650001501566650001901581653003301600653003101633653003001664653001801694653003301712653002701745653002501772653002401797700002201821700002101843700002101864700001601885700001901901700001901920700001901939700001901958700002301977700002102000700001502021700002202036700002202058700001602080700001602096700001602112700002202128700001802150700002102168700001802189700001502207700001302222700002002235700002302255700002102278700002302299700001902322700001902341700001802360700002002378700002302398700002502421700001702446700001702463700002102480700001502501700002002516700002202536700002102558700001902579700001902598700002002617700002202637700001902659700002102678700001902699700002402718700001902742700002002761700001802781773010102799856008202900852000902982655001202991IND60614393720221121051755.0181002e20180920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061439372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNitta, Nao10aIntelligent Image-Activated Cell Sorting  ap. 266-276.e13.  aA fundamental challenge of biology is to understand the vast heterogeneity of cells, particularly how cellular composition, structure, and morphology are linked to cellular physiology. Unfortunately, conventional technologies are limited in uncovering these relations. We present a machine-intelligence technology based on a radically different architecture that realizes real-time image-based intelligent cell sorting at an unprecedented rate. This technology, which we refer to as intelligent image-activated cell sorting, integrates high-throughput cell microscopy, focusing, and sorting on a hybrid software-hardware data-management infrastructure, enabling real-time automated operation for data acquisition, data processing, decision-making, and actuation. We use it to demonstrate real-time sorting of microalgal and blood cells based on intracellular protein localization and cell-cell interaction from large heterogeneous populations for studying photosynthesis and atherothrombosis, respectively. The technology is highly versatile and expected to enable machine-based scientific discovery in biological, pharmaceutical, and medical sciences.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3ablood cells 3adata collection 3adecision making 3ainformation processing 3ainfrastructure 3amedical sciences 3amicroalgae 3amicroscopy 3aphotosynthesis 0aimage-activated cell sorting 0ahigh-throughput microscopy 0ahigh-throughput screening 0adeep learning 0aconvolutional neural network 0acellular heterogeneity 0amachine intelligence 0acellular morphology1 aSugimura, Takeaki1 aIsozaki, Akihiro1 aMikami, Hideharu1 aHiraki, Kei1 aSakuma, Shinya1 aIino, Takanori1 aArai, Fumihito1 aEndo, Taichiro1 aFujiwaki, Yasuhiro1 aFukuzawa, Hideya1 aHase, Misa1 aHayakawa, Takeshi1 aHiramatsu, Kotaro1 aHoshino, Yu1 aInaba, Mary1 aIto, Takuro1 aKarakawa, Hiroshi1 aKasai, Yusuke1 aKoizumi, Kenichi1 aLee, SangWook1 aLei, Cheng1 aLi, Ming1 aMaeno, Takanori1 aMatsusaka, Satoshi1 aMurakami, Daichi1 aNakagawa, Atsuhiro1 aOguchi, Yusuke1 aOikawa, Minoru1 aOta, Tadataka1 aShiba, Kiyotaka1 aShintaku, Hirofumi1 aShirasaki, Yoshitaka1 aSuga, Kanako1 aSuzuki, Yuta1 aSuzuki, Nobutake1 aTanaka, Yo1 aTezuka, Hiroshi1 aToyokawa, Chihana1 aYalikun, Yaxiaer1 aYamada, Makoto1 aYamagishi, Mai1 aYamano, Takashi1 aYasumoto, Atsushi1 aYatomi, Yutaka1 aYazawa, Masayuki1 aDi Carlo, Dino1 aHosokawa, Yoichiroh1 aUemura, Sotaro1 aOzeki, Yasuyuki1 aGoda, Keisuke0 tCell.g2018 Sept. 20, v. 175, no. 1 p.266-276.e13dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03228naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002900148245015900177300001400336500001500350520176400365592002802129650002502157650002202182650001002204650001802214650001802232650002102250650002802271650001902299650003002318650001402348650002502362650002002387650002102407650001702428650000902445650002702454651001102481653002402492700002402516700002502540773010002565856008402665852000902749655001202758IND4451706720221119040806.0141111e20110419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445170672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.10.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ada Silveira, Júlia A.G.10aDetection of Theileria and Babesia in brown brocket deer (Mazama gouazoubira) and marsh deer (Blastocerus dichotomus) in the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil  ap. 61-66.  a2019-12-06  aIntraerythrocytic protozoan species of the genera Theileria and Babesia are known to infect both wild and domestic animals, and both are transmitted by hard-ticks of the family Ixodidae. The prevalences of hemoprotozoa and ectoparasites in 15 free-living Mazama gouazoubira, two captive M. gouazoubira and four captive Blastocerus dichotomus from the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, have been determined through the examination of blood smears and the use of nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). The cervid population was inspected for the presence of ticks and any specimens encountered were identified alive under the stereomicroscope. Blood samples were collected from all 21 animals, following which blood smears were prepared, subjected to quick Romanowsky staining and examined under the optical microscope. DNA was extracted with the aid of commercial kits from cervid blood samples and from tick salivary glands. The nPCR assay comprised two amplification reactions: the first was conducted using primers specific for a 1700bp segment of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia and Theileria species, whilst the second employed primers designed to amplify a common 420bp Babesia 18S rRNA fragment identified by aligning sequences from Babesia spp. available at GenBank. The ticks Amblyomma cajennense, Rhipicephalus microplus and Dermacentor nitens were identified in various of the cervids examined. Of the animals investigated, 71.4% (15/21) were infected with hemoprotozoa, including Theileria cervi (47.6%), Theileria sp. (14.3%), Babesia bovis (4.8%) and Babesia bigemina (4.8%). However, only one of the infected wild cervids exhibited accentuated anaemia (PCV=17%). This is first report concerning the occurrence of Theileria spp. in Brazilian cervids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmblyomma cajennense 3adisease detection 3aticks 3aBabesia bovis 3aribosomal RNA 3aBabesia bigemina 3aRhipicephalus microplus 3ablood sampling 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aTheileria 3aprotozoal infections 3asalivary glands 3aAnocentor nitens 3awild animals 3adeer 3anew geographic records 3aBrazil 0aBoophilus microplus1 aRabelo, Élida M.L.1 aRibeiro, Múcio F.B.0 tVeterinary parasitology.g2011 Apr. 19, v. 177, no. 1-2 p.61-66dElsevier B.V.x0304-40177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2010.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03140naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005700140245008300197300001800280500001900298500002000317520166900337592002802006596005402034650003502088650001202123650001602135650001802151650002502169650002702194650001402221650001002235650001902245650001702264650001702281650002602298650001302324650002402337700001902361700002202380700002202402700002102424773014202445856007402587852000902661655001202670IND60719202520221122055646.0201128e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071920252DNAL7 a10.1111/jvim.159392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPringle, John1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4013-036310aMarkers of long term silent carriers of Streptococcus equi ssp. equi in horses  ap. 2751-2757.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Difficulty in detection of silent carriers of Streptococcus equi is a key reason for its continued spread to immunologically naïve groups of horses. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical examination, markers of inflammation, or serology differentiate silent carriers of S. equi in recovered comingled horses. ANIMALS: Ninety‐eight warmblood yearlings and 72 unaffected mares on a large breeding farm (outbreak A), 38 mature Icelandic horses at a riding stable (outbreak B), and 27 mixed breed horses at a boarding stable (outbreak C). METHODS: Prospective observational study 6 months to 2 years after strangles outbreaks. Carriers were defined as any animal positive on culture or qPCR to S. equi from nasopharyngeal lavage or guttural pouch endoscopy and lavage. Most horses had complete physical exams and 1 group included evaluation of white blood cell counts and serum amyloid A. Sera from all horses was tested for antibodies to antigens A and C of S. equi using an enhanced indirect ELISA. Descriptive statistics were calculated. Data were compared using paired t tests, Wilcoxon ranked test, chi square, or the Fishers exact test. Significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS: Apart from weanlings at 6 months in outbreak A, there was no significant association between any clinical markers or serology with carrier state (P = .06‐1). Moreover, 3/12 culture positive carriers were seronegative to S. equi. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Silent carriers of S. equi do not differ clinically or on markers of inflammation to their noncarrier herd‐mates. Moreover, serology alone will not distinguish carriers in comingled horses.  aPublisher supplied data  a221‐2013‐606cSvenska Forskningsrådet Formas 3aStreptococcus equi subsp. equi 3aamyloid 3ablood serum 3acarrier state 3aclinical examination 3adescriptive statistics 3aendoscopy 3afarms 3aguttural pouch 3ainflammation 3amixed breeds 3aobservational studies 3aserology 3aveterinary medicine1 aVenner, Monica1 aTscheschlok, Lisa1 aWaller, Andrew S.1 aRiihimäki, Miia0 tJournal of veterinary internal medicine.g2020 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.2751-2757dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl43440x0891-66407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jvim.159393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245014300211300001600354520193600370592002802306596005502334650002502389650002902414650002602443650001002469650001902479650002102498650002202519650002202541650002002563650001502583650001302598651001802611700001802629700002502647773011702672856008302789852000902872655001202881IND60686284320221121221051.0200417e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068628432DNAL7 a10.1007/s10980-020-00978-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrice, Edward P.

However, few studies have directly linked anthropogenic disturbance with patterns of BH. The US National Wetlands Condition Assessment (NWCA) provides an opportunity to investigate patterns of β-diversity related to anthropogenic disturbances. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to compare β-diversity between highly, intermediately and less-disturbed herbaceous emergent wetlands across the temperate region of the conterminous US, and to identify species with greatest influence on β-diversity patterns within disturbance categories. METHODS: Using species occurrence and abundance data, average distances to group centroids in ordination space were used to assess wetland β-diversity across a disturbance gradient. Species contributions to β-diversity were calculated per disturbance category. RESULTS: Compared to the least and intermediately disturbed wetlands, highly disturbed wetlands had significantly lower β-diversity based on species abundances across the study area. When using only species occurrences, highly disturbed wetlands had significantly lower β-diversity than intermediately disturbed wetlands. No significant differences were found amongst disturbance categories at the within-site scale. The invasive grass Phalaris arundinacea had the greatest influence on β-diversity, especially in the most disturbed wetlands. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic disturbances have homogenized regional botanical diversity. This homogenization is a function of disturbance intensity, which, after a threshold is crossed creates environmental conditions that lead to the local dominance of a single, widespread invader. This process is repeated across the region, scaling up to homogenize the flora of the entire region.  aPublisher supplied data  aFW-16201cIllinois Environmental Protection Agency 3aPhalaris arundinacea 3aanthropogenic activities 3aenvironmental factors 3aflora 3ahomogenization 3ainvasive species 3aplant communities 3aspecies abundance 3atemperate zones 3avegetation 3awetlands 3aUnited States1 aSpyreas, Greg1 aMatthews, Jeffrey W.0 tLandscape ecology.g2020 Mar., v. 35, no. 3 p.779-792dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870067x0921-29737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-020-00978-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02259naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001600149245012800165500001400293520110300307592002801410650001701438650001601455650001601471650002001487650002101507650002001528650001301548650000901561700001501570700002101585700001701606700002001623700001501643773013501658856008301793852000901876655001201885IND60715173820221119030256.0201026e20200930xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071517382DNAL7 a10.3390/agriculture101004452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao 10aIndexes of Radicle are Sensitive and Effective for Assessing Copper and Zinc Tolerance in Germinating Seeds of Suaeda salsa  aNAL-light  aEuhalophytes, such as Suaeda salsa, are ideal candidates to remediate heavy metal-polluted saline soils. However, the metal tolerance ability of dimorphic seeds and subsequent seedlings is largely unknown. This study investigated the tolerance of S. salsa seeds to different concentrations of Cu²⁺ (0–300 mM) and Zn²⁺ (0–300 mM) during germination and seedling growth stages. Results showed that dimorphic seeds of S. salsa had high metal tolerance during germination, and even germinated under 300 mM Cu and Zn treatments. However, seedling growth was more sensitive to metal solutions and radicle growth was almost completely inhibited by Cu at 10 mM, and by Zn at 50 mM. Germinating seeds and seedlings of S. salsa had a higher metal toxicity threshold of Zn than that of Cu. In all indexes, indexes of radicle were the most sensitive and effective indicator of metal tolerance. Seeds of S. salsa germinated successfully and seedlings survived under high Zn and Cu stress. The results suggest that S. salsa could be sown directly in heavy metal-contaminated soils for phytoremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSuaeda salsa 3aagriculture 3agermination 3ametal tolerance 3aphytoremediation 3aseedling growth 3atoxicity 3azinc1 aJiang, Li 1 aTanveer, Mohsin 1 aMa, Jinbiao 1 aZhao, Zhenyong 1 aWang, Lei 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Sept. 30, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101004453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245007400163300001600237520141000253592002801663650001101691650002401702650001301726650001101739700001701750700001601767700001901783773009901802856008101901852000901982655001201991IND60465698920221117042124.0151123e201601  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6046569892DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-015-9390-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, H. Y.10aStochastic factors controlling the failure of carbon/epoxy composites  ap. 311-333.  aThe intrinsic scatter in tensile properties of unidirectional (UD) carbon/epoxy composites is due to several factors, including variability in fibre strength and fibre volume fraction at the local microscopic level. A model included in a multiscale finite element process, previously developed to simulate fibre failure in composite laminates but having little variation in fibre strength and local fibre volume fraction, has been extended to cover the effects of such material variations. The present study investigates the effects of the variability in material properties which can occur in real UD composite materials subjected to monotonic increasing and sustained loadings. This latter case is one of the originalities of this study. In the interval of variation studied for the Weibull parameters of fibre strength and fibre volume fraction, the mean and standard deviation of the failure stress are never strongly affected. Concerning the time-to-failure, its mean and its standard deviation increase strongly if the mean of fibre volume fraction increases and if the standard deviation of the fibre strength decreases. The standard deviation of local fibre volume fraction was found to have only a secondary effect on failure stress and time-to-failure. Another original and important result concerns the scatter in the time-to-failure of composites due to the level of applied sustained loading.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acomposite materials 3aepoxides 3amodels1 aThionnet, A.1 aMouritz, A.1 aBunsell, A.

The abilities of spin-label EPR were demonstrated for Chol/POPC (cholesterol/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine) membranes, with a Chol/POPC mixing ratio that changed from 0 to 3. Using the saturation-recovery (SR) EPR approach with cholesterol analogue spin labels, ASL and CSL, and oxygen or NiEDDA relaxation agents, it was confirmed that the CBD was present in all membrane suspensions when the mixing ratio exceeded the cholesterol solubility threshold (CST). Conventional EPR spectra of ASL and CSL in the CBD were similar to those in the surrounding POPC bilayer (which is saturated with cholesterol), indicating that in both domains, cholesterol exists in the lipid-bilayer-like structures. The behavior of ASL and CSL (and, thus, the behavior of cholesterol molecules) in the CBD was compared with that in the surrounding POPC-cholesterol domain (PCD). In the CBD, ASL and CSL molecules are better ordered than in the surrounding PCD. This difference is small and can be compared to that induced in the surrounding domain by an ∼10°C decrease in temperature. Thus, cholesterol molecules are unexpectedly dynamic in the CBD, which should enhance their interaction with the surrounding domain. The polarity of the water/membrane interface of the CBD is significantly greater than that of the surrounding PCD, which significantly enhances penetration of the water-soluble relaxation agent, NiEDDA, into that region. Hydrophobicity measured in the centers of both domains is similar. The oxygen transport parameter (oxygen diffusion-concentration product) measured in the center of the CBD is about ten times smaller than that measured in the center of the surrounding domain. Thus, the CBD can form a significant barrier to oxygen transport. The results presented here point out similarities between the organization and dynamics of cholesterol molecules in the CBD and in the surrounding PCD, as well as significant differences between CBDs and cholesterol crystals.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acholesterol 3acrystals 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3ahydrophobicity 3amixing 3aoxygen 3asolubility 3atemperature1 aMainali, Laxman1 aWidomska, Justyna1 aSubczynski, Witold K.0 tChemistry and physics of lipids.g2011 Nov., v. 164, no. 8 p.819-829dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0009-30847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2011.08.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04220naa a2200853 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245010200171300001800273520147500291592002801766650002301794650002301817650005201840650001601892650002401908650002301932650001701955650004001972650002102012650001502033650001402048650002602062650001402088653001502102653001302117653001602130653001702146653002902163653002802192653002202220653001802242653000802260653000802268653001002276653001002286653001302296653000802309653001002317653000802327653000802335653001002343653000802353653001102361653001502372653000702387653000702394700003502401700002902436700002302465700005902488700002602547700002002573700001902593700001902612700001802631700002302649700002002672700007602692700002002768700001902788700003002807700002702837700002802864700002502892773034302917856008503260852000903345655001203354IND60743883520221120104437.0210820e20210826xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2021.06.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAparisi, Álvaro10aLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19  ap. 2619-2627.  aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the sole causative agent of coronavirus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19).We performed a retrospective single-center study of consecutively admitted patients between March 1st and May 15th, 2020, with a definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The primary end-point was to evaluate the association of lipid markers with 30-days all-cause mortality in COVID-19.A total of 654 patients were enrolled, with an estimated 30-day mortality of 22.8% (149 patients). Non-survivors had lower total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels during the entire course of the disease. Both showed a significant inverse correlation with inflammatory markers and a positive correlation with lymphocyte count. In a multivariate analysis, LDL-c ≤ 69 mg/dl (hazard ratio [HR] 1.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14–3.31), C-reactive protein >88 mg/dl (HR 2.44; 95% CI, 1.41–4.23) and lymphopenia <1000 (HR 2.68; 95% CI, 1.91–3.78) at admission were independently associated with 30-day mortality. This association was maintained 7 days after admission. Survivors presented with complete normalization of their lipid profiles on short-term follow-up.Hypolipidemia in SARS-CoV-2 infection may be secondary to an immune-inflammatory response, with complete recovery in survivors. Low LDL-c serum levels are independently associated with higher 30-day mortality in COVID-19 patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aC-reactive protein 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3ablood serum 3aconfidence interval 3aetiological agents 3ahazard ratio 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3alymphocyte count 3ametabolism 3amortality 3amultivariate analysis 3anutrition 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aCOVID-19 0aCoronavirus 0aInflammation 0aHigh-density lipoprotein 0aLow-density lipoprotein 0aTotal cholesterol 0aTriglycerides 0aALT 0aAST 0aAUROC 0aCoQ10 0aCOVID-19 0aCRP 0aHDL-c 0aIL6 0aLDH 0aLDL-c 0aPCT 0aRT-PCR 0aSARS-CoV-2 0aTC 0aTG1 aIglesias-Echeverría, Carolina1 aYbarra-Falcón, Cristina1 aCusácovich, Iván1 aUribarri, Aitor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6911-74801 aGarcía-Gómez, Mario1 aLadrón, Raquel1 aFuertes, Raúl1 aCandela, Jordi1 aTobar, Javier1 aHinojosa, Williams1 aDueñas, Carlos1 aGonzalez, Robertoc(illustrator)1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9802-92201 aNogales, Leonor1 aCalvo, Dolores1 aCarrasco-Moraleja, Manuel1 aSan Román, J.

The selective cleavage of BMAODS disulfide bonds was used to collect primary chains for the determination of the branching density (BD). The effects of initial monomer concentration, vinyl/divinyl ratio, and primary chain length on the branching and cyclization reactions were thoroughly investigated. It was found that more than 50% pendent double bonds from BMAODS were consumed in cyclization rather than in branching. The BD increased linearly with the conversion up to approximately 60% conversion. The monomer concentration was found to be the most efficient parameter in promoting branching. Increasing divinyl monomer ratio and primary chain length favored cyclization over branching. The work provides experimental evidence to support the random branching mechanism in RAFT copolymerization of vinyl and divinyl monomers.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopolymerization 3acyclization reactions 3adisulfide bonds1 aLi, Xiaohui1 aWang, Wen-Jun1 aLi, Bogeng,1 aZhu, Shiping0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Feb. 09, v. 49, no. 3 p.752-759dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b025963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02947naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129100001500147245013200162300001800294500000900312520152700321592002801848650002201876650001701898650002501915650001901940650002301959650002201982650001602004650001602020650002602036650001402062650001702076650002502093650002302118650002202141651001302163700001802176700001702194700001702211700001602228700001702244773012302261852000902384856008402393655001202477IND4398436020221120162908.0191228e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439843602DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2006.07.04922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrasad, B.10aPotential Use of Spectral Reflectance Indices as a Selection Tool for Grain Yield in Winter Wheat under Great Plains Conditions  ap. 1426-1440.  aepub  aSelection criteria that would facilitate increased genetic gain for grain yield would be considered advantageous in plant breeding programs. We evaluated the potential of spectral reflectance indices (SRI) for assessing grain yield variability in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes under Great Plains conditions. One experiment was conducted at two locations on the Oklahoma State University research farms for 1 yr, and two experiments were conducted for 2 yr at a single location. The first experiment included 25 winter wheat cultivars from the Great Plains, and the other two experiments contained two groups of 25 F₄:₆ and F₄:₇ recombinant inbred lines. Six reported SRI (red and green normalized difference vegetation index, RNDVI, GNDVI; simple ratio, SR; water index, WI; normalized water indices 1 and 2, NWI-1 and NWI-2), and two new normalized water indices (NWI-3 and NWI-4) were calculated at booting, heading, and early grain-filling stages using a FieldSpec UV/VNIR spectroradiometer. Significant genotypic variation was observed for SRI and growth stages, though the booting stage was least associated with grain yield. The relationships of grain yield with WI and NWI were stronger than with the RNDVI and SR. The WI and the NWI performed better in identifying superior genotypes, either at any individual growth stage or in a combination of growth stages. Our study clearly demonstrated the potential of using SRI as a selection tool for grain yield in a winter wheat breeding program.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aartificial selection 3aplant breeding 3aselection criteria 3aspectral analysis 3areflectance 3agrain yield 3afield experimentation 3acultivars 3ainbred lines 3adevelopmental stages 3atemporal variation 3agenetic variation 3aOklahoma1 aCarver, B.

Plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are known as one of the most important pests attacking various plants in conventional and organic farming systems. A survey was conducted in January 2019 to determine the occurrence and diversity of PPNs, their associations with soil properties, and to assess their management methods in organically farmed fields in Southern Morocco. Twelve genera of PPNs were identified in soil and root samples collected from 53 organic fields, including Meloidogyne, Pratylenchus, Helicotylenchus, Tylenchus, Tylenchorynchus, Criconemoides, Trichodorus, and Xiphinema. The root-knot nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.) and the root-lesion nematode (Pratylenchus spp.) were the most prevalent PPNs. Vegetable crops (bean, onion, and tomato) had high nematode diversity indices compared to some aromatic and medicinal crops, including the Shannon, Evenness, and plant parasitic index (PPI). Our study underlined that several PPN genera were significantly correlated with soil physico-chemical properties, in particular, soil structure and organic matter. Therefore, it was concluded that soil properties have a considerable impact on PPN communities in organic farming systems located in Southern Morocco. There are numerous strategies for the control of PPNs in organic farming systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCriconemoides 3aHelicotylenchus 3aMeloidogyne 3aPratylenchus 3aTrichodorus 3aTylenchus 3aXiphinema 3aagriculture 3abeans 3aonions 3aorganic matter 3aorganic production 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aroot-knot nematodes 3asoil structure 3asurveys 3atomatoes 3aMorocco1 aMokrini, Fouad 1 aAissami, Aicha  El1 aLaasli, Salah-Eddine 1 aImren, Mustafa 1 aÖzer, Göksel 1 aPaulitz, Timothy 1 aLahlali, Rachid 1 aDababat, Abdelfattah  A.0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Sept. 30, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101004473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01629naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245011900165300001600284520069200300592002800992650001901020650001801039650001601057650001501073700002101088700002001109773012701129856007401256852000901330655001201339IND60662090520221116230712.0190904e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066209052DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em00039g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Richard J.

Preventative interventions are warranted as risk of cardiovascular disease increases among women after menopause, and age alone is an independent risk factor for vascular dysfunction. Thus, this study evaluated the effects of 100% watermelon juice on measures of vascular function.In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 21 healthy postmenopausal women were randomized to consume two 360 mL servings of 100% watermelon juice per day or an isocaloric placebo for four weeks. Following a two-week washout period, they consumed the other beverage for an additional four weeks. Before and after each treatment arm, a fasting blood sample was taken for measurement of serum arginine, citrulline, lycopene, glucose, and insulin. Assessments of vascular function included pulse pressure, pulse wave velocity, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure, and flow-mediated dilation. General linear mixed models with intent-to-treat analyses were used to examine the effects of the intervention.Despite a significant treatment effect for circulating lycopene (p = 0.002), no changes in arginine, citrulline, or any vascular measures were observed. Although the juice intervention resulted in a slight but significant increase in fasting serum glucose (p = 0.001), changes in glucose homeostasis were not clinically significant.In contrast to findings from previous studies in younger adults and those with pre-existing hypertension, measures of vascular function in this cohort of healthy postmenopausal women were not impacted by supplemental watermelon juice.NCT03626168.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3abeverages 3ablood glucose 3ablood pressure 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acitrulline 3across-over studies 3aglucose 3ahomeostasis 3ahypertension 3ainsulin 3alycopene 3ametabolism 3anutrition 3aplacebos 3apostmenopause 3arandomized clinical trials 3arisk factors 3awatermelons 0aWatermelon juice1 aMehta, Tapan1 aNagabooshanam, Vinoth A.1 aDudenbostel, Tanja1 aLocher, Julie L.1 aCrowe-White, Kristi M.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2021 Sept. 22, v. 31, no. 10 p.2959-2968dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2021.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03230naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245016700169300001400336520196800350592002802318650002302346650001702369650001102386650001902397650002602416650001302442650001102455650002502466650001202491650002702503650001502530650001202545700001702557700002002574700001902594700002002613773009402633856008402727852000902811655001202820IND60113044320221120174632.0141111e20130118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011304432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.11.0792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMehling, Tanja10aCOSMO-RS for the prediction of the retention behavior in micellar liquid chromatography based on partition coefficients of non-dissociated and dissociated solutes  ap. 66-72.  aSeveral methods for the description of the retention behavior in micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) were described previously. Thereby, the most common are the linear solvation energy relationships (LSER). However, for the evaluation of the LSER, a number of experimental data are necessary. In this work, the retention data are predicted based on a single data point for a given solute/surfactant combination. The prediction of micelle/water partition coefficients with the COSMO-RS model was evaluated for the nonionic surfactant Brij 35 and the cationic CTAB for 21 solutes. The predicted partition coefficients along with the retention data of a single measurement were combined with a common retention model for the evaluation of partition coefficients. Thus, the description of the retention data based on a minimum of experimental data was realized in this work. The COSMO-RS model appears to be suitable for the flexible and qualitative prediction of the retention data, which is of special benefit, when a large number of solutes are studied. Furthermore, the introduced method is a promising alternative to describe the retention behavior of ionizable solutes, which is of great interest for e.g. pharmaceutical processes and analyses. To evaluate the method, lipophilicity profiles of several solutes were determined with MLC. While for the nonionic surfactant the lipophilicity is similar to the octanol/water system, a contrary phenomenon, namely a significant increase of the partition coefficient with progressive dissociation can be observed with the ionic surfactant. The MLC method proved to be an efficient method for the determination of micelle/water partition coefficients, excluding non-binding and “overbinding” solutes. The introduced COSMO-RS based approach for the estimation of the retention in MLC is especially promising for highly retarding solutes, since it is time and cost saving compared to the experimental determination.  aPublisher supplied data 3acost effectiveness 3adissociation 3aenergy 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquid chromatography 3amicelles 3amodels 3anonionic surfactants 3aoctanol 3apartition coefficients 3aprediction 3asolutes1 aKloss, Linda1 aMushardt, Heike1 aIngram, Thomas1 aSmirnova, Irina0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 1273 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.11.0793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03567naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245009900154300001600253520190300269592002802172650002202200650001302222650001302235650001602248650001202264650001602276650001102292650000902303650002002312650002202332650002602354650002102380650001702401650000902418650001502427650001202442650003402454650003502488650001502523650003302538650001402571650000902585650001902594650001802613650002502631650000902656651001002665700001402675700001502689700001802704700001902722700001402741773012702755856007402882852000902956655001202965IND60662090720221116230029.0190904e20130501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066209072DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em00043e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Ming10aHeavy metals and organic compounds contamination in soil from an e-waste region in South China  ap. 919-929.  aHeavy metals and persistent organic pollutants polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were analyzed in 34 surface soil samples collected from farmland and 7 soil or dust samples collected from the workshops in South China, where e-waste was dismantled using primitive techniques. The results show that Cd, Cu and Hg were the most abundant metals, in particular Cd pollution was serious in farmland soils, and the median concentrations in farmland soils were beyond the environmental quality standard for soils (China Grade II). A correlation between Cd, Cu, Zn, Pb and PCBs or PBDEs was significant indicating similar sources. Among the PCB congeners, high relative similarity was observed between the e-waste dump site soil (EW1) and Aroclor 1254, implying that the technical product Aroclor 1254 was one of the major sources of PCB contamination. High concentrations of PCBs in workshop dusts (D2 and D3) (1958 and 1675 μg kg⁻¹) demonstrated that the workshops dismantling electrical wires and cables, electrical motors, compressors and aluminum apparatus containing PCBs in lubricants represent strong PCB emission sources to this area. Principal component analysis (PCA) and PBDE homologue patterns verify that farmland soils surrounding the e-waste recycling sites were enriched with lower brominated congeners, and the major source of PBDEs in dust samples might potentially be associated with the extensive use of deca-mix technical products as a flame retardant. The difference between e-waste soils, dusts and farmland soils can be observed in the PCA score plot of PCBs and PBDEs, and E-waste soils and dusts exhibited more diversity than farmland soils. Furthermore, a prediction of the particular kinds of pollution from different recycling activities through the analysis of each contamination and the connections between them was investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aaluminum 3aaroclors 3abromination 3acadmium 3acompressors 3acopper 3adust 3aelectric motors 3aelectronic wastes 3aenvironmental quality 3aflame retardants 3aheavy metals 3alead 3alubricants 3amercury 3apersistent organic pollutants 3apolybrominated diphenyl ethers 3aprediction 3aprincipal component analysis 3arecycling 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3asoil sampling 3awaste disposal sites 3azinc 3aChina1 aHuang, Bo1 aBi, Xinhui1 aRen, Zhaofang1 aSheng, Guoying1 aFu, Jiamo0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 May 1, v. 15, no. 5 p.919-929dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00043e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02166naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015900168300001600327520108500343592002801428650001401456650001101470650002801481650002101509650001901530650001301549700001201562700001901574700002101593700001701614773010201631856008601733852000901819655001201828IND60578265520221121222404.0170812e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057826552DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.5b026782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Xiaosong10aDesign a Highly Reactive Trifunctional Core Molecule To Obtain Hyperbranched Polymers with over a Million Molecular Weight in One-Pot Click Polymerization  ap. 760-766.  aWe present the first one-pot one-batch synthesis of hyperbranched polymers with over a million molecular weight and low polydispersity in the copper-catalyzed alkyne–azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) polymerization of AB₂ monomer. In contrast to the traditional triazido core molecule that failed to produce high molecular weight polymer, a novel tris-triazoleamine-based B₃ molecule was designed, which complexed with Cuᴵ catalyst and activated the azido reactivity in both B₃ and B₃-containing polymers. The polymerization demonstrated linear increase of polymer molecular weights with the feed ratio of [AB₂]₀:[B₃]₀ with no need of slow monomer addition. At the same time, a higher ratio of [Cuᴵ]₀:[B₃]₀ showed no influence on molecular weight but significantly increased the polymerization rate and produced hyperbranched polymers with higher degree of branching. The one-pot polymerization using [AB₂]₀:[B₃]₀:[Cu]₀ = 2700:1:10 produced hyperbranched polymers with molecular weight Mₙ = 1.01 × 10⁶ and polydispersity Mw/Mₙ = 1.05 in 4 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acopper 3acycloaddition reactions 3amolecular weight 3apolymerization 3apolymers1 aShi, Yi1 aWang, Xiaofeng1 aGraff, Robert W.1 aGao, Haifeng0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Feb. 09, v. 49, no. 3 p.760-766dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.5b026783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012100161300001600282500001400298500002000312520160200332592002801934650001301962650002601975650002202001650001402023650001202037650002602049650002202075650001302097650001102110650001702121650001202138650001602150650001302166650001602179650002102195650002002216650001402236650001402250650001302264700002002277700003002297700006602327700003702393700001802430773013702448856007302585852000902658655001202667IND60719203120221121031451.0201128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071920312DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.124092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuffo, Alan Mario10aMulti‐trait stability index: A tool for simultaneous selection of soya bean genotypes in drought and saline stress  ap. 815-822.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDrought and salinity are the main limiting environmental factors that restrict the establishment of soya bean plants. In order to recommend genotypes for cultivation under adverse drought and saline stress conditions, multi‐environment trials (MET) are needed. However, MET analysis is usually performed considering a single trait, which provides lower reliability in recommending genotypes when compared to multi‐trait analysis. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the stability of multi‐trait stability index (MTSI) in 46 soya bean cultivars under the effects of drought and saline stress on seed germination and initial seedling growth. Drought and saline stresses were imposed by seed exposure to −0.20 MPa iso‐osmotic solutions with polyethylene glycol—PEG 6000 (119.6 g/L) or NaCl (2.36 g/L) for 12 days at 25°C. The germination rate, seedling length and seedling dry matter were measured. We showed here how genotypic stability can be quantified by MTSI when comparing drought and salinity conditions in relation to non‐stressful environment (control) and how this index can be employed under different conditions. When considering the index for multiple environments, we can select as the most stable genotypes TMG 716 RR, FPS Antares RR, AS 3610 IPRO, NS 7300 IPRO and FPS Solar IPRO among the 46 tested genotypes. Owing to high stability and gains with selection verified for these genotypes under salinity and drought conditions, they can be used as genitors in breeding programs aimed at obtaining offspring with higher resistance to antibiotic stresses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagronomy 3aantibiotic resistance 3abreeding programs 3acultivars 3adrought 3aenvironmental factors 3agenetic stability 3agenotype 3alength 3apolyethylene 3aprogeny 3areliability 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3asolutions 3asoybeans1 aSteiner, Fábio1 aAguilera, Jorge González1 aTeodoro, Paulo Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8236-542X1 aTeodoro, Larissa Pereira Ribeiro1 aBusch, Aécio0 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2020 Dec., v. 206, no. 6 p.815-822dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.124093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01497naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245016300164300001800327520038700345592002800732650001100760650002300771650002600794650001300820650001400833700001700847700001600864700001500880700001700895700001800912700001700930773010600947856008501053852000901138655001201147IND60579307220221119074305.0170816e20170707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057930722DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b013812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Hao10aPalladium-Promoted Neutral 1,4-Brook Rearrangement/Intramolecular Allylic Cyclization Cascade Reaction: A Strategy for the Construction of Vinyl Cyclobutanols  ap. 3478-3481.  aA cascade reaction to build vinyl cyclobutanol rings through activation of vinyl epoxides by palladium, followed by 1,4-Brook rearrangement and intramolecular cyclization with a palladium complex of the resulting carbon anion, is described.

Using Spectral Indices: Analysis by Random Forest  aNAL-light  aKnowing the total Nitrogen content (Nt) of forage maize (Zea mays) is important so that decisions can be made quickly and efficiently to adjust the timing and amount of both irrigation and fertilizer. In 2017 and 2018 during three growing cycles in two study plots, leaf samples were collected and the Dumas method was used to estimate Nt. During the same growing seasons and on the same sampling plots, a Parrot Sequoia camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect high resolution images of forage maize study plots. Thirteen multispectral indices were generated and, from these, a Random Forest (RF) algorithm was used to estimate Nt. RF is a machine-learning technique and is designed to work with extremely large datasets. Overall analysis showed five of the 13 indices as the most important. One of these five, the Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index/Optimized Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, was found to be the most important for estimation of Nt in forage maize (R² = 0.76). RF handled the complex dataset in a time-efficient manner and Nt did not differ significantly when compared between traditional methods of evaluating Nt at the canopy level and using UAVs and RF to estimate Nt in forage maize. This result is an opportunity to explore many new research options in precision farming and digital agriculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aZea mays 3aabsorption 3aagriculture 3aalgorithms 3aartificial intelligence 3acameras 3acanopy 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3adata collection 3afertilizers 3aforage 3airrigation 3aleaves 3areflectance 3atotal nitrogen 3aunmanned aerial vehicles 3avegetation index1 aEstrada Avalos, Juan,1 aRodríguez-Moreno, Víctor  M.1 aMauricio-Ruvalcaba, Jorge  E.1 aMartínez-Sifuentes, Aldo  R.1 aDelgado-Ramírez, Gerardo 1 aMiguel-Valle, Enrique 0 tAgriculture (Basel).g2020 Oct. 01, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:12387x2077-04727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture101004513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005700147245015400204300001600358520162200374592002801996650001202024650002802036650001402064650001502078650001202093650001602105650003002121650001502151650001702166650002202183650002102205650003002226650002602256650000902282650001502291650002102306650001702327650001502344650001302359650001002372700001902382700001902401773012802420856008102548852000902629655001202638IND60686285120221121150914.0200315e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068628512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12602-018-9506-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShukla, Geeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1212-221110aComparative Analysis of Antigiardial Potential of Heat Inactivated and Probiotic Protein of Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in Murine Giardiasis  ap. 271-279.  aThe present study was designed to envisage the antigiardial efficacy of killed probiotic and probiotic protein (PP) of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG in murine giardiasis. Experimentally, it was observed that animal administered either with probiotic protein emulsified with adjuvant (PP₍E₎ + Giardia) or killed probiotic (killed probiotic (i/p) + Giardia) had significantly reduced Giardia cycle with respect to observed severity and duration of giardiasis compared with Giardia-infected mice. Further, it was found that animals belonging to PP₍E₎ + Giardia and killed probiotic (i/p) + Giardia had significantly high levels of antigiardial IgA antibody and nitric oxide both in serum and in intestinal fluid compared with Giardia-infected and counter control mice. Histopathologyically, also animals belonging to PP₍E₎ + Giardia and killed probiotic (i/p) + Giardia animals had intact mucosal epithelium lining, basal crypts, and normal villi along with increased goblet cells compared with severe microvillus atrophy, vacuolated epithelial cells, and ileitis in Giardia-infected mice. This is the first-ever study to demonstrate that prior administration of either killed probiotics or probiotic protein of effective probiotic reduced both the severity and the duration of giardiasis mainly by modulating the gut microbiome and morphology along with mucosal immunity, but animals belonging to PP₍E₎ + Giardia had better response than killed probiotic (i/p) + Giardia suggesting that probiotic components do have adjuvant potential and may be used as the vaccine candidate for gastrointestinal diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGiardia 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aadjuvants 3aantibodies 3aatrophy 3ablood serum 3agastrointestinal diseases 3agiardiasis 3agoblet cells 3aheat inactivation 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aintestinal microorganisms 3aintestinal secretions 3amice 3amicrovilli 3amucosal immunity 3anitric oxide 3aprobiotics 3avaccines 3avilli1 aKamboj, Shweta1 aSharma, Bhawna0 tProbiotics and antimicrobial proteins.g2020 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.271-279dSpringer USwJournal:J000001286x1867-13067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12602-018-9506-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03763naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100001700158245010900175300001600284520135400300592002801654650002401682650002701706650001301733650003701746650001901783650001001802650002001812650003101832650001001863650001501873650001701888650001201905650000901917650002101926650001401947650002801961650003301989650002102022650002102043650003302064650003002097650003802127650003202165650001302197650004102210650001502251650006102266650003402327650002802361650001402389650003202403650005602435650004602491650003802537650003902575650003102614700002502645700002102670700001902691700003402710700002002744700002002764700002502784700002302809773009102832856007302923852000902996655001203005IND60082114020221118124202.0141016e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008211402DNAL7 a236389652pmid7 a10.1111/nph.122992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBen, Cécile10aMtQRRS1, an R‐locus required for Medicago truncatula quantitative resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum  ap. 758-772.  aRalstonia solanacearum is a major soilborne pathogen that attacks > 200 plant species, including major crops. To characterize MtQRRS1, a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance towards this bacterium in the model legume Medicago truncatula, genetic and functional approaches were combined. QTL analyses together with disease scoring of heterogeneous inbred families were used to define the locus. The candidate region was studied by physical mapping using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of the resistant line, and sequencing. In planta bacterial growth measurements, grafting experiments and gene expression analysis were performed to investigate the mechanisms by which this locus confers resistance to R. solanacearum. The MtQRRS1 locus was localized to the same position in two recombinant inbred line populations and was narrowed down to a 64 kb region. Comparison of parental line sequences revealed 15 candidate genes with sequence polymorphisms, but no evidence of differential gene expression upon infection. A role for the hypocotyl in resistance establishment was shown. These data indicate that the quantitative resistance to bacterial wilt conferred by MtQRRS1, which contains a cluster of seven R genes, is shared by different accessions and may act through intralocus interactions to promote resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMedicago truncatula 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3abacteria 3abacterial artificial chromosomes 3abacterial wilt 3acrops 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahypocotyls 3ainbred lines 3alegumes 3aloci 3amicrobial growth 3apathogens 3aquantitative trait loci 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCluster Analysis 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aDisease Resistancexgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Association Studies 2aGenotype 2aHypocotylximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aInbreeding 2aMedicago truncatulaxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Annotation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhenotype 2aPhysical Chromosome Mapping 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPolymorphism, Single Nucleotidexgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait Locixgenetics 2aRalstonia solanacearumxphysiology 2aReproducibility of Results1 aDebellé, Frédéric1 aBerges, Hélène1 aBellec, Arnaud1 aJardinaud, Marie‐Françoise1 aAnson, Philippe1 aHuguet, Thierry1 aGentzbittel, Laurent1 aVailleau, Fabienne0 tnew phytologist.g2013 Aug., v. 199, no. 3 p.758-772dAcademic Press.x0028-646X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.122993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02249naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245013000168300001800298500002000316520100500336592002801341650001801369650001301387650002901400700002301429700002101452700001701473700002101490700001901511700001801530700001701548700002401565700002101589700001701610700001901627773011601646856008001762852000901842655001201851IND60786877820221120091616.0220806e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078687782DNAL7 a10.1002/1873-3468.135062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Hideyuki10aZNF384‐fusion proteins have high affinity for the transcriptional coactivator EP300 and aberrant transcriptional activities  ap. 2151-2161.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aZinc‐finger protein 384 (ZNF384) fusion (Z‐fusion) genes have recently been identified as recurrent fusion genes in B‐cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (BCP‐ALL) and have been detected in 7–17% of Philadelphia chromosome‐negative BCP‐ALL cases. We selected SALL4 and ID2 as potential Z‐fusion‐specific transcriptional targets that might lead to the differentiation disorder of Z‐fusion‐positive ALL. The introduction of EP300‐ZNF384 and SYNRG‐ZNF384 induced the expression of these genes. Z‐fusion proteins exhibited stronger transcriptional activities on the promoter or enhancer region of these genes than Wild‐Z. Furthermore, GST pull‐down assay revealed that Z‐fusion proteins associated more strongly with EP300 than Wild‐Z. Coexpression of EP300 specifically enhanced the transcriptional activities of Z‐fusion proteins. We propose the increased EP300 binding of Z‐fusion proteins as a mechanism for their increased transcriptional activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aleukemia 3atranscription (genetics)1 aHayakawa, Fumihiko1 aYasuda, Takahiko1 aOdaira, Koya1 aMinamikawa, Yuka1 aTange, Naoyuki1 aHirano, Daiki1 aKojima, Yuki1 aMorishita, Takanobu1 aTsuzuki, Shinobu1 aNaoe, Tomoki1 aKiyoi, Hitoshi0 tFEBS letters.g2019 Aug., v. 593, no. 16 p.2151-2161dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl16404x0014-57937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/1873-3468.135063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03190naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002100189245010000210300002200310506007600332520098300408592002801391506003701419650001901456650002101475650001901496650001801515650002301533650001501556650001701571650000901588653002201597653001501619653001001634653001701644653001701661653001801678700002001696700001701716700002401733700001201757700001901769700002101788700002201809700001901831700002301850700002301873700001901896700002601915700002401941700002001965700002201985700001702007700001702024700002402041700002102065700002302086700002802109700001802137700001902155700002502174700002502199700002502224773010302249856008302352852000902435655001202444IND60614394620221207092728.0181127e20180906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061439462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2018.08.0422doi7 aPMC65017762pmcid7 a301931142pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyar, Kenneth A.10aAtlas of Circadian Metabolism Reveals System-wide Coordination and Communication between Clocks  ap. 1571-1585.e11.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMetabolic diseases are often characterized by circadian misalignment in different tissues, yet how altered coordination and communication among tissue clocks relate to specific pathogenic mechanisms remains largely unknown. Applying an integrated systems biology approach, we performed 24-hr metabolomics profiling of eight mouse tissues simultaneously. We present a temporal and spatial atlas of circadian metabolism in the context of systemic energy balance and under chronic nutrient stress (high-fat diet [HFD]). Comparative analysis reveals how the repertoires of tissue metabolism are linked and gated to specific temporal windows and how this highly specialized communication and coherence among tissue clocks is rewired by nutrient challenge. Overall, we illustrate how dynamic metabolic relationships can be reconstructed across time and space and how integration of circadian metabolomics data from multiple tissues can improve our understanding of health and disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanimal tissues 3acircadian rhythm 3aenergy balance 3ahigh fat diet 3ametabolic diseases 3ametabolism 3ametabolomics 3amice 0acircadian rhythms 0ametabolism 0aclock 0ametabolomics 0aCircadiOmics 0ahigh-fat diet1 aLutter, Dominik1 aArtati, Anna1 aCeglia, Nicholas J.1 aLiu, Yu1 aArmenta, Danny1 aJastroch, Martin1 aSchneider, Sandra1 ade Mateo, Sara1 aCervantes, Marlene1 aAbbondante, Serena1 aTognini, Paola1 aOrozco-Solis, Ricardo1 aKinouchi, Kenichiro1 aWang, Christina1 aSwerdloff, Ronald1 aNadeef, Seba1 aMasri, Selma1 aMagistretti, Pierre1 aOrlando, Valerio1 aBorrelli, Emiliana1 aUhlenhaut, N.

When using a capacitive sensor to measure the throughput of plant materials, an unexpected change in the measured material moisture content can result in significant error. This problem can be minimised by using a suitable electric field frequency. Thus, we studied the effect of various frequencies on capacitive throughput sensor behaviour.A novel laboratory capacitor was developed, and two sets of experiments using balsa blocks as plant material were performed. We confirmed that the dependence of sensor output voltage on the measured material moisture content could be described by S-shaped curves with two breakpoints between three sections. The first and third sections were characterised by a low influence of material moisture content on the capacitive throughput sensor output signal, whereas the moisture content had a larger influence in the second section. The shapes of the calculated curves were influenced by both the frequency of the electric field and the level of sensor filling. The sensor was less sensitive to moisture content changes when lower frequencies were employed and when the fill level was lower.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOchroma pyramidale 3adielectric properties 3aelectric field 3aelectric power 3aelectrical equipment 3awater content 0aCapacitive throughput measurement 0aElectric field frequency 0aDielectric properties1 aKřepčík, Václav1 aProšek, Václav,1 aKumhála, František0 tComputers and electronics in agriculture.g2017 Feb., v. 133 p.22-29dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38096x0168-16997nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2016.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03340naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001700157245011600174300001400290520167700304592002801981650001802009650001002027650001902037650001402056650002202070650002202092650002202114650001302136650002702149650003502176650002502211650001002236650001302246651001902259653001302278653002002291653002602311653001702337653001602354653003002370700002002400700002802420700002102448700002102469700002102490700001802511700003202529700002002561773010502581856009102686852000902777655001202786IND60727431120221120180112.0210211e20200313xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072743112DNAL7 a10.3897/natureconservation.38.494782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuliya, Mark14aThe first genetic assessment of wild and farmed ball pythons (Reptilia, Serpentes, Pythonidae) in southern Togo  ap. 37-59.  aThe ball python (Python regius) is the world’s most commonly traded python species for the “exotic” pet industry. The majority of these live snakes are produced via a number of python farms in West Africa that have been in operation since the 1960s and involved with “ranching” operations since the 1990s. However, to date no thorough taxonomic review or genetic studies have been conducted within its range, despite the fact that the evaluation of a species’ genetic variability is generally considered mandatory for effective management. We used mtDNA sequence data and eight polymorphic microsatellite markers to assess the underlying population genetic structure and to test the potential of the nuclear markers to assign farm individuals to wild reference populations in southern Togo. Despite the relatively large distances between sample locations, no significant genetic population structure was found, either in mtDNA sequence data or in the microsatellite data. Instead, our data indicate considerable gene flow among the locations. The absence of a distinct population subdivision may have resulted from an anthropogenic driven admixture of populations associated with commercial wildlife trade activity in recent decades. Given the ongoing largely unregulated nature of the commercial ranching of ball pythons in West Africa, should a wild release component continue, as a first measure we recommend that the Management Authorities should develop an action plan with specific release protocols for python farms to minimise any potential negative conservation impacts resulting from admixture (genetic pollution) between farmed and wild individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPython regius 3afarms 3afounder effect 3agene flow 3agenetic pollution 3agenetic structure 3agenetic variation 3aindustry 3amicrosatellite repeats 3anatural resources conservation 3apopulation structure 3atrade 3awildlife 3aWestern Africa 0aCOI gene 0amicrosatellites 0apopulation assignment 0aPythonregius 0aWest Africa 0awildlife trade management1 aHofmann, Sylvia1 aSegniagbeto, Gabriel H.1 aAssou, Délagnon1 aRonfot, Delphine1 aAstrin, Jonas J.1 aForat, Sophia1 aKetoh, Guillaume Koffivi K.1 aD’Cruze, Neil0 tNature conservation.g2020 Mar. 13, v. 38 p.37-59dPensoft PublisherswJournal:6152x1314-33017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3897/natureconservation.38.494783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245006500173300001600238520114000254592002801394650001301422650002201435650003801457650001301495650002601508650002301534650001201557650002101569650004401590650001701634650001801651650003401669650001901703700001401722700002301736700001701759773010201776856008601878852000901964655001201973IND60578265820221121222308.0170812e20160209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057826582DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.6b000052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZander, Zachary
K.10aIonomers for Tunable Softening of Thermoplastic Polyurethane  ap. 926-934.  aThermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) sulfonate ionomers with quaternary ammonium cations were synthesized to achieve soft TPUs without using conventional low molecular weight plasticizers. The sulfonated monomer N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES) neutralized with bulky ammonium counterions was incorporated as a chain extender to internally plasticize the TPU. Increasing the steric bulk of the counterion and the concentration of the ionic species produced softer TPUs with improved melt processability. The incorporation of the sulfonate species suppressed crystallinity of the TPU hard block, which was mainly responsible for the softening of the polymer. The synthetic procedure developed allows for facile tuning of the mechanical properties of the TPU by simply switching the counterion and/or increasing the feed ratio of ionic monomer. The precursors in this study were synthesized and analyzed via ¹H NMR, and the thermomechanical properties of the resulting TPU ionomers were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, Shore A hardness, and static mechanical testing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acrystal structure 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3ahardness 3amechanical properties 3amechanical testing 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aplasticizers 3apolyurethanes 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3athermoplastics1 aWang, Fei1 aBecker, Matthew L.1 aWeiss, R.

It was investigated for programmed temperature vapourizing (PTV) injection. Cleaning of the needle in automated injection is of modest efficiency, since the needle cannot be immersed deeply enough into the wash vial. Two approaches were studied to minimize the transfer into the column: (i) cleaning of the needle in the injector prior to splitless injection by inserting the needle in split mode while the precolumn is backflushed, which presupposes a high injector temperature to be efficient; (ii) injection under conditions minimizing thermal desorption from the needle wall, i.e. fast injection at low injector temperature (e.g. 40°C). Both approaches resulted in blank levels of around 0.1pg for diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and of around 1pg for di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). They could be useful tools in existing or future methods for the analysis of phthalates or other compounds causing blank problems through contamination of the laboratory air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aair 3acleaning 3adesorption 3adibutyl phthalate 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3atemperature1 aGrob, Konrad1 aMoret, Sabrina1 aConte, Lanfranco0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Jan. 18, v. 1273 p.105-110dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.11.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03663naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245013800208300001600346500001500362520176800377592002802145650002202173650001602195650002202211650002202233650003102255650001902286650001502305650001602320650002202336650002202358650002502380651002202405653002702427653001902454653002002473653001602493653002102509653001102530653002502541653001602566700001702582700001602599700002202615700001702637700002302654700002502677700002502702700002102727700002402748700003102772700002202803700002502825773010502850856008502955852000903040655001203049IND60561054620221123004744.0190318e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056105462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2017.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiou, Virginie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6549-385X10aBiodegradation of Emiliania huxleyi aggregates by a natural Mediterranean prokaryotic community under increasing hydrostatic pressure  ap. 271-281.  a2019-12-06  aIn the deep ocean, fluxes of particulate organic carbon (POC) and calcium carbonate are positively correlated, suggesting that CaCO3 could increase sinking particle densities and/or protect the organic matter from degradation by prokaryotes, the so called “ballast effect”. Here, we used the PArticle Sinking Simulator (PASS) system to investigate the effect of increasing pressure on the biodegradation of calcifying Emiliania huxleyi aggregates. Incubations were carried out over a period of 10days, simulating the changes in temperature and pressure in the water column of the NW Mediterranean Sea. Aggregates sinking from a depth of 200m to 1700m (assuming an average sinking velocity of 150md−1) were exposed to a natural mesopelagic prokaryotic community collected from 200m. In contrast to previous studies, where silicifying diatom aggregates were used, the calcifying E. huxleyi aggregates were found to be more sensitive to degradation with increasing hydrostatic pressure (relative to constant atmospheric pressure). This was confirmed by changes in lipid composition which suggested increased cell lysis. Changes in particulate inorganic carbon and total alkalinity indicated that CaCO3 dissolution might have been faster under pressure. Increased hydrostatic pressure also had a positive effect on particle aggregation, which may compensate for the effect of increased cell lysis. Our results imply that in coccolithophorid-dominated sinking aggregates, the ballasting and protection effects of coccoliths may collapse throughout the water column. The increased aggregation potential with pressure observed in these controlled conditions, may balance the loss of mineral ballast to a certain extent, although this needs to be confirmed in situ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aprokaryotic cells 3acorrelation 3aEmiliania huxleyi 3alipid composition 3aparticulate organic carbon 3abiodegradation 3aalkalinity 3atemperature 3acalcium carbonate 3aBacillariophyceae 3aatmospheric pressure 3aMediterranean Sea 0aBiological carbon pump 0aBiodegradation 0aMineral ballast 0aProkaryotes 0aCoccolithophorid 0acarbon 0aHydrostatic pressure 0aMesopelagic1 aPara, Julien1 aGarel, Marc1 aGuigue, Catherine1 aAl Ali, Badr1 aSantinelli, Chiara1 aLefèvre, Dominique,1 aGattuso, Jean-Pierre1 aGoutx, Madeleine1 aJacquet, Stéphanie1 aLe Moigne, Frédéric A.C.1 aTachikawa, Kazuyo1 aTamburini, Christian0 tProgress in oceanography.g2018 Apr., v. 163 p.271-281dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2017.01.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016200166300001600328520160100344592002801945650001101973650002501984650001702009650001502026650002402041650001402065650001602079650002002095650001802115650002102133650001502154650003102169650002302200650002202223700001702245700001802262700002102280700002102301773012802322856008102450852000902531655001202540IND60686285420221121231446.0200315e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068628542DNAL7 a10.1007/s12602-018-9500-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZamani, Behzad14aThe Effects of Supplementation with Probiotic on Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress in Adult Subjects: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Trials  ap. 102-111.  aPrevious studies have supposed that probiotic supplementation led to a positive effect on different health outcomes. Furthermore, several studies indicated that probiotics supplementation improved antioxidant status, while some studies did not indicate these effects. Hence, current systematic review and meta-analysis study was conducted to determine the effect of probiotic supplementation on some oxidative stress biomarkers among adult subjects. We searched four electronic databases PubMed, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library till November 2017. Clinical trials that compared the effects of probiotic supplementation with the control group were included. A random-effect model was used to pool weighted mean difference (WMD). Finding of 11 included studies (n = 577) indicated that probiotic supplementation increased total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (WMD 77.30 mmol/L; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.60, 152.01; I² = 88.3%) and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) (WMD − 0.31 μmol/L; 95% CI − 0.54, − 0.08; I² = 71.5%) significantly compared to the control group. However, its effects on glutathione (GSH) was not significant (WMD = 19.32 μmol/L; 95% CI − 18.70, 57.33; I² = 64.9%). The current meta-analysis revealed that probiotic supplementation may result in increasing TAC and lowering MDA, which improve antioxidant status. However, due to high heterogeneity, findings should be interpreted with caution. Further investigations are required to elucidate the effect of supplementation with probiotics on biomarkers of antioxidants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abiomarkers 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3aglutathione 3amalondialdehyde 3ameta-analysis 3aoxidative stress 3aprobiotics 3arandomized clinical trials 3astatistical models 3asystematic review1 aSheikhi, Ali1 aNamazi, Nazli1 aLarijani, Bagher1 aAzadbakht, Leila0 tProbiotics and antimicrobial proteins.g2020 Mar., v. 12, no. 1 p.102-111dSpringer USwJournal:J000001286x1867-13067nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12602-018-9500-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03643naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245012800153300001600281500001400297500002000311520179700331592002802128596005902156650001302215650001302228650002302241650002202264650000902286650001602295650001002311650001602321650002202337650001302359650001602372650001102388650001202399650001402411650001702425650001002442650001702452650001302469650001602482650001902498650001402517650001102531650001102542700001702553700001402570700001702584700001402601700001802615700001702633700001702650700002002667700002902687700005802716773013702774856007302911852000902984655001202993IND60719203420221122105419.0201128e202012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071920342DNAL7 a10.1111/jac.124372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hao10aMaize genotypes with deep root systems tolerate salt stress better than those with shallow root systems during early growth  ap. 711-721.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMaize (Zea mays L.) is susceptible to salinity but shows genotypic variation for salt tolerance. How maize genotypes with contrasting root morphological traits respond to salt stress remains unclear. This study assessed genotypic variation in salinity tolerance of 20 maize genotypes with contrasting root systems exposed to NaCl for 10 days (0, 50 mM or 100 mM NaCl, added in four increments every other day from 14 days after transplanting, DAT) in a semi‐hydroponic phenotyping system in a temperature‐controlled greenhouse. Considerable variation was observed for each of the 12 measured shoot and root traits among the 20 genotypes under NaCl treatments. Salt stress significantly decreased biomass production by up to 54% in shoots and 37% in roots compared with the non‐saline control. The 20 genotypes were classified as salt‐tolerant (8 genotypes), moderately tolerant (5) and salt‐sensitive (7) genotypes based on the mean shoot dry weight ratio (the ratio of shoot dry weight at 100 mM NaCl and non‐saline control) ± one standard error. The more salt‐tolerant genotypes (such as Jindan52) had less reductions in growth, and lower shoot Na⁺ contents and higher shoot K⁺/Na⁺ ratios under salt stress. The declared salt tolerance was positively correlated with shoot height, shoot dry weight and primary root depth, and negatively correlated with shoot Na⁺ content at 100 mM NaCl. Primary root depth is critical for identifying salt responsiveness in maize plants and could be suggested as a selection criterion for screening salt tolerance of maize during early growth. The selected salt‐tolerant genotypes have potentials for cultivation in saline soils and for developing high‐yielding salt‐tolerant maize hybrids in future breeding programmes.  aPublisher supplied data  a31471946cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aZea mays 3aagronomy 3abiomass production 3abreeding programs 3acorn 3acorrelation 3adepth 3aexhibitions 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agreenhouses 3aheight 3ahybrids 3aphenotype 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asaline soils 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3ascreening 3ashoots 3aweight1 aLiang, Liyan1 aLiu, Shuo1 aAn, Tingting1 aFang, Yan1 aXu, Bingcheng1 aZhang, Suiqi1 aDeng, Xiping1 aPalta, Jairo A.1 aSiddique, Kadambot H.

P.10aControlled Organocatalytic Ring-Opening Polymerization of ε-Thionocaprolactone  ap. 774-780.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFor the first time, the controlled ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of ε-thionocaprolactone (tnCL) is conducted. The organocatalytic ROP of tnCL occurs without carbonyl scrambling, leading to homopoly(ε-thionocaprolactone) (PtnCL). The ROP by base catalysts alone is proposed to proceed via a nucleophilic mechanism, while the addition of an H-bond donating thiourea (TU) is shown to provide excellent reaction control. The increased reaction control provided by the TU occurs in the virtual absence of binding between tnCL and TU, and a mechanistic account for this observation is discussed. The monomer ring strain is measured and found to be similar to δ-valerolactone (VL). Copolymers with VL are synthesized, and the resulting analysis of the copolymer materials properties provides the only known physical characterizations of poly(thio(no)ester-co-ester)s.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3apolymerization 3athiourea1 aKiesewetter, Matthew K.0 tMacromolecules.g2016 Feb. 09, v. 49, no. 3 p.774-780dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.macromol.6b001363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245010000167300001800267500001500285520207500300592002802375650001702403650001502420650001102435650001102446650001502457650001102472650002102483650001202504650001502516650001002531650002002541650001302561650001102574650001402585650002402599650001102623650002202634651001102656653001502667700002502682700001602707700002202723700002702745773008702772856004802859852000902907655001202916IND50069779220221121032748.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006977922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-013-9678-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeller, Ilka C.10aLatitudinal Patterns of Herbivory in Mangrove Forests: Consequences of Nutrient Over-Enrichment  ap. 1203-1215.  a2019-12-06  aEcosystems in the tropics are predicted to have stronger responses to nutrient enrichment, greater diversity, and more intense biotic interactions than in temperate areas. Mangrove forests, which occur across a broad biogeographic range from warm temperate to tropical, provide a unique opportunity to test these hypotheses by investigating the responses of herbivores to nutrient enrichment in temperate versus tropical latitudes. Mangroves are complex intertidal ecosystems with spatial differences in structure and diversity along tidal gradients and are threatened globally by human activities including nutrient over-enrichment. In this study, we used long-term fertilization experiments at the Indian River Lagoon, FL; Twin Cays, Belize; and Bocas del Toro, Panamá to determine how increased nutrients impact herbivore abundance and herbivory of Rhizophora mangle at the tree, forest, and regional scales. At these locations, which span approximately 2185 km and 18.4o of latitude, we fertilized individual trees with one of three treatments (Control, +N, +P) in two zones (fringe, scrub) along transects perpendicular to the shoreline and measured their responses for 4 years. Herbivory was measured as folivory, loss of yield, and tissue mining. Although nutrient enrichment altered plant growth, leaf traits, and nutrient dynamics, these variables had little effect on folivory at any location. Our results did not support the prediction that herbivory and per capita consumption are greatest at the most tropical location. Instead, folivory was highest at the most temperate location and lowest at the intermediate location. Folivory was generally higher in the fringe than in the scrub zone, but the pattern varied by location, herbivore, and nutrient treatment. Folivory by a dominant herbivore, Aratus pisonii, decreased from the highest to the lowest latitude. Our data suggest that factors controlling population dynamics of A. pisonii cascade to the mangrove canopy, linking herbivory to crab densities. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant growth 3aprediction 3acanopy 3arivers 3ashrublands 3ahumans 3amangrove forests 3atropics 3aherbivores 3atrees 3atemperate zones 3alatitude 3amining 3anutrients 3apopulation dynamics 3aleaves 3aRhizophora mangle 3aBelize 0aecosystems1 aChamberlain, Anne H.1 aPiou, Cyril1 aChapman, Samantha1 aLovelock, Catherine E.0 tEcosystems.g2013 Nov., v. 16, no. 7 p.1203-1215dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-013-9678-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02962naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245009700159300001800256520161900274592002801893650000801921650001801929650001901947650001401966650001101980650001501991650001302006650001602019650002102035650001602056650003702072650000902109650001302118650000902131650001902140650001002159650001802169650001302187650002002200651001002220700001902230700001802249773013002267856007402397852000902471655001202480IND60662091220221116230254.0190904e20130529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066209122DNAL7 a10.1039/c3em00070b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Ji-Zhong10aPAHs in the Chinese environment: levels, inventory mass, source and toxic potency assessment  ap. 1104-1112.  aThis paper presents a systematic but preliminary study on the levels, inventory mass, emission sources and risk of exposure to PAHs in China by examining 14 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (from the 16 priority PAHs listed by the U.S. EPA, excluding naphthalene and acenaphthylene) in four main environmental media (air, water, soil and sediment). The concentration of individual PAHs in the air, soil, freshwater, seawater, freshwater sediment and marine sediment of China was compared with the global concentration range (GCR) of PAHs from a large number of studies. The PAH levels were found at the high end of the GCR in the air, at the upper middle of the GCR in the water body, and at the middle of the GCR in the soil and sediment. These indicate that PAHs still are emitted heavily in China. About 530 000 tons of Σ₁₄PAH was estimated to be distributed into these four media in China. Soil possesses the highest proportion of the PAHs (60%), and the air has the lowest proportion (<0.5%). Therefore, the soil and sediment play an important role in the storage of PAHs. More than 10 thousand tons of PAHs are emitted from all kinds of sources. Firewood, straw, domestic and coking were considered as the main emissions of PAHs in the energy supply. A benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) based hazard quotient (HQ) was introduced to assess the potential toxic risk of exposure. The terrestrial water environment was found to have a high BaP exposure. The HQ value was more than 1 for 58% of freshwater and 39% of freshwater sediment samples. Urban and developed sites were considered to have high BaP exposure risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3aemissions 3aenergy 3afreshwater 3afuelwood 3ainventories 3amarine sediments 3anaphthalene 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3arisk 3aseawater 3asoil 3asoil pollution 3astraw 3asurface water 3atoxicity 3awater pollution 3aChina1 aZhu, Cheng-Zhu1 aChen, Tian-Hu0 tEnvironmental science.g2013 May 29, v. 15, no. 6 p.1104-1112dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3em00070b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01457naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245009300169300001800262520047300280592002800753650001600781650001200797650002300809650002300832650001100855650001200866650001400878700001800892700002100910773010600931856008501037852000901122655001201131IND60579307820221119074402.0170816e20170707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057930782DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b014022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMetz, Tanner

Here, the low temperature‐induced modifications of chloroplast ultrastructure and carbohydrate metabolism in wheat after four generations continuously grown under ambient CO₂ concentration (a[CO₂]) and e[CO₂] (2014–2018) were investigated. The results indicated that the transgenerational exposure to e[CO₂] increased the number of grana lamellae and the amounts of osmiophilic lipid droplets, attenuating the negative effect of low temperature on chloroplast ultrastructure. The transgenerational e[CO₂] enhanced the activities of antioxidant enzymes (i.e. SOD, POD and CAT) and concentrations of osmotic substances (i.e. proline and soluble sugar), which alleviated the low temperature‐induced oxidative damage to the chloroplast ultrastructure. In addition, transgenerational exposure of wheat to e[CO₂] increased activities of vacInv and cwInv, while decreased fructokinase activity, which affected the sucrose metabolism in wheat leaf. These findings elucidated that transgenerational exposure to e[CO₂] could improve low temperature tolerance of winter wheat, which provide novel insights to the response of wheat to future climate change.  aPublisher supplied data  a31701362cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31922064cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aC08Y194cCAS Pioneer Hundred Talents Program  a20190201118JCcScience & Technology Development Program of Jilin Province 3aagronomy 3acarbohydrate metabolism 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3acold stress 3adroplets 3aenzyme activity 3afructokinase 3agrana 3aleaves 3alipids 3aproline 3asucrose 3atemperature 3aultrastructure 3awinter wheat1 aLiu, Shengqun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6450-84311 aGuo, Junhong1 aLiu, Fulai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5006-89651 aSong, Fengbin1 aLi, Xiangnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0417-91510 tJournal of agronomy and crop science.g2020 Dec., v. 206, no. 6 p.773-783dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57791x0931-22507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.124433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03937naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245018600173520204000359592002802399650002402427650001102451650002202462650001702484650001702501650001602518650002302534650002702557650001602584650002202600650001702622650003202639653002102671653002202692653002402714653001002738653000902748653000802757653001202765653000902777653000902786653000902795653000802804653000902812653000902821653001102830653000802841700002002849700002102869700001902890700001902909700001602928700001602944700001802960700001702978700001902995700002503014700001703039700001803056773009503074856008503169852000903254655001203263IND60743884720221120115550.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074388472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1536382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBahuguna, Ashutosh10aInsights into cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition by isolated bioactive compounds 3-caffeoyl-4-dihydrocaffeoyl quinic acid and isorhamnetin 3-O-β-D-glucopyranoside from Salicornia herbacea  aCyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an important enzyme with numerous biological functions. Overexpression of COX-2 has been associated with various inflammatory-related diseases and therefore, projected as an important pharmacological target.We aimed to investigate the inhibitory potential of isolated bioactive compounds, 3-caffeoyl-4-dihydrocaffeoyl quinic acid (CDQ) and isorhamnetin 3-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (IDG), from Salicornia herbacea against COX-2 using both computational and in vitro approaches.Computational analysis, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and post-simulations analysis, were employed to estimate the binding affinity and stability of CDQ and IDG in the catalytic pocket of COX-2 against Celecoxib as positive control. These predictions were further evaluated using in vitro enzyme inhibition as well as gene expression mediation in macrophages cells.Molecular docking analysis revealed substantial binding energy of CDQ (-6.1 kcal/mol) and IDG (-5.9 kcal/mol) with COX-2, which are lower than Celecoxib (-8.1 kcal/mol). MD simulations (100 ns) and post simulation analysis exhibited the substantial stability and binding affinity of docked CDQ and IDG compounds with COX-2. In vitro assays indicated significant COX-2 inhibition by CDQ (IC₅₀ = 76.91 ± 2.33 μM) and IDG (IC₅₀ = 126.06 ± 9.44 μM). This result supported the inhibitory potential of isolated bioactive compounds against COX-2. Also, a cellular level study revealed a downregulation of COX-2 expression in tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages treated with CDQ and IDG.Computational and experimental analysis of CDQ and IDG from S. herbacea established their potential in the inhibition and mediation of COX-2. Hence, CDQ and IDG can be considered for therapeutic development against COX-2 linked disorders, such as inflammation and cancer. Furthermore, CDQ and IDG structures can be served as a lead compound for the development of advanced novel anti-inflammatory drugs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalicornia europaea 3aenergy 3aenzyme inhibition 3ainflammation 3aisorhamnetin 3amacrophages 3amolecular dynamics 3aprostaglandin synthase 3aquinic acid 3asimulation models 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aCyclooxygenase-2 0aMolecular docking 0aSalicornia herbacea 0aCOX-2 0aDCCM 0aDFT 0aGROMACS 0aHOMO 0aLUMO 0aMPLC 0aPCA 0aRMSD 0aRMSF 0aTNF-α 0aVLC1 aBharadwaj, Shiv1 aBajpai, Vivek K.1 aShukla, Shruti1 aWŏn, Tong-uk,1 aPark, InWha1 aNa, MinKyun1 aSonwal, Sonam1 aHuh, Yun Suk1 aHan, Young-Kyu1 aSimal-Gandara, Jesus1 aXiao, Jianbo1 aKim, Myunghee0 tPhytomedicine.g2021 Sept., v. 90 p.153638-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:12402x0944-71137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2021.1536383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02868naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245013000166300001600296520130200312592002801614650001801642650002501660650003401685650002701719650003401746650002101780650002201801650002201823650001101845650002001856650001801876650001001894650001101904650001701915650001301932650001201945650002401957650001801981650001901999650004302018650002502061650001202086650001302098700002502111700003102136773009302167856008102260852000902341655001202350IND60518359120221118223544.0160623e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051835912DNAL7 a10.1007/s12033-016-9935-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKharazmi, Sara10aCotton Leaf Curl Multan Betasatellite DNA as a Tool to Deliver and Express the Human B-Cell Lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) Gene in Plants  ap. 362-372.  aThe betasatellite DNA associated with Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMB) contains a single complementary-sense ORF, βC1, which is a pathogenicity determinant. CLCuMB was able to replicate in plants in the presence of diverse helper geminiviruses, including Tomato leaf curl virus-Australia (TLCV-Au), Iranian isolate of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV-[Ab]), and Beet curly top virus (BCTV-Svr), and can be used as a plant gene delivery vector. To test the hypothesis that CLCuMB has the potential to act as an animal gene delivery vector, a specific insertion construct was produced by the introduction of a human B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) cDNA into a mutant DNA of CLCuMB in which the βC1 was deleted (β∆C1). The recombinant βΔC1-Bcl-2 construct was successfully replicated in tomato and tobacco plants in the presence of TLCV-Au, BCTV-Svr and TYLCV-[Ab]. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses of plants containing the replicative forms of recombinant βΔC1-Bcl-2 DNA showed that Bcl-2 gene was expressed in an acceptable level in these plants, indicating that β∆C1 can be used as a tool to deliver and express animal genes in plants. This CLCuMB-based system, having its own promoter activity, offers the possibility of production of animal recombinant proteins in plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aBeet curly top virus 3aCotton leaf curl Multan virus 3aTomato leaf curl virus 3aTomato yellow leaf curl virus 3aWestern blotting 3aanimal production 3acomplementary DNA 3acotton 3agene expression 3agene transfer 3agenes 3ahumans 3aleaf curling 3alymphoma 3amutants 3aopen reading frames 3apathogenicity 3aplant proteins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arecombinant proteins 3atobacco 3atomatoes1 aAtaie Kachoie, Elham1 aBehjatnia, Seyed Ali Akbar0 tMolecular biotechnology.g2016 May, v. 58, no. 5 p.362-372dSpringer USx1073-60857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-016-9935-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02825naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002400137245010200161300001600263500002000279520149400299592002801793650002401821650002201845650001701867650001801884650002001902650001501922650002501937650001401962650002101976650001401997650001402011650002202025650001802047650001102065650001402076650001702090650001302107651001802120700001802138773013002156856007202286852000902358655001202367IND60587548720221118235951.0180319e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058754872DNAL7 a10.1890/06-00702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNewbold, Stephen C.10aEcological effects of density‐independent mortality: application to cooling‐water withdrawals  ap. 390-406.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA wide variety of environmental stresses can cause density‐independent mortality in species populations. One example is cooling‐water withdrawals, which kill or injure many aquatic organisms near power plants and other industrial facilities. In the United States alone, hundreds of facilities withdraw trillions of gallons from inland and coastal waters every year to cool turbines and other manufacturing equipment. A number of detailed, site‐specific studies of the effects of such cooling‐water withdrawals have been conducted over the last 30 years, but only a few generalizations have been proposed in the peer‐reviewed literature. In this paper we use a series of basic theoretical models to investigate the potential effects of density‐independent mortality on species populations and ecosystems, with particular focus on the effects of cooling‐water withdrawals on fish populations, fisheries, and aquatic communities. Among other results, we show that the effects of cooling‐water withdrawals on a species will depend on the magnitude of other co‐occurring stressors, environmental variability, the nature of the management regime in the associated fisheries, and the position of the species in the food web. The general models in this paper can provide a starting point for further empirical case studies and some preliminary conceptual guidance for decision makers who must choose between alternative policy options for controlling cooling‐water withdrawals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic communities 3aaquatic organisms 3acase studies 3acoastal water 3adecision making 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental impact 3aequipment 3afish communities 3afisheries 3afood webs 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3amodels 3amortality 3apower plants 3aturbines 3aUnited States1 aIovanna, Rich0 tEcological applications.g2007 Mar., v. 17, no. 2 p.390-406dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-00703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03300naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245014000163300001600303520149200319592002801811650000801839650002701847650001701874650001801891650001601909650001401925650001701939650001501956650001001971650002201981650001102003650002202014650001502036650001102051650001102062650001902073650001502092650001702107650001902124650002102143650004002164653001602204653002302220653001602243653002802259653001502287700001402302700002002316700001802336700001802354700001902372700001502391700001402406700001602420773014602436856008302582852000902665655001202674IND60585310220221119122430.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058531022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.1362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Xiaomu10aAntibiotic bedaquiline effectively targets growth, survival and tumor angiogenesis of lung cancer through suppressing energy metabolism  ap. 267-272.  aTumor angiogenesis plays essential roles during lung cancer progression and metastasis. Therapeutic agent that targets both tumor cell and vascular endothelial cell may achieve additional anti-tumor efficacy. We demonstrate that bedaquiline, a FDA-approved antibiotic drug, effectively targets lung cancer cells and angiogenesis. Bedaquiline dose-dependently inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of a panel of lung cancer cell lines regardless of subtypes and molecular heterogeneity. Bedaquiline also inhibits capillary network formation of human lung tumor associated-endothelial cell (HLT-EC) on Matrigel and its multiple functions, such as spreading, proliferation and apoptosis, even in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We further demonstrate that bedaquiline acts on lung cancer cells and HLT-EC via inhibiting mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, leading to ATP reduction and oxidative stress. Consistently, oxidative damage on DNA, protein and lipid were detected in cells exposed to bedaquiline. Importantly, the results obtained in in vitro cell culture are reproducible in in vivo xenograft lung cancer mouse model, confirming that bedaquiline suppresses lug tumor growth and angiogenesis, and increases oxidative stress. Our findings demonstrating that energy depletion is effectively against lung tumor cells and angiogenesis. Our work also provide pre-clinical evidence to repurpose antibiotic bedaquiline for lung cancer treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aangiogenesis 3aanimal models 3aantibiotics 3aapoptosis 3acell culture 3acell lines 3adrugs 3aendothelial cells 3aenergy 3aenergy metabolism 3aglycolysis 3ahumans 3alipids 3alung neoplasms 3ametastasis 3amitochondria 3aneoplasm cells 3aoxidative stress 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aBedaquiline 0aTumor angiogenesis 0aLung cancer 0aMitochondrial functions 0aGlycolysis1 aLi, Fajiu1 aWang, Xiaojiang1 aLi, Chenghong1 aMeng, Qinghua1 aWang, Chuanhai1 aHuang, Jie1 aChen, Shi1 aZhu, Ziyang0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2018 Jan. 01, v. 495, no. 1 p.267-272dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.1363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03358naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245011600178520206000294592002802354650005302382650001502435650002402450650002802474650001402502650001202516650001602528650001002544650001502554650001702569653001502586653002502601653002602626653003302652653001602685700001702701700001302718700001402731773009202745856009002837852000902927655001202936IND60776770520221121045516.0220830e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077677052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1348342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAimuzi, Ruxianguli10aExposure to phthalates, phenols, and parabens mixture and alterations in sex steroid hormones among adolescents  aExposure to phthalates (PAEs), phenols, and parabens has been linked with sex hormone imbalance; however, previous studies were predominantly limited to adults and failed to examine the combined effects of these chemicals mixture among adolescents. Thus, we used the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013–2016) to explore the associations of urinary PAEs, phenols, and parabens biomarkers with sex hormones among participants aged 12–19 years old (n = 613). Latent class analysis (LCA) and quantile-based g-computation (QGC) were applied to assess the associations of the latent exposure profiles and chemicals mixture with sex hormone indicators, including steroid hormones and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), in adolescents and by sex. Using LCA, four latent classes were identified among all participants. Compared with the class characterized by "Low exposure", the class represented by "High PAEs" [mono (2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (MECPP), mono (2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate (MEHHP), and monobenzyl phthalate (MBZP)] had lower level of estradiol (E₂) [β = −0.249, 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.419, −0.08], free androgen index (FAI) (β = −0.258, 95%CI: −0.512, −0.005) and free testosterone (FT) (β = −0.248, 95%CI: −0.496, −0.001) among male adolescents. These results were echoed by the results in QGC analyses, where PAEs mixture was negatively associated with E₂ (β = −0.137, 95% CI: −0.263, −0.011), FAI (β = −0.198, 95%CI: −0.387, −0.008) and FT (β = −0.189, 95%CI: −0.375, −0.002) among male adolescents. By contrast, the associations of the identified latent classes or chemicals mixture with sex hormone indicators were generally nonsignificant among female counterparts, except for a positive association between PAEs mixture and SHBG (β = 0.121, 95%CI: 0.012, 0.23). Our study demonstrated that exposure to PAEs, particularly MECPP, MEHHP, and MBZP, would be a threat to the sex hormone homeostasis of male adolescents.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3abiomarkers 3aconfidence interval 3across-sectional studies 3aestradiol 3afemales 3ahomeostasis 3amales 3aphthalates 3atestosterone 0aPhthalates 0aSex steroid hormones 0aLatent class analysis 0aQuantile-based g-computation 0aAdolescents1 aWang, Yuqing1 aLuo, Kai1 aJiang, Yu0 tChemosphere.g2022 Sept., v. 302 p.134834-dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.1348343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle06189naa a2200925 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002900147245019100176520349400367592002803861650002303889650002803912650002503940650002303965650001703988650001404005650002104019650001904040650001904059650001304078650001204091650001804103650002004121650001704141650001804158650001104176650001504187650001304202650001804215650003304233650002004266650001404286650000904300650001004309650001304319650002504332650001004357650002304367653002304390653003804413653001404451653001504465653003004480653002604510653000804536653004804544653000804592653000704600653001004607653001004617653001104627653001104638653001004649653000804659653001104667653000804678653000804686653001004694653001004704653000704714653001104721653000804732653000804740653000704748653000904755700003104764700006704795700002804862700002404890700006504914700006504979773011605044856008205160852000905242655001205251IND60792411220221121024925.0220921e20221205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079241122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2022.1156922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira, Ana Bárbara D.10aDefinition of chemical markers for Hancornia speciosa Gomes by chemometric analysis based on the chemical composition of extracts, their vasorelaxant effect and α-glucosidase inhibition  aHancornia speciosa Gomes (Apocynaceae) is a tree found in the Brazilian savannah, traditionally used to treat several diseases, including diabetes and hypertension. The anti-hypertensive activity of H. speciosa leaves (HSL) has been demonstrated in different models and is credited to the vasodilator effect and ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibition. The hypoglycemic effect of HSL has been also reported. To establish correlations between the biological activities elicited by H. speciosa extracts and the contents of their major compounds, aiming to define chemical markers related to the potential antihypertensive and antidiabetic effects of the species. Additionally, it aimed to isolate and characterize the chemical structure of a marker related to the α-glucosidase inhibitory effect. Extracts of a single batch of H. speciosa leaves were prepared by extraction with distinct solvents (ethanol/water in different proportions; methanol/ethyl acetate), employing percolation or static maceration as extraction techniques, at different time intervals. The contents of chlorogenic acid, rutin and FlavHS (a tri-O-glycoside of quercetin) were quantified by a developed and validated HPLC-PDA method. Bornesitol was determined by HPLC-PDA after derivatization with tosyl chloride, whereas total flavonoids were measured spectrophotometrically. Identification of other constituents in the extracts was performed by UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis. The vasorelaxant activity was assayed in rat aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine, and α-glucosidase inhibition was tested in vitro. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to evaluate the contribution of each marker to the biological responses. Isolation of compound 1 was carried out by column chromatography and structure characterization was accomplished by NMR and UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analyses. The contents of the chemical markers (mean ± s.d. % w/w) varied significantly among the extracts, including total flavonoids (2.68 ± 0.14 to 5.28 ± 0.29), bornesitol (5.11 ± 0.26 to 7.75 ± 0.78), rutin (1.46 ± 0.06 to 1.97 ± 0.02), FlavHS (0.72 ± 0.05 to 0.94 ± 0.14) and chlorogenic acid (0.67 ± 0.09 to 0.91 ± 0.02). All extracts elicited vasorelaxant effect (pIC₅₀ between 4.97 ± 0.22 to 6.48 ± 0.10) and α-glucosidase inhibition (pIC₅₀ between 3.49 ± 0.21 to 4.03 ± 0.10). PCA disclosed positive correlations between the vasorelaxant effect and the contents of chlorogenic acid, rutin, total flavonoids, and FlavHS, whereas a negative correlation was found with bornesitol concentration. No significant correlation between α-glucosidase inhibition and the contents of the above-mentioned compounds was found. On the other hand, PCA carried out with the areas of the ten major peaks from the chromatograms disclosed positive correlations between a peak ascribed to co-eluted triterpenes and α-glucosidase inhibition. A triterpene was isolated and identified as 3-O-β-(3′-R-hydroxy)-hexadecanoil-lupeol. According to PCA results, the vasorelaxant activity of H. speciosa extracts is related to flavonoids and chlorogenic acid, whereas the α-glucosidase inhibition is associated with lipophilic compounds, including esters of lupeol like 3-O-β-(3′-R-hydroxy)-hexadecanoil-lupeol, described for the first time for the species. These compounds can be selected as chemical markers for the quality control of H. speciosa plant drug and derived extracts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHancornia speciosa 3aantihypertensive effect 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3achemometrics 3achlorides 3achlorogenic acid 3achromatography 3aderivatization 3adiabetes 3aethanol 3aethyl acetate 3aglycemic effect 3ahypertension 3alipophilicity 3alupeol 3amaceration 3amethanol 3aphenylephrine 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3aquercetin 3arats 3arutin 3asavannas 3atraditional medicine 3atrees 3avasodilator agents 0aHancornia speciosa 0aQuantitative chemical composition 0aCyclitols 0aFlavonoids 0aα-glucosidase inhibition 0aVasorelaxant activity 0aPCA 0a3-O-β-(3′-R-hydroxy)-hexadecanoil-lupeol 0aACE 0aCE 0aCEBIO 0aEE-EC 0aEE-E50 0aEE-E70 0aEE-PP 0aESI 0aFlavHS 0aHMP 0aHSL 0aME-24 0aME-72 0aMS 0aNF-κB 0aPCA 0aPDA 0aRM 0aUPLC1 aGomes, José Hugo de Sousa1 aPereira, Aline Carvalho1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5373-06001 aPádua, Rodrigo Maia de1 aCôrtes, Steyner F.1 aSena, Marcelo Martins1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5693-90151 aBraga, Fernão Castro1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9468-376X0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2022 Dec. 05, v. 299 p.115692-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl30651x0378-87417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2022.1156923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245007800200300001600278500001900294500002000313520162600333592002801959596004501987596009302032596009702125596003502222650001602257650001502273650001702288650001502305650001102320650000902331650002102340650002302361651001902384651001502403651002002418700006202438700005402500700006202554773012002616856007402736852000902810655001202819IND60739507220221120221655.0210530e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073950722DNAL7 a10.1111/cobi.136162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZizka, Alexander1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1680-919210aAutomated conservation assessment of the orchid family with deep learning  ap. 897-908.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInternational Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List assessments are essential for prioritizing conservation needs but are resource intensive and therefore available only for a fraction of global species richness. Automated conservation assessments based on digitally available geographic occurrence records can be a rapid alternative, but it is unclear how reliable these assessments are. We conducted automated conservation assessments for 13,910 species (47.3% of the known species in the family) of the diverse and globally distributed orchid family (Orchidaceae), for which most species (13,049) were previously unassessed by IUCN. We used a novel method based on a deep neural network (IUC‐NN). We identified 4,342 orchid species (31.2% of the evaluated species) as possibly threatened with extinction (equivalent to IUCN categories critically endangered [CR], endangered [EN], or vulnerable [VU]) and Madagascar, East Africa, Southeast Asia, and several oceanic islands as priority areas for orchid conservation. Orchidaceae provided a model with which to test the sensitivity of automated assessment methods to problems with data availability, data quality, and geographic sampling bias. The IUC‐NN identified possibly threatened species with an accuracy of 84.3%, with significantly lower geographic evaluation bias relative to the IUCN Red List and was robust even when data availability was low and there were geographic errors in the input data. Overall, our results demonstrate that automated assessments have an important role to play in identifying species at the greatest risk of extinction.  aPublisher supplied data  aFZT 118cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft  aFN‐1749cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  aPCEFP3_187012cSchweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung  a2019‐04739cVetenskapsrådet 3aOrchidaceae 3aautomation 3adata quality 3aextinction 3amodels 3arisk 3aspecies richness 3athreatened species 3aEastern Africa 3aMadagascar 3aSouth East Asia1 aSilvestro, Daniele1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0100-09611 aVitt, Pati1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3727-91781 aKnight, Tiffany M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0318-15670 tConservation biology.g2021 June, v. 35, no. 3 p.897-908dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl42603x0888-88927nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cobi.136163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03693naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002200137245009000159300001600249500002000265520232600285592002802611650001202639650001802651650001602669650002902685650002302714650002202737650002602759650001702785650002302802650001502825650001002840650001402850650000902864650001202873650002802885650002602913700002302939700002702962700003502989773013003024856007203154852000903226655001203235IND60587548820221119000521.0180319e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058754882DNAL7 a10.1890/06-03962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKashian, Donna R.14aThe cost of tolerance: sensitivity of stream benthic communities to uv‐b and metals  ap. 365-375.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe ability to tolerate disturbance is a defense strategy that minimizes the effects of damage to fitness and is essential for sustainability of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Despite the apparent benefits of tolerance, there may be an associated cost that results in a deficiency of a system to respond to additional disturbances. Aquatic ecosystems are often exposed to a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances, and the effects of these compound perturbations are not well known. In this investigation, we examine whether tolerance to one stressor, metals, results in a cost of increased sensitivity to an additional stressor, ultraviolet‐B (UV‐B) radiation. Heavy metal pollution is recognized as a major environmental problem in Rocky Mountain streams. These high‐elevation, typically clear streams may be at particular risk to elevated UV‐B levels associated with reduced levels of ozone. Microcosm experiments were conducted using natural stream benthic communities collected from a reference site and a site with a long‐term history of heavy‐metal pollution. Direct and interactive effects of heavy metals and UV‐B radiation on structural and functional characteristics of benthic communities were evaluated among four treatments: control, UV‐B, metals, and metal and UV‐B. Communities from the metal‐polluted site were more tolerant of metals but less tolerant to UV‐B compared to reference communities. Increased mayfly drift and reduced metabolism in response to metal exposure were observed in reference communities but not in the metal‐polluted communities. In contrast to these results, UV‐B radiation significantly reduced community metabolism, total macroinvertebrate abundance, and abundances of mayflies, caddisflies, and dipterans from the metal‐polluted site, but had no effects on benthic communities from the reference site. ANOSIM results demonstrated that community responses differed among treatments at both sites. Metals had the largest impact on community differences at both sites, while UV‐B had greater impacts at the metal‐polluted site. This research demonstrates the need to account for potential costs associated with tolerance and that these costs can result in behavioral, structural, and functional impacts to benthic communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDiptera 3aEphemeroptera 3aTrichoptera 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abenthic organisms 3afunctional properties 3aheavy metals 3amacroinvertebrates 3ametabolism 3aozone 3apollution 3arisk 3astreams 3asustainable development 3aultraviolet radiation1 aZuellig, Robert E.1 aMitchell, Katharine A.1 aClements, W.

Construction industry is also contributing to the problem by emitting greenhouse gases. In order to deal with this issue sustainable products are being adopted by all the industries. Similarly, highway industry is also adopting several measures to reduce its carbon footprint. One of such measures is cold mix asphalt technology (CMA). CMA does not require any heating of material. This is achieved by using asphalt emulsion and cutback as binding material. Since these materials are liquid at room temperature, they do not require any heating for mixing and compaction. This gives many environmental and economic benefits to CMA over hot mix asphalt (HMA). Despite having these advantages, inferior performance makes CMA undesirable to be used in the construction of roads having high density traffic. Although some studies have been taken to improve the performance of CMA but those are limited in their scope. Present paper gives an overview of the different aspects of CMA technology. It discusses materials, design procedure, field utilisation, performance, effect of different performance enhancing measures of CMA. In the end benefits, drawbacks and future scope of CMA are also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3abitumen 3acarbon footprint 3acold 3aconstruction industry 3aemulsions 3afinancial economics 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aheat 3aliquids 3amixing 3aroads 3atraffic 0aCold mix asphalt (CMA) 0aEmulsion 0aCutback1 aSingh, Bhupendra0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 280 p.124378-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1243783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03109naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245011000154300001800264520176900282592002802051650001602079650002302095650001602118650001102134650001902145650001402164650001102178650001402189650001702203650001902220700001302239700001702252700001802269700001802287700001802305700001402323700001302337700001502350700001502365700001802380700002402398773013402422856007402556852000902630655001202639IND60773953320221119052013.0220420e20220419xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077395332DNAL7 a10.1039/d0cs01487g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Jing10aAdditive-mediated intercalation and surface modification of MXenes [Erratum: April 2022, v.51(8); p.3314]  ap. 2972-2990.  a2D carbides and nitrides of transition metals, also known as MXenes, are an emerging class of 2D nanomaterials that have shown excellent performances and broad application prospects in the fields of energy storage, catalysis, sensing, electromagnetic shielding, electronics and photonics, and life sciences. This unusual diversity of applications is due to their superior hydrophilicity and conductivity, high carrier concentration, ultra-high volumetric capacitance, rich surface chemistry, and large specific surface area. However, it is difficult to make MXenes with the desired surface functional groups that deliver high reactivity and high stability, because most MXenes are extracted from ceramics (MAX phase) by an etching process, where a large number of metal atoms are inevitably exposed on the surface, with other anions and cations embedded uncontrollably. The exposed metal atoms and implanted ions are thermodynamically unstable and readily react with trace oxygen or oxygen-containing groups to form the corresponding metal oxides or degrade chemically, resulting in a sharp decline in activity and loss of excellent physicochemical properties. The addition of certain synergistic additives during the intercalation and chemical modification of surface functional groups under non-hazardous conditions can result in stable and efficient MXene-based materials with exceptional optical, electrical, and magnetic properties. This review discusses several such methods, mainly additive-mediated intercalation and chemical modification of the surface functional groups of MXene-based materials, followed by their potential applications. Finally, perspectives are given to discuss the future challenges and promising opportunities of this exciting field.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3acatalytic activity 3aelectronics 3aenergy 3ahydrophilicity 3amagnetism 3aoxygen 3aphotonics 3asurface area 3athermodynamics1 aWu, Jing1 aWang, Yizhou1 aDeng, Fengxia1 aJiang, Jizhou1 aZhang, Yizhou1 aLiu, Song1 aLi, Neng1 aZhang, Han1 aYu, Jiaguo1 aZhai, Tianyou1 aAlshareef, Husam N.0 tChemical Society reviews.g2022 Apr. 19, v. 51, no. 8 p.2972-2990dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0cs01487g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02881naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245009900166520150600265592002801771650001301799650001401812650001901826650002201845650002301867650002401890650001201914650001701926650001401943650002301957653002101980653002302001653001802024653002202042653002802064700001702092700001302109700001402122700001402136700002102150700001502171700001702186773011302203856008602316852000902402655001202411IND60714054920221120070410.0210820e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071405492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1243792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Jiake10aCyclones of different sizes and underflow leakage for aerosol particles separation enhancement  aAerosol particle (especially PM₂.₅ and PM₁₀) is one of the most serious environmental pollution worldwide and is urging the development of separation technology. Cyclonic centrifugation devoted to the separation of suspension systems whose component have a significant density difference, however, it has been difficult to separate the fine particles whose size are of several microns or sub-micron. Therefore, a series of cyclones of different sizes (cylinder diameter D of 25 mm, 75 mm, 100 mm, 150 mm and 200 mm) and different vortex finder depth (0.5D, 0.6D, 0.7D, 0.8D, 0.9D) were designed to separate aerosol fine particles. The result showed that the cyclone whose diameter was 75 mm and vortex finder depth was 0.7D was most efficient and energy saving. The efficiency of HLG75 cyclone reached 95% at a flow rate of 35.5 m³/h and kept above 80% within the range of 24–68 m³/h. When the cyclones were tested under underflow leakage condition, HLG75 cyclone also acquired a most significant improvement, from 95% to 98%, at a split factor of 11.2%. Based on the research above, an improvement to the gas-liquid cyclonic separation unit was put forward, that is, inducing the gas at the under-flow exit to maintain the stable gas-leaking condition of each cyclone in avoidance to the inhaling of separated liquid. The results can provide guidance for the design of cyclones and may serve better in the powder and chemical industry process concerning aerosol particles removal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abreathing 3acentrifugation 3achemical industry 3acyclone separators 3aenergy conservation 3aliquids 3aparticulates 3apollution 3asuspension systems 0aGas purification 0aCyclone separation 0aFine particle 0aUnderflow leakage 0aStructural optimization1 aShen, Qisong1 aCui, Xin1 aWu, Jiwei1 aMa, Liang1 aTian, Chengcheng1 aFu, Pengbo1 aWang, Hualin0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 280 p.124379-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1243793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03603naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006500140245009000205300001600295500002000311506002800331520212300359592002802482596002602510596005502536506003702591650001702628650001702645650001502662650001502677650002002692650001302712650002202725650001402747650002402761650000902785700005702794700005702851700005802908773011902966856007503085852000903160655001203169IND60750460720221207073616.0220826e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075046072DNAL7 a10.1002/ppp3.101782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlaux, Pierre‐Louis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2518-791110aCan common mycorrhizal fungal networks be managed to enhance ecosystem functionality?  ap. 433-444.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aResource is Open Access  aMycorrhizal fungi are key components of soil biodiversity that offer potential to provide sustainable solutions for land management, notably in agriculture and forestry. Several studies conducted in controlled environments show that key functional attributes of common mycorrhizal networks (CMNs), which inter‐link different plants, are influenced by management practices. Here, we highlight the need to consider how land management affects the ubiquity and function of CMNs in nature to maximize the role of mycorrhizal fungi in enhancing ecosystem services. We emphasize that CMNs can sometimes negatively affect aspects of plant performance, but there remain major gaps in understanding before explicit consideration of CMN management can be delivered. SUMMARY: Most mycorrhizal fungi have the capacity to develop extensive extraradical mycelium, and thus have the potential to connect multiple plants and form a ‘common mycorrhizal network’. Several studies have shown that these networks can influence plant establishment, nutrition, productivity and defense, nutrient distribution and storage, and multitrophic interactions. However, many of these studies have focused on the importance of common mycorrhizal networks in ecological contexts and there has been less emphasis in managed systems, including croplands, grassland, agroforestry and forestry, on which humankind relies. Here we review the evidence of the potential importance of common mycorrhizal networks in managed systems, and provide insight into how these networks could be managed effectively to maximize the functions and outputs from managed systems. We also emphasize possible negative effects of common mycorrhizal networks on plant performance and question popular views that mycorrhizal networks may offer a panacea for enhancing ecosystem services. We highlight the need to gain greater insight into the ubiquity, functioning, and response to management interventions of common mycorrhizal networks and, critically, the need to determine the extent to which these networks can add value to the promotion of mycorrhizal colonization.  aPublisher supplied data  cN8 AgriFood programme  aNE/P001823/1cNatural Environment Research Council0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagroforestry 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3agrasslands 3aland management 3amycelium 3amycorrhizal fungi 3anutrition 3aplant establishment 3asoil1 aZhang, Yaqian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7172-45031 aGilbert, Lucy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9139-84501 aJohnson, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2299-25250 tPlants, people, planet.g2021 Sept., v. 3, no. 5 p.433-444dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27661x2572-26117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ppp3.101783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02282naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100006000155245010800215300001400323520092600337592002801263650002101291650002301312650002301335650002201358650002101380650001101401650001901412650002001431650002401451651001701475653002201492653001601514653001201530653001401542653001201556653001101568700005101579700002201630773009701652856009001749852000901839655001201848IND60532347420221122060359.0190318e20151001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053234742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.08.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aByron, Carrie J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3820-739213aAn Integrated ecological–economic modeling framework for the sustainable management of oyster farming  ap. 15-22.  aSustainable resource management requires improved understanding of complex ecological processes and the socioeconomic drivers shaping human–environment interactions.

To demonstrate utility of this integrated model, it was applied to coastal shellfish aquaculture production in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island, US, a coastal ecological–economic system that provides important ecosystem services and contributes to the regional economy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic systems 3aeconomic valuation 3aecosystem services 3amarine ecosystems 3amarine resources 3amodels 3aoyster culture 3apolicy analysis 3aresource management 3aRhode Island 0aCarrying capacity 0aAquaculture 0aBivalve 0aShellfish 0aEcopath 0aIMPLAN1 aJin, Di1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6403-79831 aDalton, Tracey M.0 tAquaculture.g2015 Oct. 01, v. 447 p.15-22dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.08.0303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03422naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004200113040001800155100002300173245007800196300001600274520194500290592002802235650001202263650001102275650002402286650002502310650001402335650001402349650002402363650000902387650002302396650001102419650001002430650001202440650002102452650002302473650004502496650001102541650000902552650002602561650001202587650004802599651001302647651001302660700002102673700001702694700001602711773010102727856005502828852000902883655001202892IND50074399720221120072540.0140401e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007439972DNAL7 a229432862pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02025.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHamede, Rodrigo K.10aBiting injuries and transmission of Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease  ap. 182-190.  aThe Tasmanian devil is threatened with extinction by devil facial tumour disease (DFTD), a unique infectious cancer in which the tumour cells themselves, which derive from a single long‐dead host devil, are the infective agent and the tumour is an infectious parasitic cell line. Transmission is thought to occur via direct inoculation of tumour cells when susceptible and infected individuals bite each other or by fomitic transfer of tumour cells. The nature of transmission and the extent to which biting behaviour and devil ecology is associated with infection risk remains unclear. Until our recent study in north‐west Tasmania showed reduced population and individual impacts, DFTD had caused massive population declines in all populations monitored. In this paper, we investigate seasonal patterns of injuries resulting from bites between individuals, DFTD infection status and tumour location in two populations to determine whether the number of bites predicts the acquisition of DFTD and to explore the possibility that the reduced impacts of DFTD in north‐west Tasmania are attributed to reduced bite rates. Devils with fewer bites were more likely to develop DFTD and primary tumours occurred predominantly inside the oral cavity. These results are not consistent with transmission occurring from the biter to the bitten animal but suggest that dominant individuals delivering bites, possibly by biting the tumours of other devils, are at higher risk of acquiring infection than submissive individuals receiving bites. Bite rates, which were higher during autumn and winter, did not differ between sites, suggesting that the reduced population impacts in north‐west Tasmania cannot be explained by lower bite rates. Our study emphasizes the importance of longitudinal studies of individually marked animals for understanding the ecology and transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and parasites in wild populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimals 3aautumn 3ainfectious diseases 3alongitudinal studies 3aneoplasms 3aparasites 3apopulation dynamics 3arisk 3aseasonal variation 3awinter 2aAging 2aAnimals 2aBites and Stings 2aEndangered Species 2aFacial Neoplasmsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMarsupialiaxinjuries 2aSeasons 2aWounds and Injuriesxpathologyxveterinary. 3aTasmania 0aTasmania1 aMcCallum, Hamish1 aJones, Menna1 aBoots, Mike0 tjournal of animal ecology.g2013 Jan., v. 82, no. 1 p.182-190dUniversity Pressx0021-87907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02025.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02727naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013800169520139100307592002801698650001301726650000801739650001201747650001701759650001301776650001501789650001301804650001601817650001701833650001001850650001901860650001501879650001301894650001501907653001501922653001201937653002401949653001001973653001301983700001701996700001802013700001802031773011302049856008602162852000902248655001202257IND60714055020221120132019.0210219e20210120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071405502DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1243802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Xiao-xia10aImpact of biochar addition on three-dimensional structural changes in aggregates associated with humus during swine manure composting  aAerobic composting is widely used to recycle agricultural organic waste. From a micro perspective, the dynamic changes in the internal structure of compost aggregates during composting can reflect aeration conditions, which is worthy of further study to improve composting efficiency. This study set three composting treatments (swine manure: rice straw = 4:1 and 8:1, swine manure: rice straw: biochar = 8:1:1, wet mass ratio), to detect 3-D microstructures of compost aggregate with the involvement of humus and biochar during composting. The results showed that biochar addition to compost enhanced humic acid formation and humification degree, and it greatly decreased bulk density by 45.89% and increased free air space by 31.25% compared with the initial stage of the compost. Compost materials tended to become looser during composting, and biochar aided an increase in total porosity of compost aggregates by approximately 90% compared with other treatments, mainly attributed to decomposition effects. It is assumed that large aggregates break up with the assistance of biochar, and these small parts of the materials gradually stick together with the formation of humus colloids to develop final dense particles. Therefore, it can be concluded that when biochar is used as an additive, it can improve the physical structure with the involvement of humus during composting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3abiochar 3abulk density 3acolloids 3acomposting 3acomposts 3ahumic acids 3ahumification 3ahumus 3amicrostructure 3apig manure 3aporosity 3arice straw 0aComposting 0aBiochar 0aAggregate structure 0aHumus 0aSR-μ CT1 aWu, Shu-biao1 aWang, Xi-qing1 aLiu, Hong-tao0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2021 Jan. 20, v. 280 p.124380-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.1243803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01725naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245010200159300001800261520055500279592002800834650000800862650003600870650001900906650001200925650000700937650001400944700001800958700002200976700002300998700002001021700002001041700002101061700002001082700001901102773013401121856007501255852000901330655001201339IND60775188820221118012945.0220422e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077518882DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc00836j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnet, Hugues10aAssessment of presumed small-molecule ligands of telomeric i-DNA by biolayer interferometry (BLI)  ap. 5116-5119.  aBiolayer interferometry (BLI) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy were used to investigate the interaction between previously reported i-motif DNA (i-DNA) ligands and folded or unfolded i-DNA in acidic (pH 5.5) and near-neutral (pH 6.5) conditions.

This procedure, called the K-bicarbonate method here, provided precise estimates of lime requirement that were 9.6% to 27.2% (average=12.9%) greater than those obtained by the method currently recommended for use on pond soils. It is likely that the K-bicarbonate method neutralizes more of the exchangeable acidity in pond bottom soil samples than does the current method recommended for pond bottom soils and thereby provides a more reliable estimate of lime requirement. Moreover, the K-bicarbonate method does not require a hazardous chemical, a mechanical shaker, or a pH meter as does the current method for pond lime requirement. The cost per analysis also is cheaper by the K-bicarbonate method than with the method currently recommended for pond soils.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacidity 3aalkalinity 3abicarbonates 3acalcium carbonate 3alime requirement 3aneutralization 3apH 3aponds 3apotassium 3asoil 3asoil sampling 3asulfuric acid 3atitration 0aLime requirement 0aPond liming 0aPond bottom soils 0aWater quality 0aBottom soil management1 aBoyd, Claude E.1 aViriyatum, Rawee0 tAquaculture.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 434 p.282-287dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.08.0313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03175naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100003800149245009800187300001400285520146300299592002801762650002601790650002201816650002801838650001201866650001601878650001701894650001901911650001201930650001901942650001001961650002001971650001501991650001202006650001802018650001802036650001602054653001902070653002802089653002002117653001402137653001602151700001902167700003202186700003002218700002402248700002802272700002102300700003302321700002602354700002802380773009702408856008302505852000902588655001202597IND60584260820221120025737.0190426e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058426082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aqrep.2017.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFreitas, Jorgina Juliana Gradisse10aEffect of dietary supplements in American bullfrogs reared in low and high stocking densities  ap. 45-48.  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the probiotic Bacillus subtillis and beta-glucan from the fungus Agaricus blazei on survival, growth and immunological capacity in bullfrogs (Lithobates catesbeianus) cultured in low and high stocking densities. Animals weighing 24.3±2.38g were randomly distributed into four treatments with four simultaneous replicates: D100: 100 frogs/m2 (control); D236: 236 frogs/m2; D236+Prob.: 236 frogs/m2 supplemented with probiotic; and D236+BG: 236 frogs/m2 supplemented with beta-glucan. The parameters evaluated were weight gain, survival, plasma corticosterone (CORT), phagocytic capacity (PC) and phagocytic index (PI), at 24h and 15 and 30days. There is significant interaction between treatments and time for CORT levels. At 30days, these values were very close for the D100 (control) and D236+BG groups. Meanwhile, no statistical differences were observed between treatments for PC and PI. These results indicate that beta-glucan reduced the effects of stress caused by high density in bullfrogs, but the probiotic did not reduce these effects. Both compounds are not efficient at increasing survival rates, weight gain and neither immune response of animals. Thus, the use of commercial food additives may not have the favorable impact desired by the farmer. Their use in aquaculture should be further studied in experiments involving a longer trial period and taking into account the cost of their use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgaricus subrufescens 3aBacillus subtilis 3aLithobates catesbeianus 3aanimals 3aaquaculture 3abeta-glucans 3acorticosterone 3afarmers 3afood additives 3afungi 3aimmune response 3aprobiotics 3arearing 3astocking rate 3asurvival rate 3aweight gain 0aCorticosterone 0aLithobates catesbeianus 0aImmune response 0aProbiotic 0aBeta-glucan1 aViau, Priscila1 aOliviera, Claudio Alvarenga1 aTeixeira, Patricia Coelho1 aTachibana, Leonardo1 ade Carla Dias, Danielle1 aHipolito, Marcio1 aBordon, Isabella Cristina C.1 aAlfaia, Sthefany Rosa1 aFerreira, Claudia Maris0 tAquaculture reports.g2017 Nov., v. 8 p.45-48dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2017.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02646naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001400142245012500156300001600281520115000297592002801447650003001475650001101505650001601516650001301532650001201545650003101557650001001588650002401598650001601622650001201638650001001650650003001660650000901690650001601699653001301715653002301728653002101751653002201772700001701794700001501811700001201826700001301838700001701851700001701868700001801885700001901903773010901922856007602031852000902107655001202116IND60127370620221122065620.0151124e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012737062DNAL7 a10.1896/054.097.02372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Xin10aComposition and Expression of Heat Shock Proteins in an Invasive Pest, The Rice Water Weevil (Coleoptera: Curculionidae)  ap. 611-619.  aFor poikilothermic groups such as insects, the capacity to adapt to different temperature regimes is particularly important for survival. To investigate the possible role of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in the invasive pest, the rice water weevil (Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel, Coleoptera: Curculionidae), we first analyzed the composition and expression profile of Hsp families under sub-lethal temperatures of 0 °C and 43 °C, using the quantitative realtime polymerase chain reaction. Eight genes coding Hsp90, Hsp70, and small Hsps were upregulated under heat stress, while only 1 Hsp70 gene and 1 Hsp90 gene were up-regulated under cold stress. Results indicate that Hsps from all families except Hsp60 are responsible for the capacity of L. oryzophilus to tolerate temperature stress, although more genes were up-regulated, and more rapidly, under heat stress than under cold stress. Secondly Hsp expression patterns in diapausing and non-diapausing female adults were investigated. The results showed that rice water weevils in diapause up-regulated no Hsp gene but they downregulated 4 small Hsps, 2 Hsp90, 1 Hsp70 and 1 Hsp60 genes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLissorhoptrus oryzophilus 3aadults 3acold stress 3adiapause 3afemales 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat shock proteins 3aheat stress 3ainsects 3apests 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arice 3atemperature 0adiapause 0aheat shock protein 0ainvasive species 0athermal tolerance1 aZhou, Wen-Wu1 aZhou, Ying1 aLiu, Su1 aLu, Fang1 aYang, Mao-Fa1 aCheng, Jiaan1 aGurr, Geoff M1 aZhu, Zeng-Rong0 tFlorida entomologist.g2014 June, v. 97, no. 2 p.611-619dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1896/054.097.02373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245016000169300001400329520086400343592002801207650001301235650001601248650001801264650002501282650002001307650001101327650002601338650001501364653001801379653002001397653001301417653001601430653002201446773011201468856008201580852000901662655001201671IND60584260920221120025654.0180905e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058426092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scp.2017.09.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasciotti, Maíra10aPerspectives for the use of biotechnology in green chemistry applied to biopolymers, fuels and organic synthesis: from concepts to a critical point of view  ap. 82-89.  aSince the eighteenth century, after the first industrial revolution, humans have been exploiting the planet's natural resources in an unsustainable manner. This has caused some irreversible impacts on the environment. Because of this, we are facing a change of philosophy within the scientific community about chemical and industrial processes. During the 1990s, the concepts of green chemistry began to solidify, while in parallel some major advances in biotechnology were achieved through developments of genomic sciences and genetic and metabolic engineering. This work will discuss some new insights into the use of biotechnology as an important tool in green chemistry, showing new applications to biopolymers, biofuels and as a new alternative to traditional organic synthesis, making chemical processes more sustainable and less damaging to the planet.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiofuels 3abiopolymers 3abiotechnology 3aenvironmental impact 3agreen chemistry 3ahumans 3ametabolic engineering 3aphilosophy 0aBiotechnology 0aGreen chemistry 0aBiofuels 0aBiopolymers 0aOrganic synthesis0 tSustainable chemistry and pharmacy.g2017 Dec., v. 6 p.82-89dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23279x2352-55417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scp.2017.09.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02292naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012100161300001200282520122400294592002801518650001201546650001101558650001301569650001901582650001001601650001401611650001401625651001701639700001901656700001601675700001701691700001801708773011401726856008101840852000901921655001201930IND60518359920221118223216.0160504e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051835992DNAL7 a10.1007/s12665-016-5498-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xin10aHeterogeneity of glacial lake expansion and its contrasting signals with climate change in Tarim Basin, Central Asia  ap. 696.  aOn the basis of Landsat TM/ETM +/OLI imagery in the years 1990, 2000 and 2013, changes of lake area were detected and its contrasting signals with climate change are addressed for Tarim Basin in Central Asia. During the past 23 years, the lake area has expanded at an average rate of 0.67 %/a, with the fastest rates in Altun Shan and Tian Shan mountains and slower rates in the Karakoram and Pamir, which indicates spatially heterogeneous warmer and wetter climatic signals in the basin. Examining decades, the average expansion rate of lake area (0.98 %/a) over 2000–2013 was about four times that (0.23 %/a) of 1990–2000, indicating accelerated warmer–wetter trends around the transition year 2000 in the mountain areas. Discrepant area expansion of different types of glacial lake implies contrasting signals of climate change in the Tarim Basin. Fewer direct climatic signals can be inferred from changes of supraglacial lakes.

The oxygen permeation rates of EVOH film specimens are dramatically slower than that of the PE specimen and reduce significantly as their vinyl alcohol contents increase. After blending EVOH in MPA resin, the oxygen permeation rates of each MPAEVOH series film specimens reduce significantly as their EVOH and/or vinyl alcohol contents increase, respectively. At some optimum compositions, the oxygen permeation rates of the MPAEVOH film specimens are even lower than that of the pure EVOH film specimen with a vinyl alcohol content of 52 wt%. On the other hand, the average radius (R f), volume (V f) of the free-volume-cavities and fractional free-volume (F ᵥ) values of each MPAEVOH series specimens reduce significantly as their EVOH and/or vinyl alcohol contents increase.

The selection of carrot genotypes should consider several agronomically important characteristics to allow more suitable and balanced gains. The aim of the present study was to estimate genetic gains in the carrot using different selection indices. Thirty-six carrot genotypes were evaluated in two experiments, the first conducted between 16 November 2017 and 1 March 2018, and the second between 5 March and 18 June 2018 in, Brasilia. In both trials. the experimental design was of randomised blocks with three replications. The plots were sown directly onto the seedbed, which had a total working area of 1.8 m2. The incidence of leaf blight was evaluated 78 to 98 days after sowing, at intervals of seven days, giving a total of four evaluations. The harvest was carried out at 105 days when the characteristics of the yield components were measured. An analysis of variance was applied, together with five selection indices: direct selection, classic, desired gain, weight- and parameter-free, and genotype-ideotype. There were differences between genotypes for most of the characteristics under evaluation. The genotype-ideotype index afforded the greatest gains for the characteristics being evaluated, with an economic weight equal to the coefficients of genetic variation; however other indices were also efficient and offered balanced gains, with the exception of the desired-gain index. = No Brasil, a cenoura é uma das hortaliças mais importantes por sua preferência, versatilidade e importância nutricional, principalmente como fonte de vitaminas. A seleção de genótipos de cenoura deve levar em consideração várias características de importância agronômica para permitir ganhos mais adequados e equilibrados. Assim, objetivou-se estimar os ganhos genéticos por diferentes índices de seleção em cenoura. Trinta e seis genótipos de cenoura foram avaliados em dois experimentos, sendo o primeiro conduzido entre 16 de novembro de 2017 e 01 de março de 2018, e o segundo entre 05 de março e 18 de junho de 2018, em Brasília-DF. O delineamento experimental nos dois ensaios foi de blocos ao acaso, com três repetições. As parcelas foram semeadas diretamente sobre o canteiro, com área total útil de 1,8 m2. Foi avaliada a incidência da queima das folhas de 78 aos 98 dias após a semeadura, com intervalos de sete dias, totalizando quatro avaliações. A colheita foi realizada aos 105 dias, mensurando os caracteres componentes de rendimento. A análise de variância e cinco métodos de índices de seleção foram aplicados: seleção direta, índice clássico, ganhos desejados, livre de pesos e parâmetros e genótipo/ideótipo. Houve diferenças entre genótipos para a maioria dos caracteres avaliados. O índice de seleção que proporcionou maiores ganhos para o conjunto de caracteres avaliados foi o índice genótipo/ideótipo com peso econômico igual aos coeficientes de variação genéticos, contudo outros índices também foram eficientes por proporcionar ganhos equilibrados, exceto o índice dos ganhos desejados.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanalysis of variance 3acarrots 3aexperimental design 3agenetic variation 3aleaf blight 3aseedbeds 3aBrazil 0adaucus carota l. 0aherdabilidade. 0amelhoramento genético1 aPereira, Gabriel Emiliano1 aSilva, Giovani Olegário da0 tAgro@mbiente on-line.g2022 Mar., v. 16, no. 0 p.1-14dUniversidade Federal de RoraimawJournal:27788x1982-84707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.18227/1982-8470ragro.v16i0.71543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001500149245012700164300001400291520152400305592002801829650002101857650001901878650002001897650002501917650001101942650001401953650001001967650002601977650001302003650002802016650003902044650001802083650001402101650001802115653001402133653002402147653002702171653003002198653002102228700001602249700001602265700001502281700001702296700001702313773013002330856008302460852000902543655001202552IND60553919720221120110030.0161023e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055391972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2014.05.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Xinna10aMetabolic evolution of two reducing equivalent-conserving pathways for high-yield succinate production in Escherichia coli  ap. 87-96.  aReducing equivalents are an important cofactor for efficient synthesis of target products. During metabolic evolution to improve succinate production in Escherichia coli strains, two reducing equivalent-conserving pathways were activated to increase succinate yield. The sensitivity of pyruvate dehydrogenase to NADH inhibition was eliminated by three nucleotide mutations in the lpdA gene. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased under anaerobic conditions, which provided additional NADH. The pentose phosphate pathway and transhydrogenase were activated by increased activities of transketolase and soluble transhydrogenase SthA. These data suggest that more carbon flux went through the pentose phosphate pathway, thus leading to production of more reducing equivalent in the form of NADPH, which was then converted to NADH through soluble transhydrogenase for succinate production. Reverse metabolic engineering was further performed in a parent strain, which was not metabolically evolved, to verify the effects of activating these two reducing equivalent-conserving pathways for improving succinate yield. Activating pyruvate dehydrogenase increased succinate yield from 1.12 to 1.31mol/mol, whereas activating the pentose phosphate pathway and transhydrogenase increased succinate yield from 1.12 to 1.33mol/mol. Activating these two pathways in combination led to a succinate yield of 1.5mol/mol (88% of theoretical maximum), suggesting that they exhibited a synergistic effect for improving succinate yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3aanaerobic conditions 3acarbon 3aevolution 3agenes 3ametabolic engineering 3amutation 3apentose phosphate cycle 3apyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide) 3asuccinic acid 3asynergism 3atransketolase 0aSuccinate 0aReducing equivalent 0aPyruvate dehydrogenase 0aPentose phosphate pathway 0aTranshydrogenase1 aTan, Zaigao1 aXu, Hongtao1 aChen, Jing1 aTang, Jinlei1 aZhang, Xueli0 tMetabolic engineering.g2014 July, v. 24 p.87-96dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering Societyx1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2014.05.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02395naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245012000160300001600280520087600296592002801172650001801200650001801218650001201236650000901248650001201257650001101269650002301280650001701303650001801320650001001338650002401348650001301372651001401385653002501399653001701424653001601441653000901457653001501466653002801481653001801509653001801527653001001545653001801555700002701573700001901600700002201619700001801641773010901659856007601768852000901844655001201853IND60127371020221120171321.0151124e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012737102DNAL7 a10.1896/054.097.02412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCazado, L.

Few studies have been made on specific parameters of its life history and ecology. The aim of this study was to determine the number of larval stages of R. subtilis. One thousand and eighteen larvae were collected from soybean plants during 2 yr (2011 and 2013), and head capsule width of each larva was measured. For analysis of data, the Hcap program and Dyar's rule were used. The Hcap program showed 4 different peaks in the frequency distribution of the head capsule widths. This result also agreed with Dyar's rule that revealed a perfect geometric larval growth pattern for each instar by regression analysis. The excellent fit to a linear model, indicates that no instar was overlooked. This research identified 4 instars for R. subtilis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCurculionidae 3adata analysis 3aecology 3ahead 3ainstars 3alarvae 3alarval development 3alife history 3alinear models 3apests 3aregression analysis 3asoybeans 3aArgentina 0ablack soybean weevil 0aHcap program 0aDyar's rule 0apest 0alife cycle 0apicudo negro de la soja 0aprograma Hcap 0aregla de Dyar 0aplaga 0aciclo de vida1 aVan Nieuwenhove, G.

We analysed cave-air samples for their CO₂ and CH₄ concentrations ([CO₂] and [CH₄]) and carbon isotopic compositions from sampling campaigns in winter (August 2014) and summer (February 2015) at numerous heights and locations throughout Gaden and Cathedral caves, in a semi-arid environment, Wellington Caves, NSW, Australia. Ventilation is the dominant control on cave-air CO₂ and CH₄, with the highest cave-air CO₂ concentrations ([CO₂]cₐᵥₑ) occurring in summer, in association with the lowest cave-air CH₄ concentrations ([CH₄]cₐᵥₑ). Analyses show that the cave-air CO₂ has both atmospheric and soil sources. Soil air and cave air in both caves undergo methanogenesis and methanotrophy, but we identify cave-specific differences in cave-air CH₄ and CO₂. [CH₄]cₐᵥₑ in Cathedral Cave shows an inverse relationship to [CO₂]cₐᵥₑ, particularly in areas separated from the main cave passage. In contrast, Gaden Cave has near-atmospheric [CH₄]cₐᵥₑ and isotopic ratios present at all locations sampled in winter. Where no ventilation is occurring in summer, [CH₄]cₐᵥₑ in Gaden Cave decreases, but remains reasonably high compared to Cathedral Cave. Our research shows adjacent caves vary in their ability to act as a net sink for CH₄, and highlights the need for further studies before global generalisations can be made about the carbon budget of karst environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acaves 3akarsts 3amethane 3amethane production 3asemiarid zones 3asoil air 3asummer 3auncertainty 3awinter 3aNew South Wales1 aIverach, C.

Over the past four decades, Hawaii has developed a system of 11 Marine Life Conservation Districts (MLCDs) to conserve and replenish marine resources around the state. Initially established to provide opportunities for public interaction with the marine environment, these MLCDs vary in size, habitat quality, and management regimes, providing an excellent opportunity to test hypotheses concerning MPA design and function using multiple discrete sampling units. Digital benthic habitat maps for all MLCDs and adjacent habitats were used to evaluate the efficacy of existing MLCDs using a spatially explicit stratified random sampling design. Analysis of benthic cover validated the a priori classification of habitat types and provided justification for using these habitat strata to conduct stratified random sampling and analyses of fish habitat utilization patterns. Results showed that a number of fish assemblage characteristics (e.g., species richness, biomass, diversity) vary among habitat types, but were significantly higher in MLCDs compared with adjacent fished areas across all habitat types. Overall fish biomass was 2.6 times greater in the MLCDs compared to open areas. In addition, apex predators and other species were more abundant and larger in the MLCDs, illustrating the effectiveness of these closures in conserving fish populations within their boundaries. Habitat type, protected area size, and level of protection from fishing were all important determinates of MLCD effectiveness with respect to their associated fish assemblages. Although size of these protected areas was positively correlated with a number of fish assemblage characteristics, all appear too small to have any measurable influence on the adjacent fished areas. These protected areas were not designed for biodiversity conservation or fisheries enhancement yet still provide varying degrees of protection for fish populations within their boundaries. Implementing this type of biogeographic process, using remote sensing technology and sampling across the range of habitats present within the seascape, provides a robust evaluation of existing MPAs and can help to define ecologically relevant boundaries for future MPA design in a range of locations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity conservation 3abiogeography 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3aecosystems 3afish 3afish communities 3afisheries 3ahabitats 3amarine environment 3amarine protected areas 3amarine resources 3apredators 3aremote sensing 3aspecies diversity 3aHawaii1 aBrown, Eric K.1 aMonaco, Mark E.0 tEcological applications.g2007 Apr., v. 17, no. 3 p.715-730dEcological Society of AmericawJournal:jnl47193x1051-07617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-05363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03316naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014000169300001400309520178300323592002802106650002002134650001902154650001602173650002702189650001402216650001002230650000802240650001502248650001302263650003202276650001502308650002402323650001202347653002002359653001202379653002002391653001202411700001702423700007102440700002402511700005902535773015802594856008502752852000902837655001202846IND60584261120221117162115.0180907e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058426112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.09.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTjeertes, Elke14aThe new body mass index formula; not validated as a predictor of outcome in a large cohort study of patients undergoing general surgery  ap. 24-27.  aA new and interesting body mass index (BMI) formula has been proposed. This formula was designed to provide a more accurate estimation of weight categories, not limited in a two-dimensional manner. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of the new BMI formula on postoperative complications and long-term survival in a large cohort of patients undergoing general surgery.4293 consecutive patients undergoing general surgery in a general teaching hospital were included. Data on comorbidity and demographics were gathered prior to surgery. We also collected data on surgery related characteristics. BMI was calculated using the conventional as well as the new BMI formula. Patients were then divided into four weight categories (BMI < 18.5, 18.5–25, 25–30 and >30 kg/m²) as recommended by the World Health Organization.The study population consisted of 4293 patients. Multivariate regression analyses and the area under the ROC-curve (0.531 ± 0.011 and 0.539 ± 0.011) showed comparable results in predicting outcome between the two formulas. A demographic shift was noticed after complementing the new BMI formula. Male patients were the subjects of this shift, usually towards a lower BMI. According to the conventional BMI formula, 58% of men were overweight BMI > 25 kg/m², compared to 51.4% according to the new formula.This study showed no difference in prediction of outcome after general surgery when comparing the current BMI formula to the new BMI formula. Thus, despite the fact that the new mathematical proposition seemed more logical and interesting, both calculations can be used in clinical practice. Moreover, our results do not support a change from the conventional BMI formula, currently used and accepted worldwide.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acohort studies 3acomorbidity 3ademographic statistics 3ahospitals 3amales 3amen 3aoverweight 3apatients 3apostoperative complications 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3asurgery 0aBody mass index 0aOutcome 0aGeneral surgery 0aFormula1 aHoeks, Sanne1 avan Vugt, Jeroen Laurens Ad1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0033-99471 aStolker, Robert Jan1 aHoofwijk, Anton1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4672-63980 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2017 Dec., v. 22 p.24-27dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2017.09.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01944naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008900168300001800257500001500275520084000290592002801130650000901158650001901167650001501186650001301201650002001214650002001234653002301254700002601277700002601303700002001329773015501349856008101504852000901585655001201594IND60627354820221118011126.0190128e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062735482DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0757-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBesra, Laxmidhar10aElectrophoretic deposition of alumina on stainless steel from non-aqueous suspension  ap. 5714-5721.  a2019-12-06  aElectrophoretic deposition of alumina on stainless steel has been investigated. The influence of different organic media and deposition parameters such as solid concentration, applied voltage and time of deposition on deposit yield has been evaluated. Maximum deposit yield was obtained for solvent media that imparts highest magnitude of surface charge on alumina in suspension. The deposit yield increased linearly with concentration of alumina powder in suspension, and applied voltage following Hamakers law. A similar linearity in yield was observed at short deposition times, but a deviation in linearity was observed at higher time of deposition, which is attributed to the shielding effect of the deposited layers and accumulation of ions at the electrode, and depletion of powder in the suspension with progress in deposition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3aaluminum oxide 3aelectrodes 3asolvents 3astainless steel 3aelectrophoresis 0aelectric potential1 aSamantaray, Pravanjan1 aBhattacharjee, Sarama1 aSingh, Bimal P.0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 July, v. 42, no. 14 p.5714-5721dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0757-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02168naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245004700162300001400209520100600223592002801229650001401257650001601271650001301287650001201300650002001312653001401332653001801346653001101364653000801375653001401383653000901397653000801406653000801414653000901422653001101431653000901442653000901451700001201460700001401472773014401486856008301630852000901713655001201722IND60585311120221119122149.0201202e20180101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058531112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2017.10.1452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhan, Lei10aAutophagy in endometriosis: Friend or foe?  ap. 60-63.  aEndometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent disease and characterized by the implantation of endometrial glands and stroma deep and haphazardly into the outside the uterine cavity.

Unfortunately, there is no a consistent theory for the etiology of endometriosis. Furthermore, the endometriosis is hard to diagnose in early stage and the treatment methods are limited. Importantly, emerging evidence has investigated that there is a close relationship between endometriosis and autophagy. However, autophagy is a friend or foe in endometriosis is puzzling, the precise mechanism underlying autophagy in endometriosis has not been fully elucidated yet.

Its potential use as a cost-effective adsorbent for heavy metals is beneficial to both waste management and wastewater treatment. In this study, the adsorption kinetics, isotherms as well as the factors influencing the adsorption performance were assessed through batch sorption experiments. The results show that incinerated sewage sludge ash (ISSA) was effective in adsorbing Pb(II) from aqueous solution in a wide pH range (3.00–6.00) due to the combined contributions of ion exchange, precipitation and complexation, which was confirmed by systematic investigation through XRD, SEM-EDX, FTIR, XPS and a sequential extraction procedure (SEP) for Pb(II). Nonetheless, the adsorption of Pb(II) by ISSA would be adversely affected by high ionic strength. The sorption process was fast, and the equilibrium data could be well described by the Langmuir model, the maximum uptake capacity for Pb(II) increased with temperature and the calculated adsorption capacities at 298, 308 and 318 K for Pb(II) were 58.28, 60.06 and 62.42 mg/g, respectively. These findings indicate the ISSA can be recognized as a high-performance adsorbent for Pb(II) removal in wastewater treatment applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3acost effectiveness 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3aheavy metals 3aion exchange 3aionic strength 3alead 3apH 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asewage sludge 3asludge ash 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater treatment 0aIncinerated sewage sludge ash 0aLead adsorption 0aWaste management 0aWastewater treatment applications1 aLi, Jiang-shan1 aPoon, C.

In this work, acid birnessite (AB) doped with iron was synthesized as the artificial mineral to study the adsorption and oxidation of antimony. As compared to the pristine birnessite, Fe-doping birnessites show a markedly enhanced removal efficiency for both Sb(III) and Sb(V), where 10% Fe exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity of 759 mg/g Sb(III). The removal of Sb(III) clearly underwent a novel kinetic process of adsorption-desorption- (re-adsorption). By monitoring the kinetics with XRD, XPS, and IR, it is demonstrated that the three-stage kinetics were attributed to the strong interaction between Sb(III) and birnessite, including Sb(III) oxidation, followed by destruction of birnessite and then phase transformation into vernadite. Furthermore, the increase of iron content doped into birnessite enhanced the rate of its phase transition, which led to an increased adsorption of the oxidized antimony on the surface of vernadite by substituting iron and manganese associated with hydroxyl group. This work suggested that the strong interactions between heavy metal ions and mineral particles, more than adsorption, are critical to the transformation, mobility and biotoxicity of antimony in nature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3aantimony 3abirnessite 3aheavy metals 3airon 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3amonitoring 3aoxidation 3aphase transition 3apollutants 3apollution control 0aAcid birnessite 0aAntimony 0aAdsorption 0aOxidation 0aTransformation1 aZhang, Weifang1 aTao, Le1 aLiu, Feng1 aZhang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8299-25730 tChemosphere.g2019 July, v. 226 p.834-840dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.1943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03722naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024004000131040001800171100002300189245013700212300001600349520179000365592002802155650002102183650002002204650002502224650002602249650002202275650001702297650002202314650002102336650001102357650002402368650003502392650001302427650004002440650001502480650002102495650001302516650002602529650001002555650001002565650001802575650001302593650001402606653002202620653001702642653001102659653001602670653004002686653002502726700002402751700002402775700001602799700002002815700002202835773014702857856008303004852000903087655001203096IND60553920220221121043513.0161023e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055392022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2014.05.0082doi7 a10.1016/j.ymben.2014.05.0082chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutensohn, Michael10aMetabolic engineering of monoterpene biosynthesis in tomato fruits via introduction of the non-canonical substrate neryl diphosphate  ap. 107-116.  aRecently it was shown that monoterpenes in tomato trichomes (Solanum lycopersicum) are synthesized by phellandrene synthase 1 (PHS1) from the non-canonical substrate neryl diphosphate (NPP), the cis-isomer of geranyl diphosphate (GPP). As PHS1 accepts both NPP and GPP substrates forming different monoterpenes, it was overexpressed in tomato fruits to test if NPP is also available in a tissue highly active in carotenoid production. However, transgenic fruits overexpressing PHS1 produced only small amounts of GPP-derived PHS1 monoterpene products, indicating the absence of endogenous NPP. Therefore, NPP formation was achieved by diverting the metabolic flux from carotenoids via expression of tomato neryl diphosphate synthase 1 (NDPS1). NDPS1 transgenic fruits produced NPP-derived monoterpenes, including nerol, neral and geranial, while displaying reduced lycopene content. NDPS1 co-expression with PHS1 resulted in a monoterpene blend, including β-phellandrene, similar to that produced from NPP by PHS1 in vitro and in trichomes. Unexpectedly, PHS1×NDPS1 fruits showed recovery of lycopene levels compared to NDPS1 fruits, suggesting that redirection of metabolic flux is only partially responsible for the reduction in carotenoids. In vitro assays demonstrated that NPP serves as an inhibitor of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, thus its consumption by PHS1 leads to recovery of lycopene levels. Monoterpenes produced in PHS1×NDPS1 fruits contributed to direct plant defense negatively affecting feeding behavior of the herbivore Helicoverpa zea and displaying antifungal activity against Botrytis cinerea. These results show that NPP-derived terpenoids can be produced in plant tissues; however, NPP has to be consumed to avoid negative impacts on plant metabolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aHelicoverpa zea 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3aantifungal properties 3abeta-phellandrene 3abiosynthesis 3acis-trans isomers 3afeeding behavior 3afruits 3agene overexpression 3agenetically modified organisms 3ageranial 3ageranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 3aherbivores 3ain vitro studies 3alycopene 3ametabolic engineering 3aneral 3anerol 3aplant tissues 3atomatoes 3atrichomes 0aNeryl diphosphate 0aMonoterpenes 0aTomato 0aCarotenoids 0aGeranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 0aDirect plant defense1 aNguyen, Thuong T.H.1 aMcMahon, Richard D.1 aKaplan, Ian1 aPichersky, Eran1 aDudareva, Natalia0 tMetabolic engineering.g2014 July, v. 24 p.107-116dElsevier Inc.aInternational Metabolic Engineering SocietywJournal:26771x1096-71767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2014.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011500162520117900277592002801456650001201484650002501496650002901521650001201550650003101562650001201593650002001605650001101625650001601636650002501652650002401677651001001701653002001711653005501731653002901786653003501815653001801850700001501868700001501883700001601898773011801914856008202032852000902114655001202123IND60734150120221119024355.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073415012DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShi, Ruxia10aComprehensive evaluation of ecosystem health in pastoral areas of Qinghai–Tibet Plateau based on multi model  aIn order to solve the problem that the existing ecosystem health assessment methods are affected by many uncertain factors, resulting in inaccurate assessment results, a comprehensive assessment method of ecosystem health in pastoral areas of Qinghai–Tibet Plateau was proposed based on multi model combination method, taking pastoral areas of Qinghai–Tibet Plateau as an example. Remote sensing technology is introduced to obtain the relevant information of the study area and analyze the ecological and environmental problems of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. The remote sensing image of plateau pastoral area is corrected and fused, and the multi model is established by using the common Kriging interpolation method, and the response evaluation index system is obtained. Analysis of forest vegetation coverage, temperature vegetation drought index, leaf area index, vegetation primary productivity, surface temperature and precipitation, calculation of index weight, complete the design of evaluation method. The experimental results show that the designed evaluation method is closer to the actual situation, which verifies the effectiveness of the evaluation method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrought 3aenvironmental health 3aenvironmental technology 3aforests 3ahealth effects assessments 3akriging 3aleaf area index 3amodels 3apastoralism 3aprimary productivity 3asurface temperature 3aChina 0aMultiple models 0aComprehensive evaluation of ecological environment 0aRemote sensing technique 0aOrdinary Kriging interpolation 0aDrought index1 aJia, Qinyi1 aWei, Fenzi1 aDu, Guozhen0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101552-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1015523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01818naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245007600167300001800243520081200261592002801073650001301101650001401114650002101128650001501149650002201164650000701186650002001193700001601213700001801229773015501247856008101402852000901483655001201492IND60627355220221118011241.0190128e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062735522DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-006-0754-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, ZhangSheng10aEffect of AlN particles on the corrosion behavior of Al/AlNP composites  ap. 5736-5741.  aThe corrosion behavior of Al/AlNP composites has been examined by using potentiodynamic polarization technique in 3.5wt% NaCl solution with the pH value of 5, 8.6, and 11.6 respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements have also been carried out to assess the long-term effects of AlN particles. It has been found that Al/AlNₚ composites show the increased susceptibility to pitting attack compared with the unreinforced Al, which is attributed to the micro-galvanic action between AlN particles and the matrix Al. The micro-galvanic action mainly arises as a result of hydrolysis of AlN particles. In addition, EIS measurements reveal that the corrosion mechanism of Al/AlNₚ composites changes a lot with increasing immersion time, which is controlled by diffusion process at last.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3acorrosion 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrolysis 3along term effects 3apH 3asodium chloride1 aWu, BianTao1 aGu, Mingyuan,0 tJournal of materials science.g2007 July, v. 42, no. 14 p.5736-5741dKluwer Academic Publishers-Plenum PublisherswJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-006-0754-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02124naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001400140245013500154300001600289520102000305592002801325650002501353650002301378650001501401650001601416650000901432650001001441650001301451650001801464700001301482700001601495700002301511700001501534773012901549856007501678852000901753655001201762IND60775189820221118013235.0220422e20220421xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077518982DNAL7 a10.1039/d2em00034b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Biao10aTowards improved characterization of the fate and impact of hydraulic fracturing chemicals to better secure regional water quality  ap. 497-503.  aHydraulic fracturing (HF) of shale and other permeable rock formations to extract gas and oil is a water-intensive process that returns a significant amount of flowback and produced water (FPW). Due to the complex chemical composition of HF fluids and FPW, this process has led to public concern on the impacts of FPW disposal, spillage and spreading to regional freshwater resources, in particular to shallow groundwater aquifers. To address this, a better understanding of the chemical composition of HF fluid and FPW is needed, as well as the environmental fate properties of the chemical constituents, such as their persistence, mobility and toxicity (PMT) properties. Such research would support risk-based management strategies for the protection of regional water quality, including both the phase-out of problematic chemicals and better hydraulic safeguards against FPW contamination. This article presents recent strategies to advance the assessment and analysis of HF and FPW associated organic chemicals.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3aenvironmental fate 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3aoils 3ashale 3atoxicity 3awater quality1 aHan, Min1 aHuang, Chen1 aArp, Hans Peter H.1 aZhang, Gan0 tEnvironmental science.g2022 Apr. 21, v. 24, no. 4 p.497-503dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26908x2050-78957nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2em00034b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04013naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245014700163300001600310520270700326592002803033653002003061653001603081653001303097653001403110653002503124653001003149653001903159653002003178653001203198653001503210653001703225653001503242653001003257653001503267700002003282700002103302700003003323700003203353773010903385856007603494852000903570655001203579IND60127371620221120171438.0150428e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012737162DNAL7 a10.1896/054.097.02472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParadell, Susana10aDiversity of Auchenorrhyncha (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Delphacidae) Associated with Vicia villosa in Southern Buenos Aires Province, Argentina  ap. 674-684.  aAmong the Hemiptera, the Auchenorrhyncha are well known owing to their phytosanitary relevance since the group includes pathogen vector species able to damage commercial crops. Vicia villosa Roth (Fabaceae) is a fodder plant species, mainly distributed in central Argentina. Previous contributions have shown that V. villosa is colonized by diverse species of Auchenorrhyncha, either naturalized or native to valley of Colorado River area, in southern Buenos Aires province. To date, the only information about the species of hoppers associated with Vicia has come from preliminary field observations. The dearth of demographic knowledge about these phytophagous insects associated with this crop in Argentina motivates the study. The aims of this work were: 1) to characterize the diversity of the species of Auchenorrhyncha associated with V. villosa and 2) to determine the seasonal fluctuation of the most abundant species in relation to local weather variables and crop phonological phases. The study was conducted in Vicia plots located at EEA INTA Hilario Ascasubi (S 39° 23′ 36″ -W 62° 37′ 59″, 15 m.a.s.l.) southern Buenos Aires province. The specimens were collected with a sweep net during 2 yr (2009 and 2011). Weather variables were recorded using a meteorological station located at the sampling site. To measure species richness and community diversity we calculated both Margalef (DMg) and the Simpson (D) indexes, and also, the Relative Importance Index (RII). The relationships between population densities of the leafhoppers, Paratanus exitiosus (Beamer) and Agalliana ensigera Oman (Cicadellidae), with weather variables were analyzed through simple and multiple linear regression. A total of 17 species were associated with V. villosa crops in Argentina, of which 15 belong to the Cicadellidae and 2 to the Delphacidae. Abundance and species richness were higher in 2009 than in 2011. In general, the results of the Margalef index showed that species richness was higher in 2009, while Simpson Index (D) indicated a higher dominance in 2011 than in 2009. The species, P. exitiosus and A. ensigera, stood out for their abundance, frequency and phytosanitary relevance during the sampling period. Both species presented population increases since Nov coinciding with different phenological phases of the crop and the maximum density of the canopy. Additionally, the population density of P. exitiosus showed strong dependence on the hydric balance and photoperiod, while A. ensigera was influenced by Degree-days₁₀ and hydric balance. Vicia villlosa was a new host-plant record for 15 species. Buenos Aires province was cited as a new distribution record for 2 species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aAuchenorrhyncha 0acommunities 0arichness 0aabundance 0aseasonal fluctuation 0aVicia 0acrop phenology 0aAuchenorrhyncha 0ariqueza 0aabundancia 0afluctuación 0aestacional 0aVicia 0afenología1 aDefea, Bárbara1 aDughetti, Arturo1 aZárate Rosales, Alberto,1 aLenicov, Ana M.

It is crucial to explore the vegetation characteristics and dynamics before developing appropriate strategies to mitigate the ecosystem degradation. In this paper, remote sensing images are used to obtain vegetation cover data, which are considered to show ecosystem statuses in the Xihu oasis during 1986–2010. Both the land use dynamic change (LUDC) model and proposed transitional area ratio (TAR) index are used to analyze the vegetation dynamics among four vegetation cover types (i.e. no, low, medium and high) and possible driving factors. Results indicate that: (1) the vegetation degrades during 1986–1999 and then has been recovered since the early 2000s; (2) the introduced LUDC model shows that the low and medium vegetation covers are the most unstable types because they can easily transfer into the other types under external disturbances; (3) the proposed TAR index agrees with the results from LUDC model in the overall change trend of vegetation cover during 25 years, and is a good representation of vegetation stability; and (4) the correlation analyses between TAR index and the runoff and groundwater in the upper river basin present that the oasis ecosystem is affected mostly by human activities, and the impacts of runoff and groundwater in upper river basin on vegetation cover in the Xihu oasis can reach approximately 30 and 15 years, respectively. To recover the Xihu oasis ecosystem to the status in 1986, the continuous annual runoff at the Panjiazhuang hydrologic station should be more than 2.9 × 10⁸ m³ for 30 years, or the depth of groundwater level in the Yumen basin should be higher than 5.3 m for 15 years.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adesertification 3aecosystems 3agroundwater 3ahumans 3aland use 3amodels 3aoases 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3avegetation cover 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aChina1 aLi, Xiang1 aHuang, Yuefei1 aSi, Yuan1 aWei, Jiahua1 aLiu, Jiahong1 aBai, Rui0 tEnvironmental earth sciences.g2016 Apr., v. 75, no. 8 p.707-707dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx1866-62807nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-016-5420-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04665naa a2200901 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024001700113024001900130024002700149024001100176040001800187100001800205245014300223300001800366506017300384520133700557592002801894650002101922650001401943650002701957650001601984650002302000650001002023650002002033650001302053650001502066650004302081650004402124650001502168650001202183650004302195650001402238650001602252650001702268650001002285650003502295650005802330650005002388650003902438650003802477650001302515650004202528650003802570650003602608650005602644650003702700651001802737651001802755653003302773653003002806653001602836653003702852653002802889653005002917653004202967653004603009653004103055653003603096700002103132700002003153700002303173700002103196700002003217700001703237700002403254700002303278700002203301773013303323856011203456856007503568956008603643961001303729852000903742655001203751IND4465829620221214225308.0160905e20130320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446582962DNAL7 a10113/587542hdl7 a2890642aris7 a233797582pmid7 a10.1021/jf305208e2doi8 ans4434  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Mingli,10aOil, Fatty Acid, Flavonoid, and Resveratrol Content Variability and FAD2A Functional SNP Genotypes in the U.S. Peanut Mini-Core Collection  ap. 2875-2882.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aPeanut seeds contain high amounts of oil and protein as well as some useful bioactive phytochemicals which can contribute to human health. The U.S. peanut mini-core collection is an important genetic resource for improving seed quality and developing new cultivars. Variability of seed chemical composition within the mini-core was evaluated from freshly harvested seeds for two years. Oil, fatty acid composition, and flavonoid/resveratrol content were quantified by NMR, GC, and HPLC, respectively. Significant variability was detected in seed chemical composition among accessions and botanical varieties. Accessions were further genotyped with a functional SNP marker from the FAD2A gene using real-time PCR and classified into three genotypes with significantly different O/L ratios: wild type (G/G with a low O/L ratio <1.7), heterozygote (G/A with O/L ratio >1.4 but <1.7), and mutant (A/A with a high O/L ratio >1.7). The results from real-time PCR genotyping and GC fatty acid analysis were consistent. Accessions with high amounts of oil, quercetin, high seed weight, and O/L ratio were identified.

Thus, a total of 190 trout were obtained, represented by 95 runts and 95 fish of harvest quality. Trout were examined for macroscopic ectoparasites as well as helminths of the gastrointestinal tract and body cavity by careful visual inspection, and belly flap musculature by pepsin digestion. Stomach content analysis was performed in order to assess the risk of endoparasite transmission to the net cage cultured trout. Low numbers of salmon lice (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) (1–9 lice per fish) were found on 9 trout from western localities off the eastern coast of Jutland characterized by water salinity levels of 21–24‰, whereas no lice were detected on fish from areas of lower salinity. Body cavity and musculature of all trout were free from helminths, and the absence of medically important 3rd stage larvae of Anisakidae was thus confirmed. However, transmission of endoparasites was documented by the finding of the nematode Hysterothylacium aduncum in the intestines of 9.5% of the runts (mean intensity=2.3) and 2.1% of the harvest quality trout (mean intensity=2.0). A few cestodes (Eubothrium sp.) located in the pyloric caeca, and one acantocephalan (Neoechinorhynchus sp.) found in the intestine, were collected from four trout. The higher prevalence of H. aduncum among runts was associated with a markedly increased intake of parasite intermediate or paratenic hosts, i.e. small fish (mainly three-spined stickleback) and crustaceans (mainly amphipods), by these fish compared to those of harvest quality. Additionally, a higher number of runts than harvest quality fish had eaten biofouling organisms, e.g. mussels and algae, further indicating a difference in feeding behavior between the two quality classes of trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmphipoda 3aEubothrium 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aHysterothylacium aduncum 3aLepeophtheirus salmonis 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aalgae 3abiofouling 3acage culture 3acages 3acecum 3acoasts 3adigestion 3afarmed fish 3afeeding behavior 3afish culture 3ahelminths 3alarvae 3alice 3amariculture 3amussels 3aparatenic hosts 3apepsin 3arisk 3aslaughter 3astomach 3atrout 3awater salinity 3aDenmark 0aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aMariculture 0aRunts 0aHysterothylacium aduncum 0aSalmon lice 0aStomach content1 aMehrdana, Foojan1 aMarana, Moonika Haahr1 aBahlool, Qusay Zuhair Mohammad1 aJaafar, Rzgar Mohammad1 aSindberg, Diana1 aJensen, Hannah Malene1 aKania, Per Walter1 aBuchmann, Kurt0 tAquaculture.g2014 Oct. 20, v. 434 p.486-492dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.08.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02634naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245015000163300001400313506002800327520118500355592002801540506003701568650001401605650002601619650001301645650001001658650000901668651001101677653002101688653002601709653002801735653003101763700002601794700002701820700002201847700001901869700002301888773021801911856007402129852000902203655001202212IND60770592220221215143838.0220304e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077059222DNAL7 a10.12899/asr-19672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadalamenti, Emilio14aThe evolution in time of the concept of fast growing tree species: is it possible to use a definition applicable to all environmental conditions?  ap. 53-61.  aResource is Open Access  aAlthough the expression “fast-growing species” (FGS) referred to tree species has been since long time used, a clear definition has not been adopted for decades. Starting from the Italian historical background, we searched for the definitions of FGS formulated over time at a national and international level. The mean annual increment (MAI) of 10 m3 ha-1, identified by the FAO, has been the most commonly considered threshold until recently. Subsequently, experimental activities and research efforts have consistently enhanced the productivity of FGS, and other definitions have been proposed accordingly. Hence, FGS should provide annual wood yields of 15-25 m3 ha-1 with rotations of less than 25-30 years. In Europe, the maximum MAI can reach about 20-25 m3 ha-1, while in fast-growing tropical plantations the MAI frequently exceeds 30-35 m3 ha-1. However, we deem that the threshold of 10 m3 ha-1 year-1 is still reliable for Mediterranean conditions. Since the fast-growing is a relative concept, strongly affected by species’ traits, environmental conditions and cultural practices, a future increase in the productivity levels of wood plantations can be expected.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aevolution 3amean annual increment 3aresearch 3atrees 3awood 3aEurope 0awood plantations 0amean annual increment 0ashort rotation forestry 0awood and timber production1 aSferlazza, Sebastiano1 aDonato S.

This work aimed to investigate the influence of the amount of oil (10–30% on flour basis), xylanase activity (17–57 U/g on flour-bran basis) and resting time (1–3 h) of the dough on rheology of dough with added glucose oxidase, its 3D printing precision and snack quality (shrinkage, texture, colour). Response surface methodology, partial least squares and artificial neural networks (ANN) were compared for modelling the dough rheology and snack quality. ANN identified the highest sensitivity of the snack formulation to the amount of oil and the lowest to the resting time. Optimal amount of oil was 20%; at lower amounts, dough had higher complex viscosity, yield point and flow point, whereby snacks were harder, darker, redder and yellower. At the optimum xylanase amount of 37 U/g, shrinkage during baking was minimized (5.4%) as the structure scanned by electron microscopy was more complex and compact. ANN showed that rheological properties of the dough can be valuable predictors of shrinkage and colour of 3D-printed snacks, facilitating product development.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adough 3aelectron microscopy 3aenzymatic treatment 3aflour 3aglucose oxidase 3alipid content 3aoils 3aproduct development 3aresponse surface methodology 3arheology 3ashrinkage 3atexture 3aviscosity 3axylanases 0a3D shape shrinkage 0aArtificial neural networks 0aGlucose oxidase 0aXylanase1 aBenković, Maja1 aIveković, Damir1 aVukušić Pavičić, Tomislava1 aČukelj Mustač, Nikolina1 aVoučko, Bojana1 aČurić, Duška,1 aNovotni, Dubravka1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8760-61250 tJournal of cereal science.g2022 Nov., v. 108 p.103559-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46803x0733-52107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcs.2022.1035593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03220naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245013200164300001600296520176800312592002802080650002002108650001302128650002102141650002002162650001202182650001202194650002402206650001002230650001002240650004302250650001302293650001402306650002902320653002002349653002402369653002102393653003502414700001702449700001302466700001402479700001402493700001602507773012102523856008502644852000902729655001202738IND60635808120221117172003.0190606e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063580812DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.03.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yi10aCytochrome P450 monooxygenases-mediated sex-differential spinosad resistance in house flies Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae)  ap. 178-185.  aFemales developed notably higher resistance than males in a spinosad-resistant house fly strain, however, resistance factors responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. In this study, the potential role of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases involved in the sex-differential spinosad resistance in house flies was investigated, using a susceptible strain (SSS) and a spinosad resistant near-isogenic line (N-SRS). Combination of the synergism of spinosad by PBO and increased cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activity in the N-SRS strain implied that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases contributed to spinosad resistance in house flies. Transcriptional levels of eight P450 genes related to insecticide resistance in two genders of the SSS and N-SRS strain were separately evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, compared with the corresponding gender of susceptible SSS house flies, CYP4G2 and CYP6A5v2 were overexpressed in resistant N-SRS females, while the expression of these two P450 genes was significantly decreased in resistant N-SRS males. Furthermore, by measuring the expression of CYP4G2 and CYP6A5v2 in female and male house fly populations with different spinosad resistance levels, which were generated from a series of genetic crosses, the genetic linkage between spinosad resistance and P450 gene expression was analyzed. It was found that with increased spinosad resistance, CYP4G2 and CYP6A5v2 were up-regulated in females, while both of them were down-regulated in males, and this suggested their involvement in the female-linked spinosad resistance of house flies. Taken together, our results provide valuable insight into the involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases in the sex-differential spinosad resistance in house flies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMusca domestica 3acrossing 3acytochrome P-450 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3afemales 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3amales 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aspinosad 3asynergism 3atranscription (genetics) 0aMusca domestica 0aSpinosad resistance 0aSex-differential 0aCytochrome P450 monooxygenases1 aWang, Yanyan1 aMa, Zhuo1 aZhai, Dai1 aGao, Xiwu1 aShi, Xueyan0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2019 June, v. 157 p.178-185dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl1414x0048-35757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2019.03.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100003100171245014300202300001400345520101200359592002801371650004401399650001201443650002501455650002001480650001201500650001501512650001201527650004401539650001401583650001201597650002701609650002601636650002601662650002901688650004901717650002701766650003901793650002701832650004501859650004101904650003301945653001701978653001501995653001102010653001602021653001302037700003402050700002502084700002002109773010302129856008702232852000902319655001202328IND50065432120221118051404.0190409e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006543212DNAL7 a230696072pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.09.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTimilsena, Yakindra Prasad10aEffect of different pretreatments on delignification pattern and enzymatic hydrolysability of miscanthus, oil palm biomass and typha grass  ap. 82-88.  aCumulative pretreatments methods were evaluated for delignification ability and enzymatic digestibility using miscanthus (M×G), empty palm fruit bunch (EFB) and typha grass as feedstocks. Despite their close chemical composition, the three feedstocks unveiled quite different behavior under the same condition of pretreatment. Characterization of ethanol organosol lignins extracted from the three feedstocks by 13C NMR and FTIR revealed information concerning S/G/H ratios which was important to rationalize the differences among the feedstock behavior. The S/G/H ratios for MxG, EFB and typha, were established to levels of ∼52/44/4, ∼68/30/2 and ∼46/27/27 respectively. The xylans hydrolytic susceptibility were a major cause of difference in behavior of feedstock during the pretreatment process. The influence of the presence of naphthol during autohydrolysis on the delignification ability was studied. A good relationship was observed between S+H/G ratio and the scavenging effect of naphthol.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3adelignification 3aethanol 3afeedstocks 3agrasses 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apalm oils 2aBiomass 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aCellulasexmetabolism 2aEthanolxpharmacology 2aHydrolysisxdrug effects 2aLigninxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aPlant Oilsxmetabolism 2aPoaceaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aSolventsxpharmacology 2aSpectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared 2aTyphaceaexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2abeta-Glucosidasexmetabolism 0aPretreatment 0aBioethanol 0aLignin 0aS/G/H ratio 0aNaphthol1 aAbeywickrama, Chandana Janaka1 aRakshit, Sudip Kumar1 aBrosse, Nicolas0 tBioresource technology.g2013 May, v. 135 p.82-88dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.09.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005900148245007400207300001600281520164200297592002801939650001701967650001101984650001901995650001902014650002202033650001902055650001402074650002402088650001202112650001702124650001202141650001302153651001302166700002202179700001902201700002102220773012102241856008202362852000902444655001202453IND60686282120221121085413.0200315e202004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068628212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-020-01249-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeise, Ellen M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4274-019210aAdaptive genetic management: assessing the benefits of translocations  ap. 277-287.  aDeclines in abundance and genetic diversity in plant and animal populations are increasingly of conservation concern. Genetic rescue, or the supplementation of declining populations with individuals from genetically different sources, may aid in demographic and genetic recovery efforts, assuming introduced individuals successfully reproduce following translocation. However, the relative reproductive contributions of resident and translocated individuals are not frequently evaluated. In the northern lower peninsula of Michigan, USA, fourteen brown trout (Salmo trutta) from each of three different tributaries were introduced into a research stream (Hunt Creek) to supplement a small, isolated resident brown trout population. Mean expected heterozygosity and mean allelic richness differed between the three translocated populations compared to residents. Additionally, inter-population variance in allele frequency (FST) between resident and translocated populations ranged from 0.024 to 0.098. Using genetic parentage assignments, we documented that translocated and resident brown trout did interbreed; however, intra-population mating events were more common. Simulations indicated that increases in genetic diversity among age-1 offspring were the result of reproduction by translocated adults, as genetic variation was significantly above levels expected by reproduction among residents alone (p < 0.001). To achieve management goals for genetic rescue programs, managers would be advised to conduct simulations and hypothesis testing in addition to collection of empirical genetic data to evaluate introduction outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3aadults 3agene frequency 3agenetic rescue 3agenetic variation 3aheterozygosity 3aparentage 3apopulation dynamics 3aprogeny 3areproduction 3astreams 3avariance 3aMichigan1 aSard, Nicholas M.1 aNehfer, Andrew1 aScribner, Kim T.0 tConservation genetics.g2020 Apr., v. 21, no. 2 p.277-287dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870040x1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-020-01249-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01699naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245014200169300001800311520057900329592002800908650001200936650001400948650002300962650001100985650002900996650002301025650001301048650001101061650001401072650000901086700001901095700002301114773010601137856008501243852000901328655001201337IND60579304820221119074323.0170816e20170707xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057930482DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.orglett.7b009172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShimada, Yukako10aPreparation of Organozinc Reagents via Catalyst Controlled Three-Component Coupling between Alkyne, Iodoarene, and Bis(iodozincio)methane  ap. 3335-3337.  aThree-component coupling between an alkyne, iodoarene, and bis(iodozincio)methane yields allylic zinc with a tetrasubstituted alkene moiety in the presence of a nickel catalyst.

Here, we present a theoretical model of ferroelectric bilayers using basic thermodynamics taking into account the appropriate electrical boundary conditions and electrostatic fields. The spontaneous polarization mismatch in ferroelectric/ferroelectric (FE/FE), FE/paraelectric (FE/PE), and FE/dielectric (FE/DE) bilayers results in a non-linear electrostatic coupling which produces significant deviations in the overall dielectric response if it is computed using the simple capacitor-in-series (CIS) model. Our results show that the CIS approach is a good approximation only for DE/DE multilayers and for FE heterostructures if the individual layers are electrostatically screened from each other.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical equipment 3amodels 3athermodynamics1 aKesim, M.

The complex equilibria and kinetic process of separations were studied in order to understand major factors in the control of selectivity and retention order of complex anions. A systematic study was applied to identify the additional peaks of the system as NaEDTA³⁻, NaHEDTA²⁻, Na₂EDTA²⁻, EDTA⁴⁻/HEDTA³⁻, DCTA⁴⁻/HDCTA⁻³. On the basis of microequilibrium considerations of chelating ligand, it was shown that one should expect the peaks of sodium chelates when the ligand is in excess in the sample solution. The probability density function was introduced for calculation of complex chromatograms, because complexing ligands can exist in at least two different interconvertible forms in the presence of metal ion. The chromatogram of interconverting chelate species can be given as the sum of probability density functions (P) weighed by the molar fractions of complexed (ΦML) and dissociated (ΦL) forms. The influences of kinetic rate of complex formation and dissociation on the distribution of components between eluents and ion exchange stationary phases were quantitatively described and demonstrated by elution profiles. The applicability of the developed method is represented by the simultaneous analysis of transition metal chelates and inorganic anions. ICP-AES analysis and FTIR-ATR technique were used for confirmation of IC results for metals and ligands, respectively. Collection protocols for the heart-cutting procedure of chromatograms were applied in the analysis of target components. The limit of detection and linearity of the method in the range of 0.01–0.25mM sample concentration were also presented.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEDTA (chelating agent) 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aanions 3achelates 3adetection limit 3adissociation 3aion exchange 3aion exchange chromatography 3aprobability1 aHorváth, Krisztián,1 aHajós, Péter0 tJournal of chromatography.g2013 Jan. 11, v. 1272 p.26-32dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.11.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01852naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003200150245011800182300001600300520061400316536011400930592002801044650001101072650001201083650001101095650001301106651001501119653002701134653001701161653001301178653003001191653002501221700002201246700001801268773009901286856008401385852000901469655001201478IND60727428720221119025444.0210211e20200624xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072742872DNAL7 a10.3897/herpetozoa.33.e515702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrnobrnja-Isailović, Jelka10aNew record of a Dalmatolacerta oxycephala (Duméril & Bibron, 1839) population in the northern part of Montenegro  ap. 121-124.  aTwo previously known northernmost localities of Sharp-snouted rock lizard in Montenegro were the entrance of the Komarnica Canyon (Nevidio), and the middle part of the Tara River Canyon (village Tepca).

This study investigated the improvement in prediction accuracy for heat tolerance when selected sets of sequence variants from a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) were combined with a standard 50k single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) panel used by the dairy industry. METHODS: Over 40,000 dairy cattle with genotype and phenotype data were analysed. The phenotypes used to measure an individual’s heat tolerance were defined as the rate of decline in milk production traits with rising temperature and humidity. We used Holstein and Jersey cows to select sequence variants linked to heat tolerance. The prioritised sequence variants were the most significant SNPs passing a GWAS p-value threshold selected based on sliding 100-kb windows along each chromosome. We used a bull reference set to develop the genomic prediction equations, which were then validated in an independent set of Holstein, Jersey, and crossbred cows. Prediction analyses were performed using the BayesR, BayesRC, and GBLUP methods. RESULTS: The accuracy of genomic prediction for heat tolerance improved by up to 0.07, 0.05, and 0.10 units in Holstein, Jersey, and crossbred cows, respectively, when sets of selected sequence markers from Holstein cows were added to the 50k SNP panel. However, in some scenarios, the prediction accuracy decreased unexpectedly with the largest drop of − 0.10 units for the heat tolerance fat yield trait observed in Jersey cows when 50k plus pre-selected SNPs from Holstein cows were used. Using pre-selected SNPs discovered on a combined set of Holstein and Jersey cows generally improved the accuracy, especially in the Jersey validation. In addition, combining Holstein and Jersey bulls in the reference set generally improved prediction accuracy in most scenarios compared to using only Holstein bulls as the reference set. CONCLUSIONS: Informative sequence markers can be prioritised to improve the genomic prediction of heat tolerance in different breeds. In addition to providing biological insight, these variants could also have a direct application for developing customized SNP arrays or can be used via imputation in current industry SNP panels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aJersey 3achromosomes 3acrossbreds 3adairy cattle 3adairy industry 3aevolution 3agenome-wide association study 3agenomics 3agenotype 3aheat tolerance 3ahumidity 3alivestock production 3amilk production 3aphenotype 3aprediction 3areproduction 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3atemperature1 aHaile-Mariam, Mekonnen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5476-74751 aCocks, Benjamin G.1 aMacLeod, Iona M.1 aMrode, R.

Here we follow-up a prior study, which surveyed turfgrass establishment in plots amended with biochar or compost or a mixture of both and unamended control plots. Following establishment, the plots were differentially irrigated at either full (85% ETₒ replaced) or deficit (50% ETₒ replaced) levels for four years and sampled for analysis. Relationships between soil chemical parameters and microbial community biomass and profiles based on phospholipid fatty acid analysis and high throughput sequencing of bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA genes were determined. Compared to the unamended control soils, compost amended soils with or without biochar underwent greater shifts in soil physiochemical and biological properties than those receiving biochar. Although the impact of compost on the microbial community lessened with time, even 5 years after its incorporation, compost amended soils had increased microbial biomass by 127% and 157% in full and deficit irrigated plots compared to unamended plots. Bacterial/archaeal communities compositionally were more divergent in response to deficit irrigation in the unamended soils than in those amended with compost or biochar. Both soil amendments resulted in reduced relative abundances of nitrifying bacteria and archaea. In compost-amended soils many taxa associated with plant growth promotion and carbon cycling increased in relative abundance, whereas no such effect was observed with biochar. Altogether, these results provide mechanistic insights into how organic amendments affect turfgrass systems and their associated soil microbial communities under full and deficit irrigation regimens.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acomposts 3adeficit irrigation 3agrowth promotion 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial communities 3aphospholipid fatty acids 3aplant growth 3asoil ecology 3aturf grasses 0aTurfgrass 0aCompost 0aMicrobial community1 aCurtis, Daniel1 aAzeem, Muhammad1 aMontgomery, Jonathan1 aCrowley, David E.1 aMcGiffen, Milton E.0 tApplied soil ecology.g2021 Dec., v. 168 p.104134-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.1041343Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002600139245009800165300001600263520123600279592002801515650001501543650001001558650001001568650001501578650001101593650001401604650001401618650001701632700001601649773016501665856007301830852000901903655001201912IND60082111820221118124116.0141016e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008211182DNAL7 a10.1111/bij.123382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAjuria Ibarra, Helena10aFemale‐limited colour polymorphism in the crab spider Synema globosum (Araneae: Thomisidae)  ap. 368-383.  aConspicuous colour variation, caused by the influence of the environment on phenotype or by genetic differences among individuals, is frequently observed in nature. If genetic in origin, colour variation can facilitate the study of mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of true polymorphisms. Here we describe, for the first time, the female‐limited colour polymorphism in the crab spider, Synema globosum. We looked for associations between life‐history traits and female colour morph, and identified potential agents of selection that could influence the maintenance of the polymorphism. Our results showed that the polymorphism is discrete and heritable, and that differences in colour among morphs are likely to be detectable by honeybees, birds, and conspecifics. We found limited evidence of differences among morphs in morphology and ecology, and found no differences in components of reproduction. Based on the lines of evidence obtained in this study, we suggest that selection exerted by prey, predators, and/or mates is likely to influence the maintenance of the polymorphism observed in S. globosum. © 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 113, 368–383.  aPublisher supplied data 3aThomisidae 3abirds 3acolor 3ahoney bees 3amorphs 3aphenotype 3apredators 3areproduction1 aReader, Tom0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g2014 Oct., v. 113, no. 2 p.368-383dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bij.123383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02932naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011400164300001100278520189200289592002802181650001202209650001902221650001402240650002002254650001002274650002202284650001302306650001102319650000902330700002602339700002202365773010302387856008302490852000902573655001202582IND60767680220221121022252.0220922e202212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076768022DNAL7 a10.1186/s12863-021-01021-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsman, Noha10aExploring the effects of genetic variation on gene regulation in cancer in the context of 3D genome structure  ap. 13.  aBACKGROUND: Numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted to date revealed genetic variants associated with various diseases, including breast and prostate cancers. Despite the availability of these large-scale data, relatively few variants have been functionally characterized, mainly because the majority of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) map to the non-coding regions of the human genome. The functional characterization of these non-coding variants and the identification of their target genes remain challenging. RESULTS: In this communication, we explore the potential functional mechanisms of non-coding SNPs by integrating GWAS with the high-resolution chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data for breast and prostate cancers. We show that more genetic variants map to regulatory elements through the 3D genome structure than the 1D linear genome lacking physical chromatin interactions. Importantly, the association of enhancers, transcription factors, and their target genes with breast and prostate cancers tends to be higher when these regulatory elements are mapped to high-risk SNPs through spatial interactions compared to simply using a linear proximity. Finally, we demonstrate that topologically associating domains (TADs) carrying high-risk SNPs also contain gene regulatory elements whose association with cancer is generally higher than those belonging to control TADs containing no high-risk variants. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that many SNPs may contribute to the cancer development by affecting the expression of certain tumor-related genes through long-range chromatin interactions with gene regulatory elements. Integrating large-scale genetic datasets with the 3D genome structure offers an attractive and unique approach to systematically investigate the functional mechanisms of genetic variants in disease risk and progression.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreasts 3acarcinogenesis 3achromatin 3adata collection 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3agenomics 3ahumans 3arisk1 aShawky, Abd-El-Monsif1 aBrylinski, Michal0 tBMC genomic data.g2022 Dec., v. 23, no. 1 p.13-13dBioMed CentralwJournal:27685x2730-68447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12863-021-01021-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245014400161300001300305500001500318520174900333592002802082650002402110650001902134650001402153650001502167650002202182650002202204650002202226650002202248650002302270650001702293650001302310650001402323653002602337700002002363700001802383700001602401700001602417700001402433773010202447856007302549852000902622655001202631IND60480599920221121054904.0160128e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048059992DNAL7 a10.1111/acv.122192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacpherson, M.

The spread of disease through naive native populations will depend on both demographic and disease parameters, as well as on habitat suitability and connectivity. Using the potential spread of squirrelpox virus (SQPV) on the Isle of Arran as a case study, we develop mathematical models to examine the impact of an emerging disease on a population in a complex landscape of different habitat types. Furthermore, by considering a range of disease parameters, we infer more generally how complex landscapes interact with disease characteristics to determine the spread and persistence of disease. Specific findings indicate that a SQPV outbreak on Arran is likely to be short lived and localized to the point of introduction allowing recovery of red squirrels to pre‐infection densities; this has important consequences for the conservation of red squirrels. More generally, we find that the extent of disease spread is dependent on the rare passage of infection through poor quality corridors connecting good quality habitats. Acute, highly transmissible infectious diseases are predicted to spread rapidly causing high mortality. Nonetheless, the disease typically fades out following local epidemics and is not supported in the long term. A chronic infectious disease is predicted to spread more slowly but can remain endemic in the population. This allows the disease to spread more extensively in the long term as it increases the chance of spread between poorly connected populations. Our results highlight how a detailed understanding of landscape connectivity is crucial when considering conservation strategies to protect native species from disease threats.  aPublisher supplied data 3amathematical models 3adisease models 3asquirrels 3alandscapes 3aemerging diseases 3awildlife diseases 3adisease outbreaks 3aSquirrelpox virus 3aindigenous species 3acase studies 3ahabitats 3amortality 0aSquirrel parapoxvirus1 aDavidson, R.

The feedstock was a real municipal waste sample received from a local waste treatment plant. Shredded into small particles, it contained a high amount of moisture (51.2%) and ash (17.4%). A pilot-scale intermediate pyrolysis system was used to process the material. The process mass balance showed that the yield pyrolysis oil was 10.6%. GC-MS and FTIR experiments showed that the accelerated aging (80 °C for 24 hours) did not cause an obvious change in the liquid chemical composition, but led to a significant reduction in the solids and moisture contents. The dynamic viscosity tests demonstrated that the intermediate pyrolysis oil derived from OFMSW is a non-Newtonian fluid. The dynamic viscosity of the pyrolysis oil reduced with the increase of temperature or shear rate, which can be modelled by WLF function and the Carreau model, respectively. A shear rate-temperature superposition method was proposed to construct the viscosity master curve at a wide range of shear rate, where WLF function was employed to model the shear rate-temperature shift factor. The accelerated aging caused an obvious reduction in dynamic viscosity, resulting from the decomposition of the semisolid organic agglomerates in the solids content during the aging of the OFMSW intermediate pyrolysis oil. The relatively high viscosity and reduced viscosity after aging of the OFMSW pyrolysis oil has indicated its potential for application as a substitute of the light fraction in the bitumen for road construction.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aaccelerated aging 3abitumen 3achemical composition 3afeedstocks 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aliquids 3amodels 3amunicipal solid waste 3apyrolysis 3apyrolysis oils 3aroad construction 3atemperature 3aviscosity 3awaste treatment 0aOrganic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) 0aIntermediate pyrolysis 0aPyrolysis oil 0aAging 0aDynamic viscosity 0aViscosity master curve 0aBio-bitumen1 aZhang, Yuqing1 aOmairey, Eman1 aCai, Junmeng1 aGufan,1 aBridgwater, A.

The accumulated anomalies of monthly precipitation and temperature records were analyzed and the trends in the climate variables were identified and quantified for two historical periods. The precipitation trends are in almost all cases not significant while the temperature shows statistically significant increasing tendencies especially in summer. A clear changing point around the 80s and at the end of the 90s was identified by the accumulated anomalies of the minimum and maximum temperature, respectively. The gradual increase of the temperature over the area is confirmed by the climate model projections, at short&mdash;(2016&ndash;2035), medium&mdash;(2046&ndash;2065) and long-term (2081&ndash;2100), provided by an ensemble of 13 RCMs, under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). All the models agree that the mean temperature will rise over this century, with the highest increases in the warm season. The total annual rainfall is not expected to significantly vary in the future although systematic changes are present in some months: a decrease in April and July and an increase in November. The daily temperature projections of the RCMs were used to identify potential variations in the characteristics of the heat waves; an increase of their frequency is expected over this century.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate change 3aclimate models 3aclimatic factors 3aheat 3arain 3asummer 3atemperature 3awarm season 3aItaly1 aTanda, Maria Giovanna,1 aTodaro, Valeria0 tWater.g2018 July 25, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100809783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02916naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013000168300001600298520140900314592002801723650001101751650001501762650001501777650001301792650001201805650002501817650000901842650002501851650001601876650003301892650001001925650001601935650001501951650001101966650002501977653001302002653001402015653001602029653001202045653001502057653002702072700001602099700001702115700001502132700001302147700001902160773011302179856008502292852000902377655001202386IND60634707720221118120041.0190325e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063470772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.2062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Kangning10aRecovery of ammonium and phosphate from urine as value-added fertilizer using wood waste biochar loaded with magnesium oxides  ap. 205-214.  aSustainability in waste and wastewater treatment is currently drawing extensive attention. This study employed magnesium-oxides-modified biochar (Mg-biochar) yielded from wood waste to recover ammonium and phosphate from human urine. The Mg-biochar demonstrated high removal capacities of ammonium and phosphate, reaching 47.5 mgN/g and 116.4 mgP/g, respectively. Particularly, the removal capacity of ammonium was higher than those of many other carbon-based absorbents. Process mechanisms were discussed by analyzing the chemical composition of nutrient-enriched biochar (NBC), and the adsorption kinetics and isotherms. The struvite precipitation on the biochar surface was the dominant mechanism in the removal of both ammonium and phosphate, whereas the surface adsorption of phosphate also played a role in phosphate removal. The NBC presented competitive effects on growths of maize and ryegrass as a commercial fertilizer diammonium phosphate in pot experiments. However, the relatively low concentration of phosphate in the urine limited the removal efficiency of ammonium to only 1%, although most phosphates were removed. As such, another treatment unit should be combined for the complete removal of ammonium. Results indicated that Mg-biochar from wood waste can effectively remove phosphate from urine while recovering ammonium and phosphate as a biochar-based nutrient-enriched fertilizer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLolium 3aabsorbents 3aadsorption 3aammonium 3abiochar 3achemical composition 3acorn 3adiammonium phosphate 3afertilizers 3amagnesium ammonium phosphate 3aurine 3avalue added 3awaste wood 3awastes 3awastewater treatment 0aAmmonium 0aPhosphate 0aHuman urine 0aBiochar 0aAdsorption 0aStruvite precipitation1 aLin, Fangyu1 aDou, Xiaomin1 aZheng, Min1 aTan, Wei1 aWang, Chengwen0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.205-214dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.2063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02795naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013900164500001900303520130800322592002801630650003201658650001601690650001101706650001901717650002501736650001401761650003101775650001401806650001301820650001201833653004101845653004001886653002501926653001801951700001301969700001901982700002702001700002502028700002102053700002502074700002102099773011402120856008202234852000902316655001202325IND60734787820221121004446.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073478782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2021.1130542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Dengyun10aDevelopment and qualification of a fast, high-throughput and robust imaging-based neutralization assay for respiratory syncytial virus  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common pathogen causing severe respiratory illness in infants and elder adults. The development of an effective RSV vaccine is an important unmet medical need and an area of active research. The traditional method for testing neutralizing antibodies against RSV in clinical trials is the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), which uses 24-well plates and needs several days post infection to develop viral plaques. In this study, we have developed a virus reduction neutralization test (VRNT), which allows the number of RSV infected cells to be automatically counted by an imaging cytometer at one day post infection in 96-well plates. VRNT was found robust to cell seeding density, detection antibody concentration, virus input and infection time. By testing twenty human sera, we have shown good correlation between VRNT50 and PRNT50 titers for multiple RSV strains: A2, Long and 18537 (serotype B). To understand the VRNT performance, eight human serum samples with high, medium and low neutralization titers were selected for VRNT qualification. We have demonstrated that VRNT had good specificity, precision, linearity and relative accuracy. In conclusion, VRNT is a better alternative to PRNT in serum neutralization test for RSV vaccine candidates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRespiratory syncytial virus 3ablood serum 3ahumans 3aneutralization 3aneutralization tests 3apathogens 3arespiratory tract diseases 3aserotypes 3avaccines 3aviruses 0aPlaque reduction neutralization test 0aVirus reduction neutralization test 0aDesign of Experiment 0aQualification1 aHsu, Amy1 aBogardus, Leah1 aRubinstein, Leonard J.1 aAntonello, Joseph M.1 aGurney, Kevin B.1 aWhiteman, Melissa C.1 aDellatore, Shara0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2021 July, v. 494 p.113054-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12466x0022-17597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2021.1130543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03829naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100004100147245019000188500001900378520177000397592002802167650002402195650001502219650001502234650002402249650001902273650002102292650000902313650001102322650000802333650001802341650001802359650000902377650002402386653002802410653001502438653004502453653004302498653000902541653000802550653000902558653001002567653001102577653000902588653000902597653000902606653001002615653001002625653001002635653000702645653000702652653000802659700001802667700002402685700001802709700003202727700002602759700002502785700002402810700001602834700002702850700003702877773011402914856008203028852000903110655001203119IND60734787920221121015702.0210603e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073478792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jim.2021.1130572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMortensen, Winnie Charlotte Pedersen14aThe effect of pre-analytical handling on the stability of fractalkine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1), interleukin 6 and interleukin 8 in samples of human cerebrospinal fluid  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCytokine networks in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are important to our understanding of several neuroinflammatory diseases. Knowledge about optimal handling of samples is limited but important to minimize bias and reduce costs in CSF biomarker studies. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of storage temperature and time delay from CSF sample collection until freezing on the concentration of 11 different cytokines thought to be associated with chronic pain. CSF samples from 21 individuals undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia were divided between two tubes. One tube was stored and centrifuged (within 30 min) at room temperature, and one tube was stored in ice water and centrifuged (within 30 min) at 4 °C. Each tube was split into six vials that were frozen at −80 °C, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 h after collection. Cytokines were analyzed using a multiplex panel. A random effect panel data regression was conducted for each biomarker including the variables of storage temperature until freezing and time delay. Four cytokines had detectable levels: Fractalkine, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1(MCP-1), interleukine 6 (IL-6), and interleukine 8 (IL-8). There was no significant effect of storage temperature and time delay on MCP-1, IL-6, or IL-8 concentrations. Fractalkine concentration showed no clear trend. No concentration differences were observed between samples kept in ice water and those at room temperature except at the 3-h time point, and there was no overall significant effect of time delay on fractalkine concentration. We found no clear effect of storage temperature and time delay up to five hours from sample collection until freezing on the CSF concentrations of fractalkine, MCP-1, IL-6, or IL-8.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aanesthesia 3abiomarkers 3acerebrospinal fluid 3achemokine CCL2 3achemokine CX3CL1 3ahips 3ahumans 3aice 3ainterleukin-6 3ainterleukin-8 3apain 3astorage temperature 0aPre-analytical handling 0aTime delay 0aCX3CL1 (C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1) 0aCCL-2 (C–C motif chemokine ligand 2) 0aBDNF 0aCSF 0aGDPR 0aHMGB1 0aIL-1β 0aIL-4 0aIL-6 0aIL-8 0aIL-10 0aIL-18 0aMCP-1 0aMS 0aRT 0aTNF1 aBendix, Laila1 aJensen, Hanne Irene1 aVarnum, Claus1 aRasmussen, Lasse Enkebølle1 aLauridsen, Jørgen T.1 aBorbye-Lorenzen, Nis1 aSkogstrand, Kristin1 aToft, Palle1 aVaegter, Henrik Bjarke1 aBlichfeldt-Eckhardt, Morten Rune0 tJournal of immunological methods.g2021 July, v. 494 p.113057-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12466x0022-17597nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jim.2021.1130573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02751naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245014300165300001600308520170600324592002802030650001302058650002102071650001902092653003102111653002202142653001702164653002402181653001702205773012402222852000902346856008202355655001202437IND4451499320221120224617.0200513e20110401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445149932DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-010-0214-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkada, Yasuhiko10aShear behaviour in numerical triaxial compression tests by 3D fluid-coupled DEM: a fundamental study on mechanisms of landslide initiation  ap. 116-127.  aShear behaviour in triaxial compression tests was numerically examined by 3D fluid-coupled DEM in a fundamental study on the mechanisms of landslide initiation. Changes in pore-water pressure because of undrained compression were calculated by introducing a measurement sphere surrounding a ball which represented the soil particles. The pore-water pressure was assigned to the measurement sphere as the product of the changes in volumetric strain and modulus of compressibility of water, and resulting flow due to the pressure differences among neighbouring measurement spheres was given on the basis of Darcy's law. Specimens for the numerical triaxial compression tests were prepared with wide ranges of initial void ratio by use of samples with three different grain-size distributions. In the loose specimens, positive pore-water pressure build-up and subsequent liquefaction were numerically reproduced. In contrast, in the dense specimens, negative pore-water pressure was observed, showing upgrade of soil structure. For the medium specimens, phase transformation, which is a typical characteristic of granular soils, was successfully reproduced. Although steady-state lines were found for each sample on a diagram, there was a gap at a specific initial void ratio. Although the angles of internal friction were inversely proportional to the initial void ratio in both the undrained and drained tests in the medium to dense specimens, the observed angles of internal friction were smaller than the particle-to-particle friction angle. This result may be attributable to the fact that the balls could not form the complicated soil structures created in reality by particles with complex shapes.  aPublisher supplied data 3afriction 3aphase transition 3asoil structure 0aAngle of internal friction 0aFluid-coupled DEM 0aInterlocking 0aPore-water pressure 0aSteady state0 tJournal of forest research.g2011 Apr. 1, v. 16, no. 2 p.116-127dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-010-0214-93Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02654naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001800171245010700189300001600296520104500312592002801357650002101385650002101406650002401427650002001451650001901471650001201490650001001502650001601512650001201528650002201540650005101562650004501613650002301658650002201681650001001703650002301713650002501736653001201761653001901773653002701792653001901819653002301838700002001861700001801881700002301899773010601922856008702028852000902115655001202124IND50062735720221118020034.0190409e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006273572DNAL7 a234532342pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2012.12.1862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCusola, Oriol10aApplication of surface enzyme treatments using laccase and a hydrophobic compound to paper-based media  ap. 521-526.  aA new approach for the hydrophobization of finished cellulosic substrates based on a previously reported enzymatic technique is proposed. Commercial finished paper was hydrophobized by using laccase from Trametes villosa in combination with lauryl gallate (LG) as hydrophobic compound. The efficiency of the method was increased by the use of a lignosulfonate as a natural dispersant to improve the surface distribution of LG on the paper, raise its hydrophobicity and help preserve the enzyme activity. No similar threefold effect from a single compound for the improvement of enzymatic treatments was previously reported. The influence of processing conditions including the LG dose, treatment time and temperature was also examined, resulting in further increased hydrophobicity. Efficient fiber bonding and chemical functionalization were confirmed by thorough washing and Soxhlet extraction of the paper. As shown here for the first time, enzyme treatments have the potential to improve the surface hydrophobicity of paper-based media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrametes villosa 3achemical bonding 3aenzymatic treatment 3aenzyme activity 3ahydrophobicity 3alaccase 3apaper 3atemperature 3awashing 2aEnzyme Activation 2aGallic Acidxanalogs & derivativesxchemistry. 2aHydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions 2aLaccasexchemistry 2aMaterials Testing 2aPaper 2aSurface Properties 2aTrametesxenzymology 0aLaccase 0aHydrophobicity 0aCellulose paper sheets 0aLauryl gallate 0aNatural dispersant1 aValls, Cristina1 aVidal, Teresa1 aRoncero, M.

In the first year, the vegetative characters of the cultivars were measured, whereas the yield and the growth rate were both determined in the second year. The yields of ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Fuji’ varieties were 2.38 and 3.88 kg, with average fruit weights of 173.71 g and 136.76 g, respectively. The concentrations of soluble solids, an important quality attribute, were 11.2% and 12.9% for ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Fuji’, respectively. Titratable acidity, which indicates the maturity of the fruit and specifies the market suitability, was found to be 0.37% in ‘Granny Smith’ and 0.52% in ‘Fuji’. Although some properties differed between these cultivars, the firmness of both cultivars was the same, with a value of 6.6 libre. Although both varieties have a double sigmoid vegetative growth, ‘Granny Smith’’s vegetative growth was relatively better than that of ‘Fuji’, whereas ‘Fuji’ had a higher productivity. However, for precise evaluation of yields, the period of economical production is required. Preliminary results of morphological, phenological, and pomological tests showed that the varieties ‘Granny Smith’ and ‘Fuji’ grafted onto dwarf rootstocks have a potential for increased production in the Van region of Eastern Turkey.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTurkey (country) 3aapples 3acultivars 3afirmness 3afruits 3agrowth performance 3amarkets 3aphenology 3atitratable acidity 3avegetative growth1 aTAŞ, Teyar M.1 aMURADOĞLU, Ferhat0 tNotulae botanicae Horti Agrobotanici Cluj-Napoca.g2011 May, v. 39, no. 1 p.246-250dAcademicPreswJournal:21431x1842-43097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.15835/nbha39156163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245010100158520160200259592002801861650003801889650002101927650002101948650001601969650002301985650001902008650002602027650002002053650001102073650002502084650001502109650001302124650001802137651001702155700001902172700001102191700001702202700002102219773011902240856007302359852000902432655001202441IND60653377820221119065700.0190714e20180816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337782DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Huimeng10aEstimating Evapotranspiration of Processing Tomato under Plastic Mulch Using the SIMDualKc Model  aAccurate estimation of crop evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for agricultural water resource management and proper irrigation scheduling. The 2-year field experimental data of processing tomato under plastic-mulched drip and basin irrigation in the Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao), located in the upper reaches of the Yellow river, were used to calibrate and validate the SIMDualKc model. The model adopted the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) dual K<inf>c</inf> method for partitioning ET into plant transpiration and soil evaporation. The results showed a good agreement between soil water observations and simulations throughout the growing seasons with a low error estimate and high model efficiency. The calibrated basal potential crop coefficients for the initial stage, mid-season stage, and late stage were 0.30, 0.92, and 0.60, respectively. ET during the two growing seasons was in the range of 284&ndash;331 mm for basin irrigation and 266&ndash;310 mm for drip irrigation. The average soil evaporation accounted for 5% of ET in 2015 and 14% of ET in 2016 for drip irrigation treatments, while it accounted for 4% and 13% of ET for basin irrigation treatments in the two experimental years, indicating that transpiration was the dominant component of ET of processing tomato under plastic mulch in Hetao. The highest water productivity was obtained from the drip irrigation treatment. The SIMDualKc model is an appropriate tool to estimate crop ET and may be further used to improve local irrigation scheduling for processing tomato in the upper reaches of the Yellow river.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFood and Agriculture Organization 3abasin irrigation 3acrop coefficient 3aevaporation 3aevapotranspiration 3agrowing season 3airrigation scheduling 3amicroirrigation 3amodels 3aplastic film mulches 3asoil water 3atomatoes 3atranspiration 3aYellow River1 aHuang, Guanhua1 aXu, Xu1 aXiong, Yunwu1 aHuang, Quanzhong0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 16, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02330naa a2200241 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001800153245009300171300001600264520150200280592002801782650001901810650001601829700002001845773012001865852000901985856008201994655001202076991620946720742620221121045229.0181030e197410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7490967722DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517574044010152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimpson, Jack13aAn Analysis of Carding Efficiency and Processing Performance of Cotton /Polyester Blends  ap. 813-822.  aThe effect of various levels of cotton and polyester fibers blended during opening and picking on carding efficiency and processing performance was investigated. The cotton was middling grade, 1 1/16-in. staple length, and 4.2 micronaire reading; the polyester was high modulus, 1.5 in. long, and 1.5 denier. As the percent polyester in the blend increased, compression recovery increased moderately and shear friction appreciably. The increase in friction offset the increase in compression recovery so that cylinder load, fiber hooks, and card sliver variability increased with greater polyester content. However, as the polyester content increased, the increase in fiber friction and length uniformity improved drafting efficiency so that second drawing sliver and yarn uniformity improved. Increasing the polyester content of a blend did not improve yarn grade; high cotton content blends had the same grade as high polyester content blends. At constant end breakage, production in spinning increased rapidly to a 65c/35p blend; additional increases in polyster resulted in only slight improvements in spinning efficiency. Very little polyester was lost in the carding waste even with close flat-to-cylinder settings (0.010 in.), which no doubt provided better carding action on the cotton component in the blend than do settings commonly used. However, it is possible that this close a setting for high percentage polyester blends might cause excessive cylinder loading under mill conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aplant products 3afield crops1 aFiori, Louis A.0 tTextile research journal.g1974 Oct., v. 44, no. 10 p.813-822dSage PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x0040-51757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0040517574044010153Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02980naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002200157245007400179300001400253520158400267592002801851650001201879650001201891650001301903650001501916650001101931650001501942650001601957650002101973650001501994650001802009650001502027650001102042650001302053650001002066651001402076653001502090653001802105653001602123653001602139653001202155653002802167700002002195700002702215700002002242773011102262856009202373852000902465655001202474IND60536695220221119143711.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolhjou, Aliakbar10aSoil translocation by narrow openers with various bent leg geometries  ap. 41-49.  aNo-till farmers in Australia often use narrow point openers to place seed and fertiliser in furrows in conjunction with the spraying of pre-emergence herbicides. These openers can produce excessive soil throw which creates problems such as increasing the depth of soil cover on adjacent furrows, herbicide contamination above seed in adjacent furrows, increased stimulation of weed seed germination and furrow moisture loss. This study evaluated the effect of a range of bent leg narrow opener geometries on soil movement when operating at 120 mm depth and 8.2 kmh−1. Results showed that a bent leg opener geometry combined with a chamfered face could loosen a furrow without throwing soil laterally out of the furrow due to the shank being offset (bent) away from the central upheaval of soil. The bent leg openers were also able to loosen soil with minimal mixing of soil layers. Increasing the shank offset from the furrow centre reduced the surface soil interaction with the vertical shank section operating in the furrow. Decreasing the side bend angle from 65° to 45° reduced surface tracer lateral movement. Adding a leading foot to a bent leg opener reduced the loosened cross sectional area by 13% due to the shallower engagement of the side-leg portion. These findings have implications for optimising no-till seeding practises through better control of soil throw, aiming to: reduce weed seed germination and soil moisture loss, enable narrower row spacing options, the safer use of pre-emergence herbicides incorporated when seeding and higher operating speeds.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarmers 3afurrows 3ageometry 3aherbicides 3amixing 3ano-tillage 3arow spacing 3aseed germination 3asoil depth 3asoil movement 3asoil water 3asowing 3aspraying 3aweeds 3aAustralia 0aSoil throw 0aOpener design 0aSoil mixing 0aSeed furrow 0aNo till 0aPre-emergence herbicide1 aFielke, John M.1 aDesbiolles, Jacky M.A.1 aSaunders, Chris0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Nov., v. 127 p.41-49dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245017300159300001400332500002000346520169400366592002802060650001902088650001102107650002002118650002402138650001402162650001302176650001302189650002602202650001402228650000902242650004202251650003002293650001102323650001802334650001402352650001202366650001302378700002402391700001902415700002302434773011802457856007302575852000902648655001202657IND60587842120221120144402.0180102e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058784212DNAL7 a10.1111/are.128632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLyons, Philip P10aExploring the microbial diversity of the distal intestinal lumen and mucosa of farmed rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) using next generation sequencing (NGS)  ap. 77-91.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aIn this study, next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to survey the 16S rRNA ribotypes of the distal intestinal lumen and mucosal epithelium of farmed rainbow trout. This approach yielded a library consisting of 2 979 715 quality filtered paired sequences, assigned to genus level of taxonomy using the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP). A high level of diversity was observed in both regions. A total of 90 bacterial genera were identified in the lumen of all fish sampled, compared with 159 in the mucosa. The allochthonous microflora was dominated by sequences belonging to the γ Proteobacteria (mean sequence abundance 54.3%), in particular the Enterobacteriaceae, with Yersinia, Serratia, Hafnia and Obesumbacterium the most abundant genera. Fewer γ Proteobacteria (mean sequence abundance 37%) were present in the mucosa, and autochthonous communities consisted of a more even split among the bacterial classes, with increases in sequences assigned to members of the β Proteobacteria (mean sequence abundance 18.4%) and Bacilli (mean sequence abundance 16.8%). The principal bacterial genera recorded in the mucosa were Cetobacterium, Yersinia, Ralstonia, Hafnia and Carnobacterium. The results of this study demonstrate that the luminal and mucosal bacterial communities may be different in their respective structures, and that the mucosal microflora of rainbow trout may be more diverse than previous research has suggested. This research also demonstrated a degree of conservation of bacterial genera between individual fish sampled, and is to the author's knowledge the first time the MiSeq® NGS platform has been used to explore the rainbow trout intestinal microflora.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarnobacterium 3aHafnia 3aObesumbacterium 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aRalstonia 3aSerratia 3aYersinia 3abacterial communities 3adatabases 3afish 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amucosa 3aribosomal RNA 3aribotypes 3asurveys 3ataxonomy1 aTurnbull, James F.,1 aDawson, Karl A1 aCrumlish, Margaret0 tAquaculture research.g2017 Jan., v. 48, no. 1 p.77-91dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.128633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02983naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014000164300001600304520163400320592002801954650002001982650002402002650001502026650000902041650002402050650003702074650002202111650001802133650001702151650001102168650001602179650002402195650002202219650002002241650003202261650001002293651001702303651001002320700001902330773009802349856008102447852000902528655001202537IND50089800720221119053155.0150215e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008980072DNAL7 a10.1007/s11295-014-0716-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMora, Freddy10aBayesian estimation of genetic parameters for growth, stem straightness, and survival in Eucalyptus globulus on an Andean Foothill site  ap. 711-719.  aKnowledge of the genetic variation of key economic traits in Eucalyptus globulus under cold conditions is crucial to the genetic improvement of environmental tolerances and other economic traits. A Bayesian analysis of genetic parameters for quantitative traits was carried out in 37 E. globulus open-pollinated families under cold conditions in southern Chile. The trial is located in the Andean foothills, in the Province of Bío-Bío. The Bayesian approach was performed using Gibbs sampling algorithm. Multi-trait linear and threshold models were fitted to phenotypic data (growth traits, survival, and stem straightness). Fifteen years after planting, height, diameter at breast height, and stem volume were found to be weakly to moderately heritable with Bayesian credible intervals (probability of 90 %): [Formula: see text] = 0.009–0.102, [Formula: see text] = 0.031–0.185, and [Formula: see text] = 0.045–0.205, respectively. Stem straightness was found to be weakly to moderately heritable ranging from 0.032 to 0.208 (Bayesian 90 % credible interval); posterior mode [Formula: see text] = 0.091. Tree survival at age of 15 years was high in the trial (84.8 %) with such heritability values ranging from 0.072 to 0.157. Survival was non-significantly genetically correlated to growth and stem straightness. Stem volume had the highest predicted genetic gains ranging from 17.9 to 23.7 % (selection rate of 15.8 and 8.3 %, respectively). The results of this study confirm the potential for selective breeding of this eucalypt in areas of southern Chile where cold is a significant constraint.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aEucalyptus globulus 3aalgorithms 3acold 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3agenetic variation 3agrowth traits 3aheritability 3amodels 3aprobability 3aquantitative traits 3aselection methods 3astem elongation 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3aAndes region 3aChile1 aSerra, Nicolle0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2014 June, v. 10, no. 3 p.711-719dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-014-0716-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02927naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094024003600133040001800169100002500187245011000212300001600322506011700338506007600455506003100531520109600562592002801658596004301686596003901729596003501768506003701803650001101840650001101851650001501862650001501877650001701892653002901909653002601938653002101964653001901985700006002004700002202064700002302086700002702109700006102136700002102197773009702218856008302315961001402398852000902412655001202421IND60761102720221215143332.0220704e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rala.2021.12.0072chorus7 a10.1016/j.rala.2021.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCreutzburg, Megan K.12aA geographic strategy for cross-jurisdictional, proactive management of invasive annual grasses in Oregon  ap. 173-180.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  a•Invasive annual grasses pose a widespread threat to western rangelands, and a strategic and proactive approach is needed to tackle this problem.•Oregon partners used new spatial data to develop a geographic strategy for management of invasive annual grasses at landscape scales across jurisdictional boundaries.

To elucidate the molecular basis of β-carotene accumulation in M. charantia, the gene expression levels of phytoene synthase (McPSY) and phytoene desaturase (McPDS) were determined. These levels were particularly high in the flowers of M. charantia. During fruit maturation, the expression levels of McPSY and McPDS decreased during the mid-stages but increased in the fully mature fruit. In addition, carotenoids accumulated as the peel changed from green to orange. Thus, McPSY and McPDS expression correlated with carotenoid accumulation during fruit maturation. Principal component analysis (PCA) also was used to evaluate the differences among the profiles of seven carotenoids identified in the fruit at several maturation stages. Riper fruits had higher carotenoid concentrations than less ripe fruits.  aPublisher supplied data 3afruits 3aprincipal component analysis 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenes 3acarotenoids 3aMomordica charantia 3acarrots 3aphytoene synthase 0aplants1 aKim, Chae-gwang,1 aPark, Nam Il1 aLee, Sook Young1 aPark, Sang Un0 tFood chemistry.g2011 June 15, v. 126, no. 4 p.1686-1692dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01165naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245021900169300001600388520021600404592002800620650001600648650001600664650001200680700002000692773009700712856008100809852000900890655001200899IND60573989120221122221221.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10228-016-0531-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakayama, Naohide10aMesovagus, a replacement name for the grenadier genus Mesobius Hubbs and Iwamoto 1977 (Actinopterygii: Gadiformes: Macrouridae), a junior homonym of Mesobius Chamberlin 1951 (Chilopoda: Lithobiomorpha: Lithobiidae)  ap. 120-122.  aA replacement name, Mesovagus nom. nov., is proposed for the grenadier genus Mesobius Hubbs and Iwamoto 1977, which is preoccupied by Mesobius Chamberlin 1951 in lithobiid centipedes (Chilopoda: Lithobiomorpha).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLithobiidae 3aMacrouridae 3ahomonym1 aEndo, Hiromitsu0 tIchthyological research.g2017 Jan., v. 64, no. 1 p.120-122dSpringer Japanx1341-89987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10228-016-0531-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200349 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024003600099040001800135100001600153245013000169300001600299520070100315592002801016650001901044650001601063653001801079653000901097653002401106653001901130653003501149653003901184653002201223653001501245653001401260700001601274773012001290852000901410856008201419655001201501991620946810742620221121061733.0181030e197312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7392311982DNAL7 a10.1177/0040517573043012112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSegal, Leon10aConcerning the Restoration by Resin Stripping of the Tensile Properties of Cotton Fabric Finished with Dimethylolethyleneurea  ap. 748-752.  aResin stripping of treated cotton fabric (removal of resin by acid hydrolysis) was investigated by measurements of textile properties, by viscometry, and by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC). Breaking strengths and elongations- at-break, which were reduced by treatment with dimethylolethyleneurea (DMEU), were partially restored by resin stripping. The acid-catalyzed treatment of the fabric with the substituted urea substantially reduced the degree of polymerization (DP) of the cotton cellulose; resin stripping further reduced the DP.

Plant roots, in particular in grafted agricultural crops, can function as a boundary against external stresses in order to maintain plant fitness. However, limited information exists for salinity stress responses of woody species and their rootstocks. Pistachio (Pistacia spp.) is a tree nut crop with relatively high salinity tolerance as well as high genetic heterogeneity. In this study, we used a microscopy‐based approach to investigate the cellular and structural responses to salinity stress in the roots of two pistachio rootstocks, Pistacia integerrima (PGI) and a hybrid, P. atlantica x P. integerrima (UCB1). We analyzed root sections via fluorescence microscopy across a developmental gradient, defined by xylem development, for sodium localization and for cellular barrier differentiation via suberin deposition. Our cumulative data suggest that the salinity response in pistachio rootstock species is associated with both vacuolar sodium ion (Na⁺) sequestration in the root cortex and increased suberin deposition at apoplastic barriers. Furthermore, both vacuolar sequestration and suberin deposition correlate with the root developmental gradient. We observed a higher rate of Na⁺ vacuolar sequestration and reduced salt‐induced leaf damage in UCB1 when compared to P. integerrima. In addition, UCB1 displayed higher basal levels of suberization, in both the exodermis and endodermis, compared to P. integerrima. This difference was enhanced after salinity stress. These cellular characteristics are phenotypes that can be taken into account during screening for sodium‐mediated salinity tolerance in woody plant species.  aPublisher supplied data  aHC‐2017‐22cPistachio Board of CA  aHC‐2019‐21cPistachio Board of CA  aCA‐D‐PLS‐2132‐HcU.S. Department of Agriculture 3aPistacia 3acortex 3aendodermis 3afluorescence microscopy 3agenetic heterogeneity 3ahybrids 3aleaves 3apistachios 3arootstocks 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3asalt tolerance 3asodium 3astress tolerance 3asuberin 3asuberization 3avacuoles 3awoody plants 3axylem1 aQuartararo, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7021-34641 aBetz, Oliver Karl1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9979-23911 aMadahhosseini, Shahab1 aHeringer, Angelo Schuabb1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2723-73531 aLe, Thu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8629-53961 aShao, Yuhang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6234-28021 aCaruso, Tiziano1 aFerguson, Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9520-078X1 aJernstedt, Judy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0575-09381 aWilkop, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9066-55131 aDrakakaki, Georgia1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3949-86570 tPlant direct.g2021 May, v. 5, no. 5 p.e00315-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.3153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100001900157245016600176300001400342520149300356592002801849650002001877650001501897650002001912650002401932650001101956650001401967650001401981650002801995650002402023650002402047650002602071650000902097650001002106650002002116653003102136653001802167653000802185653002202193653001902215653001402234700002002248700005702268700001802325700005802343700001702401773011102418856009202529852000902621655001202630IND60536695520221119143820.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetrů, Michal10aFinite element method model of the mechanical behaviour of Jatropha curcas L. bulk seeds under compression loading: Study and 2D modelling of the damage to seeds  ap. 50-66.  aThis article is focused on comprehensive research of a pressing process of Jatropha curcas L. bulk seeds during linear compression. Compression experiments were performed and the strain and brittle fracturing of the seeds visualised. The mechanical behaviour and stress distribution at the volumetric strain of bulk seeds in pressing cylinders and semi-cylinders with diameters of 60, 80 and 100 mm were described by 2D FEM models. It has been determined that the study of nonlinear visco-elastic and plastic strain seed interactions and the damage and crack growth in such seeds can be significantly improved through computer simulations using an explicit FEM algorithm. In this study, the compressibility of ripe J. curcas L. bulk seeds was analysed and compared depending on the volume strain and energy performance of the linear pressing process. Empirical equations and differential deformation theory describing the seeds interacting beyond the oil point were reported. In addition, the issue of contact theory in numerical modelling of the point contact of interacting seeds was also described. Statistical results showed that the 2D FEM model can be used to study the volumetric strain, stress and damage of J. curcas L. bulk seeds. These studies suggest that FEM models may be considered an important tool to assess the energy performance of the pressing process of J. curcas bulk seeds and can provide valuable information for the design and optimisation of pressing equipment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aJatropha curcas 3aalgorithms 3acompressibility 3acomputer simulation 3aenergy 3aequations 3aequipment 3afinite element analysis 3amathematical models 3amathematical theory 3amechanical properties 3aoils 3aseeds 3aviscoelasticity 0aLinear compression loading 0aVisualisation 0aFEM 0aVolumetric strain 0aSuperstructure 0aBiodiesel1 aNovák, Ondřej1 aHerák, David1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0097-60091 aMašín, Ivan1 aLepšík, Petr1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1900-72641 aHrabě, Petr0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Nov., v. 127 p.50-66dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.08.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04234naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149100002900167245008800196300001600284520175200300592002802052650001202080650001302092650002502105650001502130650002502145650001902170650002202189650001402211650001402225650002302239650001102262650002102273650002702294650000902321650002602330650001102356650001002367650003202377650004102409650004502450650001202495650006102507650004902568650003302617650004502650650003002695650007302725650005702798650002702855650004602882650002402928650002402952650003702976650000903013650003503022650001703057650005103074650000903125650002503134650003203159700002203191700003103213700002303244700002603267773009003293856008403383852000903467655001203476IND4470760020221122205845.0141112e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447076002DNAL7 a226523742pmid7 a10.1016/j.nutres.2012.03.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChennasamudram, Sudha P.10aRenoprotective effects of (+)-catechin in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat model  ap. 347-356.  aDiabetic nephropathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus leading to end-stage renal disease. Oxidative stress and inflammation play a major role in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Green tea, known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to be renoprotective. We hypothesized that (+)-catechin (CTN), a component of green tea, is responsible for the renoprotection. Our investigation of the therapeutic potential of CTN in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats demonstrated for the first time that the effects of CTN treatment were comparable with the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) enalapril for the treatment of albumin excretion. After 12 weeks of CTN treatment with 35 mg/d in the drinking water, urinary albumin excretion and plasma creatinine concentrations in all the diabetic treatment groups were reduced, compared with the diabetic group with no treatment. Urine creatinine and creatinine clearance were higher in diabetic groups treated with CTN and ACEi compared with the diabetic group with no treatment. Endothelin 1, lipid peroxidation, concentration of alanine transferase enzyme, and expression of fibronectin were lower in all the treatment groups compared with the diabetic group with no treatment. Concentrations of free thiols were higher in the CTN-treated group compared with the diabetic rats with no treatment. Our findings suggest that CTN has renoprotective properties comparable with ACEi, and coadministration of CTN and enalapril might be useful in reducing albumin excretion as well as improving endothelial function. (+)-Catechin might be successfully used in the future for clinical situations where ACEi is poorly tolerated or contraindicated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3aalbumins 3aantioxidant activity 3acreatinine 3adiabetic nephropathy 3adrinking water 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aexcretion 3agreen tea 3alipid peroxidation 3amodels 3aoxidative stress 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arats 3arenoprotective effect 3athiols 3aurine 2aAlanine Transaminasexblood 2aAlbuminuriaxdrug therapyxetiology. 2aAngiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Inflammatory Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCamellia sinensisxchemistry 2aCatechinxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aCreatininexbloodxurine. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Experimentalxbloodxcomplicationsxdrug therapy. 2aDiabetic Nephropathiesxbloodxprevention & control. 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aEnalaprilxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aEndothelin-1xblood 2aFibronectinsxblood 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMale 2aOxidative Stressxdrug effects 2aPhytotherapy 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSulfhydryl Compoundsxblood1 aKudugunti, Shashi1 aBoreddy, Purushotham Reddy1 aMoridani, Majid Y.1 aVasylyeva, Tetyana L.0 tNutrition research.g2012 May, v. 32, no. 5 p.347-356dElsevier Inc.x0271-53177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2012.03.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02050naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003200139245010200171520103700273592002801310650001301338650002001351650001101371650001101382650001401393650002101407650001501428651001001443700002201453700001701475700001901492773011901511856007301630852000901703655001201712IND60653378220221119065931.0190714e20180817xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337822DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuñoz Barrachina, Enrique,10aCorrection of Precipitation Records through Inverse Modeling in Watersheds of South-Central Chile  aPrecipitation is the main input in the water balance of watersheds; therefore, correct estimates are necessary for water resources management and decision making. In south-central Chile there is a low density of precipitation gauges (~1 station/675 km2), most of which are located in low-altitude areas. The spatial distribution of precipitation is, therefore, not properly recorded. In this study an inverse modeling approach is used to estimate the extent to which precipitation amounts must be corrected. Using a lumped water balance model, a factor for correcting precipitation data is calculated for 41 watersheds located in south-central Chile. Then, based on a geo-statistical interpolation, a map for correcting the precipitation amounts is proposed and a validation of these corrections is achieved. The results show that in gently sloping areas, the precipitation records are more representative than in steep mountain areas. In addition, the higher the mountains, the less representative the precipitation records become.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3adecision making 3agauges 3amodels 3amountains 3awater management 3awatersheds 3aChile1 aAcuña, Mauricio,1 aLucero, Juan1 aRojas, Ignacio0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 17, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03637naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245007000168300001600238500001500254520163600269536017701905592002802082596007802110596006702188650001302255650001902268650001202287650001402299650001102313650001402324650001802338650001102356650001402367650002502381650002802406650001602434650001302450650002802463650001902491650002402510650001402534650001002548650001202558653002802570653002502598653003302623653001702656653001202673700001702685700002102702700002002723700001602743700002602759700002102785773011102806856008502917852000903002655001203011IND60614825520221118102303.0181002e20180903xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061482552DNAL7 a10.1080/03079457.2018.14882402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahar, Ehud10aNewcastle disease virus: is an updated attenuated vaccine needed?  ap. 467-478.  a2019-12-06  aNewcastle disease virus (NDV) is a major cause of infectious mortality and morbidity in poultry worldwide. It is an enveloped virus with two outer-membrane proteins—haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion protein (F)—that induce neutralizing antibodies. All NDV strains belong to one serotype. Yet, NDV vaccines, derived from genotype II, do not fully prevent infection or shedding of viruses from other genotypes. The aim of this study was to test if an updated vaccine is required. For this purpose, NDVs isolated from infected, albeit heavily vaccinated, flocks were genetically and immunologically characterized. Amino acid differences in F and HN protein sequences were identified between the vaccine strain and each of the isolates, some specifically at the neutralization sites. Whereas all tested isolates showed similar haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) titres, 100–100,000 times higher antibody-to-virus ratios were needed to neutralize viral propagation in embryos by the field isolates versus the vaccine strain. As a result, a model and an equation were developed to explain the phenomenon of escape in one-serotype viruses and to calculate the HI values needed for protection, depending on variation rate at key positions. In conclusion, to confer full protection against NDVs that differ from the vaccine strain at the neutralizing epitopes, very high levels of antibodies should be raised and maintained to compensate for the reduction in the number of effective epitopes; alternatively, an adjusted attenuated vaccine should be developed—a task made possible in the current era of reverse vaccinology.  aThis work was supported by the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Egg and Poultry Board [research grant no. 847-0387-14].  aPublisher supplied data  a847-0387-14cEgg and Poultry Boarddhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100009249  cMinistry of Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100004576 3aepitopes 3aneutralization 3aenzymes 3aequations 3aflocks 3amorbidity 3alive vaccines 3amodels 3aserotypes 3aamino acid sequences 3aAvian orthoavulavirus 1 3aamino acids 3agenotype 3aneutralizing antibodies 3aviral shedding 3avaccine development 3amortality 3abirds 3apoultry 0aNewcastle disease virus 0aneutralizing epitope 0ahaemagglutination inhibition 0avirus escape 0avaccine1 aHaddas, Ruth1 aGoldenberg, Dana1 aLublin, Avishai1 aBloch, Itai1 aBachner Hinenzon, Noa1 aPitcovski, Jacob0 tAvian pathology.g2018 Sept. 3, v. 47, no. 5 p.467-478dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl4833x1465-33387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2018.14882403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02661naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245015800170300001600328520156800344592002801912653002501940653001301965653003201978653002502010653002702035700005402062700001402116700001802130773010302148856008702251852000902338655001202347IND60594056020221118114339.0180510e20160820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059405602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Tingting12aA self-biased fuel cell with TiO2/g-C3N4 anode catalyzed alkaline pollutant degradation with light and without light—What is the degradation mechanism?  ap. 122-129.  aA new self-sustained fuel cell system was established using anodic TiO2/g-C3N4 and cathodic Pt nano-catalysts. It is effective for pollutant Rhodamine B (RhB) removal in the alkaline anolyte (0.5molL⁻¹ Na2SO4⁺ 0.5molL⁻¹ NaOH). The cell voltage can reach∼0.6V (1000Ω). The anodic RhB degradation was affected by the system circuit connection modes (short-circuit, 1000Ω and open-circuit). It was themost effective when an external 1000Ω resistance was connected, and removed ∼98% RhB in the anode chamber (350mL, 10mgL⁻¹ RhB). Compared to the traditional method, it does not need any applied voltage or light irradiation to remove RhB. Cyclic voltammetry curves (CV) of TiO2/g-C3N4 anode in different electrolytes indicate excellent oxidation capacity at lower potential under alkaline than neutral condition. Presence of RhB under Ultraviolet light (UV) did not increase the system oxidation current as significantly as those without light under alkaline condition. The proposed mechanisms for RhB degradation were caused by the dark activation of O2 and formation of reactive oxidizing species (ROS such as O2⁻). It was confirmed by the electron spin resonance (ESR), even under open-circuit voltage (OCV) condition. The anodic TiO2/g-C3N4 catalyzed O2 activation and pollutant oxidation. The RhB removal doesn’t decrease as the temperature drops, because of the increase in dissolved oxygen (DO) and the formation of ROS. To cold season, this is a significant advantage compared with microbial methods for practically wastewater treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 0aNo light irradiation 0aAeration 0aMolecular oxygen activation 0aOrganics degradation 0aElectricity generation1 aLiu, Lifen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2949-63481 aLi, Liang1 aYang, Fenglin0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.122-129dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02237naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100006000149245011600209520120900325592002801534650001301562650001301575650002701588650001501615650001201630653001901642653002401661653001101685653001001696700001701706773009501723856008401818852000901902655001201911IND60761103120221119184016.0220118e20220301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.appet.2021.1058792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSherrard, Adelyn1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7039-840310aFeeding coparenting: Associations with coercive control, structure-based, and autonomy-promoting food parenting  aFeeding coparenting refers to how two parents work together in the child feeding domain. However, little is known about feeding coparenting in relation to food parenting. The current study seeks to examine 1) whether parent demographics (i.e., sex, age, BMI, and employment status) and parent concern about child weight are related to feeding coparenting (i.e., Shared Views, Active Engagement, Solo Parenting) and 2) whether feeding coparenting is related to food parenting (i.e., coercive control feeding, structure-based feeding, autonomy-promoting feeding). Parents (n = 160) of 3- to 5-year old children completed an online survey. Parents' sex, employment status, and concern about child weight were related to feeding coparenting (Shared Views, Active Engagement, Solo Parenting). After controlling for those variables, feeding coparenting was related to structure-based (Shared Views and Active Engagement) and autonomy-promoting feeding (Active Engagement). However, none of the feeding coparenting variables were associated with coercive control feeding. These findings illuminate the importance of understanding how parents’ feeding coparenting relationship plays a part in food parenting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3achildren 3ademographic statistics 3aemployment 3asurveys 0aFood parenting 0aFeeding coparenting 0aParent 0aChild1 aTan, Cin Cin0 tAppetite.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.105879-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1058793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03154naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245014500178300001600323500002000339520148700359592002801846596005301874596005301927650001901980650001801999650001602017650001602033650001802049650001102067650002202078650000902100650001302109650002402122650001402146650001002160650002002170650001202190650002602202650001302228700002102241700006102262700002702323700002002350700002102370700001702391773013302408856008602541852000902627655001202636IND60573719820221119034655.0220819e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371982DNAL7 a10.1080/15222055.2017.13016042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAl‐Khafaji, Firas M.10aEffects of Feeding Frequencies on the Growth, Plasma Biochemistry, and Liver Glycogen of Jade Perch Scortum barcoo in a Recirculating System  ap. 216-223.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aJade Perch Scortum barcoo having an initial average weight of 7.28 ± 0.13 g (mean ± SE) were cultured in a recirculating system at different feeding frequencies that included one, two, three, or four meals a day at 5% body weight per day. Treatments were performed in triplicate using 65 fish in each replicate. After 72 d, the survival, growth, feeding efficiencies, body indices, plasma biochemistry, whole‐body proximate composition, and muscle cholesterol were measured while histological sections of the liver were stained for glycogen with periodic acid Schiff. Results showed that growth was best when fish were fed three times a day, which was significantly higher than those fed one, two or four times a day. Feeding efficiencies were significantly better for fish fed two or three times a day. Plasma glucose, plasma cholesterol, periodic acid Schiff staining intensity of the liver, and hepatosomatic index were significantly higher for fish fed three times a day compared with once a day. Whole‐body crude protein was significantly lower for fish fed once a day compared with treatments of two or four times a day. Muscle cholesterol tended to increase with increasing feeding frequencies, but the results were not significant. No significant treatment effect was detected on the plasma mineral content. Based on a feeding rate of 5% body weight/d, it is recommended that feedings are divided into three meals a day to increase available energy for optimal growth.  aPublisher supplied data  aGP‐IPB/2014/9440403cUniversiti Putra Malaysia  aGP‐IBT/2013/9410700cUniversiti Putra Malaysia 3aScortum barcoo 3ablood glucose 3abody weight 3acholesterol 3acrude protein 3aenergy 3afeeding frequency 3afish 3aglycogen 3ahepatosomatic index 3ahistology 3aliver 3amineral content 3amuscles 3aproximate composition 3astaining1 aRomano, Nicholas1 aAmin, S.

The parameters of this model, α and β, characterize the absolute strength and the spread of strengths, respectively. Information is lacking on the influence of soil properties on values of α and β. We measured dry aggregate strength as the specific rupture energy (E in J g⁻¹) of 40 aggregates in two size classes (4–8 and 8–16 mm) from 36 locations along a 500‐m transect across four soil types with a wide range of physical and chemical properties (e.g., 8.0–72.6% sand content). Estimates of α and β were obtained by fitting Weibull's model to these data using nonlinear regression. The α and β values were lognormally and normally distributed, respectively. The mean log(α) was ‐2.4 and the mean β was 1.3. Multiple regression analysis was used to relate log(α) and β to soil properties. The resulting regression equations explained 93% of the variation in log(α) and 60% of the variation in β. The log(α) increased with decreasing aggregate size and sand content and increasing organic matter content. The β increased (indicating a narrower range of strength values) with decreasing log(α) and aggregate size. The regression equations were validated by predicting the cumulative relative frequency distribution of E for aggregates from a different site where independent measurements of E were available for comparison. A good agreement (R² ≥ 0.91) was obtained between predicted and observed values of E.  aPublisher supplied data 3asoil strength 3aregression analysis 3aequations 3asand 3asoil organic matter 3amodels 3asoil aggregates1 aKay, B.

To observe the effect of applied potential on the photoelectrochemical performance of WO3 nanoparticles films, various applied potentials are employed for the electrochemical doping treatment. In comparison to pristine WO3 and the WO3 that have been annealed in Ar gas, the electrochemical doping WO3 shows remarkably improved photoelectrochemical performance. The optimized WO3 film yields a photocurrent density of 1.30mA/cm² (vs. Ag/AgCl), which is 2.33 times higher than that of pristine WO3 film. The results of intensity-modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) demonstrate that the electrochemcial doping accelerates the electron transport with trap-state passivation so as to improve the separation of photo-generated electrons and holes. This approach brings new opportunities for the development of PEC water splitting with superior performance.  aPublisher supplied data 0aWO3 0ananoparticles film 0aelectrochemical doping 0aphotoelectrochemical performance1 aLi, Jie1 aLi, Wenzhang1 aHe, Haizhou1 aYang, Yahui1 aLi, Yaomin1 aChen, Qiyuan0 tElectrochimica acta.g2016 Aug. 20, v. 210 p.251-260dElsevier LtdwJournal:26735x0013-46867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.electacta.2016.05.1653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005100169520101300220592002801233650001401261650001201275650001401287650001801301650001601319650001701335650001301352650001601365650002201381650003101403650001401434653001301448653001201461653001001473653001301483653001001496700002101506700002301527700001901550773012001569856008201689852000901771655001201780IND60734788820221120183010.0210806e20210820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073478882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1669942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSyrjanen, Johanna10aOn the molecular nature of large-pore channels  aMembrane transport is a fundamental means to control basic cellular processes such as apoptosis, inflammation, and neurodegeneration and is mediated by a number of transporters, pumps, and channels. Accumulating evidence over the last half century has shown that a type of so-called “large-pore channel” exists in various tissues and organs in gap-junctional and non-gap-junctional forms in order to flow not only ions but also metabolites such as ATP. They are formed by a number of protein families with little or no evolutionary linkages including connexin, innexin, pannexin, leucine-rich repeat-containing 8 (LRRC8), and calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM). This review summarizes the history and concept of large-pore channels starting from connexin gap junction channels to the more recent developments in innexin, pannexin, LRRC8, and CALHM. We describe structural and functional features of large-pore channels that are crucial for their diverse functions on the basis of available structures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3acalcium 3aconnexins 3agap junctions 3ahomeostasis 3ainflammation 3ainnexins 3ametabolites 3amolecular biology 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3apannexins 0aConnexin 0aInnexin 0aLRRC8 0aPannexin 0aCALHM1 aMichalski, Kevin1 aKawate, Toshimitsu1 aFurukawa, Hiro0 tJournal of molecular biology.g2021 Aug. 20, v. 433, no. 17 p.166994-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12469x0022-28367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2021.1669943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245010300170300001600273520166300289592002801952650001301980650002101993650003002014650001102044650002802055650001702083650001302100651001402113653002602127653001802153653002202171653001902193653001402212653001202226653001402238700002102252773011302273856008502386852000902471655001202480IND60634709120221118115637.0190325e20180620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063470912DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.2252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZutshi, Ambika10aDeclaring Talloires: Profile of sustainability communications in Australian signatory universities  ap. 687-698.  aThis paper profiles Australian universities’ website communications about sustainability initiatives, especially relating to Talloires Declaration signification and the ten recommended actions. The research involves a content study of Talloires signatories’ websites and their semiotic and signaling theory aspects across time. The source is publicly available information (time period 2014 and 2015 respectively) in context with education for sustainable development (ESD) in society and the transaction model in communication theory. It is found that some of the signatory universities in Australia exemplify a few of the Talloires ten agreed actions in their public communications, but each point is not emphasised with equal priority. The variance may be due to divergent underlying objectives; such as public communication of Talloires toward genuine benefit for the environment, or to create a strategic positioning tool to signal the university as an environmental champion within the broader society. Focusing upon secondary data from signatory university websites in Australia, the paper provides a study of higher education signification of Talloires. It assists the initial understanding of signaling theory in the public communication transactions that promote Talloires action and implementation. The findings encourage further studies of related communication issues in universities in other countries. The paper also deepens local and global understanding of perceptions of sustainability and contributes to the body of comparative literature of sustainability in higher education as a development component of strategic management of ESD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3ahigher education 3ainformation dissemination 3amodels 3asustainable development 3auniversities 3avariance 3aAustralia 0aTalloires declaration 0aSignification 0aSignalling theory 0aSustainability 0aEducation 0aSociety 0aAustralia1 aCreed, Dr Andrew0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.687-698dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.2253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04374naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100006200138245017200200500002000372520270700392592002803099596008003127596003303207596007503240650002503315650001803340650001803358650001603376650001903392650002603411650002003437650001603457650002003473650002603493650001403519650002903533650001903562650002203581700001903603700001503622700002103637700005603658773010803714856007303822852000903895655001203904IND60790668220221119182828.0220826e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066822DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.3302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLinden, Katrina J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7710-980310aFactors that affect protein abundance of a positive regulator of abscisic acid signalling, the basic leucine zipper transcription factor ABRE‐binding factor 2 (ABF2)  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMost members of basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor (TF) subgroup A play important roles as positive effectors in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during germination and/or in vegetative stress responses. In multiple plant species, one member, ABA insensitive 5 (ABI5), is a major TF that promotes seed maturation and blocks early seeding growth in response to ABA. Other members, referred to as either ABRE‐binding factors (ABFs), ABRE‐binding proteins (AREBs), or D3 protein‐binding factors (DPBFs), are implicated as major players in stress responses during vegetative growth. Studies on the proteolytic regulation of ABI5, ABF1, and ABF3 in Arabidopsis thaliana have shown that the proteins have moderate degradation rates and accumulate in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Exogenous ABA slows their degradation and the ubiquitin E3 ligase called KEEP ON GOING (KEG) is important for their degradation. However, there are some reported differences in degradation among subgroup A members. The conserved C‐terminal sequences (referred to as the C4 region) enhance degradation of ABI5 but stabilize ABF1 and ABF3. To better understand the proteolytic regulation of the ABI5/ABFs and determine whether there are differences between vegetative ABFs and ABI5, we studied the degradation of an additional family member, ABF2, and compared its in vitro degradation to that of ABI5. As previously seen for ABI5, ABF1, and ABF3, epitope‐tagged constitutively expressed ABF2 degrades in seedlings treated with cycloheximide and is stabilized following treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Tagged ABF2 protein accumulates when seedlings are treated with ABA, but its mRNA levels do not increase, suggesting that the protein is stabilized in the presence of ABA. ABF2 is also an in vitro ubiquitination substrate of the E3 ligase KEG and recombinant ABF2 is stable in keg lysates. ABF2 with a C4 deletion degrades more quickly in vitro than full‐length ABF2, as previously observed for ABF1 and ABF3, suggesting that the conserved C4 region contributes to its stability. In contrast to ABF2 and consistent with previously published work, ABI5 with C terminal deletions including an analogous C4 deletion is stabilized in vitro compared to full length ABI5. In vivo expression of an ABF1 C4 deletion protein appears to have reduced activity compared to equivalent levels of full length ABF1. Additional group A family members show similar proteolytic regulation by MG132 and ABA. Altogether, these results together with other work on ABI5 regulation suggest that the vegetative ABFs share proteolytic regulatory mechanisms that are not completely shared with ABI5.  aPublisher supplied data  aIOS‐1557760cNSF | BIO | Division of Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS)  cUC Davis, Aggie Alumni Award  cPaul K. and Ruth R.

A model of precision food parenting proposes that child healthy dietary intake could be optimized by the selection and implementation of effective food parenting practices. Parents use and learn from these complex interactions with their child, which are reflective of feeding style. Intervention research has targeted VPPs in general without a delineation of which practices were selected, which were used, or why they were selected. It is not clear how these users were influenced by feeding style, nor what the parent learned from the interaction. The current study used mixed methods wherein middle socioeconomic status parents of 3–5 year old children were categorized within feeding style groups (n = 122), asked to select two VPPs, implemented them for a week (n = 63), and qualitatively interviewed about their experience. Responsiveness VPPs were most commonly selected, primarily due to their perceived ease of implementation. Parents believed there would be long term positive outcomes, e.g. more vegetable intake from using the practices selected. Frequency of use depended in part on opportunity, e.g. food purchase parenting practices could only be employed during intermittent shopping events. Few differences were detected by parent feeding styles in the types of VPPs selected, frequency of use, or effectiveness. Food parenting interventions can encourage selection of specific VPPs to employ and do not appear to have to tailor the types of VPPs offered to parent feeding style. Research is needed with larger, socioeconomically diverse samples to assess optimal categorization into feeding styles and confirm the present results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aappetite 3achildren 3afood purchasing 3amodels 3asocioeconomic status 3avegetable consumption 3avegetables 0aFeeding styles 0aParenting practices 0aPreschool 0aQualitative 0aIntervention1 aDemet, Rosemary1 aHughes, Sheryl O.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0331-24941 aWood, Alexis C.1 aThompson, Debbe1 aO'Connor, Teresia M.1 aBaranowski, Tom0 tAppetite.g2022 Mar. 01, v. 170 p.105883-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.1058833Available from publisher's site40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/76110353Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02569naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006700167300001600234520154800250592002801798650002401826650000901850650002701859650001401886650001401900650001501914650001501929650001501944650001301959650002001972650001401992700001602006773009502022856008102117852000902198655001202207IND4407510320221120215537.0151024e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440751032DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9436-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, J.

Suspended inorganic clays and periphyton are common to aquatic environments, and both can strongly influence physical and chemical water conditions. We used replicated artificial stream channels to test the prediction that suspended clay particles would affect the uptake of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) by periphyton. Commercially available kaolinite and bentonite clays were characterized for their aqueous suspension behavior and affinities for SRP. Periphyton was grown in a recirculating stream system and subjected to simultaneous suspended clay and SRP additions. SRP removal from solution, both in the presence and absence of suspended clays, was used to quantify SRP uptake parameters by periphyton. Clay type and concentrations of 20, 80, and 200 mg l⁻¹ had no significant effect upon SRP uptake rate exhibited by periphyton during three 90-min experiments. Less than 1% of SRP removal was attributable to the suspended clay load or artificial stream construction materials, based on clay isotherm data and material sorption studies, indicating that 99% of SRP removal was attributable to biotic uptake. Removal of SRP (as KH₂PO₄) was described by a first-order equation with rate constants ranging between 0.02 and 0.14 min⁻¹. Our results suggest that high turbidity conditions caused by suspended mineral clays have little immediate effect upon SRP removal from the water column by periphyton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic environment 3aclay 3aconstruction materials 3aequations 3akaolinite 3aperiphyton 3aphosphorus 3aprediction 3asorption 3astream channels 3aturbidity1 aLind, O.

Here, we systematically studied the effects of hierarchical ZnO nanostructures on the electrochemical performance of LIBs. ZnO nanowire (NW) trunks were decorated with ZnO NWs or ZnO nanosheets (NSs) by successive hydrothermal synthesis to create hierarchical three-dimensional nanostructures. The branched ZnO NSs on the ZnO NW trunk exhibited a two-fold higher specific gravimetric capacity compared to ZnO NWs and branched ZnO NWs on ZnO NW trunks after 100 cycles of charging–discharging at 0.2C (197.4 mA g⁻¹). The improvement in battery anode performance is attributable to the increased interfacial area between the electrodes and electrolyte, and the void space of the branched NSs that facilitates lithium ion transport and volume changes during cycling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanodes 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3alithium 3alithium batteries 3ananosheets 3ananowires 3azinc oxide1 aShin, Sun Hae Ra1 aKim, Yeonhoo1 aCrossley, Kenneth1 aKim, Yerim1 aHan, Hyungkyu1 aYoo, Jinkyoung0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 03, v. 10, no. 23 p.13655-13661dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00372g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001500141245011000156300001800266500001400284520114600298592002801444650001001472650002001482650002301502650001201525650001601537650001401553650001201567650002101579650001501600650000901615650001801624650002301642650001701665650001301682650002101695653001901716700001701735700001601752773015201768856007501920852000901995655001202004IND60710104820221116194409.0200908e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010482DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-9222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Yang10aEffect of choline chloride with propylene glycol on growth performance and meat quality in finishing pigs  ap. 1349-1353.  aNAL-light  aThis study was conducted to evaluate the effect of choline chloride alone and in combination with propylene glycol on the growth performance, meat quality and backfat in finishing pigs. A total of 90 crossbred [(Landrace× Yorkshire)× Duroc] pigs with an average initial body weight (BW) of 75.15± 1.94 kg were randomly distributed by BW and sex. This 8-week experiment consisted of 3 dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment and 5 pigs per pen. The experiment included 3 treatments: CON, basicdiet;TRT1, basic diet+0.05% choline chloride;TRT2, basicdiet+0.05% biocholine P (chloride chloride and propylene glycol). Body weight was statistically higher (P < 0.05) in pigs fed TRT2 diet than the CON diet in week 8. During 4 to 8 weeks and overall, the average daily gain (ADG) was significant higher (P < 0.05) in the pigs fed TRT2 diet than the CON diet. Digestibility of nitrogen wassignificantlyincreased (P < 0.05) at week 4 and week 8, back fat was higher (P < 0.05) in week 6 and week 8 in pigs fed TRT2 diet than the CON diet. In conclusion, dietary TRT2 can increase the BW, ADG, nitrogen and backfat in finishing pigs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDuroc 3aanimal research 3aaverage daily gain 3abackfat 3abody weight 3achlorides 3acholine 3acholine chloride 3acrossbreds 3adiet 3adigestibility 3agrowth performance 3ameat quality 3anitrogen 3apropylene glycol 0aFinishing pigs1 aLee, Sang In1 aKim, In-ho,0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2019 Oct., v. 53, no. 10 p.1349-1353dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-9223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02364naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245010400171300001600275520119600291592002801487650002201515650001301537650001501550650001401565650001901579653002001598653001301618653002201631653001801653700002101671700007301692700002501765773011601790856008701906852000901993655001202002IND60585825420221120151233.0181012e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajak, Upendra10aNumerical investigation of performance, combustion and emission characteristics of various biofuels  ap. 235-252.  aAlternative fuels have been a major concern in today’s era due to its promising characteristics in internal combustion engines. The computational analysis is a proven method by many researchers in determining combustion, performance and emission characteristics of an internal combustion engine, offering accurate results at par with experimental results. An attempt is being made by the author(s) in this paper for performing numerical study of nine (9) different alternative biofuels and pure diesel. Comparison has been carried out with the results of pure diesel in a single cylinder, naturally aspirated, water cooled, direct injection diesel engine with different engine load (20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100%), constant compression ratio (CR17.5), higher nozzle opening pressure (220 bar) and advance injection timing (23° CA before TDC). The study was performed after validating results of two experimental data using the proposed tool, which have shown that the numerical results were in good agreement with the experimental results. The numerical results of the different biofuels have depicted the possibility of using the fuels as alternative fuel for internal combustion engine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalternative fuels 3abiofuels 3acombustion 3acylinders 3adiesel engines 0aNumerical study 0aBiofuels 0aAlternative fuels 0aDiesel engine1 aNashine, Prerana1 aSingh, Thokchom Subhaschandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6176-82111 aVerma, Tikendra Nath0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 156 p.235-252dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03046naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245011900159300001400278520157000292592002801862650000801890650002401898650002201922650001201944650001601956650001701972650001701989650001602006650001402022650002402036650001202060650001402072650001602086650002902102650002602131650001002157653002202167653001902189653002902208653002602237700001202263700001502275700001402290700001402304700001602318773010502334856008002439852000902519655001202528IND60563010620221118062825.0170223e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301062DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.44.2016.0422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYe, G.J.10aFrame-shift mutation causes the function loss of TaMYB-A1 regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in Triticum aestivum  ap. 35-46.  aRed coleoptile is an easily observed trait in Triticum aestivum and can provide some protection against stress. Here, TaMYB-A1 or TuMYB-A1 , homologous to TaMYB-D1 , which controls red coleoptile formation in the common wheat cultivar ‘Gy115’, was isolated from eight T. aestivum and 34 T. urartu cultivars. The genome sequence of TaMYB-A1 was 867 bp with an intron of 93 bp, which was similar to the MYBs regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in T. aestivum but different from other MYB transcription factors regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. TaMYB-A1 had an integrated DNA-binding domain of 102 amino acids and a transcriptional domain of 42 amino acids, which was responsible for regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. TaMYB-A1 was assigned to the same branch as the MYBs regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in a phylogenetic tree. A transient expression analysis showed that TaMYB-A1 induced ‘Opata’ coleoptile cells to synthesize anthocyanin with the help of ZmR . A non-functional allele of TaMYB-a1 existed in common wheat cultivars containing rc-a1 . One single nucleotide was deleted 715 bp after the start codon in TaMYB-a1 compared with TaMYB-A1 . The deletion caused a frame shift mutation, destroyed the DNA transcription activator domain, and resulted in TaMYB-a1 losing its ability to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in ‘Opata’ coleoptile cells. Those cultivars with functional TaMYB-A1 or TuMYB-A1 have red coleoptiles. The isolation of TaMYB-A1 should aid in understanding the molecular mechanisms of coleoptile traits in T. aestivum .  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA-binding domains 3aTriticum aestivum 3aalleles 3aamino acids 3aanthocyanins 3abiosynthesis 3acoleoptiles 3acultivars 3aframeshift mutation 3aintrons 3aphylogeny 3astart codon 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors 3awheat 0aTriticum aestivum 0ared coleoptile 0aMYB transcription factor 0afunction verification1 aWei, L.1 aChen, W.J.1 aZhang, B.1 aLiu, B.L.1 aZhang, H.G.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.35-46dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03138naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245006400171300001600235520192500251592002802176650002802204650001102232650001302243650002502256650002502281650001602306653002302322653003302345653002702378653003402405653002702439700006102466700002502527773011602552856008702668852000902755655001202764IND60585825520221120151320.0181012e20180115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobri, Sobrina10aSolar photovoltaic generation forecasting methods: A review  ap. 459-497.  aSolar photovoltaic plants are widely integrated into most countries worldwide. Due to the ever-growing utilization of solar photovoltaic plants, either via grid-connection or stand-alone networks, dramatic changes can be anticipated in both power system planning and operating stages. Solar photovoltaic integration requires the capability of handling the uncertainty and fluctuations of power output. In this case, solar photovoltaic power forecasting is a crucial aspect to ensure optimum planning and modelling of the solar photovoltaic plants. Accurate forecasting provides the grid operators and power system designers with significant information to design an optimal solar photovoltaic plant as well as managing the power of demand and supply. This paper presents an extensive review on recent advancements in the field of solar photovoltaic power forecasting. This paper aims to analyze and compare various methods of solar photovoltaic power forecasting in terms of characteristics and performance. This work classifies solar photovoltaic power forecasting methods into three major categories i.e., time-series statistical methods, physical methods, and ensemble methods. To date, Artificial Intelligence approaches are widely used due to their capability in solving the non-linear and complex structure of data. The performance analysis shows that these methods outperform the traditional methods. Recently, the ensemble methods were also developed by researchers to extract the unique features of single models to enhance the forecast model performances. This combination produces accurate results compared to individual models. This paper also elaborates on the metrics assessment which was implemented to evaluate the forecast model performances. This work provides information which is beneficial for researchers and engineers who are involved in the modelling and planning of the solar photovoltaic plant.  aPublisher supplied data 3aartificial intelligence 3amodels 3aplanning 3astatistical analysis 3atime series analysis 3auncertainty 0aSolar photovoltaic 0aRenewable energy power plant 0aModelling and planning 0aSpatial and temporal horizons 0aSmart grid forecasting1 aKoohi-Kamali, Sam1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4620-66401 aRahim, Nasrudin Abd.0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2018 Jan. 15, v. 156 p.459-497dElsevier LtdwJournal:11831x0196-89047nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245011600171500001900287520205300306592002802359650001602387650001202403650001602415650001802431650001902449650000702468650001802475650001502493650001202508650001402520650001902534653001602553653001802569653002702587653001602614653002502630700002002655700002102675700002202696700002402718773011902742856008802861852000902949655001202958IND60709366320221123015958.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDultz, Stefan10aEffects of solution chemistry on conformation of self-aggregated tannic acid revealed by laser light scattering  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aInorganic soil solution constituents can alter the charge, size, and conformation of dissolved organic molecules, thus affecting their environmental behavior. Here, we investigated how pH, cation valence and activities induce conformational changes and aggregation-sedimentation reactions of organic polyelectrolytes. For that we determined the hydrodynamic diameter of the model compound tannic acid by laser light scattering at concentrations of 1–30 g L⁻¹ in the pH range from 3 to 10 and with electrolyte additions of CaCl₂ and hydroxyl-Al cations. Charge properties were quantified by polyelectrolyte titration and zeta potential measurements. After dispersion by sonication, aggregation was determined in time sequences up to 60 min and suspension stability was traced in sedimentation experiments. Tannic acid was present in ultrapure water in a self-aggregated state. At pH <3 as well as >7.5, its hydrodynamic diameter increased. Whereas at high pH this behavior could be assigned to unfolding of molecular conformations, at low pH it is likely that charge neutralization decreased repulsive forces and facilitated aggregation. At pH 5 and ionic strengths of up to 5 mM, CaCl₂ did not affect aggregation state of tannic acid and results resembled those obtained in ultrapure water. Addition of hydroxyl-Al cations broke-up the self-aggregated tannic acid structures under formation of Al-organic coprecipitates. Strong aggregation only occurred at mixing ratios where opposite surface charges were completely balanced. Under natural conditions, self-aggregation of tannic acid can be expected only at higher solution concentrations. However, at acidic pH, hydroxyl-Al cations and tannic acid may form discrete colloidal particles already at low tannic acid concentrations, resulting in the destabilization of suspensions. Our data emphasize that the soil solution composition strongly modifies the physical state of tannic acid, and likely also of other biopolymers, and thus their interactions within environmental matrices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiopolymers 3acations 3aenvironment 3ahydrodynamics 3aneutralization 3apH 3asoil solution 3asonication 3atannins 3atitration 3azeta potential 0aTannic acid 0aParticle size 0aConformational changes 0aAggregation 0aSuspension stability1 aMikutta, Robert1 aKara, Selen N.M.1 aWoche, Susanne K.1 aGuggenberger, Georg0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142119-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03574naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245011400170500002200284520207700306592002802383650002302411650001602434650001002450650001302460650001402473650002302487650001402510650004102524650001502565650001102580650001702591650001202608650001102620650002102631650001102652650001302663650001802676650002102694653001202715653001402727653001802741653003002759653003302789700001602822700001702838700001702855773007702872856008602949852000903035655001203044IND60585825620221120140619.0171114s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWenchao, Yang10aCatalytic upgrading of bio-oil in hydrothermal liquefaction of algae major model components over liquid acids  aPre-press version  aWe selected acetic acid and sulfuric acid as liquid acid catalysts to investigate their performance on hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of algae major model components, including polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and polysaccharides-proteins mixture. The aim of this study was to understand the catalytic effects of liquid acid catalysts as well as the formation process mechanisms and properties of the bio-oils from HTL of algae. We also used the two acids in HTL process of Chlorella vulgaris to estimate their catalytic performances in algae and compare this performance with the results from HTL of model components. Product distributions from different catalytic conditions were compared with blank results. Bio-oils were analyzed by elemental analysis, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the addition of acetic acid or sulfuric acid had no positive effect on the enhancement of bio-oil yield from HTL of individual algae major model components; however, the use of liquid acid catalysts could prevent the detrimental effect of interaction between polysaccharides and proteins on bio-oil yield. H/C ratios and higher heating values (HHVs) of bio-oils obtained from HTL of algae major model components increased significantly in the presence of acid catalysts. Sulfuric acid favored the oxygen removal process, and acetic acid reduced the nitrogen content in bio-oil from HTL of proteins. GC-MS results showed that bio-oil composition was greatly altered when adding acids. The light component proportion of catalytic upgraded bio-oils was significantly higher than that of bio-oils obtained with no catalyst. The results of HTL of Chlorella vulgaris with acid catalysts indicate that both acids favor to the hydrolysis of cellulose; therefore, the use of acid catalysts could accelerate the formation of bio-oil from cellular components. The difference between the HTL of algae major model components and real algae using acid catalysts was probably due to the complexity of algae structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aacetic acid 3aalgae 3abiofuels 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acellulose 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3ahydrolysis 3alipids 3aliquefaction 3aliquids 3amodels 3anitrogen content 3aoxygen 3aproteins 3asulfuric acid 3athermogravimetry 0abio-oil 0aupgrading 0aacid catalyst 0ahydrothermal liquefaction 0aalgae major model components1 aXianguo, Li1 aDahai, Zhang1 aLijuan, Feng0 tEnergy conversion and management.g2017, dElsevier Ltdx0196-89047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2017.11.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02653naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094024002100135024001900156040001800175100002400193245005700217300001200274506007600286520122000362592002801582506003701610650001801647650001001665650001201675650001401687650001501701650002801716650001201744650001001756650002401766650001901790650002201809650002001831650002401851650002601875650001001901650001901911700002001930700002201950773010301972856008702075852000902162655001202171IND60119477320221207125921.0141214e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011947732DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-reviews30122doi7 aPMC1394112pmcid7 a122255932pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPaolo Claudio, Pier14aThe retinoblastoma family: twins or distant cousins?  ap. 382.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe destiny of a cell - whether it undergoes division, differentiation or death - results from an intricate balance of many regulators, including oncoproteins, tumor-suppressor proteins and cell-cycle-associated proteins. One of the better-studied tumor suppressors is the retinoblastoma protein, known as pRb or p105. Two recently identified proteins, pRb2/p130 and p107, show structural and functional similarities to pRb, and these proteins and their orthologs make up the retinoblastoma (Rb) family. Members of the family have been found in animals and plants, and a related protein is known in the alga Chlamydomonas. Members of the Rb family are bound and inactivated by viral proteins and, in turn, bind cellular transcription factors and repress their function, and can also form complexes with cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases and with histone deacetylases. They are found in the nucleus and their subnuclear localization depends on binding to the nuclear matrix. Members of the family form part of a signal-transduction pathway called the Rb pathway, which is important in cell-cycle regulation and have roles in growth suppression, differentiation and apoptosis in different organisms and cell types.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlamydomonas 3aalgae 3aanimals 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3acyclin-dependent kinase 3acyclins 3adeath 3ahistone deacetylase 3anuclear matrix 3aoncogene proteins 3aplants (botany) 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factors 3atwins 3aviral proteins1 aTonini, Tiziana1 aGiordano, Antonio0 tGenome biology.g2002 Aug., v. 3, no. 9 p.382-382dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2002-3-9-reviews30123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02529naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245008200164300001400246520103500260592002801295650002201323650001701345650001601362650001001378650001201388650002201400650001301422650001901435650001801454650001901472650001301491650002201504650001701526650002601543650001401569650001101583650001701594650001001611653002501621653001501646653002401661653001001685653002001695653001901715700001901734700001901753700002101772773010501793856008001898852000901978655001201987IND60563010820221118062841.0170223e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301082DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.44.2016.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShoeva, O.Yu.10aAnthocyanins participate in protection of wheat seedlings from osmotic stress  ap. 47-56.  aPlant secondary metabolites anthocyanins are considered to play a protective role. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), anthocyanins can be observed in both adult plants and seedlings. The aim of the current study was to investigate the putative role of anthocyanins present in grains and shoots with respect to the protection of seedlings against drought. For this purpose a set of near isogenic lines (NILs) differing in pericarp and coleoptile colour was used. Water stress was created by artificial shortage of moisture under laboratory conditions. Differences among the lines were observed in a way that the lines with dark-purple grains and coleoptiles (genotype Pp - D1Pp - D1Pp3Pp3Rc - A1Rc - A1Rc - D1Rc - D1) demonstrated a higher seedling drought tolerance than plants with uncoloured pericarp and lightpurple coleoptiles (pp - D1pp - D1pp3pp3Rc - A1Rc - A1rc - D1rc - D1). Furthermore, protection of the root system and the shoot was related with the presence of anthocyanins in grains and coleoptiles, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTriticum aestivum 3aanthocyanins 3acoleoptiles 3acolor 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3agenotype 3aisogenic lines 3amature plants 3aosmotic stress 3apericarp 3aprotective effect 3aroot systems 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3awater stress 3awheat 0aTriticum aestivum L. 0aflavonoids 0anear isogenic lines 0agrain 0apurple pericarp 0ared coleoptile1 aGordeeva, E.I.1 aArbuzova, V.S.1 aKhlestkina, E.K.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.47-56dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03229naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016300172300001600335520171500351592002802066650002302094650001402117650001702131650002602148650002902174650002702203650001702230650002002247650001502267650001702282650001602299651001602315653002502331653002702356653002702383653002402410653003102434700002702465700001502492700001902507700001902526700002002545773008902565856008402654852000902738655001202747IND60544841120221121224803.0160901e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054484112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2014.05.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeekhuizen, Johan10aImpact of input data uncertainty on environmental exposure assessment models: A case study for electromagnetic field modelling from mobile phone base stations  ap. 148-155.  aWith the increased availability of spatial data and computing power, spatial prediction approaches have become a standard tool for exposure assessment in environmental epidemiology. However, such models are largely dependent on accurate input data. Uncertainties in the input data can therefore have a large effect on model predictions, but are rarely quantified.With Monte Carlo simulation we assessed the effect of input uncertainty on the prediction of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from mobile phone base stations at 252 receptor sites in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The impact on ranking and classification was determined by computing the Spearman correlations and weighted Cohen׳s Kappas (based on tertiles of the RF-EMF exposure distribution) between modelled values and RF-EMF measurements performed at the receptor sites.The uncertainty in modelled RF-EMF levels was large with a median coefficient of variation of 1.5. Uncertainty in receptor site height, building damping and building height contributed most to model output uncertainty. For exposure ranking and classification, the heights of buildings and receptor sites were the most important sources of uncertainty, followed by building damping, antenna- and site location. Uncertainty in antenna power, tilt, height and direction had a smaller impact on model performance.We quantified the effect of input data uncertainty on the prediction accuracy of an RF-EMF environmental exposure model, thereby identifying the most important sources of uncertainty and estimating the total uncertainty stemming from potential errors in the input data. This approach can be used to optimize the model and better interpret model output.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3abuildings 3acase studies 3aelectromagnetic field 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental exposure 3aepidemiology 3aexposure models 3aprediction 3aspatial data 3auncertainty 3aNetherlands 0aUncertainty analysis 0aMonte Carlo simulation 0aElectromagnetic fields 0aExposure assessment 0aMobile phone base stations1 aHeuvelink, Gerard B.M.1 aHuss, Anke1 aBürgi, Alfred1 aKromhout, Hans1 aVermeulen, Roel0 tEnvironmental Research.g2014 Nov., v. 135 p.148-155dElsevier Inc.x0013-93517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2014.05.0383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03352naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012600167500001900293520183500312592002802147650002202175650002302197650001902220650001602239650001202255650002102267650001102288650004302299650000902342650001502351650002402366650001102390650002502401650001202426651001002438653002502448653003202473653002002505653002602525700001602551700001502567700001702582700001602599700001502615773011902630856008802749852000902837655001202846IND60709366420221123024743.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Zihao10aMapping farmland soil organic carbon density in plains with combined cropping system extracted from NDVI time-series data  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe accurate mapping of farmland soil organic carbon density (SOCD) is crucial for evaluating carbon (C) sequestration potential and forecasting climate change. Natural factors such as soil types and topographical factors are important variables in mapping soil properties. Moreover, cropping systems are important components of agricultural activities and are significantly correlated with soil properties. Therefore, integrating cropping systems and natural factors can improve the accuracy of mapping farmland SOCD. This study aimed to obtain and incorporate cropping system information in mapping SOCD in plains by combining normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time-series data and the regression Kriging (RK) method. We collected 230 topsoil samples in Jianghan Plain, China and (i) obtained the spatial patterns of crops in summer and winter using NDVI time-series data derived from HJ-1A/1B satellite images, (ii) investigated the differences in SOCD under different cropping systems, and (iii) evaluated the performance of the RK_CS model in integrating cropping systems and natural factors into mapping SOCD. ANOVA results showed significant differences in SOCD under different cropping systems. Specifically, the SOCD of single rice was higher than that of rice–wheat rotation and dry crops. Meanwhile, the regression results showed that SOCD was affected by natural factors and cropping system, with the latter playing a major role. The integration of soil types, slope and cropping systems explained approximately 26.3% of the variation in SOCD. Model validation results confirmed the effectiveness of the RK_CS model. The findings reveal single cropping rice sequences more C than other cropping systems. Cropping system is an important environmental variable in improving mapping farmland SOCD in plains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagricultural soils 3aclimate change 3aenvironment 3akriging 3amodel validation 3amodels 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3arice 3asatellites 3asoil organic carbon 3asummer 3atime series analysis 3atopsoil 3aChina 0aDigital soil mapping 0aSoil organic carbon density 0aCropping system 0aNDVI time-series data1 aLiu, Yaolin1 aHan, Yiran1 aZhou, Jianai1 aLiu, Jiamin1 aWu, Jingan0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142120-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245009200172300001600264520138600280592002801666650001601694650001201710650000901722650001501731650001301746650001301759650001001772650001001782650001101792650001201803651001301815700001901828700001701847700002401864773013901888856008402027852000902111655001202120IND60123430220221120083651.0150325e20140304xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012343022DNAL7 a10.1080/02755947.2013.8621942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen, Michael J.10aBlack Bass and Crappie Use of Installed Habitat Structures in Table Rock Lake, Missouri  ap. 223-231.  aReservoirs are important resources utilized by millions of freshwater anglers annually, but as reservoirs age the quality of the habitat that they provide for fish deteriorates. In 2007, a large-scale habitat improvement project began on Table Rock Lake, Missouri, with the goal of supplementing existing fish habitat in this large reservoir. Over 2,000 habitat structures composed of cedar, pine, hardwoods, stumps, and rocks were installed between 2007 and 2013. By means of scuba surveys, we evaluated the use of these structures by black bass Micropterus spp. and crappies Pomoxis spp. to determine whether it varied among fish species, fish sizes, and structure types. Black bass were observed utilizing all structure types but appeared to utilize hardwoods most. Covariates such as water depth and visibility at the structure confounded our analysis of black bass use, however, limiting our ability to clearly document differences in use. Crappies never used rock structures, and more crappies were observed on cedar structures than any other type. In Table Rock Lake, black bass were attracted to all structure types and crappies were attracted to all structure types except rock. Since fish use is similar across nearly all habitat types, other factors such as cost and installation times should be considered when planning habitat enhancement projects on large reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMicropterus 3aPomoxis 3abass 3afreshwater 3ahabitats 3ahardwood 3alakes 3arocks 3astumps 3asurveys 3aMissouri1 aBush, Shane C.1 aVining, Ivan1 aSiepker, Michael J.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2014 Mar. 4, v. 34, no. 2 p.223-231dTaylor & FranciswJournal:19701x1548-86757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02755947.2013.8621943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03764naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006300150245017600213500002200389520186700411592002802278650002102306650000902327650002302336650001502359650001702374650002902391650001502420650002802435650001502463650001002478650001502488650002202503650002802525650003502553650002502588650000702613650001602620650001702636650001902653650001702672650001902689650002502708651001202733653002302745653002002768653002402788653000902812700001802821700001702839700003102856700002102887700002002908700002402928700002302952773010302975856005103078852000903129655001203138IND60795542120221117210900.0221004e20220929xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079554212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.1046852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmmeri, Rim Werheni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3712-138610aImprovement of degraded agricultural soil in an arid zone following short- and long-term treated municipal wastewater application: A case study of Gabes perimeter, Tunisia  aPre-press version  aThis work aimed to study the short, medium, and long-term influences of treated wastewater (WWTP) as a soil irrigation technique on physical, chemical, and microbiological properties. Sampled soil plots were irrigated with WWTP for 1, 7, and 15 years. Rain-fed regime soil has been used as a control. This study was conducted in El Hamma of Gabes (southeast of Tunisia), an arid zone, during the dry season. Three soil profiles at 0–20, 20–40, and 40–60 cm were sampled. Physical and chemical analyzes, including pH, electrical conductivity, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, and active and total CaCO₃ were evaluated. Soil microbial biomass C and N were performed according to the fumigation extraction method. Soil microbial contamination was assessed by enumerating total, Fecal Coliforms, E. coli, and Fecal Streptococci with the most probable number (MPN) method and plate medium count. Bacterial and fungal enumeration were evaluated by the plate count agar method. In addition, the DGGE molecular analysis was also assessed in the different soil samples. The obtained physical and chemical evaluation proved that the WWTP irrigation practice improves soil fertility. Microbial biomass C and N increased by increasing the time of WWTP irrigation. In addition, the sanitary quality of the soil is affected by the increase of pathogens. We have observed an increase in microbial biomass as demonstrated by an increase in heterotrophic bacteria and filamentous fungi in the soil irrigated with WWTP compared to the control. Long-term WWTP irrigation has increased the activities of the soil microorganisms and then soil fertility. Meanwhile, the same pathogens and bacteria could pose a serious threat to sanitary soil quality and a limiting factor for the use of WWTP in agriculture areas without tertiary treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aagar 3aagricultural soils 3aarid zones 3acase studies 3acation exchange capacity 3adry season 3aelectrical conductivity 3afumigation 3afungi 3airrigation 3amicrobial biomass 3amicrobial contamination 3amost probable number technique 3amunicipal wastewater 3apH 3aplate count 3asoil ecology 3asoil fertility 3asoil quality 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3aTunisia 0aTreated wastewater 0aSoil properties 0aMicrobial diversity 0aDGGE1 aHidri, Yassin1 aSouid, Faiza1 aSimeone, Giuseppe Di Rauso1 aHajjaji, Feryell1 aMoussa, Mohamed1 aHassen, Abdennaceur1 aEturki, Saifeddine0 tApplied soil ecology.g2022 Sept. 29,  p.104685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl55717x0929-13937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104685  aDNAL 7aarticle03244naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245010700162300001600269520169200285592002801977650002602005650001502031650001602046650002002062650001302082650001902095650002202114650001502136650001002151650001302161650001802174650001502192650001702207650001902224650002402243650001802267650001002285651001502295653001602310653001602326653001602342653001802358653001902376700001402395700001902409700002702428700002102455700001802476773010702494856008002601852000902681655001202690IND60563010920221118062809.0170223e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301092DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.44.2016.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHusenov, B.10aEvaluation and managing wheat seed-borne diseases: Options and suggestions from the case of Tajikistan  ap. 124-138.  aWheat seed-borne diseases are among the major constraints reducing crop yield and the quality of seed and grain. In this study we aimed to evaluate the type and prevalence of fungal seed-borne diseases in Tajik wheat seed samples. Particular emphasis was given to common bunt resistance in advanced wheat breeding materials. Furthermore, we aimed to identify options for improving the seed quality. Seed samples collected from two different locations in Tajikistan were tested by conventional seed-health testing methods for presence of seed-borne diseases. Nineteen advanced wheat breeding lines and three varieties collected from the Tajik wheat breeding program were screened using an artificial inoculation test for their response to common bunt. Significant differences were found between the locations and genotypes concerning presence of common bunt and black point. Fourteen fungal species, where most of them are pathogenic for wheat, were identified in the seed samples. Tilletia laevis , T. tritici , Bipolaris sorokiniana , Stemphylium spp., and Drechslera spp. were the major pathogenic fungi observed in collected wheat samples. Common bunt was predominantly represented by T. laevis . No strong resistance was found in the studied Tajik wheat material, although a low percentage of infection was found in one line (SHARK/ F4105W2.1), while the material was evaluated for common bunt resistance. In managing seed-borne diseases, breeding of resistant varieties should be given a priority, while cultural practices such as preventing contamination and monitoring seed health status should also be considered, as a last resort the use of chemical seed treatments are advised.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBipolaris sorokiniana 3aDrechslera 3aStemphylium 3aTilletia laevis 3abreeding 3abreeding lines 3abreeding programs 3acrop yield 3afungi 3agenotype 3ahealth status 3amonitoring 3aseed quality 3aseed treatment 3aseed-borne diseases 3asmut diseases 3awheat 3aTajikistan 0ablack point 0acommon bunt 0aseed health 0aTilletia spp. 0awheat breeding1 aAsaad, S.1 aMuminjanov, H.1 aGarkava-Gustavsson, L.1 aYorgancillar, A.1 aJohansson, E.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.124-138dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02007naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010300157300001800260520105000278592002801328650001401356650001301370650001601383650002201399650001301421650002301434700001401457700003001471773010801501856007501609852000901684655001201693IND60532797720221119171538.0160728e20141013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053279772DNAL7 a10.1021/bm500990z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Congcong10aPhotoreconfigurable Polymers for Biomedical Applications: Chemistry and Macromolecular Engineering  ap. 3474-3494.  aStimuli-responsive polymers play an important role in many biomedical technologies. Light responsive polymers are particularly desirable because the parameters of irradiated light and diverse photoactive chemistries produce a large number of combinations between functional materials and associated stimuli. This Review summarizes recent advances in utilizing photoactive chemistries in macromolecules for prospective use in biomedical applications. Special focus is granted to selection criterion when choosing photofunctional groups. Synthetic strategies to incorporate these functionalities into polymers and networks with different topologies are also highlighted herein. Prospective applications of these materials are discussed including programmable matrices for controlled release, dynamic scaffolds for tissue engineering, and functional coatings for medical devices.

Efforts to understand the mechanisms of synthesis and transport of cell wall materials have been generating valuable information for diverse practical applications. Nonetheless, the identity of the endomembrane components necessary for the transport of cell wall enzymes and polysaccharides is not well known. Evidence indicates that plant cells can accomplish secretion of cell wall constituents through multiple pathways during development or under stress conditions and, that compared with other eukaryotes, they rely on a highly diversified toolkit of proteins for membrane traffic. This suggests that production of the cell wall in plants consists of intricate and highly regulated pathways. In this review, we summarize important discoveries that have allowed the activities of the plant secretory pathway to be linked to the production and deposition of cell wall-synthesizing enzymes and polysaccharides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acell membranes 3acell wall components 3acell walls 3aendomembrane system 3aenzymes 3aeukaryotic cells 3aphysiological transport 3apolysaccharides 3aproteins 3asecretion 0aEndocytosis 0aExocyst complex 0aMicrotubule-associated cellulose synthase complex (MASC) 0aPectin 0aSecretion 0atrans-Golgi network (TGN)1 aBrandizzi, Federica0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.687-693dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pct1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03547naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003500132040001800167100001900185245016000204506017300364520156800537650002602105650001502131650002702146650001602173650001302189650001902202650001902221650001002240650002302250650002002273650001902293650002802312650002802340650002202368650001402390650003302404650001602437700002302453700001602476700002702492700001802519700002302537773012202560856011202682856008102794956012402875961000902999852000903008655001203017IND60005946220221214225024.0140801s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000594622DNAL7 a2912762aris7 a10113/594622hdl7 a10.4172/2157-7110.10002362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUkuku, Dike O.10aMembrane Damage and Viability Loss of E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp in Apple Juice Treated with High Hydrostatic Pressure and Thermal Death Time Disks  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aDifferences in membrane damage including leakage of intracellular UV-materials and loss of viability of Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 bacteria in apple juice following thermal death time disk (TDT) and high hydrostatic pressure treatments were investigated. Salmonella and E. coli O157H:H7 bacteria were inoculated in apple juice to a final 7.8 log CFU/ml and were thermally treated with TDT disks at 25, 35, 45, 50, 55 and 60 deg C for 4 min or pressurized at 350, 400 and 450 MPa at 25, 35, 45, 50, 55 and 60 deg C for 20 min. Sublethal injury, leakage of UV- materials including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and viability loss as a function of membrane damage of these bacterial pathogens were investigated. Also, scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize difference in membrane damage. Sub-lethal injury occurred in Salmonella and E. coli populations thermally treated with TDT disk at 55 deg C and above and at pressure treatments of 350 MPa and above. Leakage of intracellular UV-materials and ATP of thermal injured cells were lower than the values determined from pressurized cells. Similarly, recovery of thermal injured cells occurred faster than pressurized cells during storage of treated samples at 22 deg C. The results of this study indicate that pressure treatment of 350 MPa at 35 deg C for 20 min and thermal treatments of 55 and 60 deg C and immediate storage of treated samples at 5 deg C will inhibit recovery of injured bacteria in apple juice and therefore, will enhance the microbial safety of the treated juice. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella 3aadenosine triphosphate 3aapple juice 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3acell viability 3adeath 3afood contamination 3afood sanitation 3aheat treatment 3ahigh pressure treatment 3amicrobial contamination 3apathogen survival 3apathogens 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asterilizing1 aYamamoto, Kazutaka1 aBari, Md L.1 aMukhopadhaya, Sudarsan1 aJuneja, Vijay1 aKawamoto, Shinishi0 tJournal of food processing & technology.g2013, v. 04, no. 06dOMICS Publishing GroupwJournal:28364x2157-71107nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/594623Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4172/2157-7110.10002363Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://submit-u.nal.usda.gov/system/files/submissions/Ukuku-HHP-apple%20juice-JFP-PDF-paper-7-9-13.pdf  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle01428naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002100127024001900148040001800167100002300185245005800208300001200266506007600278520037400354592002800728506003700756650001000793650001300803650001200816650002200828650001500850650003400865773010300899856007901002852000901081655001201090IND60119477920221207130501.0141214e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011947792DNAL7 a10.1186/gb-2003-4-1-2012doi7 aPMC1512862pmcid7 a125402942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGresshoff, Peter M10aPost-genomic insights into plant nodulation symbioses  ap. 615.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSeveral legume genes involved in establishing nitrogen fixation have been discovered using functional genomics; when mutated, the genes affect symbioses, and all encode receptor kinases.

However, the functions and dynamics of the TGN in plant cells have not been well understood yet. To elucidate the dynamics of the plant TGN, we established transgenic plants expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)–SYP43, the ortholog of Tlg2/syntaxin16, which is localized to the TGN in yeast and mammalian cells, under the control of the native promoter as a TGN marker. Observation by confocal laser scanning microscopy and super-resolution confocal live imaging microscopy revealed two types of TGN in Arabidopsis root: the GA-TGNs (Golgi-associated TGNs), located on the trans -side of the Golgi apparatus, and the GI-TGNs (Golgi-released independent TGNs), located away from the Golgi apparatus and behaving independently. The GI-TGNs is derived from a population of GA-TGNs by segregation, although the core of the GA-TGN remains even after the generation of the GI-TGN. We further found that the abundance of the GI-TGNs differs between observed tissues. Our results indicate that the dynamic features of the TGN in plant cells differ from those of animal and yeast cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aGolgi apparatus 3aconfocal laser scanning microscopy 3aextracellular space 3agreen fluorescent protein 3aimage analysis 3amammals 3atissues 3atransgenic plants 3ayeasts 0aArabidopsis 0aLive imaging 0aSNARE 0aTGN1 aSuda, Yasuyuki1 aUeda, Takashi1 aNakano, Akihiko0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2014 Apr., v. 55, no. 4 p.694-703dJapanese Society of Plant Physiologists.x0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcu0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02070naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245009400155300002000249500001900269520087600288592002801164650003401192650002101226650001501247650001301262650000901275650001801284650001301302700001601315700001301331700001401344700002001358700002101378700001901399700001801418700001601436773012501452856007401577852000901651655001201660IND60688725520221120122951.0200416e20200401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068872552DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00666a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Lei10aPreparation of a porous graphite felt electrode for advance vanadium redox flow batteries  ap. 13374-13378.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRapid mass transfer and great electrochemical activity have become the critical points for designing electrodes in vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). In this research, we show a porous graphite felt (GF@P) electrode to improve the electrochemical properties of VRFBs. The generation of pores on graphite felt electrodes is based on etching effects of iron to carbon. The voltage and energy efficiencies of VRFB based on the GF@P electrode can reach 72.6% and 70.7% at a current density of 200 mA cm⁻², respectively, which are 8.3% and 7.9% better than that of untreated GF@U (graphite felt). Further, the VRFBs based on GF@P electrodes possess supreme stability after over 500 charge–discharge cycles at 200 mA cm⁻². The high-efficiency approach reported in this study offers a new strategy for designing high-performance electrode materials applied in VRFBs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agraphene 3airon 3amass transfer 3avanadium1 aYue, Junpei1 aDeng, Qi1 aLing, Wei1 aZhou, Chun-Jiao1 aZeng, Xian-Xiang1 aZhou, Congshan1 aWu, Xiong-Wei1 aWu, Yuping,0 tRSC advances.g2020 Apr. 01, v. 10, no. 23 p.13374-13378dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00666a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005400153245011000207500001900317520192800336592002802264650001902292650003002311650001902341650003302360650001402393650001602407650001102423650002102434650001602455650001502471650001502486651001002501653003102511653004402542653002502586653002402611653002102635700002002656700001702676700001602693700001802709700001402727773011902741856008802860852000902948655001202957IND60709366720221123015814.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5556-638410aTime-scale dependent mechanism of atmospheric CO2 concentration drivers of watershed water-energy balance  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (CO₂), as a key variable linking human activities and climate change, seriously affects the watershed hydrological processes. However, whether and how atmospheric CO₂ influences the watershed water-energy balance dynamics at multiple time scales have not been revealed. Based on long-term hydrometeorological data, the variation of non-stationary parameter n series in the Choudhury's equation in the mainstream of the Wei River Basin (WRB), the Jing River Basin (JRB) and Beiluo River Basin (BLRB), three typical Loess Plateau regions in China, was examined. Subsequently, the Empirical Mode Decomposition method was applied to explore the impact of CO₂ on watershed water-energy balance dynamics at multiple time scales. Results indicate that (1) in the context of warming and drying condition, annual n series in the WRB displays a significantly increasing trend, while that in the JRB and BLRB presents non-significantly decreasing trends; (2) the non-stationary n series was divided into 3-, 7-, 18-, exceeding 18-year time scale oscillations and a trend residual. In the WRB and BLRB, the overall variation of n was dominated by the residual, whereas in the JRB it was dominated by the 7-year time scale oscillation; (3) the relationship between CO₂ concentration and n series was significant in the WRB except for 3-year time scale. In the JRB, CO₂ concentration and n series were significantly correlated on the 7- and exceeding 7-year time scales, while in the BLRB, such a significant relationship existed only on the 18- and exceeding 18-year time scales. (4) CO₂-driven temperature rise and vegetation greening elevated the aridity index and evaporation ratio, thus impacting watershed water-energy balance dynamics. This study provided a deeper explanation for the possible impact of CO₂ concentration on the watershed hydrological processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon dioxide enrichment 3aclimate change 3adry environmental conditions 3aequations 3aevaporation 3ahumans 3ahydrometeorology 3atemperature 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aChina 0aElevated CO2 concentration 0aWatershed water-energy balance dynamics 0aMultiple time scales 0aVegetation dynamics 0aTemperature rise1 aHuang, Shengzhi1 aHuang, Qiang1 aPan, Baozhu1 aLeng, Guoyong1 aWang, Hao0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142132-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245008300166300001800249520129600267592002801563650001001591650001601601650001101617650002901628650001101657650002101668650001801689650002801707650001301735650002101748650003301769700002101802700001801823700002301841700002001864700002101884700002001905773009801925856008102023852000902104655001202113IND60439022920221119121750.0151024e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043902292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00705-015-2433-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDurán, Anyelo10aAssociation of lipid profile alterations with severe forms of dengue in humans  ap. 1687-1692.  aPrevious studies have shown a relationship between circulating lipids and dengue virus infection; however, the association of altered lipid profiles with severe dengue remains little studied. The aim of this study was to determine the association between circulating lipid content and severe dengue and/or platelet counts. Ninety-eight patients (2–66 years old) classified as having dengue without warning signs (DNWS), dengue with warning signs (DWWS), or severe dengue (SD) and 62 healthy individuals were studied. Blood samples were tested for NS1, anti-dengue IgM, platelet content, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (T), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Lipid alterations were observed mainly in patients with SD. Increased T and VLDL was observed in SD, and increased HDL was observed in DWWS and SD. Decreased TC was found in all forms of dengue, and the lowest LDL values were found in SD. Platelet counts were significantly decreased in DWWS and SD when compare to DNWS. A positive correlation (p = 0.019) between LDL values and platelet counts and a negative correlation (p = 0.0162) between VLDL values and platelet counts were found. Lipid profile alterations were associated with severe dengue.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood 3acholesterol 3adengue 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin M 3alipid content 3alow density lipoprotein 3apatients 3atriacylglycerols 3avery low density lipoprotein1 aCarrero, Rafaela1 aParra, Belkis1 aGonzález, Andrea,1 aDelgado, Lineth1 aMosquera, Jesús1 aValero, Nereida0 tArchives of virology.g2015 July, v. 160, no. 7 p.1687-1692dSpringer Viennax0304-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00705-015-2433-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03341naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006500147245010900212300001800321520185700339592002802196650001102224650001902235650002202254650001302276650001102289650001702300650001502317650001902332650001502351650001302366650000902379650001902388650001502407650002102422650001102443650001302454650001702467651001302484651001102497700003202508700001902540700004202559700001802601773013702619856008202756852000902838655001202847IND60594630220221120062737.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463022DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-017-1269-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMansur, AndressaVianna1http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4104-308510aAdapting to urban challenges in the Amazon: flood risk and infrastructure deficiencies in Belém, Brazil  ap. 1411-1426.  aSustainable urban infrastructure transition is perhaps the biggest challenge confronting cities in the global south in a time of climate change. Fast-growing cities are increasingly faced with deficiencies in the provisioning of public infrastructures, such as delivering water and sewage treatment and mitigating the risk of flooding to large segments of the population. Problems such as flooding encapsulate both structural and individual dimensions of adaptation. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework to analyze urban adaptation to increasing flood risk in the capital city of Belem in the Brazilian Amazon. Our analysis focuses on two domains of adaptive capacity to floods: generic capacity (provisioning of basic infrastructure and services) and specific capacity (effective flooding response, proactive strategies for risk reduction). We combined data from census sector and household semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, observational and archival data, and photo documentation to analyze both capacities in the city of Belém. Our findings indicated deficiency and intra-urban variability of both generic (water supply, sanitation, waste management, and adequate storm drainage) and specific capacities (specific individual and community and political actions for flood mitigation). However, significant inequalities exist across sectors of the population. Poorest urban sectors present higher deficits of generic adaptive capacity related to infrastructure. The expansion of vast areas of informal settlements, lack of basic infrastructure, and failed projects to reduce flood risk also challenge the specific adaptive capacity of households. A perception of corruption associated with public projects and high levels of violence also prevent cooperation and collective action among residents affected by flooding.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3aclimate change 3acollective action 3adrainage 3afloods 3afocus groups 3ahouseholds 3ainfrastructure 3ainterviews 3apolitics 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3asanitation 3asewage treatment 3astorms 3aviolence 3awater supply 3aAmazonia 3aBrazil1 aBrondizio, EduardoSonnewend1 aRoy, Samapriya1 ade Miranda Araújo Soares, PedroPaulo1 aNewton, Alice0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.1411-1426dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1269-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002700113040001800140100002100158245014100179300001600320500001500336520155700351592002801908650001401936650001501950650001901965650001101984650001301995650002102008650001902029653001502048700002102063700002002084773009402104856004002198852000902238655001202247IND50072292720221118064530.0140125e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007229272DNAL7 a242744292pmid7 a10.1111/mec.126022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauch, Christina10aWithin the genome, long telomeres are more informative than short telomeres with respect to fitness components in a long‐lived seabird  ap. 300-310.  a2019-12-06  aTelomeres, DNA‐protein structures at chromosome ends, shorten with age, and telomere length has been linked to age‐related diseases and survival. In vitro studies revealed that the shortest telomeres trigger cell senescence, but whether the shortest telomeres are also the best biomarker of ageing is not known. We measured telomeres in erythrocytes of wild common terns Sterna hirundo using terminal restriction fragment analysis. This yields a distribution of telomere lengths for each sample, and we investigated how different telomere subpopulations (percentiles) varied in their relation to age and fitness proxies. Longer telomeres within a genome lost more base pairs with age and were better predictors of survival than shorter telomeres. Likewise, fitness proxies such as arrival date at the breeding grounds and reproductive success were best predicted by telomere length at the higher percentiles. Our finding that longer telomeres within a genome predict fitness components better than the shorter telomeres indicates that they are a more informative ageing biomarker. This finding contrasts with the fact that cell senescence is triggered by the shortest telomeres. We suggest that this paradox arises, because longer telomeres lose more base pairs per unit time and thus better reflect the various forms of stress that accelerate telomere shortening, and that telomeres primarily function as biomarker because their shortening reflects cumulative effects of various stressors rather than reflecting telomere‐induced cell senescence.  aPublisher supplied data 3atelomeres 3abiomarkers 3abreeding sites 3agenome 3aseabirds 3ain vitro studies 3aSterna hirundo 0asenescence1 aBecker, Peter H.1 aVerhulst, Simon0 tMolecular ecology.g2014 Feb., v. 23, no. 2 p.300-310dBlackwell Sciencex0962-10837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.12602  aDNAL 7aarticle02730naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245016100207300001800368506007600386520157400462592002802036506003702064650001902101650001102120650002002131650001202151651001302163773013702176856008202313852000902395655001202404IND60594630420221207122204.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463042DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-017-1273-72doi7 aPMC64483552pmcid7 a310075952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReckien, Diana10aWhat is in an index?

Calculating social vulnerability usually involves the construction of a composite index, for which several construction methods have been suggested. However, thorough investigation of results across methods or applied weighting of vulnerability factors is largely missing. This study investigates the outcome of the variable addition—both with and without weighting of single vulnerability factors—and the variable reduction approach/model on social vulnerability indices calculated for New York City. Weighting is based on scientific assessment reports on climate change impacts in New York City. Additionally, the study calculates the outcome on social vulnerability when using either area-based (person/km²) or population-based (%) input data. The study reveals remarkable differences between indices particularly when using different methods but also when using different metrics as input data. The variable addition model has deductive advantages, whereas the variable reduction model is useful when the strength of factors of social vulnerability is unknown. The use of area-based data seems preferable to population-based data when differences are taken as a measure of credibility and quality. Results are important for all forms of vulnerability mapping using index construction techniques.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclimate change 3amodels 3arisk assessment 3aweather 3aNew York0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.1439-1451dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-017-1273-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03157naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245017100170300001200341520160000353592002801953650000801981650001301989650002502002650001902027650002002046650001002066650001602076650001602092650001702108650001302125650002702138650004302165650000902208650005202217650001002269650001302279650001702292650000902309650001702318653001702335653000902352653001302361653001502374653002002389700001902409700001802428773008502446856008702531852000902618655001202627IND60585826320221120182220.0190202e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058582632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.peptides.2017.11.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, Masum10aOsteoanabolic activity of whey-derived anti-oxidative (MHIRL and YVEEL) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory (YLLF, ALPMHIR, IPA and WLAHK) bioactive peptides  ap. 1-7.  aExploring bone rebuilding anabolic agents has been gaining much attention due to their potential therapeutic effects in treating several bone disorders including osteoporosis. Whey protein has been reported to affect bone health osteoanabolically, in terms of proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells. This study investigates whether whey derived anti-oxidative (AO) (P1- MHIRL, P2- YVEEL) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory (ACE inhibitory) (P3- YLLF, P4-ALPMHIR, P5-IPA, P6- WLAHK) bioactive peptides affect the proliferation and differentiation of primary osteoblast cells isolated from rat calvaria. The proliferation and osteogenic activity of osteoblast cells in presence of these peptides were determined by MTT assay, DNA quantification study, Alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP) and ALP staining, Alizarin red activity and staining, and secretory osteocalcin measurement. The expression of osteogenesis-related genes (COLI-α, ALP, OCN and RUNX2) were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis over a period of 21days. The peptide treated osteoblasts showed a significant increase in viable cell density and proliferation in the order of P2>P6>P3 at optimised concentration. Furthermore, the osteoblastic differentiation markers in response to these peptides were found to be significantly up regulated in the order of P2>P6>P3 when compared to the controls. These results demonstrated that bioactive whey-derived AO and ACE inhibitory peptides can play a potential therapeutic role in osteoporosis by activating osteoblasts anabolically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aalizarin 3aalkaline phosphatase 3acell viability 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3aosteoblasts 3aosteocalcin 3aosteoporosis 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3askull 3astaining 3atherapeutics 3awhey 3awhey protein 0aOsteoporosis 0aWhey 0aPeptides 0aOsteoblast 0aDifferentiation1 aKapila, Rajeev1 aKapila, Suman0 tPeptides.g2018 Jan., v. 99 p.1-7dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2017.11.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03715naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245011400211300001600325520198700341592002802328650004702356650002202403650003002425650001602455650001402471650002002485650001702505650001202522650002102534650001902555650001902574650002502593650001302618650001302631650001202644651001002656651001002666653000802676653000702684653001502691653003502706653002802741653002402769700002402793700002002817700002002837700002402857700005902881700001802940773009602958856008603054852000903140655001203149IND60531899920221119153744.0190319e20160112xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053189992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNakamura, Kazuya1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4113-157910aDevelopment of a high-yield reassortant influenza vaccine virus derived from the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) strain  ap. 328-333.  aIn April 2013, the first three fatal cases of human infection with an avian influenza A virus (H7N9) were reported in China. Because of a pandemic threat by this virus, we have commenced to develop candidate vaccine viruses (CVVs). Three 6:2 genetic reassortant viruses with different hemagglutinin (HA) sequences, NIIDRG-10, -10.1 and -10.2, were generated by a reverse genetics technique between the high egg-growth master virus, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9), kindly provided by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The different HA gene sequences of the three CVVs were derived from the original virus stock. NIIDRG-10 possesses HA, whose sequence is identical to that of the original A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) in the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (EPI439507), while NIIDRG-10.1 and -10.2 possess amino acid differences, A125T and N123D/N149D, respectively, compared with NIIDRG-10. NIIDRG-10 replicated in embryonated chicken eggs with low hemagglutination titer 128, whereas NIIDRG-10.1 and -10.2 grew well with hemagglutination titer 1024. These viruses reacted well with a ferret antiserum raised against the original A/Anhui/1/2013 virus. Ferret antiserum against NIIDRG-10.1 reacted well with A/Anhui/1/2013 similar to the homologous virus NIIDRG-10.1. These results indicated that NIIDRG-10.1 passed the two-way test of antigenic identity. In contrast, the ferret antiserum against NIIDRG-10.2 reacted with A/Anhui/1/2013 at an 8-fold lower hemagglutination inhibition titer than with the homologous virus NIIDRG-10.2, indicating an antigenic change. The total and HA protein yields of NIIDRG-10.1 were 14.7 and 6.9μg/ml, respectively, similar to those levels of high-yield seed viruses of seasonal influenza vaccines. NIIDRG-10.1 was approved as one of the CVVs for H7N9 viruses by the WHO in 2013. The candidate vaccine derived from NIIDRG-10.1 is currently being evaluated in a phase II clinical study in Japan.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCenters for Disease Control and Prevention 3aInfluenza A virus 3aWorld Health Organization 3aamino acids 3aantiserum 3aavian influenza 3achicken eggs 3aferrets 3ahemagglutination 3ahemagglutinins 3ahuman diseases 3anucleotide sequences 3apandemic 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aChina 3aJapan 0aCVV 0aHA 0aMDCK cells 0aAvian influenza A (H7N9) virus 0aCandidate vaccine virus 0aViral quasi-species1 aShirakura, Masayuki1 aSuzuki, Yasushi1 aNaito, Tadasuke1 aFujisaki, Seiichiro1 aTashiro, Masato1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8133-12631 aNobusawa, Eri0 tVaccine.g2016 Jan. 12, v. 34, no. 3 p.328-333dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2015.11.0503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011700165500002200282520154200304592002801846650002401874650002101898650001301919650001401932650001701946650001401963650001501977650001401992650001402006650001402020650002402034650001802058650000902076650001902085650001102104653001302115653002902128653001902157653001502176653000802191653000802199653000902207653000802216653000802224653001402232653000902246700001702255700001202272700001902284700001802303700005702321773032002378856005102698852000902749655001202758IND60795542620221117210921.0221004e20220921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079554262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.09.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Tianqi10aUse of fish oil and mortality of patients with cardiometabolic multimorbidity: A prospective study of UK biobank  aPre-press version  aCardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) has risen as a global issue of public health, with an in-creasing prevalence and more severe clinical prognosis. This study aimed to estimate the association between use of fish oil and mortality among patients with CMM. In this prospective study based on UK Biobank, participants with ≥2 of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs, including coronary heart disease [CHD], diabetes, hypertension, and stroke in this study) at recruitment were included. Use of fish oil was derived from touchscreen questionnaires at baseline. All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were accessed via electronic health-related records. Kaplan–Meier curves and flexible parametric Royston-Parmar proportion-hazard models were fitted to assess the as-sociations of fish-oil use with all-cause, cardiovascular mortality, and related life expectancy alterations. Among 30 068 participants from UK Biobank (67.9% men; mean age 61.75 years), 5357 deaths were reported during 12.03 years of follow-up. For patients with CMM, use of fish oil was associated with a 17% lower risk of all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.78–0.88, P < 0.001), and 19% lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (95% CI 0.72–0.90, P < 0.001) in multivariable-adjusted models. At 45 years old, using fish oil was associated with 1.66 years of life expectancy gained. Among patients with CMM, use of fish oil was associated with a significantly reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular mortality, and prolonged life expectancy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconfidence interval 3acoronary disease 3adiabetes 3afish oils 3ahypertension 3alongevity 3ametabolism 3amortality 3anutrition 3aprognosis 3aprospective studies 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3astroke 0aFish oil 0aCardiometabolic diseases 0aMultimorbidity 0aUK Biobank 0aBMI 0aCHD 0aCMDs 0aCMM 0aICD 0an-3 PUFAs 0aRMST1 aHe, Lingfang1 aLuo, Yi1 aZhang, Guogang1 aCheng, Xunjie1 aBai, Yongping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6355-58420 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Sept. 21, dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.09.016  aDNAL 7aarticle03431naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245013800167500001900305520174000324592002802064650001202092650001102104650001802115650001302133650001402146650002102160650004902181650001602230650001302246650002202259650001902281650001402300650001102314650000702325650001502332653001902347653002902366653000902395653005102404700005402455700001902509700005902528700001802587700001602605700001702621700001802638700001702656773011902673856008802792852000902880655001202889IND60709367020221121223248.0210624e20210201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070936702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Chen10aBiochar cathode: Reinforcing electro-Fenton pathway against four-electron reduction by controlled carbonization and surface chemistry  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPorous biochars have attracted tremendous interests in electrochemical applications. In this study, a family of biochars were prepared from cellulose subject to different carbonization temperatures ranging from 400 to 700 °C, and the biochars were in-situ activated by a molten salt (ZnCl₂) to construct a hierarchically porous architecture. The activated porous biochars (ZnBC) were used as a carbocatalyst for electro-Fenton (EF) oxidation of organic contaminants. Results showed that high-temperature carbonization improved the activity of biochar for four-electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to the rich carbon defects, while the mild-temperature treatment regulated the species and distribution of oxygen functional groups to increase the production of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) via a selective two-electron ORR pathway. ZnBC-550 was the best cathode material with a high ORR activity without compromise in H₂O₂ selectivity; a high production rate of H₂O₂ (796.1 mg/g/h) was attained at −0.25 V vs RHE at pH of 1. Furthermore, Fe(II) addition induced an electro-Fenton system to attain fast decomposition of various organic pollutants at −0.25 V vs RHE (reversible hydrogen electrode) and pH of 3 with a satisfactory mineralization efficiency toward phenolic pollutants. The EF system maintains its excellent stability for 10 cycles. Hydroxyl radicals were identified as the dominant reactive oxygen species based on in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis and radical quenching tests. This study gains new insights into electrocatalytic H₂O₂ production over porous biochars and provides a low-cost, robust and high-performance electro-Fenton cathode for wastewater purification.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochar 3acarbon 3acarbonization 3acathodes 3acellulose 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenvironment 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amineralization 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3apH 3awastewater 0aPorous biochar 0aElectro-Fenton oxidation 0aH2O2 0aHydroxyl radical, advanced oxidation processes1 aChen, Tong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8319-11421 aHuang, Qunxing1 aDuan, Xiaoguang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9635-58071 aZhan, Mingxiu1 aJi, Longjie1 aLi, Xiaodong1 aWang, Shaobin1 aYan, Jianhua0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 01, v. 754 p.142136-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1421363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03120naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166500002200277506010400299506007600403520161700479592002802096506003702124650002202161650001902183650002102202650001502223650004302238650001402281650001802295650002502313650001902338653002202357653001702379653002402396653001202420653001802432700002202450700002202472773012002494856005102614852000902665655001202674IND60795542720221207124925.0221004e20220922xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079554272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.09.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Yinjie10aSocio-economic gradients in diagnosed and undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes and its related health complications  aPre-press version  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDiagnosed and undiagnosed Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) remains a challenge in high-income countries. In addition, the presence of T2D can cause further disease burden because of its high susceptibility to complications. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence of socio-economic gradients in undiagnosed T2D and its complications in a large population cohort. We investigated this using the Dutch Lifelines Cohort Study (Lifelines). Within Lifelines, baseline data of 102 163 adults aged 30 and above were collected from 2007 to 2013. The associations of Socio-Economic Status (SES), indicated by monthly household income, with the prevalence of T2D status and the number of T2D complications were assessed using multinomial Poisson and linear regressions with adjustments for age and sex. The prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed T2D was, respectively, 3.0% and 3.0% in the low SES group compared to 1.1% and 1.8% in the high SES group. Individuals with lower SES were at higher risk of having undiagnosed T2D (relative risk ratio (rrr) [95% CI]: 1.63 [1.47-1.81] for low SES and 1.16 [1.05-1.29] for middle SES) and diagnosed T2D, compared with those with high SES. Lower SES was positively associated with the number of T2D complications (low SES vs. high SES (ref); B [95% CI]: 0.15 [0.13-0.16]). Complementing the known socio-economic gradients in diagnosed T2D, we document socio-economic gradients in undiagnosed T2D and T2D complications in a single, large general representative population. Furthermore, individuals with low SES with diagnosed or undiagnosed T2D were more susceptible to T2D complications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aburden of disease 3acohort studies 3ahousehold income 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anutrition 3arelative risk 3asocioeconomic status 3asocioeconomics 0aDiabetes Mellitus 0aEpidemiology 0aHealth inequalities 0aPoverty 0aPublic Health1 aDekker, Louise H.1 aMierau, Jochen O.0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Sept. 22, dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.09.018  aDNAL 7aarticle03274naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002700142245014900169300001800318500001400336520171700350592002802067650002002095650001002115650001202125650001802137650001802155650002402173650001102197650001702208650002102225650002002246650001102266653002602277653003202303653003402335700001902369700001802388700001502406700001902421700001702440700001702457700001902474700001702493700002102510773015202531856007602683852000902759655001202768IND60710106120221116194330.0200908e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010612DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-36822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKushwaha, Manish Kumar10aUse of scrotal infrared thermography and ultrasonography to understand thermoregulation of testis and sperm quality in Karan Fries breeding bull  ap. 1420-1424.  aNAL-light  aThe present investigation was carried out to study the effect of testicular covering thickness, scrotal circumference and scrotal surface temperature gradient insert semen quality attributes of Karan Fries breeding bull. Six ejaculates were collected from each randomly selected bulls (n=15) and seminal quality attributes were evaluated during peak winter season. Same time scrotal surface temperature gradient (SSTG), the thickness of testicular covering (TTC) and scrotal circumference (SC) of individual bulls were recorded using DarviDTL007 infrared thermography camera, ultrasonography and measuring tape, respectively. Three groups were formed based on SSTG (Group I-# 4ºC, Group II-4.1 to 6.8ºC and Group III-#6.9ºC), two groups based on TTC (Group I-3.03 to 4.85 and Group II-4.86 to 7.03 mm) and SC (Group I-32 to 35 and Group II-36 to 41 cm). Ejaculate rejection rate (ERR) was significantly decreased with the increase of SSTG and SC. ERR was not affected with TTC. The increase of SSTG (from Group I to Group III), mass activity and non-eosinophilic sperm count weresignificantly increased, and sperm abnormalities were significantly (p<0.01)decreased. Similarly, with the increase of SSTG and abnormalities were significantly (p<0.01) increased among different groups. Ejaculate volume and non-eosinophilic sperm count were significantly (p<0.01) increased with SC group I and group II. It can be concluded that scrotal surface temperature gradient wasa better indicator ofsemen quality ascomparedto the thicknessof testicular covering and bulls having a higher scrotal surface temperature gradient, scrotal circumference and lower thickness of testicular covering produced better quality semen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal research 3abulls 3acameras 3asemen quality 3asperm quality 3asurface temperature 3atestes 3athermography 3athermoregulation 3aultrasonography 3awinter 0aScrotal circumference 0aScrotal surface temperature 0aTesticular covering thickness1 aBhakat, Mukesh1 aMohanty, T.K.1 aKumar, Raj1 aSinha, Ranjana1 aRahim, Abdul1 aSingh, Pawan1 aKhosla, Kavita1 aShah, Nadeem1 aDanish, Ziaullah0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2019 Nov., v. 53, no. 11 p.1420-1424dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-36823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02935naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100005800147245008700205300001800292520177500310592002802085650001102113650001202124650001602136650002002152650001902172650001102191650001102202650002402213650001602237650002402253650001102277651002502288700002002313773013702333856008202470852000902552655001202561IND60594630720221120062612.0180619e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059463072DNAL7 a10.1007/s10113-018-1290-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLionello, Piero1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0779-568114aThe relation between climate change in the Mediterranean region and global warming  ap. 1481-1493.  aThe recent (twentieth century) and future (twenty-first century) climate evolution in the Mediterranean region is analyzed in relation to annual mean global surface temperature change. The CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5) simulations, the CRU (Climate Research Unit) observational gridded dataset, and two twentieth century reanalyzes (ECMWF, European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasts) and NOAA ESRL (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Earth System Research Laboratory) are used. These datasets to large extent agree that in the twentieth century: (a) Mediterranean regional and global temperatures have warmed at a similar rate until the 1980s and (b) decadal variability determines a large uncertainty that prevents to identify long-term links between precipitation in the Mediterranean region and global temperature. However, in the twenty-first century, as mean global temperature increases, in the Mediterranean region, precipitation will decrease at a rate around − 20 mm/K or − 4%/K and temperature will warm 20% more than the global average. Warming will be particularly large in summer (approximately 50% larger than global warming) and for the land areas located north of the basin (locally up to 100% larger than global warming). Reduction of precipitation will affect all seasons in the central and southern Mediterranean areas, with maximum reduction for winter precipitation (− 7 mm/K or − 7%/K for the southern Mediterranean region). For areas along the northern border of the Mediterranean region, reduction will be largest in summer (− 7 mm/K or − 9%/K for the whole northern Mediterranean region), while they will not experience a significant reduction of precipitation in winter.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3aclimate 3aclimatology 3adata collection 3aglobal warming 3amodels 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3auncertainty 3aweather forecasting 3awinter 3aMediterranean region1 aScarascia, Luca0 tRegional environmental change.g2018 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.1481-1493dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:J000000303x1436-37987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-018-1290-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03429naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001500146245011500161300001400276520186800290592002802158650002102186650002502207650002502232650001802257650001302275650001402288650002002302650002002322650001402342650002202356650001002378650001102388650001102399650001902410650001502429650002102444650001502465650001302480650001502493650001202508650000902520650002502529650001402554653001702568653001702585653001502602653000902617653002802626700001502654773010502669856008002774852000902854655001202863IND60563011720221118062953.0170223e201703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301172DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.44.2016.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsthir, B.10aModulation of antioxidant defense system and polyamine catabolism in rice leaves under two planting conditions  ap. 57-67.  aAerobic rice offers an attractive alternative approach over transplanting system as it consumes less water with low labour expenses. Flag leaf of six rice cultivars, viz. PR 120, PR 115, PR 116, Feng Ai Zan, PAU 201 and Punjab Mehak 1 was analysed for antioxidant defence mechanism and polyamine catabolism under the aerobic and the transplanting conditions. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), diamine oxidase (DAO) and polyamine oxidase (PAO) activities increased gradually from tillering to anthesis stage and then declined towards maturity stage under both planting conditions. Apparently, contents of ascorbic acid, α-tocopherol, proline and polyamines (PAs) also revealed similar trend. The aerobic condition elevated activities of PAO, SOD as well as contents of PAs, lipid peroxide and H ₂O ₂ whereas the transplanting condition had higher levels of APX, GPX, CAT and total antioxidant activities and contents of ascorbate, α-tocopherol and proline. Cultivars Feng Ai Zan, PR 115 and PR 120 exhibited superior tolerance over other cultivars by accumulating higher contents of PAs with increasing levels of PAO and SOD activities under the aerobic condition. However, under the transplanting condition PR 116 and PAU 201 showed higher activities of antioxidative enzymes with decreasing contents of lipid peroxide and H ₂O ₂. We infer that under the aerobic condition, enhancement of PAs and PAO activity enabled rice cultivars to tolerate oxidative stress, while under the transplanting condition, antioxidative defence system with decreasing of lipid peroxide content was closely associated with the protection of flag leaf by maintaining membrane integrity. In crux, results indicated that H ₂O ₂ metabolic machinery was strongly up-regulated especially at the anthesis stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbate peroxidase 3aascorbic acid 3acatalase 3acultivars 3adiamine oxidase 3aenzyme activity 3aflowering 3ahydrogen peroxide 3alabor 3aleaves 3alipids 3amaturity stage 3ametabolism 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aplanting 3apolyamines 3aproline 3arice 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atillering 0aantioxidants 0aaerobic rice 0apolyamines 0arice 0atransplanted conditions1 aKumari, M.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 Mar., v. 45, no. 1 p.57-67dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011800171300001600289520140600305592002801711650002301739650001101762650001901773650001601792650001101808650001701819650001101836650001301847650001201860650002501872650001601897650001001913700003501923700001901958700002601977773010202003856004802105852000902153655001202162IND50072203120221118123502.0140214e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007220312DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-013-1418-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRios, Jonas Alberto10aPhotosynthetic gas exchange in leaves of wheat plants supplied with silicon and infected with Pyricularia oryzae   ap. 371-379.  aPhotosynthetic gas exchange in the leaves of wheat plants growing in a nutrient solution containing 0 or 2 mM silicon (Si) and inoculated with Pyricularia oryzae was investigated. The blast severity, the gas exchange parameters such as net carbon assimilation rate (A), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g (s)), internal CO2 concentration (C (i)) and transpiration rate (E) and the concentration of pigments (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids) were determined. The blast severity was reduced by 67.66 % on +Si plants compared with the -Si plants. There were significant increases of 29.3, 17.7 and 45 % for A at 48, 72 and 96 h after inoculation (hai); 26.7 and 49 % for g (s) at 48 and 96 hai; and 25.2 and 31.4 % for E at 48 and 96 hai, respectively, for +Si inoculated plants when compared with the -Si inoculated plants. The C (i) was significantly lower for +Si inoculated plants than for -Si inoculated plants at 48, 72 and 96 hai. For inoculated plants, the concentrations of chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b were significantly higher for the +Si plants compared with the -Si plants at 72 and 96 hai. The results of this study clearly demonstrated that the supply of Si to the wheat plants was associated with lower blast severity in parallel with improved gas exchange performance, resulting in higher energy for mounting successful defense strategies against P. oryzae infection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMagnaporthe oryzae 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorophyll 3aenergy 3agas exchange 3aleaves 3apigments 3asilicon 3astomatal conductance 3awater vapor 3awheat1 aRodrigues, Fabrício de Ávila1 aDebona, Daniel1 aSilva, Leandro Castro0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2014 Feb., v. 36, no. 2 p.371-379dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-013-1418-3  aDNAL 7aarticle03008naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245009500163300001600258520163600274592002801910650000901938650001401947650001801961650001301979650001601992650001902008651001202027653002502039653004002064653001602104653002002120653002602140700001502166700001302181700001502194700001602209700001402225700002002239700001602259700001702275700002102292700001702313773010702330856008002437852000902517655001202526IND60563011820221118062908.0170627e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056301182DNAL7 a10.1556/0806.44.2016.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOyekunle, M.10aStability analysis of maize cultivars adapted to tropical environments using AMMI analysis  ap. 336-345.  aGenotype × environment interactions complicate selection of superior genotypes for narrow and wide adaptation. Eighteen tropically-adapted maize cultivars were evaluated at six locations in Nigeria for 2 yrs to (i) identify superior and stable cultivars across environments and (ii) assess relationships among test environments. Environment and genotype × environment interactions (GEI) were significant (P < 0·05) for grain yield. Environments accounted for 63.5% of the total variation in the sum of squares for grain yield, whereas the genotype accounted for 3.5% and GEI for 32.8%. Grain yield of the cultivars ranged from 2292 kg ha–1 for DTSTR-W SYN2 to 2892 kg ha ⁻¹ for TZL COMP4 C3 DT C2 with an average of 2555 kg ha ⁻¹. Cultivar DT SYN2-Y had the least additive main effect and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) stability value of 7.4 and hence the most stable but low-yielding across environments. AMMI biplot explained 90.5% and classified cultivars and environments into four groups each. IWD C3 SYN F3 was identified as the high-yielding and stable cultivar across environments. ZA15, ZA14, BK14, BK15 and IL15 had environment mean above the grand mean, while BG14, BG15, LE14, LE15, IL14, LA14 and LA15 had mean below the grand mean. ZA, BK, BG, LE and LA were found to be consistent in ranking the maize cultivars. However, Zaria, Birnin Kudu, and Ilorin were identified as the best test locations and could be used for selecting the superior maize cultivars. The identified high-yielding and stable cultivar could be further tested and promoted for adoption to contribute to food insecurity in Nigeria.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorn 3acultivars 3afood security 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ainterleukin-15 3aNigeria 0aAMMI stability value 0agenotype × environment interaction 0agrain yield 0amaize cultivars 0amultiple environments1 aMenkir, A.1 aMani, H.1 aOlaoye, G.1 aUsman, I.S.1 aAdo, S.G.1 aAbdullahi, U.S.1 aAhmed, H.O.1 aHassan, L.B.1 aAbdulmalik, R.O.1 aAbubakar, H.0 tCereal research communications.g2017 June, v. 45, no. 2 p.336-345dAkadémiai Kiadóx1788-91707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/0806.44.2016.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024002200130024001900152040001800171100002500189245013700214300002200351506007600373520119600449592002801645506003701673650000801710650002501718650001901743650001401762650001901776650001901795650001201814650001301826650001401839650001601853650001201869653003201881653001601913653003901929653002601968653002801994653002002022653002802042653002602070653002802096653001402124700002502138700001602163700002502179700002002204700001802224700001702242700001802259700002102277700002202298700002502320700002402345700001702369700002202386700002202408700001702430700002402447700002302471700001702494700005802511773010202569856008302671852000902754655001202763IND60676622820221207090657.0191214e20191127xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067662282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.0442doi7 aPMC71754112pmcid7 a317596982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aValencia, Alfredo M.10aRecurrent SMARCB1 Mutations Reveal a Nucleosome Acidic Patch Interaction Site That Potentiates mSWI/SNF Complex Chromatin Remodeling  ap. 1342-1356.e23.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMammalian switch/sucrose non-fermentable (mSWI/SNF) complexes are multi-component machines that remodel chromatin architecture. Dissection of the subunit- and domain-specific contributions to complex activities is needed to advance mechanistic understanding. Here, we examine the molecular, structural, and genome-wide regulatory consequences of recurrent, single-residue mutations in the putative coiled-coil C-terminal domain (CTD) of the SMARCB1 (BAF47) subunit, which cause the intellectual disability disorder Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS), and are recurrently found in cancers. We find that the SMARCB1 CTD contains a basic α helix that binds directly to the nucleosome acidic patch and that all CSS-associated mutations disrupt this binding. Furthermore, these mutations abrogate mSWI/SNF-mediated nucleosome remodeling activity and enhancer DNA accessibility without changes in genome-wide complex localization. Finally, heterozygous CSS-associated SMARCB1 mutations result in dominant gene regulatory and morphologic changes during iPSC-neuronal differentiation. These studies unmask an evolutionarily conserved structural role for the SMARCB1 CTD that is perturbed in human disease.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aamino acid sequences 3adominant genes 3aequipment 3aheterozygosity 3ahuman diseases 3amammals 3amutation 3aneoplasms 3anucleosomes 3asucrose 0amammalian SWI/SNF complexes 0aBAF complex 0aATP-dependent chromatin remodeling 0aCoffin-Siris syndrome 0aintellectual disability 0aSMARCB1 (BAF47) 0anucleosome acidic patch 0anucleosome remodeling 0achromatin accessibility 0astructure1 aCollings, Clayton K.1 aDao, Hai T.1 aSt. Pierre, Roodolph1 aZheng, Yongzhi,1 aHuang, Junwei1 aSun, Zhen-Yu1 aSeo, Hyuk-Soo1 aMashtalir, Nazar1 aComstock, Dawn E.1 aBolonduro, Olubusayo1 aVangos, Nicholas E.1 aYeoh, Zoe C.1 aDornon, Mary Kate1 aHermawan, Crystal1 aBarrett, Lee1 aDhe-Paganon, Sirano1 aWoolf, Clifford J.1 aMuir, Tom W.1 aKadoch, Cigall1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4058-59850 tCell.g2019 Nov. 27, v. 179, no. 6 p.1342-1356.e23dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11769x0092-86747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02780naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245013300178300001600311520137700327592002801704650001101732650001701743650001901760650002001779650001701799650001801816650002201834650001501856650001301871650001501884650001601899650002701915650002601942650005801968650001302026650002502039700001902064700002602083700001602109700002202125773008102147856008502228852000902313655001202322IND60088451420221121151058.0141102e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008845142DNAL7 a10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.12.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCervantes Cianca, R.C.10aReversed-phase HPLC/FD method for the quantitative analysis of the neurotoxin BMAA (β-N-methylamino-l-alanine) in cyanobacteria  ap. 379-384.  aA method has been developed and optimized in order to detect and quantify the non-protein amino acid β-N-methylamino-l-alanine(BMAA) in cyanobacteria. The novelty of the method is that we have used methanol instead of acetonitrile as the eluent. The method includes extraction with 0.1 M trichloroacetic acid (free BMAA) or protein hydrolysis with 6 M hydrochloric acid (total BMAA), derivatization with AQC (6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography analysis with fluorescence detection (HPLC/FD). Detection limits ranged from 0.35 to 0.75 pg injected, while quantification limits ranged from 1.10 to 2.55 pg injected for total and free BMAA hydrolysis, respectively. The linear response range was up to 850 pmol in both methods, embracing three orders of magnitude. The method was successfully applied to a lyophilized estuarine species of Nostoc (LEGE 06077). All previous published methods for BMAA quantification, using HPLC/FD, have reported the usage of acetonitrile. This is the first report using methanol as the mobile phase. Although the elution strength differs with both solvents, the final method proved efficient for the quantification of BMAA in this complex sample. The method resulted effective, low-priced, and simple, being suitable for routine monitoring of BMAA in cyanobacteria.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNostoc 3aacetonitrile 3aderivatization 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3afreeze drying 3ahydrochloric acid 3ahydrolysis 3amethanol 3amonitoring 3aneurotoxins 3anonprotein amino acids 3aquantitative analysis 3areversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography 3asolvents 3atrichloroacetic acid1 aBaptista, M.S.1 ada Silva, Luís Pinto1 aLopes, V.R.1 aVasconcelos, V.M.0 tToxicon.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 59, no. 3 p.379-384dElsevier Ltdx0041-01017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.12.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02205naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245013100160300001800291500001400309520094600323592002801269650001801297650001401315650001801329650002001347650002301367650002501390650001101415653000801426653001401434653002001448653001001468653001101478700002301489700002701512700002001539773015201559856007501711852000901786655001201795IND60710106720221116194213.0200908e201911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071010672DNAL7 a10.18805/ijar.B-8632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozlu, Tolunay10aImmunohestochemical staaning of cd3, cd79αcy and s-100 on bursa fabricius, thymus and spleen of turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo)  ap. 1450-1454.  aNAL-light  aDistribution of CD3, CD79ácy and S-100, immunohistochemically, in the bursa of Fabricius, thymus and spleen has not been reported in turkeys. Therefore, we determined the localisation of anti-CD3 protein antibodies for mature T-lymphocytes, anti-CD79αcy antibodies for B-lymphocytes and anti-S-100 protein antibodies for follicular dentritic cells in the bursa of Fabricius, thymus and spleen, which are the lymphoid organs, in a study sample of turkeys. Triple staining method was applied to demonstrate the general structure. Moreover, in all the organs positive reactions were observed with the CD3, CD79αcy and S-100 antibodies. It was also found that similar areas had a positive reaction with CD79αcy and S-100 in all of the tested organs. It was remarkable that CD79αcy reacted positively on Hassall's corpuscles (strongly) and the reticular cells (weakly) in the medulla of the thymus instead of the B-lymphocyte positive areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aMeleagris 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal research 3abursa of Fabricius 3aimmunohistochemistry 3aspleen 0aCD3 0aCD79 αcy 0aLymphoid tissue 0aS-100 0aTurkey1 aSari, Ebru Karadag1 aBozkurt, Yesim Akaydin1 aKurtdede, Nevin0 tIndian journal of animal research.g2019 Nov., v. 53, no. 11 p.1450-1454dAgricultural Research Communication CentrewJournal:2025x0976-05557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.18805/ijar.B-8633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02800naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245013700163300001800300500002000318520134300338592002801681650001001709650001701719650002701736650001601763650001701779650001101796650002301807650002001830650001401850650002301864650001501887650001401902650001301916650002901929650002001958650001701978650001601995700002002011700001302031700001702044700002102061700001902082773012302101856007302224852000902297655001202306IND60587840020221117165525.0180102e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058784002DNAL7 a10.1111/are.128442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Cheng‐Rong10aEffects of different dietary amino acid patterns on growth performance and body composition of juvenile giant croaker Nibea japonica  ap. 3942-3951.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aA feeding trial was conducted to investigate the effects of different dietary amino acid patterns on growth performance, feed utilization and body composition of juvenile Nibea japonica. Four semi‐purified diets were formulated to simulate the dietary amino acid profiles of juvenile giant croaker whole body protein (GCP), Peru fishmeal protein (PFP), red sea bream eggs protein (REP) and soybean meal protein (SMP) by supplementing with pre‐coated crystalline amino acids (CAA). A control diet contained only intact protein sources provided by the fishmeal and casein (2:1). Each experimental diet was fed to satiated triplicate groups of juveniles (10.73 ± 0.07 g) twice a day for 8 weeks. The highest weight gain (WG) was observed in the juveniles fed the control diet, whereas no significant differences were found between the juveniles fed the GCP and control diets. Fish fed the control, GCP, PFP and SMP diets did not exhibit any significant difference in protein efficiency ratio (PER), feed conversion (FCR) or nitrogen (N) retention. The results of this study suggest that the amino acid (AA) patterns of juvenile whole body protein could be used as a guideline in the formulation of dry diets, which also confirms that the juvenile giant croaker is able to utilize high amounts (20%) of CAA in coated form for growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNibea 3aPagrus major 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3abody protein 3acasein 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish meal 3agrowth performance 3aguidelines 3ajuveniles 3anitrogen 3aprotein efficiency ratio 3aprotein sources 3asoybean meal 3aweight gain1 aWang, Ji‐Teng1 aHan, Tao1 aLi, Xin‐Yu1 aJiang, Yu‐Dong1 aWen, Xiao‐Bo0 tAquaculture research.g2016 Dec., v. 47, no. 12 p.3942-3951dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl53865x1355-557X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/are.128443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02592naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245015200168300002000320520134400340592002801684650000801712650002201720650002601742650002101768650001501789650001101804650001501815650003301830650002401863650001701887650001701904650001501921650001401936700001801950700001801968773011301986856008602099852000902185655001202194IND60556280020221117222439.0161102e20161101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055628002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.6b031312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Pinghua10aNanoscaled Porphyrinic Metal–Organic Frameworks for Electrochemical Detection of Telomerase Activity via Telomerase Triggered Conformation Switch  ap. 10680-10686.  aIn this work, we designed a nanoscaled porphyrinic metal–organic framework (PorMOF) with iron porphyrin as linker and zirconium ion as node for electrochemical detection of telomerase activity. The as-prepared PorMOF was characterized with scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, and spectroscopic techniques and demonstrated excellent electrocatalytic activity toward O₂ reduction. Sequentially, the functionalization of PorMOF with streptavidin results in a water-stable electrochemical tracer for detection of telomerase. Upon the telomerase-triggered extension, the assistant DNA 1 (aDNA1)–assistant DNA 2 (aDNA2) duplex could switch into a hairpin structure, and thus, the aDNA2 was released and then hybridized with the capture DNA. Therefore, the PorMOF@SA tracer could be introduced on the electrode surface via biotin–streptavidin recognition, leading to the strong electrochemical signal for readout. The developed approach displayed desirable dynamic range and limitation of detection down to 30 HeLa cells mL–¹. The telomerase activity was 2.2 × 10–¹¹ IU in a single HeLa cell with good reproducibility and stability. The nanoscaled porphyrinic MOF provided a powerful platform for electrochemical signal transduction and had a promising application in the determination of various biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aX-ray diffraction 3acoordination polymers 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aoxygen 3aporphyrins 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asignal transduction 3aspectroscopy 3astreptavidin 3atelomerase 3azirconium1 aLei, Jianping1 aJu, Huangxian0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2016 Nov. 01, v. 88, no. 21 p.10680-10686dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.analchem.6b031313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245015900173300001500332520175400347592002802101650001502129650003002144650002602174650001402200650001802214650002202232650002602254650000902280650001902289650001602308651001102324700002102335700002302356700002002379700002202399700002502421773010602446856008102552852000902633655001202642IND60573986920221120161349.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-016-1354-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Christina M.10aGeropogon hybridus (L.) Sch.Bip. (Asteraceae) exhibits micro-geographic genetic divergence at ecological range limits along a steep precipitation gradient  ap. 91-104.  aWe analyzed the population genetic pattern of 12 fragmented Geropogon hybridus ecological range edge populations in Israel along a steep precipitation gradient. In the investigation area (45 × 20 km²), the annual mean precipitation changes rapidly from 450 mm in the north (Mediterranean-influenced climate zone) to 300 mm in the south (semiarid climate zone) without significant temperature changes. Our analysis (91 individuals, 12 populations, 123 polymorphic loci) revealed strongly structured populations (AMOVA ΦST = 0.35; P < 0.001); however, differentiation did not change gradually toward range edge. IBD was significant (Mantel test r = 0.81; P = 0.001) and derived from sharply divided groups between the northernmost populations and the others further south, due to dispersal or environmental limitations. This was corroborated by the PCA and STRUCTURE analyses. IBD and IBE were significant despite the micro-geographic scale of the study area, which indicates that reduced precipitation toward range edge leads to population genetic divergence. However, this pattern diminished when the hypothesized gene flow barrier was taken into account. Applying the spatial analysis method revealed 11 outlier loci that were correlated to annual precipitation and, moreover, were indicative for putative precipitation-related adaptation (BAYESCAN, MCHEZA). The results suggest that even on micro-geographic scales, environmental factors play prominent roles in population divergence, genetic drift, and directional selection. The pattern is typical for strong environmental gradients, e.g., at species range edges and ecological limits, and if gene flow barriers and mosaic-like structures of fragmented habitats hamper dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAsteraceae 3aatmospheric precipitation 3aenvironmental factors 3agene flow 3agenetic drift 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aloci 3asemiarid zones 3atemperature 3aIsrael1 aSchulz, Benjamin1 aLauterbach, Daniel1 aRistow, Michael1 aWissemann, Volker1 aGemeinholzer, Birgit0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2017 Jan., v. 303, no. 1 p.91-104dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-016-1354-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245010600157520114600263592002801409650001501437650003001452650001901482650001501501650002701516650001501543650001501558650000901573650001501582650001801597650002701615650001801642650001501660700001801675700001701693700001901710700001801729773011901747856007301866852000901939655001201948IND60653375720221119065539.0190714e20180810xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337572DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Hoi  Jin10aEffect of TSS Removal from Stormwater by Mixed Media Column on T-N, T-P, and Organic Material Removal  aThe water quality of a waterbody influenced by stormwater runoff was tested in a lab-scale setting by filtration. The filtration bed was packed with two or three types of media, sand, bottom ash (BA), and woodchips (WC), and tested with three hydraulic conductivities (HCs). Five pollutants&mdash;namely, total suspended solids (TSS): BOD, COD, T-N, and T-P, were analyzed and compared. The application of sand-bottom ash (S-BA) and bottom ash-sand (BA-S) media types showed the highest removal efficiencies for TSS, BOD, COD, T-N, and T-P, respectively. Among the five pollutants, TSS achieved the highest removal efficiency for any of the filter media, which was up to 93% for the S-BA and decreased to 72% with an increase in HC, followed by T-P > BOD > COD = T-N. The maximum removal efficiency values of BOD and COD were obtained at 67% and 52%, respectively, indicating that BOD removal was always higher than COD removal. Due to the low C:N and high HC, biodegradation was disregarded during filtration. Based on the different removal forms of T-P compared with TSS, adsorption would be involved in the removal of dissolved T-P by BA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiodegradation 3abottom ash 3achemical oxygen demand 3afiltration 3apollutants 3asand 3astormwater 3asurface water 3atotal suspended solids 3awater quality 3awood chips1 aChoi, Jae-Woo1 aKim, Tae-Han1 aPark, Jong-Sup1 aAn, Byungryul0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 10, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01522naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245007900163300001600242520045500258592002800713650001700741650001400758650002500772653002600797653001800823653001700841653002300858700001800881700001900899700005900918773011500977856008301092852000901175655001201184IND60761100320221119183659.0220214e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076110032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tree.2021.12.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rong10aBiodiversity at disequilibrium: updating conservation strategies in cities  ap. 193-196.  aGreenspaces represent an ark for urban biodiversity, but understanding their carrying capacity to sustain species remains challenging.

One of the major mechanisms for organisms to combat heat stress is through heat shock proteins (HSPs) that stabilize protein structures at above‐optimum temperatures, by assisting in the folding of nascent, misfolded, or unfolded proteins. The HSP40 subgroups, or the J‐domain proteins, functions as co‐chaperones. They capture proteins that require folding or refolding and pass them on to HSP70 for processing. In this study, we have identified a type‐I HSP40 gene in soybean, GmDNJ1, with high basal expression under normal growth conditions and also highly inducible under abiotic stresses, especially heat. Gmdnj1‐knockout mutants had diminished growth in normal conditions, and when under heat stress, exhibited more severe browning, reduced chlorophyll contents, higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) contents, and higher induction of heat stress‐responsive transcription factors and ROS‐scavenging enzyme‐encoding genes. Under both normal and heat‐stress conditions, the mutant lines accumulated more aggregated proteins involved in protein catabolism, sugar metabolism, and membrane transportation, in both roots and leaves. In summary, GmDNJ1 plays crucial roles in the overall plant growth and heat tolerance in soybean, probably through the surveillance of misfolded proteins for refolding to maintain the full capacity of cellular functions.  aPublisher supplied data  a14122715cHong Kong Research Grants Council General Research Fund  aAoE/M‐403/16cHong Kong Research Grants Council Area of Excellence Scheme 3achlorophyll 3agenes 3aheat 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3aheat-shock protein 40 3amonitoring 3amutants 3aplant growth 3aprotein metabolism 3areactive oxygen species 3asoybeans 3asugars1 aWong, Cheuk‐Hon1 aCheng, Chun‐Chiu1 aCheng, Sau‐Shan1 aLi, Man‐Wah1 aMansveld, Sandra1 aBergsma, Alex1 aHuang, Tengfang1 avan Eijk, Michiel J.

The method is based on the combination of Mixture of Gaussians (MoG) using prediction mechanism (PM) and threshold segmentation algorithm. First, the “valid region” is manually set according to a priori knowledge. Second, the foreground objects of pigs are detected using the PM-MoG algorithm. The algorithm uses the detected binary image of the previous frame to predict the current frame in the valid region for pixels that fulfil background updating conditions. Different update strategies are used to update the background for different circumstances. Third, the maximum entropy threshold segmentation algorithm is used according to the colour information of foreground objects. Finally, the results of the two previous steps of foreground detection are fused. The experimental results show that the method is effective and can extract relatively complete foreground objects of pigs in complex scenes. These complex scenes include light changes, the influence of ground urine stains, water stains, manure, and other sundries, pigs' slow movement patterns, and varying colours of foreground objects. The average foreground detection rate is approximately 92%. The experimental results set the foundation for further exploration of individual identification of group-housed pigs, their behaviour analysis, and other objectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3acolor 3aprediction 3aswine 3aurine 0aGroup-housed pigs 0aForeground detection 0aObject extraction 0aMixture of Gaussians 0aMachine vision1 aZhu, Weixing1 aJiao, Pengpeng1 aChen, Jiali0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Sept., v. 125 p.98-104dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03032naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010200172300001600274500001500290520148700305592002801792650001501820650002201835650001501857650003301872650001401905650001801919650001101937650001601948650002201964650002201986651001302008651001102021651001302032651001402045653003202059653002302091653000802114653001902122653003202141653003302173700002002206700002502226700001902251700002202270773012802292856008502420852000902505655001202514IND60573717320221119032728.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371732DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2016.12247132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarra, Giampiero12aA Simultaneous Equation Approach to Estimating HIV Prevalence With Nonignorable Missing Responses  ap. 484-496.  a2019-12-06  aEstimates of HIV prevalence are important for policy to establish the health status of a country’s population and to evaluate the effectiveness of population-based interventions and campaigns. However, participation rates in testing for surveillance conducted as part of household surveys, on which many of these estimates are based, can be low. HIV positive individuals may be less likely to participate because they fear disclosure, in which case estimates obtained using conventional approaches to deal with missing data, such as imputation-based methods, will be biased. We develop a Heckman-type simultaneous equation approach that accounts for nonignorable selection, but unlike previous implementations, allows for spatial dependence and does not impose a homogenous selection process on all respondents. In addition, our framework addresses the issue of separation, where for instance some factors are severely unbalanced and highly predictive of the response, which would ordinarily prevent model convergence. Estimation is carried out within a penalized likelihood framework where smoothing is achieved using a parameterization of the smoothing criterion, which makes estimation more stable and efficient. We provide the software for straightforward implementation of the proposed approach, and apply our methodology to estimating national and sub-national HIV prevalence in Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.

Recently, house mice (Mus musculus) in the South Atlantic were found preying on three species of albatross chicks. Here, we show that house mice can also prey on nesting adult Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) on Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge (US). In contrast to mouse attacks on albatross in the South Atlantic, where mice targeted the rump and crown of chicks, on Midway, mice targeted nesting adults mainly on the back. For both regions, the outcome was similar with reduced nesting success. In the case of Midway, reduced nesting success was due to nest abandonment or mortality of one or both parents because of secondary bacterial infections. Mouse-induced mortality of adult albatross has the potential to have a more potent demographic effect because of their much higher natural survivorship once they reach adulthood.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMus musculus 3aPhoebastria 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aconservation areas 3apredation 3arump 3asurvival rate 3awildlife 3aPacific Ocean Islands 0aInvasive mammals 0aislands 0aLaysan Albatross 0amouse 0aPhoebastria immutabilis 0aseabirds1 aDuhr, Meg1 aFlint, Beth0 tJournal of wildlife diseases.g2021 Jan. 6, v. 57, no. 1 p.125-131dWildlife Disease AssociationwJournal:1978x0090-35587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.7589/JWD-D-20-000653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03171naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245012100170300001600291520155500307592002801862650001301890650001801903650001601921650001301937650001201950650001201962650001101974650001401985650001101999650002302010650001202033650000902045650001702054650001802071650000902089650001702098650000902115650001302124650002002137650002202157650002102179650000902200651001002209653001702219653002002236653002802256653002302284700001502307700001802322700001902340700001502359773011302374856008502487852000902572655001202581IND60634705420221118053814.0190325e20180610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063470542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Zhenzhou10aCharacterization of PM10 surrounding a cement plant with integrated facilities for co-processing of hazardous wastes  ap. 831-839.  aThe co-processing of wastes in cement production has become an irreversible trend worldwide. However, secondary pollution particularly the air pollution has rarely been investigated despite it may compromise the environmental benefits of waste utilization. In this study, we collected the atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) around a cement plant in Changping district in Beijing, China, which co-processes hazardous wastes and municipal sewage sludge, and investigated the characteristics of trace elements, inorganic and organic species in the samples. The results show that volatile elements (Zn, As, Se, Sc, Cd, Sb and Pb) that are abundant in the wastes can be highly enriched in PM10 compared with local soil, reflecting the influences from cement production. The water-soluble species were generally dominated by organics, which were moderately oxidized with an average oxygen-to-carbon atomic ratio (O/C) of 0.25 and an organic mass-to-organic carbon (OM/OC) ratio of 1.49. In addition, single particle imaging analyses revealed eight types of aerosol particles: S-rich, K-rich, Na-rich, fly ash, mineral, organic, metal and soot. Furthermore, the single particle analysis suggests that the metals released from the cement production may act as catalysts to promote the heterogeneous formations of sulfate and other secondary organic species. Overall, as a preliminary yet pioneering study, our findings highlight the possibly important but understudied influences of solid waste treatment processes on local air quality and haze formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3acadmium 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acement 3aecosystem services 3afly ash 3alead 3aparticulates 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3asolid wastes 3asoot 3asulfates 3awaste treatment 3awaste utilization 3awater solubility 3azinc 3aChina 0aCement plant 0aHazardous waste 0aMunicipal sewage sludge 0aParticulate matter1 aTang, Siqi1 aZhang, Zuotai1 aLiu, Chongxuan1 aGe, Xinlei0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 10, v. 186 p.831-839dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02769naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001400159245008800173300001600261500002000277500000900297520167300306592002801979650002002007650001502027650002302042650001602065650002502081650002302106650003002129700001902159773014802178852000902326856009602335655001202431IND2046521520221119094334.0220514e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204652152DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900020008x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmato, M.10aSmall Spatial Scale Soil Water Content Measurement with Time‐Domain Reflectometry  ap. 325-329.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aPlants growing on stored soil water often exhibit symptoms of water deficit even though a relatively large quantity of soil water is available for uptake where roots are present in the subsoil. To explore the possibility that this less effective absorption phenomenon was related to nonuniform root distribution or root clumping around soil peds, we examined the suitability of time‐domain reflectometry for measuring soil water content distribution on a small spatial scale. Measurements were made on clay loam and sandy clay soils with 21‐mm‐long parallel balanced transmission lines and compared with gravimetric water content measurement. Water content values ranged from oven dry to saturation. To quantify the error in propagation time measurement using short transmission lines, measurements were made in air using rod lengths ranging from 10 to 150 mm. The coefficient of variation was quite high (2.8–7.3%) for times shorter than 100 ps for air‐dry soil. In this case, the technique proved less reliable. For longer times, corresponding to higher water contents, the coefficient of variation was <3%. A few samples of clay loam soil with water contents >0.29 m³ m⁻³ showed excessively high values of dielectric constant. Care should be taken in data interpretation at high water content for these media. Time‐domain reflectometry proved effective in measuring water content with the tested transmission line for values >0.07 m³ m⁻³. Thus, a tool is provided for in situ measurement of spatial variability or at a spatial scale compatible with many problems ranging from the water uptake of clustered roots to seed germination in the field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay loam soils 3aclay soils 3asoil water content 3ameasurement 3aspatial distribution 3asoil heterogeneity 3atime domain reflectometry1 aRitchie, J.

At the same time, the choice of fuel is not only a matter of price but of the furnace, it is used in. Top-down models often struggle to include technological explicitness, which is especially important to represent the heterogeneous structure of industrial energy demand. In this paper, an approach to apply a discrete choice model to industrial high temperature energy demand is presented. The model's parameters are estimated based on observed fuel choices. The model exhibits an average coefficient of determination of 0.45 when compared to a constant fuel use from 2002 to 2013 in major countries of the European Union. Results suggest that energy carriers are perceived very differently by industrial consumers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEuropean Union 3aclimate 3aemissions 3aenergy efficiency 3afuels 3afurnaces 3aheat 3aindustry 3amodels 3aprices 3atemperature 0aInter-fuel substitution 0aFuel switch 0aHigh temperature 0aEnergy-intensive industry 0aEnergy demand model 0aDiscrete choice1 aFleiter, Tobias1 aWorrell, Ernst0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.98-110dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02633naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004500094040001800139100002100157245008300178300001400261520132400275592002801599650004401627650002201671650001201693650001001705650001401715650001201729650001001741650001701751650000901768650003301777650000901810653002801819653001201847653001701859653002201876653001401898700001801912700002301930700002201953773011101975856009202086852000902178655001202187IND60536693520221119143909.0190412e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053669352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolin, Joseph P.10aSource of airborne sunflower dust generated during combine harvester operation  ap. 23-29.  aThe sunflower harvest season presents challenges for many farmers when an abundance of airborne dust is carried by surrounding winds and allowed to relocate on equipment surfaces. Combine fires are a serious problem resulting from the ignition of biomass dust that settle and accumulate on the combine harvester. Farmers' anecdotal evidence indicates that harvesting sunflowers can produce more airborne dust than other commodity crops. The source of this airborne sunflower dust was investigated using various methods to analyse different parts of the sunflower: whole heads, outer stalk, and inner stalk pith. These samples were compared to a collected amount of bulk sunflower dust field sample taken directly from a horizontal surface on a combine harvester during the 2011 harvest season. All testing methods; proximate and ultimate analyses, biomass dust particle density analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy; suggest the sunflower bulk field sample is comprised of mostly inner stalk pith rather than dust particles from the outer stalk and whole sunflower heads. By confirming the source of the airborne sunflower dust field sample, the arrangement of combine harvester equipment could be modified to reduce the amount of sunflower dust generated during operation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiomass 3acrops 3aequipment 3afarmers 3afires 3aharvest date 3apith 3ascanning electron microscopy 3awind 0aAirborne dust particles 0aBiomass 0aCombine fire 0aCombine harvester 0aSunflower1 aGu, Zhengrong1 aHumburg, Daniel S.1 aDalsted, Kevin J.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Oct., v. 126 p.23-29dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.07.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02663naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245009000159520137300249592002801622650001301650650001301663650002801676650001601704650001901720650000901739650001201748650002201760650001801782650002201800650001901822650001301841650001301854650001201867650001001879651002301889700002201912700001801934700001801952700001901970700001501989773011902004856007302123852000902196655001202205IND60653376020221119064546.0190714e20180811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065337602DNAL7 a10.3390/w100810722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlymale, Andrew10aBacterial Productivity in a Ferrocyanide-Contaminated Aquifer at a Nuclear Waste Site  aThis study examined potential microbial impacts of cyanide contamination in an aquifer affected by ferrocyanide disposal from nuclear waste processing at the US Department of Energy&rsquo;s Hanford Site in south-eastern Washington State (USA). We examined bacterial productivity and microbial cell density in groundwater (GW) from wells with varying levels of recent and historical total cyanide concentrations. We used tritiated leucine (3H-Leu) uptake as a proxy for heterotrophic, aerobic bacterial productivity in the GW, and we measured cell density via nucleic acid staining followed by epifluorescence microscopy. Bacterial productivity varied widely, both among wells that had high historical and recent total cyanide (CN&minus;) concentrations and among wells that had low total CN&minus; values. Standing microbial biomass varied less, and was generally greater than that observed in a similar study of uranium-contaminated hyporheic-zone groundwater at the Hanford Site. Our results showed no correlation between 3H-Leu uptake and recent or historical cyanide concentrations in the wells, consistent with what is known about cyanide toxicity with respect to iron speciation. However, additional sampling of the CN&minus; affected groundwater, both in space and time, would be needed to confirm that the CN&minus; contamination is not affecting the GW biota.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acyanides 3afluorescence microscopy 3agroundwater 3ahyporheic zone 3airon 3aleucine 3amicrobial biomass 3anucleic acids 3aradioactive waste 3aspace and time 3astaining 3atoxicity 3atritium 3awells 3aWashington (state)1 aWells, Jacqueline1 aGraham, Emily1 aQafoku, Odeta1 aBrooks, Shelby1 aLee, Brady0 tWater.g2018 Aug. 11, v. 10, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21688x2073-44417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w100810723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02234naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010900167300001600276500001900292520111900311592002801430650002801458650001501486650001301501650001701514650001101531653002301542653001401565653002401579653001401603700001401617700002701631773012201658856008301780852000901863655001201872IND60734786320221122192616.0210624e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073478632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.04.0902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDhanasekar, M.10aInsights into the exceptional stability of the molecular precursor solution for Cu2ZnSnS4 solar absorber  ap. 326-331.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEnvironment friendly molecular precursors are extensively studied for green, economical and scalable fabrication of inorganic thin films for various device applications. For compound semiconductors such as the chalcogenide solar absorber Cu₂ZnSnS₄ (CZTS), the stability of such precursor solution is highly sought after. The longer shelf life of the precursor could significantly improve the phase purity as well as the reproducibility of the resulting films, and also would aid the industrial scaling up of the fabrication process. Herein, the reason behind the exceptional stability shown by a precursor solution for CZTS is explored, by probing the nature of interaction between its various components. The unique combination of solvent and the sulfur source is shown as favorable for the stable bonds in the solution, especially the predominant bidentate bridging of sulfur source to the metal atoms. The insights elucidated through simple spectroscopic techniques can be handy when designing such sustainable precursors for other functional chalcogenides and technologically important inorganic compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopper zinc tin sulfide 3ashelf life 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur 0aPrecursor solution 0aStability 0aSolvent interaction 0aCu2ZnSnS41 aSekar, S.1 aBhat, S.

A field study with melon crop was conducted during 2011 and 2012 in central Spain, using different rates of wine-distillery waste compost to quantify nitrogen (N) leaching under two regimes of irrigation. To evaluate the groundwater pollution risk associated with these practices, some environmental indices were used to determine the variation in the quality of drinking water (Impact Index (II)) and in the nitrate concentration of the groundwater (Environmental Impact Index (EII)). To combine environmental together with yield parameters, the Management Efficiency (ME) was calculated. Considering II and EII, compost addition together with adjusted irrigation (90–100% ETc) do not represent a risk to increase groundwater contamination, and, in high doses, may contribute to remove nitrate from drainage water and improve the quality of the drinking water. In contrast, applying large amounts of compost together with an excess of water (120% ETc) increased N leaching significantly and poses a higher risk of groundwater contamination. The rate corresponding to 13 t ha−1 of compost together with an efficient irrigation is sufficient to achieve the highest yield, does not exceed the maximum allowable limits established by II and EII and has an adequate ME.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3acomposts 3adrainage water 3adrinking water 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afield experimentation 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3ahorticultural crops 3airrigation management 3aleaching 3amelons 3amicroirrigation 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aorganic wastes 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3aSpain 0aNitrates 0aGroundwater contamination 0aWine-distillery compost 0aIrrigation1 aCartagena, María C.1 aVillena, Raquel1 aArce, Augusto1 aRibas, Francisco1 aCabello, María J.1 aCastellanos, María T.0 tBiosystems engineering.g2014 Dec., v. 128 p.11-20dElsevier LtdaIAgrEwJournal:jnl70639x1537-51107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2014.07.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245006500170300001600235520158300251592002801834650001501862650001501877650002001892650001401912650000901926650001101935650003301946650001401979650001001993653001902003653001402022653001702036653003102053653004102084700002202125700001802147700002602165773012802191856008502319852000902404655001202413IND60573717620221119033007.0170724e20170403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057371762DNAL7 a10.1080/01621459.2016.12367262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStrait, Justin10aLandmark-Constrained Elastic Shape Analysis of Planar Curves  ap. 521-533.  aVarious approaches to statistical shape analysis exist in current literature. They mainly differ in the representations, metrics, and/or methods for alignment of shapes. One such approach is based on landmarks, that is, mathematically or structurally meaningful points, which ignores the remaining outline information. Elastic shape analysis, a more recent approach, attempts to fix this by using a special functional representation of the parametrically defined outline to perform shape registration, and subsequent statistical analyses. However, the lack of landmark identification can lead to unnatural alignment, particularly in biological and medical applications, where certain features are crucial to shape structure, comparison, and modeling. The main contribution of this work is the definition of a joint landmark-constrained elastic statistical shape analysis framework. We treat landmark points as constraints in the full shape analysis process. Thus, we inherit benefits of both methods: the landmarks help disambiguate shape alignment when the fully automatic elastic shape analysis framework produces unsatisfactory solutions. We provide standard statistical tools on the landmark-constrained shape space including mean and covariance calculation, classification, clustering, and tangent principal component analysis (PCA). We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework on complex shapes from the MPEG-7 dataset and two real data examples: mice T2 vertebrae and Hawaiian Drosophila fly wings.

The recommended intake of this vitamin was recently increased to 400μg/day, with an additional 200μg/day during pregnancy. The Mediterranean Diet includes sources of folate such as pulses, green-leaf vegetables, fruit, cereals, and dried fruits; other foods of interest are liver and blue fish. The objectives were to determine the foods that contribute most to folate intake and analyze the factors that influence their consumption by three generations in a female population (n=898; age, 10–75yrs) from Southern Spain: 230 adolescents (10–16yrs), 296 healthy pregnant women (19–45yrs), and 372 menopausal women (>45yrs). Participants completed a previously validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. Over 90% of their folate intake was supplied by cereals, fruit, natural juice, pulses, and cooked and raw vegetables. The mean (SD) daily intake of folate was 288.27(63.64) μg. A higher Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was significantly related to a greater folate intake. The daily folate intake was not significantly influenced by educational level, number of children, or place of residence (rural vs. urban). In logistic regression analysis, the factors related to an adequate folate intake (>2/3 of recommendations) were higher age, higher MDS, and lower BMI.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAdequate Intakes 3aMediterranean diet 3aadolescents 3abody mass index 3achildren 3adried fruit 3aeducational status 3afemale fertility 3afemales 3afish 3afolic acid 3afood frequency questionnaires 3afruits 3agrains 3ajuices 3alivers as food 3alogit analysis 3apregnancy 3apregnant women 3araw vegetables 3avegetables 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aChild 2aDiet Surveys 2aDiet, Mediterraneanxstatistics & numerical data 2aFemale 2aFolic Acidxadministration & dosage 2aHumans 2aLogistic Models 2aMiddle Aged 2aNutrition Policy 2aPregnancy 3aSpain 0aSpain 0aFolic acid 0aMediterranean Diet Score 0aFemale population 0aHealthy pregnant women1 aMariscal-Arcas, M.1 aPalacin, A.1 aLopez, M.1 aLorenzo, M.L.1 aOlea-Serrano, F.0 tAppetite.g2013 Aug. 01, v. 67 p.114-118dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl31756x0195-66637nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2013.04.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245006900166300001600235520200800251592002802259650001302287650002402300650001202324650001902336650001302355650001502368650001902383650002502402650001602427650001302443650000902456650000802465650001402473650001502487650002402502773011102526856004802637852000902685655001202694IND50060954120221122230222.0130318e201212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006095412DNAL7 a10.1007/s00704-012-0687-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOhmura, Atsumu10aEnhanced temperature variability in high-altitude climate change  ap. 499-508.  aIn the present article, monthly mean temperature at 56 stations assembled in 18 regional groups in 10 major mountain ranges of the world were investigated. The periods of the analysis covered the last 50 to 110 years. The author found that the variability of temperature in climatic time scale tends to increase with altitude in about 65 % of the regional groups. A smaller number of groups, 20 %, showed the fastest change at an intermediate altitude between the peaks (or ridges) and their foot, while the remaining small number of sites, 15 %, showed the largest trends at the foot of mountains. This tendency provides a useful base for considering and planning the climate impact evaluations. The reason for the amplification of temperature variation at high altitudes is traced back to the increasing diabatic processes in the mid- and high troposphere as a result of the cloud condensation. This situation results from the fact that the radiation balance at the earth’s surface is transformed more efficiently into latent heat of evaporation rather than sensible heat, the ratio between them being 4 to 1. Variation in the surface evaporation is converted into heat upon condensation into cloud particles and ice crystals in the mid- and high troposphere. Therefore, this is the altitude where the result of the surface radiation change is effectively transferred. Further, the low temperature of the environment amplifies the effect of the energy balance variation on the surface temperature, as a result of the functional shape of Stefan–Boltzmann law. These processes altogether contribute to enhancing temperature variability at high altitudes. The altitude plays an important role in determining the temperature variability, besides other important factors such as topography, surface characteristics, cryosphere/temperature feedback and the frequency and intensity of an inversion. These processes have a profound effect not only on the ecosystem but also on glaciers and permafrost.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3aambient temperature 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acrystals 3aecosystems 3aenergy balance 3aenvironmental impact 3aevaporation 3aglaciers 3aheat 3aice 3amountains 3apermafrost 3asurface temperature0 tTheoretical and applied climatology.g2012 Dec., v. 110, no. 4 p.499-508dSpringer-Verlagx0177-798X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00704-012-0687-x  aDNAL 7aarticle01624naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002700144245014600171300001600317500001900333520041700352592002800769650001300797650001700810650001000827650001600837650001700853650001300870651001200883700002300895700001700918700002400935700002200959700002000981700001801001773013201019856007801151852000901229655001201238IND60723076720221121075448.0210112e20210106xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072307672DNAL7 a10.7589/JWD-D-20-000952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKishbaugh, Jennifer C.10aUse of a Portable Analyzer for Venous Blood Gas and Biochemistry Analysis in Free-Ranging Indian Flying Foxes (Pteropus giganteus) in Myanmar  ap. 242-245.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe determined venous blood gas, acid-base, and biochemical parameters for thirteen free-ranging Indian flying foxes (Pteropus giganteus) in Myanmar, using a handheld i-STAT analyzer with CG8+ and CHEM8 cartridges.

Its similarity to existing CFB combustion technology has made it possible to demonstrate its feasibility at MW scale and to obtain an accurate estimation of its energy efficiency and cost. This work analyzes a novel CaL system that incorporates recent developments tested at large pilot scale, where the calciner operates under an oxygen-rich atmosphere and the sorbent is reactivated by recarbonation allowing a reduction in the thermal input needed in the calciner. It has been shown that, when this 2nd generation CaL system is coupled to existing large sources of flue gases and biomass is used as fuel in the calciner, the full system becomes carbon-negative, with CO2 emissions as low as −245.3 kgCO2/MWhe since the biomass source is carbon-neutral. The net electric efficiencies achieved for the entire system including CO2 capture are higher than 33%. Moreover, the total investment required for this CaL system can be reduced by more than 30% compared to conventional CaL systems due to the reduced footprint of the calciner-related equipment when the calciner is fired with pure oxygen.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3acalcium 3acalcium oxide 3acarbon dioxide 3acombustion 3aenergy efficiency 3aflue gas 3afluidized beds 3afuels 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aoxygen 3apower plants 3asorbents 3atemperature 0aCO2 capture 0aCalcium looping 0aBiomass 0aSorbent recarbonation 0aSecond generation1 aArias, B.1 aGrasa, G.S.1 aAbanades, J.C.0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 June 20, v. 187 p.638-649dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.03.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02257naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012100162300001400283520100900297592002801306650000801334650001301342650001001355650001301365650000901378650001301387650001001400650001301410650001401423650002601437650002301463650000901486650001101495650001401506650000901520651001901529700002401548700002401572700002001596773010501616856008101721852000901802655001201811IND60573987620221121023142.0170725e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057398762DNAL7 a10.1007/s00606-016-1349-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolec, Jan10aGalerina saxicola (Fungi, Agaricales) is conspecific with G. stordalii and new data on ecology of the latter species  ap. 23-33.  aThe holotype of Galerina saxicola Svrček, a never revised species described from the Czech Republic in 1994, was studied in detail.

Full synonymy and diagnostic characters of G. stordalii are provided, its morphological and ecological variability is discussed, and information on type specimens is corrected. Our collections document that G. stordalii has a broader ecological amplitude than thought before, living not only on Sphagnum and peat in boreal and arctic-alpine habitats like bogs and snow beds, but also among mosses in boggy spruce forests, on decaying conifer trunks in old-growth forests and on moist sandstone rocks in a river canyon under the influence of climatic inversion.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aGalerina 3aPicea 3aSphagnum 3abogs 3aconifers 3afungi 3ahabitats 3aholotypes 3amosses and liverworts 3aold-growth forests 3apeat 3arivers 3asandstone 3asnow 3aCzech Republic1 aVašutová, Martina1 aKolařík, Miroslav1 aKříž, Martin0 tPlant systematics and evolution.g2017 Jan., v. 303, no. 1 p.23-33dSpringer Viennax0378-26977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00606-016-1349-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02786naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004900092040001800141100001800159245010400177300001600281500002000297500000900317520155300326592002801879650001101907650001401918650002001932650001101952650001401963650001501977650001501992650003402007650001602041650000702057650002902064700002202093700002002115773014802135852000902283856009602292655001202388IND2046522720221119094514.0220514e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204652272DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900020016x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayes, Kim F.10aQuaternary Ammonium Surfactant Effects on Sorption of Trace Metals onto Quartz and Aluminosilicates  ap. 380-387.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aThis study was conducted to investigate the potential impact of quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) on trace metal ion desorption from soil constituents. Three soil constituents (quartz, kaolinite, and montmorillonite), two trace metal cations [Co(II) and Sr(II)], and three alkyltrimethylammoniumchloride surfactants (C₈TMAC, C₁₂TMAC, and C₁₆TMAC) were chosen for this investigation. For the quartz system, Co(II) showed no desorption while Sr(II) showed a slight pH‐dependent desorption. For kaolinite or montmorillonite systems, desorption of Co(II) and Sr(II) by QACs occurred only for the fraction of the trace metal cations sorbed on permanent‐charge sites. In the case of montmorillonite, Sr(II) was significantly desorbed at all pH values. This was thought to be a result of the nearly exclusive sorption of Sr(II) to the permanent‐charge sites in this system. In all other clay systems studied [Sr(II), Co(II) on kaolinite; Co(II) on montmorillonite], desorption only occurred at lower pH from permanent‐charge sites. No desorption occurred at higher pH values where sorption to surface hydroxyl sites was indicated. In general, QAC‐induced desorption of trace metal cations was found to be significant only when QAC sorption equaled or exceeded the cation‐exchange capacity. Surfactant chain length was found to have little effect on the overall pH‐dependent desorption trends. As expected, higher surfactant concentration was required to cause trace metal ion desorption as the surfactant chain length decreased.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquartz 3akaolinite 3amontmorillonite 3acobalt 3astrontium 3ametal ions 3adesorption 3aquaternary ammonium compounds 3asurfactants 3apH 3acation exchange capacity1 aChen, Chia‐chen1 aMcAvoy, Drew C.0 tSoil Science Society of America journal.g1995 Mar., v. 59, no. 2 p.380-387dSoil Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44580x0361-59957nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2136/sssaj1995.03615995005900020016x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03428naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245012600186300001600312500001500328520148500343592002801828650001301856650002201869650003201891650001401923650001601937650001401953650001601967650001201983650002501995650000802020650003202028650002202060650001202082650002102094650002302115650002802138650002602166650002802192650001402220650004402234650002502278650002702303650003402330650005202364650004302416650004002459651000902499651000902508653002702517700001602544700001602560700001702576700001902593700002302612773008602635856004802721852000902769655001202778IND50066757720221120224646.0130530e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006675772DNAL7 a233344412pmid7 a10.1007/s11262-013-0880-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Tsung-Chi10aMolecular characterization of the full-length L and M RNAs of Tomato yellow ring virus, a member of the genus Tospovirus   ap. 487-495.  a2019-12-06  aTomato yellow ring virus (TYRV), first isolated from tomato in Iran, was classified as a non-approved species of the genus Tospovirus based on the characterization of its genomic S RNA. In the current study, the complete sequences of the genomic L and M RNAs of TYRV were determined and analyzed. The L RNA has 8,877 nucleotides (nt) and codes in the viral complementary (vc) strand for the putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of 2,873 amino acids (aa) (331 kDa). The RdRp of TYRV shares the highest aa sequence identity (88.7 %) with that of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), and contains conserved motifs shared with those of the animal-infecting bunyaviruses. The M RNA contains 4,786 nt and codes in ambisense arrangement for the NSm protein of 308 aa (34.5 kDa) in viral sense, and the Gn/Gc glycoprotein precursor (GP) of 1,310 aa (128 kDa) in vc-sense. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that TYRV is closely clustered with IYSV and Polygonum ringspot virus (PolRSV). The NSm and GP of TYRV share the highest aa sequence identity with those of IYSV and PolRSV (89.9 and 80.2–86.5 %, respectively). Moreover, the GPs of TYRV, IYSV, and PolRSV share highly similar characteristics, among which an identical deduced N-terminal protease cleavage site that is distinct from all tospoviral GPs analyzed thus far. Taken together, the elucidation of the complete genome sequence and biological features of TYRV support a close ancestral relationship with IYSV and PolRSV.  aPublisher supplied data 3atomatoes 3asequence analysis 3aIris yellow spot tospovirus 3aPolygonum 3anucleotides 3aphylogeny 3aamino acids 3aviruses 3anucleotide sequences 3aRNA 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 2aAmino Acid Motifs 2aAnimals 2aCluster Analysis 2aConserved Sequence 2aGlycoproteinsxgenetics 2aSolanum lycopersicum. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA-Dependent RNA Polymerasexgenetics. 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTospovirusxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aViral Nonstructural Proteinsxgenetics 2aViral Structural Proteinsxgenetics 3aIran 0aIran 0aIris yellow spot virus1 aLi, Ju-Ting1 aFan, Ya-Shu1 aYeh, Yi-Chun1 aYeh, Shyi-Dong1 aKormelink, Richard0 tVirus genes.g2013 June, v. 46, no. 3 p.487-495dSpringer-Verlagx0920-85697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11262-013-0880-8  aDNAL 7aarticle03139naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245010800167300001800275500001900293520143200312536021101744592002801955596001201983596001801995596001302013650001402026650004102040650002702081650001202108650001802120650001402138650000902152650002502161650001502186651001002201653002902211653001002240653000802250653001002258653001202268700001802280700001602298700001602314700001702330700001302347700001602360773013902376856008502515852000902600655001202609IND60722641120221122221549.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264112DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18447472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYue, Cuinan10aIdentification of volatile components and analysis of aroma characteristics of Jiangxi Congou black tea  ap. 2160-2173.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJiangxi Congou black tea is one of the earliest Congou black tea in China. In order to explore its sensory characteristics and molecular sensory basis, quantitative description analysis (QDA) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to analyze the sensory characteristics and volatile components of 11 Congou black tea samples from Jiangxi Province in China. The results showed that the aroma characteristics of Jiangxi Congou black were composed of 11 aroma descriptors, namely, sweet-smell, floral, fruity, roasted, spicy, fresh, green, oil, off-odor, woody and smoky. There was also interaction effect between sensory attributes of aroma, which were significant negative correlation between floral, and fruity, and green. The presence of roasted incense could significantly enhance the olfactory perception of off-odor and smoky, and off-odor was an important attribute that affects the aroma quality of Jiangxi Congou black tea. Volatile components (i.e. 74 kinds) were identified, among which the highest content and species were alcohols, followed by esters, and the lowest were heterocycles and terpenes. The results of partial least square variable import project (PLS-VIP) showed that there were 29 volatile compounds that had an important contribution to the aroma characteristics of Congou black tea, and the volatile compounds that had an important influence on six aroma attributes were obtained.  aThe research was funded by Agricultures Research System of Jiangxi Province(JXARS-02), China Agricultures Research System (CARS-19), Jiangxi Key Laboratory of Tea Quality and Safety Control (20192BCD40007).  aPublisher supplied data  aCARS-19  a20192BCD40007  aJXARS-02 3ablack tea 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheterocyclic compounds 3aimports 3aleast squares 3aoff odors 3aoils 3aolfactory perception 3aterpenoids 3aChina 0aJiangxi Congou black tea 0aaroma 0aQDA 0aGC-MS 0aPLS-VIP1 aYang, Puxiang1 aQin, Dandan1 aCai, Hailan1 aWang, Zhihui1 aLi, Chen1 aWu, Hualing0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.2160-2173dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2020.18447473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001800138245014300156500002000299520183500319592002802154596006402182650001402246650001402260650002002274650003102294650001802325650001302343650002402356650002102380650001402401650002902415650002602444700002602470700005602496700005602552773010802608856007302716852000902789655001202798IND60790666320221119182541.0220826e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079066632DNAL7 a10.1002/pld3.2992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhemka, Niraj10aGenome‐wide profiling of miRNAs during seed development reveals their functional relevance in seed size/weight determination in chickpea  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non‐coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression at transcriptional and post‐transcriptional levels. The role of miRNAs in seed development and seed size/weight determination is poorly understood in legumes. In this study, we profiled miRNAs at seven successive stages of seed development in a small‐seeded and a large‐seeded chickpea cultivar via small RNA sequencing. In total, 113 known and 243 novel miRNAs were identified. Gene ontology analysis revealed the enrichment of seed/reproductive/post‐embryonic development and signaling pathways processes among the miRNA target genes. A large fraction of the target genes exhibited antagonistic correlation with miRNA expression. The sets of co‐expressed miRNAs showing differential expression between the two cultivars were recognized. Known transcription factor (TF) encoding genes involved in seed size/weight determination, including SPL, GRF, MYB, ARF, HAIKU1, SHB1, KLUH/CYP78A5, and E2Fb along with novel genes were found to be targeted by the predicted miRNAs. Differential expression analysis revealed higher transcript levels of members of SPL and REVOLUTA TF families and lower expression of their corresponding miRNAs in the large‐seeded cultivar. At least 19 miRNAs known to be involved in seed development or differentially expressed between small‐seeded and large‐seeded cultivars at late‐embryogenesis and/or mid‐maturation stages were located within known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with seed size/weight determination. Moreover, 41 target genes of these miRNAs were also located within these QTLs. Altogether, we revealed important roles of miRNAs in seed development and identified candidate miRNAs and their target genes that have functional relevance in determining seed size/weight in chickpea.  aPublisher supplied data  cDepartment of Biotechnology, Government of India, New Delhi 3achickpeas 3acultivars 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3amicroRNA 3aquantitative traits 3aseed development 3aseed size 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aSingh Rajkumar, Mohan1 aGarg, Rohini1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7265-22761 aJain, Mukesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7622-10830 tPlant direct.g2021 Mar., v. 5, no. 3 p.e00299-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27204x2475-44557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pld3.2993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245014200168300001800310500001900328520151000347592002801857650002401885650002001909650002701929650002301956650002901979650002502008650001702033650001602050650000902066650001702075650001902092650001802111650000902129650001302138650001302151650001302164650001602177653001902193653001902212653001902231700001702250700002302267700002002290700002302310773013902333856008502472852000902557655001202566IND60722641320221122181200.0210106e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072264132DNAL7 a10.1080/10942912.2020.18447492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNasiri, Mina10aNanoemulsion production techniques upgrade bioactivity potential of nanoemulsified essential oils on Acipenser stellatus filet preserving  ap. 2174-2188.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to prepare physically stable nanoemulsions containing three different essential oils (Rosemary, Cuminum, and Zataria Multiflora Boiss) by using two different nanoemulsification methods. Then microbial growth rate, antioxidant, and oxidant content of fresh fish fillet were assessed at 4°C and 10°C temperatures. Essential oils (EOs) were purified from Rosmarinus officinalis L., Zataria multiflora Boiss, and Cuminum cyminum L. and emulsified by two different methods: Ultrasonic Homogenization (USH) and Emulsion Phase Inversion (EPI). Samples of Acipenser stellatus (weight of 10 ± 1 g) were immersed in Nanoemulsified essential oils. Then antibacterial and antioxidant potential of these essential oils was analyzed by culturing in a tube and measuring PV and TBA, respectively, during 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after treatment. Cuminum cyminum L., at 4°C in the USH method reduced the growth of bacteria in the fish sample on all studied bacteria at 5% concentration compared to 3%. Also the results of Cuminum cyminum L. EO made by both methods used to emulsify the oil were better than the other two extracts. As well these results were observed for PV and TBA contents. This study showed that nanoemulsified Cuminum cyminum L. prepared by the USH method has good antioxidant potential and antibacterial effect among other essential oils and it can be used to produce novel natural antioxidants as well as flavoring agents that can be applied in different food products.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcipenser stellatus 3aCuminum cyminum 3aRosmarinus officinalis 3aZataria multiflora 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aemulsifying 3afish 3afish fillets 3ahomogenization 3ananoemulsions 3aoils 3aoxidants 3araw fish 3arosemary 3aultrasonics 0aEmulsification 0ananotechnology 0aessential oils1 aAhari, Hamed1 aSharifan, Anousheh1 aAnvar, Amir Ali1 aKakolaki, Shahpour0 tInternational journal of food properties.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 23, no. 1 p.2174-2188dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl56717x1532-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10942912.2020.18447493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02438naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012200207520110500329592002801434650001501462650001901477650002001496650002301516650003001539650001401569650002101583650001801604650000901622653002701631653003701658653001901695653001501714653002501729700001401754700005501768700001801823773009201841856008601933852000902019655001202028IND60779260420221117224246.0220621e20221001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077926042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1236272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Luokai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1603-973010aPhage long tail fiber protein-immobilized magnetic nanoparticles for rapid and ultrasensitive detection of Salmonella  aThere is an urgent need to develop fast and sensitive detection methods for foodborne pathogens. But the conventional culture method that typically requires 2–3 days is not ideal for the rapid analysis. Food samples demonstrate a great challenge for direct detection due to the complex matrix. Hence, we present a new method based on the phage long-tail-fiber proteins (LTF4-a) immobilized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for specific separation and concentration of Salmonella. The LTF4-a-MNP was prepared via the coupling of recombinant LTF4-a with MNPs and used to isolate and enrich Salmonella cells from contaminated food samples. The captured material was further integrated with the direct PCR program for accurate detection of Salmonella. Our study successfully established a new method for detecting contaminated food samples of Salmonella, the overall approach took no more than 3 h, which allowed a detection limit of 7 CFU/mL, demonstrating a promising alternative to the immunomagnetic separation method by replacing antibodies or aptamers, that is compatible with downstream analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmonella 3abacteriophages 3adetection limit 3afood contamination 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3amagnetism 3aoligonucleotides 3arapid methods 3atail 0aMagnetic nanocomposite 0aPhage tail fiber proteins (TFPs) 0aBio-separation 0aDirect PCR 0aSalmonella detection1 aLin, Hong1 aZhang, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4428-05961 aWang, Jingxue0 tTalanta.g2022 Oct. 01, v. 248 p.123627-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2022.1236273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02343naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245012000158300001400278500002000292520111900312592002801431650003001459650001301489650001201502650001801514650001901532650001701551650001501568650000901583650001101592650002701603650001101630650001401641650001501655650001601670650000901686651001601695700002501711773009101736856007301827852000901900655001201909IND60571880320221119190348.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057188032DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.213342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShim, Hyungeun10aAdded dietary vegetables and fruits improved coat quality of capybara in Seoul Zoo, Republic of Korea: A case study  ap. 50-55.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAdequate levels of dietary vitamin C are necessary for capybaras (Hydrochoerus hydrocharis) because they cannot synthesize the vitamin endogenously. Beginning in 2013, hair and weight loss, as well as general dermatitis, were observed in all individual capybaras (n = 4) in a mixed exhibit at Seoul Zoo. Seven additional vegetables, leafy greens, and fruits that increased dietary vitamin C concentration from ∼300–400 to >600 mg/kg dry matter were added to the diet since January 2015. Within 6 months, capybaras’ skin and coats improved considerably, with hair becoming thicker and glossier. Animals visually appeared healthier and gained weight. In conclusion, hair loss, dermatitis, and weight loss in capybara can be improved by feeding enough fresh green leaves, vegetables, and fruits. Although vitamin C is considered a major factor for alleviation of poor body condition observed, increased status of other nutrients (i.e., vitamin B₆) provided by the diet change may also have contributed to the improvements seen in the capybara.

Previous studies of solid-phase phosphorus sources and microbial immobilization co-strengthening materials have demonstrated that their performance in continuous flow reactions is of great significance towards practical application of these technologies. It was suggested that Microbial-Phosphorus minerals-Alginate (MPA) immobilized particles showed superior performance (high Cr removal efficiency, low phosphorus surplus, and high environmental resistance) in comparisons of non-immobilization systems and different immobilization methods under continuous flow conditions. Microbial community analysis revealed significant differences between different systems as well as between variations in environmental factors, providing further support for the above conclusions. Synthetic wastewater (synthesized by actual groundwater) was also introduced to further verify the practical application potential of MPA immobilized particles. The results of this study provide a new insight and relevant bench scale data to support the enhancement of in-situ Cr(VI) bioremediation.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioremediation 3achromium 3agroundwater 3amicrobial communities 3aphosphorus 3awastewater 0aChromium 0aMicrobial immobilization 0aPhosphorus minerals 0aContinuous flow reaction 0aBioremediation enhancement1 aChen, Nan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6924-83791 aFeng, Chuanping1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5485-02600 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 742 p.140685-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094024002200122024001900144040001800163100001400181245010400195300001800299506007600317520152300393592002801916596011801944596002402062506003702086650002702123650002602150650002602176650002502202650001602227650002502243650001702268650002402285650001902309650001302328650001002341650002102351650003802372650001202410650003302422650001402455650001202469653001102481653002502492653000702517653001402524700005702538700001502595700001902610700001802629700002102647700001502668700001602683700002002699700002202719700005802741773013602799856007402935852000903009655001203018IND60673303820221207081911.0191018e20180525xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067330382DNAL7 a10.1093/jxb/ery1312doi7 aPMC59726142pmcid7 a296599862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qian10aBrassica yellows virus P0 protein impairs the antiviral activity of NbRAF2 in Nicotiana benthamiana  ap. 3127-3139.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn interactions between poleroviruses and their hosts, few cellular proteins have been identified that directly interact with the multifunctional virus P0 protein. To help explore the functions of P0, we identified a Brassica yellows virus genotype A (BrYV-A) P0ᴮʳᴬ-interacting protein from Nicotiana benthamiana, Rubisco assembly factor 2 (NbRAF2), which localizes in the nucleus, cell periphery, chloroplasts, and stromules. We found that its C-terminal domain (amino acids 183–211) is required for self-interaction. A split ubiquitin membrane-bound yeast two-hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed that NbRAF2 interacted with P0ᴮʳᴬ, and co-localized in the nucleus and at the cell periphery. Interestingly, the nuclear pool of NbRAF2 decreased in the presence of P0ᴮʳᴬ and during BrYV-A infection, and the P0ᴮʳᴬ-mediated reduction of nuclear NbRAF2 required dual localization of NbRAF2 in the chloroplasts and nucleus. Tobacco rattle virus-based virus-induced gene silencing of NbRAF2 promoted BrYV-A infection in N. benthamiana, and the overexpression of nuclear NbRAF2 inhibited BrYV-A accumulation. Potato leafroll virus P0ᴾᴸ also interacted with NbRAF2 and decreased its nuclear accumulation, indicating that NbRAF2 may be a common target of poleroviruses. These results suggest that nuclear NbRAF2 possesses antiviral activity against BrYV-A infection, and that BrYV-A P0ᴮʳᴬ interacts with NbRAF2 and alters its localization pattern to facilitate virus infection.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671995a31371909a31071663cNational Natural Science Foundation of Chinadhttps://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809  aB13006c111 project0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBrassica yellows virus 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPotato leafroll virus 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acids 3aantiviral properties 3achloroplasts 3agene overexpression 3agene silencing 3agenotype 3ahosts 3aprecipitin tests 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3atobacco 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3aubiquitin 3aviruses 0aNbRAF2 0anuclear localization 0aP0 0astromules1 aLi, Yuan-Yuan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4133-12631 aWang, Ying1 aZhao, Hang-Hai1 aZhao, Tian-Yu1 aZhang, Zong-Ying1 aLi, Da-Wei1 aYu, Jia-Lin1 aWang, Xian-Bing1 aZhang, Yong-Liang1 aHan, Cheng-Gui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1584-71700 tJournal of experimental botany.g2018 May 25, v. 69, no. 12 p.3127-3139dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl44658x1460-24317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/ery1313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03184naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245014900175300001400324520175500338592002802093650001402121650001402135650001102149650002402160650001402184650001102198650001302209650001802222650001302240650002302253650002302276650002002299650001802319653001502337653001402352653001302366653002302379653001502402653001802417700002502435700002102460700002102481773010102502856009002603852000902693655001202702IND50060442820221116192952.0190318e20130215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006044282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.10.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJensen, Mark A.14aThe effect of stocking density on growth, metabolism and ammonia–N excretion during larval ontogeny of the spiny lobster Sagmariasus verreauxi  ap. 45-53.  aStocking density is a critical factor affecting performance of aquatic organisms in culture, however, its influence on energy utilisation has rarely been considered. Energy partitioning is particularly important for spiny lobster phyllosoma, which must accumulate sufficient energy reserves for metamorphosis and the non-feeding puerulus stage. The current study is the first to examine the energetics of spiny lobsters throughout the entire phyllosoma phase and determined the physiological influence of density. Growth and development, oxygen consumption and ammonia–N excretion rates were measured in Sagmariasus verreauxi phyllosoma that were cultured at High Density (HD) and Low Density (LD) from hatch to puerulus. Phyllosoma growth and development was more advanced in LD phyllosoma after 108 day in culture and mass of LD instar 17 phyllosoma was greater. There were no differences in routine metabolic rate (Rr) and ammonia–N excretion of phyllosoma between densities. However, the O:N ratio decreased in final instar phyllosoma demonstrating a shift towards higher protein catabolism. Routine metabolic rate also increased in late stage phyllosoma, possibly due to higher energy requirements in preparation for metamorphosis and increased swimming activity. The Rr of spiny lobster larvae was significantly lower than that of other crustacean larvae, which may be a characteristic of their extended larval phase, slower growth rate, and larger body size. The study demonstrated late stage phyllosoma have higher weight specific energy requirements than the preceding larval stages and exhibit a metabolic shift towards protein catabolism, suggesting an increased importance of storing lipid as an energy reserve for the puerulus stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3abody size 3aenergy 3aenergy requirements 3aexcretion 3alarvae 3alobsters 3ametamorphosis 3aontogeny 3aoxygen consumption 3aprotein metabolism 3aspecific energy 3astocking rate 0aEnergetics 0aO:N ratio 0aOntogeny 0aOxygen consumption 0aPhyllosoma 0aSpiny lobster1 aFitzgibbon, Quinn P.1 aCarter, Chris G.1 aAdams, Louise R.0 tAquaculture.g2013 Feb. 15, v. 376-379 p.45-53dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.10.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02593naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003800139245015300177300001600330500002000346520099900366592002801365596004001393596003901433596002501472596003001497650002401527650002801551650002701579650001601606650001301622650000901635650002301644650000901667650001501676650001001691650000701701650001501708650002201723650001901745700007801764700007501842773012401917856007302041852000902114655001202123IND60627726620221118041652.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062772662DNAL7 a10.1111/jfd.129282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález‐Palacios, Concepción10aBiocontrol of saprolegniosis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum) using two bacterial isolates (LE89 and LE141) of Pseudomonas fluorescens  ap. 269-275.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe probiotic activity of 15 bacterial isolates that inhibit Saprolegnia parasitica in vitro was tested for the biocontrol of saprolegniosis in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss Walbaum), adding the bacteria to tank water for 14 days at a concentration of 10⁶ bacteria ml⁻¹ water.

Structural and kinetic analyses of these states, made possible by cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), X-ray crystallography, and single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET), have provided important insights into the translocation process, which is now understood to proceed, at least in the first step of the process, as a Brownian machine that is transiently stabilized in the ‘productive’ MS II conformation by the binding of the translocase elongation factor G (EF-G).  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3amicroscopy 3atransfer RNA0 tCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology.g2012 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.778-785dElsevier Ltdx0959-440X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2012.08.0013Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011500159300001400274506002800288520153600316592002801852506003701880650002001917650001601937650002201953650001101975650001401986650001502000650001702015650000902032651001002041653001102051653001102062653002202073653001002095700002202105700001902127700001802146700001902164700002302183700002302206773013002229856007402359852000902433655001202442IND60739721320221207091421.0210331e202103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073972132DNAL7 a10.5455/faa.529982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhanal, Prakash10aEffect of various phosphorus levels on growth and yield of chilli (Capsicum annuum) in Deukhuri, Dang of Nepal  ap. 78-85.  aResource is Open Access  aPhosphorus affects the growth, development, maturity, earliness in flowering, fruiting and yield of chilli. The level and availability of phosphorus for chilli depend on the phosphorus already present in soil and climatic conditions. However, sufficient information is not available about the effect of various phosphorus levels on chilli production for the soil with a medium phosphorus level of the inner terai region of Nepal. Thus, the study was carried out to investigate the effect of various phosphorus levels on chilli on the soil having medium phosphorus at the Gadawa-4 Gangaparaspur of Deukhuri valley of the Dang district in 2018. The experiment consisted of six levels of phosphorus viz 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg P ha-1. The single factor experiment was laid in a Randomized Complete Block Design with four replications. The highest plant height (60.22 cm), number of primary branches (9.60), yield per plant (123.20 g) and per hectare (9.15 t ha-1), and early 50% flowering (44.00 days) were recorded in 90 kg P ha-1. 60 kg P ha-1 showed the highest number of fruits per plant (60.22). The maximum fruit length (6.80 cm) was recorded at 120 kg P ha-1. The study concluded that a 90 kg P ha-1 showed superiority in terms of growth parameters and phenological parameter, yield per plant and per hectare. Therefore, a 90 kg P ha-1 could be used to get the highest yield of chilli for the soil with a medium phosphorus level of inner terai place like Deukhuri, Dang of Nepal.

Therefore, lab-scale anaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactors (AnDMBRs) without and with the addition of zero-valent iron (ZVI) (i.e., AnDMBR1 versus AnDMBR2) were developed for preconcentrated domestic wastewater (PDW) treatment, and the impact of ZVI addition on process performance and associated mechanisms were investigated. The stepwise addition of ZVI from 2 to 4 to 6 g/L improved the treatment performance as COD removal slightly increased and TP removal and methane production were enhanced by 53.3%–62.9% and 22.6%–31.3%, respectively, in consecutive operational phases. However, the average increasing rate of the transmembrane pressure (TMP) in AnDMBR2 (0.18 kPa/d) was obviously higher than that in AnDMBR1 (0.05 kPa/d), indicating an unfavorable impact of dosing ZVI on the dynamic membrane (DM) filtration performance. ZVI that has transformed to iron ions (mainly Fe²⁺) can behave as a coagulant, electron donor or inorganic foulant, thus enabling the excellent removal of dissolved phosphorous, enhancing the enrichment and activities of specific methanogens and causing the formation of a compact DM layer. Morphological, componential, and microbial community analyses provided new insights into the functional mechanisms of ZVI added to membrane-assisted anaerobic digesters, indicating that ZVI has the potential to improve bioenergy production and resource recovery, while optimizing the ZVI dosage should be considered to alleviate membrane fouling.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3abioenergy 3acarbon 3achemical oxygen demand 3acoagulants 3aenvironment 3afiltration 3airon 3amembrane bioreactors 3amethane production 3amethanogens 3amicrobial communities 3amunicipal wastewater 3aphosphorus 3awastewater treatment 0aAnaerobic dynamic membrane bioreactor 0aZero-valent iron 0aPreconcentrated wastewater 0aCarbon capture 0aBioenergy recovery 0aBiochemical methane production1 aZang, Ying1 aYang, Yuan1 aDuan, Ao1 aWang, Xiaochang C.1 aNgo, Huu Hao1 aLi, Yu-You1 aDu, Runda0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 742 p.140687-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02734naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005900140245009700199300001800296500002000314520140800334592002801742596005201770596002701822650002401849650002601873650003001899650000801929650002001937650002201957650000901979650000801988650002301996650001102019700002402030700002202054700001902076773014502095856007502240852000902315655001202324IND60788375320221120173749.0220813e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078837532DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.103662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBieber, John F.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3339-743010aImpact of Ice‐Angling and Handling on Swimming Performance in Bluegill and Largemouth Bass  ap. 1301-1310.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMany recreational anglers practice catch‐and‐release; however, research indicates that capture and handling has the potential to adversely affect fish. Numerous catch‐and‐release studies have been conducted during warmer months, but little work has been done during the winter when ice‐anglers in temperate regions target fish. We conducted an ice angling simulation that quantified the impacts of air temperature and air exposure duration on swimming performance and gill physiology of Bluegill Lepomis macrochirus and Largemouth Bass Micropterus salmoides. In all experiments, fish were first subjected to a simulated angling bout in water at 5°C, followed by 30 s or 5 min of air exposure at above freezing (3–8°C) or subfreezing (−7°C) temperatures. The fish were then assessed for critical swimming speed (Bluegill), oxygen consumption (Bluegill), burst swimming (Largemouth Bass), or gill damage (Largemouth Bass). Results showed that Bluegill subjected to 5 min of air exposure at −7°C suffered impaired swimming, with a 47% loss in critical swimming speed (Ucᵣᵢₜ) compared with the controls. Treatment had no impact on burst swimming or gill damage in Largemouth Bass. The results demonstrate the possible impacts of air exposure on fish, and we recommend that ice‐anglers make an effort to minimize air exposure duration, especially when air temperatures are low.  aPublisher supplied data  aF-69-RcUnited States Fish and Wildlife Service  cUniversity of Illinois 3aLepomis macrochirus 3aMicropterus salmoides 3aadministrative management 3aair 3aair temperature 3aexposure duration 3afish 3aice 3aoxygen consumption 3awinter1 aLouison, Michael J.1 aStein, Jeffrey A.1 aSuski, Cory D.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2019 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1301-1310dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.103663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03887naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245016300158300001800321520230900339592002802648650004402676650002402720650002502744650001302769650001302782650001702795650004402812650001102856650002602867650001202893650002002905650001102925653000802936653001902944653001102963653001502974653005402989653001503043700003203058700002103090700001903111700003303130700002203163773012403185856007503309852000903384655001203393IND60527635920170706000000.0160715e20140611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052763592DNAL7 a10.1021/am501228q2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHall, Colin J.12aA Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Study of Post-Plasma Reactions in Organosilicone Microwave Plasma-Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) Coatings  ap. 8353-8362.  aPlasma-polymerized organosilicone coatings can be used to impart abrasion resistance and barrier properties to plastic substrates such as polycarbonate. Coating rates suitable for industrial-scale deposition, up to 100 nm/s, can be achieved through the use of microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), with optimal process vapors such as tetramethyldisiloxane (TMDSO) and oxygen. However, it has been found that under certain deposition conditions, such coatings are subject to post-plasma changes; crazing or cracking can occur anytime from days to months after deposition. To understand the cause of the crazing and its dependence on processing plasma parameters, the effects of post-plasma reactions on the chemical bonding structure of coatings deposited with varying TMDSO-to-O₂ ratios was studied with ²⁹Si and ¹³C solid-state magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) using both single-pulse and cross-polarization techniques. The coatings showed complex chemical compositions significantly altered from the parent monomer. ²⁹Si MAS NMR spectra revealed four main groups of resonance lines, which correspond to four siloxane moieties (i.e., mono (M), di (D), tri (T), and quaternary (Q)) and how they are bound to oxygen. Quantitative measurements showed that the ratio of TMDSO to oxygen could shift the chemical structure of the coating from 39% to 55% in Q-type bonds and from 28% to 16% for D-type bonds. Post-plasma reactions were found to produce changes in relative intensities of ²⁹Si resonance lines. The NMR data were complemented by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Together, these techniques have shown that the bonding environment of Si is drastically altered by varying the TMDSO-to-O₂ ratio during PECVD, and that post-plasma reactions increase the cross-link density of the silicon–oxygen network. It appears that Si–H and Si–OH chemical groups are the most susceptible to post-plasma reactions. Coatings produced at a low TMDSO-to-oxygen ratio had little to no singly substituted moieties, displayed a highly cross-linked structure, and showed less post-plasma reactions. However, these chemically more stable coatings are less compatible mechanically with plastic substrates, because of their high stiffness.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aabrasion resistance 3achemical composition 3acoatings 3acracking 3acrosslinking 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aoxygen 3aquantitative analysis 3asilicon 3astable isotopes 3avapors 0aNMR 0aorganosilicone 0agraded 0athin-films 0aplasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) 0apostplasma1 aPonnusamy, Thirunavukkarasu1 aMurphy, Peter

DESIGN: Ex vivo study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENT(S): Fifteen premenopausal patients undergoing surgery for benign gynecologic disorders. INTERVENTION(S): Endometrial explants were obtained by aspiration curettage and stimulated ex vivo with interleukin-1β before exposure to CMA or DEX; mRNA levels were determined via reverse transcription–quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and concentrations of arachidonic acid metabolites by enzyme immunoassays. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Messenger RNA levels of COX-2, ANXA1, PR, and GR; concentrations of PGF₂α, LTB₄, and LTC₄ in endometrial explants treated with CMA or DEX. RESULT(S): In IL-1β–treated explants COX-2 mRNA and PGF₂α, concentrations were significantly down-regulated by CMA but not by DEX. Chlormadinone acetate did not affect mRNA abundance of ANXA1, PR, and GR. CONCLUSION(S): Our data suggest that CMA is a suppressor of COX-2 expression. Comparison with DEX revealed that progestin-specific activity of CMA may mainly be responsible for suppression of prostaglandin biosynthesis in human endometrium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetates 3aarachidonic acid 3abiosynthesis 3adexamethasone 3aendometrium 3aenzyme immunoassays 3aexplants 3agene expression regulation 3aglucocorticoid receptors 3ahumans 3ainterleukin-1beta 3aleukotrienes 3amechanism of action 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolites 3apain 3apatients 3apremenopause 3aprogesterone receptors 3aprostaglandins 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asurgery1 aSchäfer, Wolfgang R.1 aDeppert, Wolfgang R.1 aFischer, Lara1 aStein, Antonia1 aSeebacher, Laura1 avon Gradowski, Akou Seli1 aStuckenschneider, Johanna1 aZahradnik, Hans P.0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Oct., v. 98, no. 4 p.1017-1022dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02943naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006900139245008900208300001800297500002000315520112000335592002801455596003301483596008501516596006801601596006501669650001501734650001301749650001401762650002701776650001501803650001901818650001601837650002501853650001901878650002901897650001101926650002801937650002601965650000901991650001102000650002302011650001502034700003802049700002902087700004602116700003902162773013002201856007302331852000902404655001202413IND60614899120221117210257.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061489912DNAL7 a10.1111/eff.124202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilveira, Estevan Luiz da1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4603-894X10aFish community response to environmental variations in an impacted Neotropical basin  ap. 1126-1139.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aFish communities’ organisation is a challenging task due to global, local and temporal variations related to biotic and abiotic factors, highlighting anthropic activities. The Verde River Basin (VRB) was chosen as a model to the fish community study due to its complexity, presenting a longitudinal gradient of degradation. The ichthyofauna and abiotic factors were sampled during twelve months in four sites. Analyses employed rarefaction curves with Hill numbers estimators and canonical correspondence analysis. The endemic Apareiodon sp. (not described), Hypostomus albopunctatus, H. strigaticeps, Oligosarcus paranensis, Neoplecostomus yapo and Trichomycterus diabolus were associated with structurally complex and well‐preserved environments. In contrary, Astyanax aff. fasciatus, Corydoras ehrhardti, Geophagus brasiliensis, H. ancistroides and Phalloceros harpagos showed tolerance to impacted environments. The methods here employed allowed to identify and explain differences in the ichthyofauna structure, distinguishing the influence of spatial, temporal and human effects on the fish communities.  aPublisher supplied data  a45536cFundação Araucária  a305403/2015‐0cConselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior  a45536cFundação Grupo Boticário de Proteção à Natureza 3aApareiodon 3aAstyanax 3aCorydoras 3aGeophagus brasiliensis 3aHypostomus 3aNeoplecostomus 3aOligosarcus 3aPhalloceros harpagos 3aTrichomycterus 3aanthropogenic activities 3abasins 3acorrespondence analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3amodels 3atemporal variation 3awatersheds1 aBallester, Eduardo Luis Cupertino1 aCosta, Karine Andréa da1 aScheffer, Elizabeth Weinhardt de Oliveira1 aVaz‐dos‐Santos, André Martins0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 4 p.1126-1139dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895938x0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.124203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03089naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006300139245008200202500001900284500002000303520143000323592002801753596007001781596003301851650002601884650001801910650001801928650001701946650002001963650002401983650001102007650001802018650002102036650002002057650003102077650000902108650002202117650001502139650001602154650001602170650001502186651001702201700001802218700002602236700001902262700002102281700001902302700001902321773012502340856007302465852000902538655001202547IND60735972220221116204225.0210430e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073597222DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.141012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSlingsby, Jasper A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1246-118110aJonkershoek: Africa's oldest catchment experiment ‐ 80 years and counting  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe Jonkershoek Forestry Research Station was established in the Mediterranean climate region of South Africa in 1935 to implement a multiple catchment experiment to determine the effects of afforestation on water yield. The experiment consists of six neighbouring catchments previously supporting indigenous fynbos shrublands, five of which were sequentially afforested with Pinus radiata plantations every 8 years from 1940 to 1980 and one kept as the control. They conclusively demonstrated a significant impact of afforestation on streamflow. The treatment catchments have seen subsequent plantation rotations since 1980 and rainfall and streamflow observations have been continued to date. Here we describe the site, experimental design, rainfall and streamflow records, instrumentation, and how to access the data. We also provide details of recently installed instrumentation, including full weather stations, fog gauges, and an eddy covariance flux tower. The Jonkershoek catchment experiment was the core of a globally significant interdisciplinary research programme (1935–1992) that shaped most environmental policies and practices relating to biodiversity, forestry, fire and water in South Africa and beyond. The South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) inherited the experiment in 2010 and is maintaining it as a long‐term eco‐hydrological research platform and global change observatory.  aPublisher supplied data  aNatural Resources ManagementcDepartment of Environmental Affairs  cNational Research Foundation 3aMediterranean climate 3aPinus radiata 3aafforestation 3abiodiversity 3aeddy covariance 3aexperimental design 3afynbos 3aglobal change 3ahydrologic cycle 3ainstrumentation 3ainterdisciplinary research 3arain 3aresearch programs 3ashrublands 3astream flow 3awater yield 3awatersheds 3aSouth Africa1 ade Buys, Abri1 aSimmers, Adrian D.

This census accomplished much: it determined the area of soil loss, both wind and water in China; the total number of erosion gullies; and the area benefitting from soil and water conservation measures in China. This paper presents census methodology, organization and the extent of soil and water conservation measures. Results show that the total soil erosion area is 2.95×106 km2, in which 1.29×106 km2 is water erosion located mainly in regions of high population density, and 1.66×106 km2 is wind erosion mainly in Northwest China. Compared with data from the second remote sensing survey, the areas of water erosion and wind erosion have been reduced by 3.556 ×105 km2 and 2.508 ×105 km2 respectively. There were 666, 719 erosion gullies counted in the Loess Plateau of Northwest China and 295, 663 counted in the black soil region of Northeast China. There were 9.916×105 km2 of land area that benefited from soil and water conservation measures, including 2.003×105 km2 with engineering measures, 7.785×105 km2 with biological measures, and 1.28×104 km2 with other measures. This census will improve the current soil erosion database and will play a key role in future soil loss treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3aengineering 3apopulation density 3aravines 3aremote sensing 3asoil 3asurveys 3awater conservation 3awater erosion 3awind erosion 3aChina 0aChina 0aSoil erosion 0aCensus 0aDynamic changes0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2013 Sept., v. 1, no. 2 p.12-18dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30035-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03021naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245010100175300001900276520182900295592002802124650003002152650002002182650002002202650001702222650002702239650001002266650000802276650001302284650001002297650001602307700002002323700002002343700002202363700001902385773009902404856008802503990002302591852000902614655001202623IND60098611520221120051652.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009861152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeyer, Claire E.10aSupersensitive fluorescent semen analysis: validation on azoospermic and oligozoospermic samples  ap. 843-848.e1.  aOBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical utility of a supersensitive fluorescent semen analysis (SSSA) procedure published by Cooper et al. (2006) with a conventional World Health Organization (WHO)–based semen analysis technique in males with severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia who are undergoing fertility assessment. DESIGN: Prospective single-center study. SETTING: IVF clinic. PATIENT(S): Patients attending an infertility clinic for semen analysis. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Presence of spermatozoa in the ejaculate. RESULT(S): Semen samples from 100 men were analyzed using conventional WHO 4th Edition semen analysis and determined to be either severely oligozoospermic or azoospermic (reported lower limit of detection of 0.1 million sperm/mL). An aliquot of the same unprocessed sample was also analyzed using the SSSA protocol (reported lower limit of detection of approximately 8000 sperm/mL). The SSSA method confirmed the results of conventional semen analysis in 77% of cases. In 22% of cases, sperm were identified only using SSSA. Overall, SSSA was capable of identifying the presence of sperm in significantly more samples than conventional semen analysis. CONCLUSION(S): The reliable differentiation of extreme oligospermia from azoospermia has profound implications in fertility management. This paper provides the first data comparing sperm detection rates using SSSA or conventional WHO-based approaches in extreme oligozoospermic and azoospermic men in an IVF setting. Results indicate that approximately one in four men classified as azoospermic by conventional semen analysis may actually have sperm present. The improved sensitivity of the SSSA technique may be of significant benefit to patients, particularly in fertility and assisted reproductive technique decision making.  aPublisher supplied data 3aWorld Health Organization 3adecision making 3adetection limit 3afluorescence 3ain vitro fertilization 3amales 3amen 3apatients 3asemen 3aspermatozoa1 aKayler, Bettina1 aOsborne, Elissa1 aMcLachlan, Robert1 aOsianlis, Tiki0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Oct., v. 98, no. 4 p.843-848.e1dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0363Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02060naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094024001800126040001800144100002200162245010600184300001400290520080200304592002801106650001501134650002101149650001501170650001801185650002301203650001901226650001701245651001001262653002101272653001001293653001201303653001301315700003401328700002101362700001901383700002101402773012801423856007801551852000901629655001201638IND60596809920221119084223.0180620e201804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059680992DNAL7 a10.1636/JoA-S-16-064.12doi4 aarac-46-01-11  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSolís, Rigoberto10aDaily pattern of locomotor activity of the synanthropic spiders Loxosceles laeta and Scytodes globula  ap. 21-25.  aThe locomotor activity of the Chilean recluse spider Loxosceles laeta (Nicolet, 1849), and the spitting spider, Scytodes globula Nicolet, 1849, were studied in the laboratory under controlled conditions (LD 12:12). In Chile, these are two common synanthropic spiders which share a microhabitat and show extensive thermal niche overlap. Although no systematic studies have been performed, it has been reported that they have nocturnal habits. Here we confirmed strictly nocturnal activity for S. globula and mainly nocturnal but with some degree of diurnal activity for the Chilean recluse spider. Also, S. globula showed a bimodal pattern of activity while L. laeta had a unimodal one. The similarity of the use of space and time make the interaction of these spiders inside homes highly probable.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLoxosceles 3adiurnal activity 3alocomotion 3amicrohabitats 3anocturnal activity 3aspace and time 3asynanthropes 3aChile 0aCircadian rhythm 0aniche 0aoverlap 0abehavior1 aAlfaro, Ana I.q(Ana Isabel),1 aSegura, Bernardo1 aMoreno, Lucila1 aCanals, Mauricio0 tJournal of arachnology.g2018 Apr., v. 46, no. 1 p.21-25dAmerican Arachnological SocietywJournal:jnl7320x0161-82027nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1636/JoA-S-16-064.13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02761naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003400150245010600184300001600290520116500306592002801471650001001499650002501509650001801534650001201552650002801564650001501592650004301607650001901650650003201669650001501701650001401716653002201730653001901752653002301771653002501794653002401819700002601843700003301869700003401902700003201936700003401968700004302002700003002045773009902075856008402174852000902258655001202267IND60122627020221122031531.0150325e20140403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012262702DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2013.8010372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarriada-Bernal, Luis Gerardo10aFlavonoid composition and antioxidant capacity of the edible flowers of Agave durangensis (Agavaceae)  ap. 105-114.  aThe antioxidant properties and the flavonoid composition of extracts of different hydrophobicity prepared from the entire edible flowers of Agave durangensis were evaluated. Separately, total extracts of tepals and anthers–pollen were analyzed in the same manner. The high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC–DAD) analysis revealed a total of eight flavonols (five quercetin glycosides and three kaempferol glycosides), varying in number and concentration in the different extracts. The total extracts of the entire flowers showed the highest flavonoid content (1210.4 µg/g dry extract) and the most complex flavonoid profile (eight compounds). All the extracts showed important antioxidant activity, which was not evidently associated with their flavonoid content. The total extracts of tepals showed the highest antioxidant properties (total antioxidant capacity, free radical scavenging activity, and iron reducing capacity: 30.2 mg ascorbic acid equivalents, EC ₅₀ = 0.074 µg/mL, and IC ₅₀ = 43.28 µg/mL, respectively). The flowers of A. durangensis represent an important source of antioxidant flavonols.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgave 3aantioxidant activity 3aascorbic acid 3aflowers 3afree radical scavengers 3aglycosides 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrophobicity 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akaempferol 3aquercetin 0aAgave durangensis 0aedible flowers 0aflavonoid profiles 0aantioxidant capacity 0aflavonol glycosides1 aAlmaraz-Abarca, Norma1 aDelgado-Alvarado, Eli Amanda1 aGallardo-Velázquez, Tzayhrí1 aÁvila-Reyes, José Antonio1 aTorres Morán, Martha Isabel,1 aGonzález-Elizondo, María del Socorro1 aHerrera Arrieta, Yolanda,0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2014 Apr. 3, v. 12, no. 2 p.105-114dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2013.8010373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02156naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245009500154300001800249520095900267592002801226650001401254650001801268650001301286650001301299650001901312650001901331650001101350650001601361653002701377653001801404653004101422653003001463653002401493700001701517700001601534773012401550856007501674852000901749655001201758IND60527636020221120163227.0160715e20140611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052763602DNAL7 a10.1021/am501268g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Ying,10aConstructing Robust Liquid Marbles for Miniaturized Synthesis of Graphene/Ag Nanocomposite  ap. 8378-8386.  aMiniaturized synthesis is attracting much attention due to many potential applications; a challenge remains in exploring versatile microreactors capable of producing pure products. In this study, we reported a kind of thermally robust liquid marbles and their application for miniaturized synthesis of graphene/Ag nanocomposite. The liquid marbles were constructed by using superhydrophobic Fe₃O₄/C microsheets as encapsulating agents. Results revealed that the morphology of the encapsulating agent as well as the humidity of atmosphere strongly affected the robustness of liquid marbles at elevated temperature. The resulting graphene/Ag nanocomposite showed one of the best catalytic characteristics for 4-nitroaniline reduction among the reported catalysts. The findings of this study not only offer an alternative insight into the stability of liquid marbles at elevated temperature but also provide a facile strategy for miniaturized synthesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3aencapsulation 3agraphene 3ahumidity 3ahydrophobicity 3ananocomposites 3asilver 3atemperature 0aminiaturized synthesis 0aliquid marble 0asuperhydrophobic Fe3O4/C microsheets 0agraphene/Ag nanocomposite 0acatalytic reduction1 aWang, Zhikui1 aPan, Qinmin0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 June 11, v. 6, no. 11 p.8378-8386dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam501268g3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03059naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245012200161300001800283500002000301520188100321592002802202596004202230650002202272650003002294650000902324650001402333651001502347700002202362700002202384700001602406700002102422700002502443773014502468856007502613852000902688655001202697IND60788375620221120173730.0220813e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078837562DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.103832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPritt, Jeremy J.10aSpatial Gradients in Population Characteristics of Ohio River Sauger and Implications for a Length‐Based Regulation  ap. 1412-1425.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aSauger Sander canadensis provide a popular, harvest‐oriented fishery throughout the Ohio River and are managed jointly by the state fisheries resource agencies through the Ohio River Fisheries Management Team. For more than two decades, the Ohio River Sauger population has been dominated by small (<356 mm), young (<3 years old) individuals. Recently, Sauger abundance in the Ohio River has been near or below long‐term averages. Together, these observations prompted concern that overfishing may be occurring and that more restrictive harvest regulations may be necessary. We summarized Sauger population characteristics (abundance of age‐0 Saugers, abundance of Saugers ≥280 mm TL, growth, and mortality) based on data from Ohio River Fisheries Management Team population assessments conducted during the period of 2005–2017 and modeled the potential outcomes of applying a 356‐mm minimum length limit. During the period 2005–2017, abundance of age‐0 Saugers and abundance of Saugers ≥280 mm TL was greater with distance downstream but generally declined through time. Growth rates and total annual mortality rates increased with distance downstream and had no apparent temporal trends. Yield‐per‐recruit models showed that where Saugers grow fastest (i.e., downstream pools), implementing a minimum length limit could improve size structure and increase yield. However, where Saugers grow slowly (upstream pools), size structure would only increase marginally, and yields would likely decrease with a minimum length limit. Upstream to downstream gradients in Sauger population characteristics may therefore lead to differences in the effectiveness of length‐based regulations among Ohio River pools. Fisheries managers must therefore consider trade‐offs between the size of fish at harvest and yield before implementing minimum length limits.  aPublisher supplied data  cFederal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration 3aSander canadensis 3aadministrative management 3afish 3amortality 3aOhio River1 aDepew, Michael A.1 aHerrala, Jason R.1 aHirst, Jana1 aJansen, Craig R.1 aZipfel, Katherine J.0 tNorth American journal of fisheries management.g2019 Dec., v. 39, no. 6 p.1412-1425dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:19701x0275-59477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nafm.103833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01487naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147242007800178245006400256300001600320520045600336592002800792650002300820650001100843650001900854650001400873650001700887650000900904700002100913700002000934773011700954856008101071852000901152655001201161IND50071883920221122005956.0150212e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007188392DNAL7 a10.1007/s00107-013-0747-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRatnasingam, Jegatheswaran10aEinfluss eines Vordämpfens auf die Trocknungsqualität von Gummibaumholz10aEffects of pre-steaming on the drying quality of Rubberwood  ap. 135-137.  aIn this study, the kiln drying yield of 30 mm Rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis) furniture stocks with pre-steaming treatment was evaluated.

Analysis of the results revealed an operational efficiency of 61% for the solar collectors at a mean differential temperature (ΔT) of 51 °C as compared with the manufacturer’s rating of 70% at a ΔT of 60 °C. The absorption chiller did however perform quite satisfactorily and achieved a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.69 as compared with the manufacturer’s rating of 0.7 despite the slight deviation at the collectors end. The installation strategy for the hot water storage tanks also appears to have achieved its objective of maintaining controlled temperature stratification in the tanks. It could therefore be concluded that the system has proved its potential as a viable cooling technology for application in buildings. However, in order to maintain appropriate hot water supply temperature during low solar radiation levels, supplementary heat source such as gas or biomass fired system would have to be considered and incorporated into solar absorption cooling systems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3abiomass 3abuildings 3acollectors 3acooling 3acooling systems 3aheat 3asolar collectors 3asolar radiation 3atanks 3atemperature profiles 3awater supply1 aFraser, S.1 aChow, D.H.C.0 tEnergy.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.395-402dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.12.0453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011000166300001800276500001900294520140800313592002801721596006001749650004401809650002201853650003701875650001601912650002301928650002101951650001501972650001701987650002402004650001502028650003702043700001902080700002702099700002302126700002202149700001902171700007002190773012102260856008302381852000902464655001202473IND60717561520221120105605.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071756152DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05415-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMandal, Manas12aA high-performance pseudocapacitive electrode based on CuO–MnO2 composite in redox-mediated electrolyte  ap. 3325-3335.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn the present work, a simple and cost-effective precipitation approach was carried out to fabricate CuO nano-needle, and its electrochemical performance was evaluated in a redox-mediated electrolyte (2 M KOH and 0.3 M K₃Fe(CN)₆). A high specific capacitance of 2519 F/g was recorded at a specific current of 8 A/g. However, the electrode suffered from poor rate capability as the specific capacitance was rapidly decreased to 100 and 1 F/g when the specific current was increased to 30 and 50 A/g, respectively. The CuO nanoparticles were further modified with MnO₂ by a hydrothermal method, and the resulting CuO–MnO₂ (CMO6) electrode delivered a high specific capacitance of 539 F/g even at very high specific current of 50 A/g. The as-synthesized electrode materials were structurally and morphologically characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrochemical performances of the CuO and MnO₂–CuO composites have been examined in detail. Synopsis Modification of pristine CuO nano-needles with MnO₂ nanosheets improved the electrochemical performance of the material.

An analytical methodology which includes the study of the phase transition rate parameter, the determination of the activation energies by using Kissinger and Flynn–Wall–Ozawa models, and the study of the phase transition kinetics by the use of the Avrami theory, has been applied. The formation of the mesophases from the isotropic state occurred close to thermodynamic equilibrium. The results evidence the presence of several individual processes in the formation of liquid crystalline phases from the melt and a strong dependence of phase transition rates and activation energies with acid contents. A decrease in the phase transition rate, related to a decrease in the overall change of the transition entropy, has been observed. The final inhibition of the liquid crystal (LC) behaviour is ascribed to an exponential increase in the activation energy of the phase transition, promoted by strong acid aggregation. An optimum composition of the 10-MeOAzB/AMPS copolymers to achieve the dual characteristics of LCIs (ionogenic and liquid crystalline behaviour) requires acid concentrations capable of promoting structure-forming effects on the LC phases and the evolution of phase separated morphologies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3acalorimetry 3acomposite polymers 3aentropy 3aliquid crystals 3amelting 3amodels1 aBadia, J.D.1 aSantonja-Blasco, L.1 aImrie, C.T.1 aRibes-Greus, A.0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2013 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.1553-1563dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.01.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245006200156300001600218520072100234592002800955650001900983650002101002650001201023650001201035650002101047650000701068700001301075773012901088856007401217852000901291655001201300IND60765197920221123035416.0220422e20120111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076519792DNAL7 a10.17221/4636-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaňová, D.14aThe effect of stress factors on birch Betula pendula Roth  ap. 399-404.  aIn a controlled pot trial, plants of birch (Betula pendula Roth) were treated in six variants: acid watering (pH 3), acid watering with spraying, drought, ammonium sulphate fertilisation, ammonium sulphate fertilisation in combination with drought, and control. The response to the treatment with ammonium sulphate in terms of the increment was discordant as it increased the sensitivity of birch to frost. Drought had a negative effect on increments. A combination of ammonium sulphate and drought; drought; ammonium sulphate and sprayed acid watering delayed the shedding of leaves; this was due to a longer vegetation period, significantly higher nitrogen content in these variants, with the exception of drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aammonium sulfate 3adrought 3aforests 3anitrogen content 3apH1 aKula, E.0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 50, no. 9 p.399-404dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/4636-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03876naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245008000177300001500257520268800272592002802960650001102988650001202999650001603011650001103027650001803038650001903056650000903075650001503084650001603099650000903115651001303124653002403137653002903161653001603190653002103206653001303227700002203240773009703262856008603359852000903445655001203454IND60600168020221119050432.0180703e20140315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060016802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.11.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeetham, Edward Paul10aWave energy gradients and shoreline change on Vabbinfaru platform, Maldives  ap. 98-110.  aThis study examined coral reef platform wave processes and shoreline dynamics over short timescales. Wave energy gradients and shoreline change were measured over a 3-week period on Vabbinfaru platform, North Malé Atoll, Maldives, during the westerly monsoon in June 2010. Wave processes were measured using nine pressure sensors recording near continuous data for 19days around the reef and shoreline of a small circular sand cay. Toe of beach position was surveyed before, during and after the deployment to map changes in shoreline configuration. Results show that wave height and direction on the windward reef are closely controlled by local wind activity inside the atoll lagoon. Wave transformation across the platform was found to exhibit strong tidal modulation and results in distinct cross-reef energy zonation. Results are presented by comparing two contrasting boundary wind conditions: the first 2weeks characterised by moderate southwest winds, and the third week characterised by stronger northwest winds. Wave data was interpolated to platform scale and used to show spatial variations in energy exposure during the different boundary conditions. Under southwest winds, greatest wave energy was present on the western and leeward (eastern) reefs, driving an energy gradient towards the sheltered northern and southern shorelines. A net 4.5% increase in beach area was measured during this period. During stronger northwest winds, higher wave energy impacted the reef and was concentrated on the western reef, northern reef and northwest shoreline. An energy gradient formed around the island towards a low energy zone located at the southeast shoreline. Significant shoreline change occurred during this period with the toe of beach retreating landward by more than 10m on the northwest, northeast and southwest of Vabbinfaru Island. Beach area was reduced by 3761m² (17%) as the shoreline was forced to adjust in response to a new hydrodynamic regime. Results show that the coral reef platform is able to modify and filter the incident wave climate, resulting in marked spatial differences in wave spectra. Spatial differences in wave energy are sensitive to local wind activity, resulting in rapid alteration in wave energy distribution around the platform. Results highlight that reef island shorelines are morphologically sensitive to short-term changes in boundary wind and wave conditions. Wave energy gradients driven by local wind activity have the potential to drive alongshore fluxes of sediment around island shorelines. Therefore, changes to the process regime can result in disequilibrium of the shoreline, forcing rapid adjustment of island sediment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatolls 3aclimate 3acoral reefs 3aenergy 3ahydrodynamics 3amonsoon season 3asand 3ashorelines 3awater power 3awind 3aMaldives 0aWave transformation 0aCoral reef hydrodynamics 0aReef island 0aShoreline change 0aMaldives1 aKench, Paul Simon0 tGeomorphology.g2014 Mar. 15, v. 209 p.98-110dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12407x0169-555X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2013.11.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003600092040001800128100002000146245010900166300001600275500001500291520154900306592002801855650001001883650002501893650001001918650001001928650003801938650001301976650001901989650002202008650001302030650002202043650002202065650001902087650001402106650002302120650002202143650002502165650002302190650001202213650005202225650002502277650004402302651001002346653001502356653002102371653001602392653002402408700001702432700001902449700002502468700002502493700002202518700001802540773013202558852000902690856008302699655001202782IND4447796620221119144123.0181016e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444779662DNAL7 a10.1177/1040638710022005142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCabezón, Oscar10aBorder Disease Virus Shedding and Detection in Naturally Infected Pyrenean Chamois (Rupicapra Pyrenaica)  ap. 744-747.  a2019-12-04  aPyrenean chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica) populations of the central and eastern Pyrenees have been affected by severe outbreaks associated with Border disease virus (BDV) since 2001. Eight Pyrenean chamois (7 males and 1 female) from 1 to 8 years of age with clinical signs consistent with BDV infection were studied. At necropsy, whole blood, tissue samples (skin, brain, prescapular lymph node, thyroid gland, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine, bone marrow, and testicle), urine, and nasal, oral, and rectal swabs were obtained. The fetus from a pregnant female was also studied. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the virus in all samples, and virus isolation was performed. Sera and tissue samples were positive to RT-PCR, and the virus was isolated from all chamois. The nasal, oral, and rectal swabs and urine samples were RT-PCR positive in 100%, 85.71%, 71.43%, and 100% of chamois, respectively, confirming the excretion of the virus via these 4 routes. In addition, sera were tested for BDV antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and seroneutralization techniques, with negative results. Sequence analysis of the 5′ untranslated region in 7 of the chamois confirmed that the virus is grouped into the BDV-4 genotype, the same BDV previously described in Pyrenean chamois. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study of naturally infected Pyrenean chamois, providing evidence that infected animals shed BDV through nasal, oral, fecal, and urinary excretion routes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aurine 3aneutralization tests 3ablood 3afeces 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3agenotype 3aanimal tissues 3adisease detection 3asampling 3awildlife diseases 3adisease outbreaks 3aborder disease 3aRupicapra 3amicrobial genetics 3adisease diagnosis 3aBorder disease virus 3avirus transmission 3achamois 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3anucleotide sequences 3asigns and symptoms (animals and humans) 3aSpain 0aPestivirus 0aPyrenean chamois 0abody fluids 0aRupicapra pyrenaica1 aRosell, Rosa1 aVelarde, Roser1 aMentaberre, Gregorio1 aCasas-Díaz, Encarna1 aLavín, Santiago,1 aMarco, Ignasi0 tJournal of veterinary diagnostic investigation.g, v. 22, no. 5 p.744-747dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl43656x1040-63877nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1040638710022005143Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02741naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245012300174300001200297500001900309520125500328592002801583650001901611650002101630650002201651650000801673650002401681650002101705650001401726650001601740650002301756650001301779650001501792650001501807650001801822650001601840650002001856650001901876650001601895650001001911700005901921700005701980773014202037856008302179852000902262655001202271IND60717561720221120105519.0201124e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071756172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-020-04876-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández, Gabriela,10aEffect of Pretreatment on Nutrient Leaching and Phytotoxicity of Biosolids from Anaerobic Digestion in Silty Loam Soil  ap. 549.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pretreatment on the phytotoxicity and leaching of nitrogen and phosphorus in biosolids from anaerobic digestion in silty loam soil. Soil columns filled with silty loam soil and biosolids (BS) stabilized by conventional (CAD) and advanced (AAD) anaerobic digestion were installed. AAD consisted of the application of sequential pretreatments: ultrasound followed by a low thermal process. The BS loads were equivalent to 30 ton/ha (CAD30 and AAD30) and 90 ton/ha (CAD90 and AAD90), and the soil columns were watered with 29 mL/day of distilled water. Phytotoxicity was evaluated by germination and root growth inhibition and by the germination index (GI) of Triticum aestivum, Lactuca sativa, and Raphanus sativus seeds. Nitrogen leaching varied from 0 to 9 mg/week, while phosphate leaching did not exceed 0.01 mg/week. The nutrient leaching rate depended on the BS application rate and not on the use of pretreatment (p < 0.05). Regarding phytotoxicity, BS application presented a tendency to attenuate the inhibition caused by the silty loam soil, with GI values ranging from 31 to 50%, 62 to 63%, and 70 to 82% for L. sativa, R. sativus, and T. aestivum, respectively.Graphical abstract  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactuca sativa 3aRaphanus sativus 3aTriticum aestivum 3aair 3aanaerobic digestion 3aapplication rate 3abiosolids 3agermination 3agrowth retardation 3anitrogen 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3aphytotoxicity 3aroot growth 3asilt loam soils 3asoil pollution 3aultrasonics 3awater1 aVenegas, María1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8646-25931 aVidal, Gladys1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7433-50040 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2020 Nov., v. 231, no. 11 p.549-549dSpringer International PublishingwJournal:jnl4876x0049-69797nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-020-04876-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02381naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008400172520109900256592002801355650001801383650002201401650001601423650002001439650001501459650002201474650002501496650001001521650001901531650001701550650001001567651003201577651001001609653001601619653001801635653002701653653002201680653002001702700001801722773011501740856008301855852000901938655001201947IND60626687020221118182449.0190426e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062668702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2018.1004792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYalla, Suneel Kumar10aDNA barcoding of commercially important cephalopods from Andaman Islands, India  aCephalopods (cuttlefishes, squids and octopuses) are highly commercially important marine organisms in the Andaman Islands. DNA barcoding is an effective tool used for identification of individuals at the lowest taxon (species) level and is been widely used for the detection of structural ambiguity of several organisms. In the present study, DNA fragments of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 (COI) gene comprising 658 base pairs (bp) were amplified by employing forward LCO 1490 and reverse HCO 2198 primers. Amplified sequences were trimmed to length of 583 bp for complete alignment. The average nucleotide frequencies were studied for eight individuals belonging to seven species (Sepia pharaonis, Sepia aculeata, Uroteuthis duvauceli, Sepioteuthis lessoniana, Octopus cyanea, Abdopus aculeatus, Octopodidae sp.) as A=29.82%, T=35.35%, G=15.33% and C=19.35%, respectively. Genetic studies revealed that the eight individuals of Coleoid cephalopods belonged to three taxonomic groups viz, (Sepioidea, Myopsida and Octopoda) under different families (Sepiidae, Loliginidae, Octopodidae).  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA barcoding 3aDNA fragmentation 3aOctopodidae 3aSepia pharaonis 3aUroteuthis 3aaquatic organisms 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3agenes 3amarine science 3amitochondria 3asquid 3aAndaman and Nicobar Islands 3aIndia 0aCephalopods 0aDNA barcoding 0aCytochrome c oxidase 1 0aPhylogenetic tree 0aAndaman Islands1 aMohanraju, R.0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2019 Jan., v. 25 p.100479-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.1004793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02064naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003000140245005900170300001800229520060700247592002800854650001600882650001700898650001800915650001900933650001400952650000700966650001700973650002800990700002401018700002601042700002201068700002301090700002401113700002401137700002001161700001901181700002001200700002201220700001601242700002101258700001901279700002201298700002501320773014201345856007401487852000901561655001201570IND60642456220221120160702.0190507e20160830xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064245622DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb01915c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJimenez, Chiara Mauriello10aNanodiamond–PMO for two-photon PDT and drug delivery  ap. 5803-5808.  aIn this article, we highlight the properties of nanodiamonds (ND), which were encapsulated in periodic mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (PMO) and were able to generate reactive oxygen species for photodynamic applications upon two-photon excitation (TPE).

The 10.5 km² watershed, located in the Eastern Temperate Mixed Forest on the Canadian Shield, has been the site of multidisciplinary studies on biogeochemical and ecological processes conducted across plot to catchment scales. The whole‐ecosystem investigative approach was adopted from the outset and has allowed research to evolve from its original (and continuing) acidification focus to include investigations on the effects of climate change, forest harvesting and other forest ecosystem perturbations. The extensive scientific and support infrastructure allows for collection of a comprehensive data record essential for understanding long‐term environmental trends. Data include atmospheric deposition, meteorology, stream hydrology and chemistry, soil, pore and ground water properties, understory and overstory vegetation, lake and outflow physical and chemical properties, and aquatic macroinvertebrate and fish community composition and abundance. These data have contributed to over 400 published research papers and graduate theses. The watershed has also figured prominently in many continent‐wide comparisons advancing fundamental watershed theory. The knowledge gained at TLW has influenced pollutant emission and natural resource management policies provincially, nationally and internationally.  aPublisher supplied data  cNatural Resources Canada  cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aCanadian Shield 3aacid rain 3aacidification 3aclimate change 3acommunity structure 3afish communities 3aforest ecosystems 3agroundwater 3ainfrastructure 3alakes 3amacroinvertebrates 3ameteorology 3amixed forests 3anatural resource management 3aoverstory 3apollutants 3asoil 3astreams 3aunderstory 3awatersheds 3aOntario1 aLeach, Jason A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6639-79931 aHazlett, Paul W.1 aFleming, Robert L.1 aEmilson, Erik J.

To address this issue, a predictive model was developed based on fuzzy theory by taking into account the main geological factors that affect the gas enrichment and permeability in coal reservoirs. Following the statistical analysis on a number of geological parameters, Euclid approach degree (a comprehensive evaluation coefficient) and fuzzy matter-elements were determined and integrated into the model. The information entropy method was used to evaluate the effect weight of each geologic factor on overall object of the synergetic gas-enrichment and higher-permeability region. The model was applied to the coal seam No. 3 of a developing coal block in the south of Qinshui basin as an example. The results show that the geological factors such as coal rank, gas saturation, coping thickness, transitional coal structure, and volatile content determine the distributions of the synergetic gas-enrichment and higher-permeability region with higher weight coefficients over 9%. Compared with these key factors, the factors such as coal thickness, gas content, methane concentration, ash content, principal stress difference, fracture density, porosity, and burial depth have only the weight coefficients of <5% and their effects on the synergetic region are very limited. The other factors including reservoir temperature, groundwater level, minimum principal stress, and water content exhibit the moderate impact featured by the weight coefficients varying from 5% to 9%. The model prediction provided a flood/contour map to visualize the synergetic gas-enrichment and higher-permeability regions. With this map, the selected coal block can be classified as extremely favorable, favorable, relatively favorable and unfavorable areas for CBM recovery based on the Euclid approach degree. The extremely favorable and favorable areas mainly distribute in the center and the southwest of the coal block; the relatively favorable area locates in most part of the coal block; unfavorable area dispersedly distributes in the south along the east-west direction. The distribution of the synergetic regions is obviously controlled by the coal structure. The prediction results were verified with the distributions of most CBM wells performed in the same coal block, showing that the model prediction is reasonably agreeable with reality. The model developed in this study can be used as a feasible tool to predict the favorable well locations and optimize the well patterns for CBM recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3aash content 3abasins 3acoal 3acoalbed methane 3aentropy 3afuzzy logic 3amethane 3apermeability 3aporosity 3aprediction 3astatistical analysis 3atemperature 3awater content 3awater table 3awells1 aSang, Shuxun1 aWang, Geoff G.X.1 aLi, Yangmin1 aLi, Mengxi1 aLiu, Shiqi0 tEnergy.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.426-439dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.12.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02296naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245005200173300001400225520108400239592002801323650002301351650002901374650001701403650001501420650002001435650001501455651002501470653001801495653002301513653002501536700002101561700001901582773023801601856008601839852000901925655001201934IND60544427920221117173433.0190416e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054442792DNAL7 a10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30045-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLo Papa, Giuseppe14aThe “genetic erosion” of the soil ecosystem  ap. 11-18.  aThis paper takes into consideration the influence of human activities on the loss of pedodiversity in a Mediterranean area due to large scale farming. In particular it examines the quantitative and qualitative soil changes in a period of 53 years (from 1955 to 2008) evaluating the loss of soil diversity at soil subgroups level of the USDA Soil Taxonomy system. The following indices were used: richness; Shannon’s diversity index; Simpson diversity index; Shannon’s evenness index; Simpson’s evenness index. In this case study, considering what we observed in time, the human intervention in soil transformation could increase the diversity in the landscape in an initial phase, but forwarding by large scale farming the result is a huge loss of pedodiversity in time, as diversity indices remarkably have shown. This analysis enabled identification of disappeared soil types, with their unique history of formation. In our opinion this strongly reflects a sort of “genetic erosion” of the soil types, resulting in a substantial weakening of the whole pedo-ecosystem.  aPublisher supplied data 3aU.S. Soil Taxonomy 3aanthropogenic activities 3acase studies 3alandscapes 3asoil ecosystems 3asoil types 3aMediterranean region 0aPedodiversity 0aAnthropogenic soil 0aSoil genetic erosion1 aPalermo, Vanessa1 aDazzi, Carmelo0 tInternational soil and water conservation research.g2013 June, v. 1, no. 1 p.11-18dElsevier B.V.aInternational Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water & Power PresswJournal:23246x2095-63397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S2095-6339(15)30045-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002800188245010100216300001200317500001100329506007600340520189700416592002802313506003702341650001302378650001602391650001102407650002402418650001402442650002602456650002302482650001002505650003202515650001802547650001502565650001402580650003002594650001702624650001402641650001302655650001002668650002202678650001702700650002002717651001202737700003002749773011302779856008202892852000902974655001202983IND60593584520221207064002.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059358452DNAL7 a297202512pmid7 aPMC59307632pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2801-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOdeniran, Paul Olalekan12aA meta-analysis of the prevalence of African animal trypanosomiasis in Nigeria from 1960 to 2017  ap. 280.  aReview  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomiasis is an economically significant disease that affects the livestock industry in Nigeria. It is caused by several parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. National estimates of the disease prevalence in livestock and tsetse flies are lacking, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to understand the trend of the disease prevalence over the years. METHODS: Publications were screened in Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE and PubMed databases. Using four-stage (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) process in the PRIMSA checklist, only studies that met the inclusion criteria for AAT and tsetse infections were analysed. Point estimates prevalence and subgroup analyses based on diagnostic techniques in livestock were evaluated at 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 74 eligible studies published between 1960 and 2017 were selected for meta-analysis. This covers the six geopolitical zones, involving a total of 53,924 animals. The overall prevalence of AAT was 16.1% (95% CI: 12.3–20.3%). Based on diagnostic techniques, the prevalence of AAT in cattle was highest in PCR followed by serology and microscopy while the highest prevalence in pigs was observed with serology. Out of 12,552 tsetse flies examined from 14 eligible studies, an overall prevalence of 17.3% (95% CI: 4.5–36.0%) and subgroup prevalence of 49.7% (95% CI: 30.7–68.8%), 11.5% (95% CI: 6.1–18.5) and 4.5% (95% CI: 1.8–8.8%) in G. morsitans, G. tachinoides and G. palpalis, respectively, were observed using the random effects-model. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of trypanosomes in both vectors and animal hosts was high in Nigeria. Therefore, further research on risk factors, seasonal and transhumance effects, vectoral capacity and competence are warranted for an effective control of AAT in Nigeria.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGlossina 3aTrypanosoma 3acattle 3aconfidence interval 3adatabases 3adiagnostic techniques 3adisease prevalence 3ahosts 3alivestock and meat industry 3ameta-analysis 3amicroscopy 3aparasites 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arisk factors 3ascreening 3aserology 3aswine 3asystematic review 3atranshumance 3atrypanosomiasis 3aNigeria1 aAdemola, Isaiah Oluwafemi0 tParasites & vectors.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.280-280dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4347486x1756-33057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2801-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02236naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024002200121024001900143040001800162100001400180245013200194300001800326506007600344520069200420592002801112506003701140650001701177650001301194650002201207650002501229650004001254653001701294653002201311653002501333653003701358653001501395700001801410700001501428700002301443700001401466700001201480700001801492700001801510700001801528773012401546856007501670852000901745655001201754IND60527636620221207082225.0160715e20140611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052763662DNAL7 a10.1021/am501309d2doi7 aPMC40592622pmcid7 a247498322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin10a“Click” Immobilization of a VEGF-Mimetic Peptide on Decellularized Endothelial Extracellular Matrix to Enhance Angiogenesis  ap. 8401-8406.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe show that coating of decellularized extracellular matrix (DC-ECM) on substrate surfaces is an efficient way to generate a platform mimicking the native ECM environment. Moreover, the DC-ECM can be modified with a peptide (QK) mimicking vascular endothelial growth factor without apparently compromising its integrity. The modification was achieved through metabolic incorporation of a “clickable” handle to DC-ECM followed by rapid attachment of the QK peptide with an azido tag using copper-catalyzed click reaction. The attachment of the QK peptide on to DC-ECM in this way further enhanced the angiogenic responses (formation of branched tubular networks) of endothelial cells.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aangiogenesis 3acoatings 3aendothelial cells 3aextracellular matrix 3avascular endothelial growth factors 0aangiogenesis 0adecellularization 0aextracellular matrix 0acopper-catalyzed click chemistry 0aQK peptide1 aZhao, Meirong1 aLi, Siheng1 aErasquin, Uriel J.1 aWang, Hao1 aRen, Li1 aChen, Changyi1 aWang, Yingjun1 aCai, Chengzhi0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2014 June 11, v. 6, no. 11 p.8401-8406dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fam501309d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03458naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100005800140245012300198300001400321500002000335520219300355592002802548596007602576650002502652650003002677650001802707650002302725650000902748650001502757650001902772650001402791650001302805700002102818700002002839773014102859856007503000852000903075655001203084IND60788376320221117003845.0220813e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078837632DNAL7 a10.1002/nafm.103722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoeppky, A.

To measure the success of stocking efforts for depressed populations, hatchery‐reared individuals must be distinguishable from naturally spawned fish, potentially many years after release. Biological tags are attractive due to their ability to batch‐mark whole cohorts in a cost‐effective manner, with minimal disruption to hatchery procedures and reduced handling stress inflicted on individuals during the marking process. Elemental marking may occur naturally or via deliberate manipulation of the concentration of specific elements to create recognizable elemental signatures in the hard structures of fish (e.g., fin rays and otoliths). In this study, elemental signatures in the fin rays of known hatchery‐released Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens (ages 1–7) were quantified via laser ablation (LA) inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP‐MS) to assess whether the ambient water chemistry in a groundwater‐fed hatchery would create an elemental signature that facilitated discrimination of hatchery‐reared individuals from those naturally spawned in the wild. The concentrations of divalent trace elements, particularly Mn, within the first growth band of hatchery‐reared fish were significantly different from those of wild conspecifics, allowing us to accurately classify hatchery‐ versus wild‐spawned individuals with 99% success. In addition, we conducted a preliminary experiment to test the validity of two separate 24‐h immersions in ⁸⁶Sr and ¹³⁷Ba (immersions were conducted 30 d apart) to induce multiple combination marks in the fin rays of juvenile Lake Sturgeon. Fin rays collected 60 d after the second immersion were analyzed for isotopic ratios via LA ICP‐MS, and results indicated that elemental marking at both time points was achieved with 100% success. Induction of a combination of isotopic signatures could enable hatcheries to track the success of families or stocking groups within a single year‐class or across multiple year‐classes.  aPublisher supplied data  a05348‐15cNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada 3aAcipenser fulvescens 3aadministrative management 3aambient water 3acost effectiveness 3afish 3ahatcheries 3ahydrochemistry 3ajuveniles 3aotoliths1 aMcDougall, C.

The morphologies and structures of the O-Mt layers dispersion in the polymer matrix were detected using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The AAMC/O-Mt was characterized by FT-IR and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).The introduction of well-dispersed O-Mt layers exhibited a considerable enhancement of the comprehensive properties of nanocomposite, such as viscosification, temperature-tolerance, salt-resistance and shear-resistance. Compared with the pure copolymer AM/AMPS/MAH-β-CD (AAMC), the AAMC/1.0 wt% O-Mt revealed an impressive thermal stability at T = 85 ℃ after 15 days, and the viscosity reached ∼2 times that of AAMC. Dynamic rheology test demonstrated that O-Mt layers acted as multifunctional crosslinkers between polymer molecules so as to enhance the elasticity of AAMC/O-Mt. The results indicated that AAMC/O-Mt had potential application for enhanced oil recovery.  aPublisher supplied data 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3aX-ray diffraction 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3acolloids 3arheology 3ananocomposites 3aviscosity 3aoils 3atransmission electron microscopy 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3amontmorillonite 3acomposite polymers 3aacrylamides 3asulfonic acids 0aβ-Cyclodextrin 0aOrgano-montmorillonite 0asulfonic acid 0aIn situ polymerization 0aCopolymer nanocomposites 0aRheology1 aKe, Yangchuan1 aZhao, Yi1 aLü, Shichao,1 aDeng, Qingchun1 aYu, Chengcheng1 aPeng, Fangfang0 tColloids and surfaces.g2019 Jan. 05, v. 560 p.336-343dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.10.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03052naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024003800132040001800170100002000188245008500208300001600293506017300309520093400482592002801416650001401444650001601458650001301474650002201487650002001509650002201529650001801551650001401569650001201583650001301595650001401608650002801622650001601650651001901666653002301685653001801708653002501726653002201751700001901773700002101792700001901813700001701832700001801849700002601867700002101893700002201914700003301936700002101969773013401990856011202124856005102236956011702287961001302404852000902417655001202426IND50088706220221214225614.0140414e20120101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008870622DNAL7 a2574922aris7 a10113/614892hdl7 a10.1080/15538362.2011.6194472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcCallum, Susan10aDeveloping Tools for Long-Term Breeding of Blueberry Germplasm for UK Production  ap. 294-303.  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aFruit consumption in the UK, particularly of berry fruits, is expanding rapidly and consumer demand for blueberries (Vaccinium spp.) is at record levels with UK growers unable to meet current demand. Consumers are aware that eating fruit can be pleasurable and with appropriate packaging, convenient, but blueberry remains unfamiliar to a wide cross section of UK consumers. There is great potential for UK growers to supply high quality fresh blueberries across a wide season so that consumption of this healthy fruit can be integrated into the British diet. A genetic framework for future crop improvement is required to develop a thriving and sustainable industry. The genetic component of this project builds on the statistical developments derived from the software program, TetraploidMap, to identify fruit quality, health, and agronomic-related quantitative trait loci in tetraploid blueberry for marker assisted breeding.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVaccinium 3ablueberries 3abreeding 3acomputer software 3aconsumer demand 3afruit consumption 3afruit quality 3agermplasm 3agrowers 3aindustry 3apackaging 3aquantitative trait loci 3atetraploidy 3aUnited Kingdom 0ahighbush blueberry 0aTetraploidMap 0aVaccinium corymbosum 0amolecular biology1 aWoodhead, Mary1 aJorgensen, Linzi1 aGordon, Sandra1 aBrennan, Rex1 aGraham, Julie1 aHackett, Christine A.1 aRowland, Lisa J.1 aHancock, James F.1 aOlmstead, J.

As an initial step, it describes the preparation of thin films of TiO₂ by the sol-gel dip-coating technique on ITO conducting glass substrates. It then discusses the fabrication of the Al/TiO₂/ITO device and the characterization of direct current (DC) electrical properties of TiO₂ thin films. The current–voltage I (V) properties of TiO₂ were measured under different temperatures from 80 to 400 K, using a digital Keithley 6571A electrometer. The I (V) characteristics appeared to be ohmic at low voltage and the space charge was limited (SCL) at higher voltage. The activation energy (Eₐ) of TiO₂ was also calculated to yield two values, depending on the temperature regime. As the particle increased in size, the conductivity increased while the grain boundary effect was reduced. The results show that the film was the conductor. The surface structure of TiO₂ was studied to reveal the film’s uniformity and nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivation energy 3aelectrical properties 3aglass 3ananoparticles 3aphotovoltaic cells 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide0 tEnergy.g2012 Mar., v. 39, no. 1 p.6-10dElsevier Ltdx0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2011.08.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02949naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002500154245009300179300001800272520166100290592002801951650001301979650001501992650002202007650002002029650002002049650001602069650001302085650004302098650005202141650001802193651001902211700002802230700002802258700001802286700001702304773009802321856008802419990002302507852000902530655001202539IND60098612520221120204553.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009861252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSadek, Khaled Hassan10aVariation in stability of housekeeping genes in healthy and adhesion-related mesothelium  ap. 1023-1027.  aOBJECTIVE: To investigate the stability of various housekeeping genes (HKG) within healthy versus scarred peritoneal mesothelium. The use of HKG as internal controls for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) studies is based on the assumption of their inherent stability. However, recent evidence suggests that this is not true for all HKG and that stability may be tissue specific and affected by certain pathologies. DESIGN: Paired mesothelial (n = 10) and adhesion tissue samples (n = 10) were taken during laparoscopic surgery. The stability of 12 candidate reference genes in the mesothelial tissues were evaluated; these include ATP5b, SDHA, CYC1, 18S rRNA, RPL13A, ACTB, YWHAZ, TOP1, UBC, EIF4A2, GAPDH, and B2M. SETTING: Hospital. PATIENT(S): Female patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery were recruited from the Princess Anne Hospital, United Kingdom. INTERVENTION(S): Assessment of HKG expression stability using geNorm algorithm software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Stability measure (M) generated by geometric averaging of multiple target genes and mean pairwise variation of genes. RESULT(S): The most stable HKGs observed across both healthy and adhesion-related mesothelium were found to be ACTB, YWHAZ, and CYC1. ACTB had a higher expression in healthy mesothelium compared with in peritoneal adhesion tissue. CONCLUSION(S): This study indicates that ACTB, YWHAZ, and CYC1 are the appropriate internal controls for qRT-PCR analysis in mesothelial gene expression studies. Published discrepancies in gene expression studies using the mesothelium may therefore be due in part to inappropriate HKG selection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aalgorithms 3acomputer software 3aessential genes 3agene expression 3alaparoscopy 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aUnited Kingdom1 aCagampang, Felino Ramon1 aBruce, Kimberley Davina1 aMacklon, Nick1 aCheong, Ying0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Oct., v. 98, no. 4 p.1023-1027dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0333Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245014700163300001400310520183800324592002802162650001902190650002102209650001302230650002202243650002002265650002502285650003402310650002102344650001602365650002902381650002502410650001802435650001802453650002202471700006302493700005502556773015202611856008202763852000902845655001202854IND60626687620221118183615.0190516e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062668762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.spc.2018.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRumayor, M.10aEnvironmental and economic assessment of the formic acid electrochemical manufacture using carbon dioxide: Influence of the electrode lifetime  ap. 72-82.  aThis paper focuses on the study of the environmental and economic feasibility of the formic acid (FA) synthesis by means of electrochemical reduction (ER) of carbon dioxide (CO2) with special emphasis on the cathode lifetime. The study has used a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach in order to obtain the environmental indicators as Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Abiotic Depletion (ADP) (both elements and fossil resources ADPs). The values of the indicators obtained in the assessment were representative of the Carbon Footprint (CF) and resource savings of this fabrication process. The commercial/conventional process for FA production was used as benchmark. The novelty of the study is the incorporation into the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) of those materials and chemicals that are used in the fabrication of an ER cell, and in particular in the cathode. Hence, the lifetime of the cathode was used as a main parameter. The results obtained for a baseline case demonstrated that cathode lifetimes over 210 h would be enough to neglect the influence of the cathode fabrication from an environmental perspective. A first approach to the utility costs of CO2 ER process was also proposed in the study. Cost of utilities ranged between 0.16 € kg −1 and 1.40 € kg−1 of FA in an ER process compared with 0.21 € kg−1 and 0.43 € kg−1 of FA in the conventional process depending on the market prices. This study demonstrated that the ER-based process could be competitive under future conditions if a reasonable electrocatalytic performance (in terms of cell voltage, current density, and faradaic efficiency) is achieved within a reasonable medium or long-term horizon. The results obtained aim to provide useful insights for decision-makers on the future developments within a decarbonized chemical industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon footprint 3acathodes 3achemical industry 3adecision making 3aeconomic feasibility 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry 3aformic acid 3aglobal warming potential 3alife cycle inventory 3amanufacturing 3amarket prices 3amineral resources1 aDominguez-Ramos, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7322-42381 aIrabien, A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2411-41630 tSustainable Production and Consumption.g2019 Apr., v. 18 p.72-82dElsevier B.V.aInstitution of Chemical EngineerswJournal:23261x2352-55097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.spc.2018.12.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245008600175300001800261520125900279592002801538650002201566650001401588650002301602650002301625650001101648650001901659650001901678650001201697650001301709650004401722650002201766650002001788650001601808700002201824700001601846700002201862700002401884773009801908856008702006990002302093852000902116655001202125IND60098029520221120222216.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009802952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerrouani, Nadia10aEnvironment-friendly synthesis of amphiphilic polyester-graft-poly(vinyl alcohol)  ap. 1621-1633.  aExperimental conditions for the synthesis of poly(ε-caprolatone)-graft-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PCL-g-PVA) and poly(l-lactide)-graft-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PLLA-g-PVA) via a PVA/MgH₂ macroinitiator were optimized. Heat stability of PVA (99% hydrolyzed) in l-lactide (L-LA) melt was studied by DSC, TGA to lower the reaction temperature and time in order to avoid degradation. Thus, no degradation of copolymers occurred and ¹³C NMR study showed that l-lactide was incorporated in graft chains as isotactic poly(l-lactide) without racemisation for 140–160°C, up to 25h, L-LA/PVA ratio in the range 3–12. Such synthesis using non-toxic catalyst and reactants in a solvent-free medium can be described as environment-friendly. Amphiphilic behavior of copolymers was studied in aqueous solution according to their chemical structures: critical micelle concentration CMC (0.03–0.5gL⁻¹), average diameter of micelles (80–150nm), surface tension γCMC (46–63mNm⁻¹), hydrophilic to lipophilic balance HLB (Griffin definition 4–7), and also from cast films: surface energy γₛ (36–50mJm⁻²). This environment-friendly process is suitable for the use of graft PVA copolymers in biomedical area for investigations under micelle applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaqueous solutions 3acatalysts 3achemical structure 3acomposite polymers 3aenergy 3aheat stability 3ahydrophilicity 3amelting 3amicelles 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apolyvinyl alcohol 3asurface tension 3atemperature1 aCouturaud, Benoit1 aMas, André1 aSchué, François1 aRobin, Jean-Jacques0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2013 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.1621-1633dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.02.0103Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02895naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245012000210300001600330506007600346520116400422592002801586506003701614650001501651650001001666650001101676650003801687650000901725650001001734650001301744650003001757650001401787650001201801650001201813650003401825650002001859650001101879650002001890650002001910650001101930650001501941650002001956650001301976650001401989650002002003700002302023700001802046700001402064700002302078700002002101773009402121856008102215852000902296655001202305IND50067863720221207065230.0150207e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006786372DNAL7 a231803642pmid7 aPMC36062832pmcid7 a10.1007/s11248-012-9674-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCornetta, Kenneth10aTransgenic sheep generated by lentiviral vectors: safety and integration analysis of surrogates and their offspring  ap. 737-745.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe safety of HIV-1 based vectors was evaluated during the production of transgenic sheep. Vectors were introduced into the perivitelline space of in vivo derived one-cell sheep embryos by microinjection then transferred into the oviducts of recipient females. At 60–70 days of gestation, a portion of the recipients were euthanized and tissues collected from both surrogates and fetuses. Other ewes were allowed to carry lambs to term. Inadvertent transfer of vector from offspring to surrogates was evaluated in 330 blood and tissue samples collected from 57 ewes that served as embryo recipients. Excluding uterine contents, none of the samples tested positive for vector, indicating that that the vector did not cross the fetal maternal interface and infect surrogate ewes. Evaluating ewes, fetuses and lambs for replication competent lentivirus (RCL); 84 serum samples analyzed for HIV-1 capsid by ELISA and over 600 blood and tissue samples analyzed by quantitative PCR for the VSV-G envelopes revealed no evidence of RCL. Results of these experiments provide further evidence as to the safety of HIV-1 based vectors in animal and human applications.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLentivirus 3ablood 3acapsid 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3aewes 3alambs 3aoviducts 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apregnancy 3aprogeny 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Genetically Modified 2aEmbryo Transfer 2aFemale 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHIV-1xgenetics 2aHumans 2aLentivirus 2aMicroinjections 2aOviducts 2aPregnancy 2aSheepxgenetics1 aTessanne, Kimberly1 aLong, Charles1 aYao, Jing1 aSatterfield, Carey1 aWesthusin, Mark0 tTransgenic research.g2013 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.737-745dSpringer-Verlagx0962-88197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11248-012-9674-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01908naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001700153245011100170300001800281520076700299592002801066650001501094650002301109650001301132650002301145650001601168650002201184650001601206700001701222700002001239700002101259700001801280700001901298773009801317856008701415990002301502852000901525655001201534IND60098029620221120222050.0141104e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009802962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.02.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Zhifang10aLow bandgap polymers with benzodithiophene and bisthienylacrylonitrile units for photovoltaic applications  ap. 1634-1641.  aNovel copolymers (P1 and P2) comprising (E)-2,3-bis(2-thienyl)acrylonitrile and benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]dithiophene derivatives are designed and synthesized to be applied as an electron donor material in polymer solar cells blended with PC₆₁BM as an electron acceptor.

The BC was synthesized by the thermal pyrolysis of used cattle bones. In preliminary stage, BC was synthesized at different temperatures ranging from 350 to 700 °C and due to the higher surface area and adsorption capacity, BC synthesized at 350 °C was selected for further experiments. The XRD pattern of BC found better in agreement with the standard pattern of hydroxyapatite. FTIR analysis also signified basic spectra of hydroxyapatite with specific bands at wavelength of 3429, 1639, 1453, 1037, 604 and 566 cm−1. Typical agglomerated structure of hydroxyapatite was witnessed in morphological examination with SEM. The specific surface area, total pore volume and the average pore diameter were found 79.34 m2 g−1, 0.041 cm3 g−1 and 2.09 nm, respectively. The elemental chemical analysis revealed 1.71 Ca/P ratio. About 10.56 mg of fluoride was adsorbed on 1 g of BC. The adsorption isotherm data was briefly illustrated by applying Langmuir isotherm model and Freundlich isotherm model. In conclusion, BC is successfully synthesized and the highest fluoride adsorption capacity was achieved as compared with earlier studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3aadsorption 3abones 3acalcium 3acattle 3achemical analysis 3afluorides 3agroundwater 3ahydroxyapatite 3amodels 3apyrolysis 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3asustainable development 3atemperature 3awater pollution 3awavelengths 0aAdsorption 0aFluoride 0aBone char 0aHydroxyapatite 0aGroundwater1 aKim, Jun Young1 aChoi, Young-Gyun0 tGroundwater for sustainable development.g2019 Apr., v. 8 p.324-331dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23351x2352-801X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gsd.2018.12.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01820naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245017400161300001800335520047400353592002800827650002600855650001300881650001600894650001500910650001900925650001900944650002800963650001900991650001301010650001901023700002401042700002201066700002601088700002101114700002601135700002301161773014301184856007401327852000901401655001201410IND60642457020221122115836.0190507e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064245702DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb01966h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeltrán, Alicia12aA photobleaching resistant polymer supported hexanuclear molybdenum iodide cluster for photocatalytic oxygenations and photodynamic inactivation of Staphylococcus aureus  ap. 5975-5979.  aThe ability of a hexanuclear molybdenum cluster, [Mo₆I₈(CH₃COO)₆]²⁻, to carry out, upon irradiation, singlet oxygen mediated photocatalytic oxygenation reactions has been tested.

A contrast in gene expression was observed with 18.9 % of upregulated genes in Vrindavani downregulated in Tharparkar and 17.8% upregulated genes in Tharparkar downregulated in Vrindavani. Functional annotation of genes differentially expressed in Tharparkar and Vrindavani revealed that the systems biology in Tharparkar is moving towards counteracting the effects due to heat stress. Unlike Vrindavani, Tharparkar is not only endowed with higher expression of the scavengers (UBE2G1, UBE2S, and UBE2H) of misfolded proteins but also with protectors (VCP, Serp1, and CALR) of naïve unfolded proteins. Further, higher expression of the antioxidants in Tharparkar enables it to cope up with higher levels of free radicals generated as a result of heat stress. In this study, we found relevant genes dysregulated in Tharparkar in the direction that can counter heat stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3acattle 3agene expression 3agenes 3aheat stress 3atranscriptome 0aNUDT2 0aBIM 0aMSP58 0aSMAD7 0aXIP 0aHSPA4 0aGPX3 0aUBE2G1 0aVCP 0aMBTPS1 0aGRB2 0aFASLG 0aPAX5 0aHMGA1 0aBHLHE40 0aHSPB8 0aUBE2S 0aRNF40 0aCREB3L1 0aRAP2A 0aMTA3 0aMAF 0aHSPA1A 0aTICAM2 0aCAT 0aUBE2H 0aUBE2L3 0aSERP1 0aJAK1 0aMYC 0aMAX 0aHMGB1 0aTCF7 0aHSPA8 0aTLR4 0aCYCS 0aUBA52 0aEIF2S3 0aJAK3 0aCASP3 0aPROX1 0aNCOR1 0aIKZF1 0aHSP90AB1 0aAPC 0aCCS 0aUBA1 0aMAP2K1 0aHSP90AA1 0aPRDX5 0aCALR 0aMAPK1 0aMAPK8 0aPRDX6 0aOSM 0aMLKL 0aPRDX1 0aGSK3A 0aRAP1B 0aSOD1 0aVIM 0aCYBB 0aSTAT1 0aHMGB2 0aSTAT5B 0aTYK2 0aRRAS 0aPBMCs 0aRIA 0aTHI 0aCxcr4 0aPTEN 0aEIF2 0aBMP 0aFMLP 0aTharparkar 0aVrindavani1 aSahu, Amit Ranjan1 aMalla, Waseem Akram1 aPraharaj, Manas Ranjan1 aHosamani, Neelima1 aKumar, Shakti1 aGupta, Smita1 aSharma, Shweta1 aSaxena, Archana1 aVarshney, Anshul1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0704-72341 aSingh, Pragya1 aVerma, Vinay1 aPuneet Kumar,1 aGyanendra Singh,1 aPandey, Aruna1 aSaxena, Shikha1 aGandham, Ravi Kumar1 aTiwari, A.

The mechanical energy provided to the powder produces a partial melting and subsequent welding of the powder particles. A Nₕᵢₜₛ threshold value is necessary to generate mechanical cohesion in the powder-compacted billets owing to the recrystallized interfacial material which provides wetting and welding of the powder particles. Mechanical strength increases with increasing Nₕᵢₜₛ owing to the increasing fraction of recrystallized material. However, stiffness decreases in parallel due to the lower crystallinity of the recrystallized material compared to the original nascent powder. The Mw dependence of the mechanical properties of the various compacted powders is attributed to the interface strength of the welded particles in relation to the kinetics of interfacial chain diffusion. The mechanism of particle welding is then discussed in terms of chain diffusion with regard to the time scale of the process. Wool’s welding criterion based on the reptation of chains over their own radius of gyration through the interface only applies for Mw<10⁶g/mol. It turned out that above this Mw value efficient welding is readily obtained after chain diffusion over a distance close to the stacking long period thanks to the occurrence of co-crystallization.  aPublisher supplied data 3acohesion 3acrystal structure 3aenergy 3amechanical properties 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3apowders1 aLame, O.1 aVigier, G.1 aDore, F.1 aSeguela, R.0 tEuropean polymer journal.g2013 June, v. 49, no. 6 p.1654-1661dElsevier Ltdx0014-30577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2013.02.0283Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012200163300001100285520163000296592002801926596005901954596006202013596005902075596005902134596008202193650001902275650002302294650001802317650001102335650001502346650001802361650001402379650001702393650002602410650001602436650001202452650002702464700005902491700001702550700001502567700001502582700001502597700001802612700001702630700002002647773012602667856008202793852000902875655001202884IND60593585020221119032300.0191003e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059358502DNAL7 a10.1007/s13593-018-0496-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Zichuan10aSilicon enhancement of estimated plant biomass carbon accumulation under abiotic and biotic stresses. A meta-analysis  ap. 26.  aAbiotic and biotic stresses are the major factors limiting plant growth worldwide. Plants exposed to abiotic and biotic stresses often cause reduction in plant biomass as well as crop yield, resulting in plant biomass carbon loss. As a beneficial and quasi-essential element, silicon accumulation in rhizosphere and plants can alleviate the unfavorable effects of the major forms of abiotic and biotic stress through several resistance mechanisms and thus increases plant biomass accumulation and crop yield. The beneficial effects of silicon on plant growth and crop yield have been widely reviewed over the last years. However, carbon accumulation of silicon-associated plant biomass under abiotic and biotic stresses has not yet been systematically addressed. This review article focuses on both the main mechanisms of silicon-mediated alleviation of abiotic and biotic stresses and their effects on plant biomass carbon accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems. The major points are the following: (1) the recovery of plant biomass via silicon mediation usually exhibits a bell-shaped response curve to abiotic stress severity and an S-shaped response curve to biotic stress severity; (2) although carbon concentration of plant biomass decreases with silicon accumulation, more than 96% of the recovered plant biomass contributes to plant biomass carbon accumulation; (3) silicon-mediated recovery generally increases plant biomass carbon by 35% and crop yield by 24%. In conclusion, silicon can improve plant growth and enhance plant biomass carbon accumulation under abiotic and biotic stresses in terrestrial ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data  a41522207cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41571130042cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31572191cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31772387cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFA0601002cState's Key Project of Research and Development Plan of China 3aabiotic stress 3abiomass production 3abiotic stress 3acarbon 3acrop yield 3ameta-analysis 3aphytomass 3aplant growth 3aresistance mechanisms 3arhizosphere 3asilicon 3aterrestrial ecosystems1 aSong, Zhaoliang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2219-58521 aYan, Zhifeng1 aQian, Hao,1 aSong, Alin1 aLiu, Linan1 aYang, Xiaomin1 aXia, Shaopan1 aLiang, Yongchao0 tAgronomy for sustainable development.g2018 June, v. 38, no. 3 p.26-26dSpringer PariswJournal:jnl33129x1774-07467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-018-0496-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02684naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002100154245009300175300001600268520142300284592002801707650002101735650001901756650002401775650003201799650001301831650001801844650001901862650002401881650001701905650001001922700002201932700001701954700001801971700002101989700001602010700002002026773009602046856008802142990002302230852000902253655001202262IND60098613020221123021549.0141104e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009861302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemogne, Cédric10aPersonality and hormone therapy use among postmenopausal women in the GAZEL cohort study  ap. 929-936.  aOBJECTIVE: To examine with a prospective design the association of personality with hormone therapy (HT) use before and after the publication of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) trial. DESIGN: Questionnaires were mailed to measure type A personality and hostility. Additional data from up to six mailed questionnaires every 3 years were used to determine the subsequent date of menopause and the use of HT. The association between personality and HT use was measured by the relative index of inequality computed through binary logistic regression. SETTING: The French GAZEL Cohort Study. PATIENT(S): Women (n = 1,803) who reached natural menopause during the study. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Hormone therapy use within 1 year after the date of menopause. RESULT(S): Hormone therapy use (916 users vs. 887 nonusers) was associated with type A personality (relative index of inequality = 1.88, 95% confidence interval = 1.35–2.63). This association remained significant after adjustment for all potential confounders (relative index of inequality = 1.84, 95% confidence interval = 1.23–2.74). There was no significant interaction between type A personality and the date of menopause as regards the WHI publication. CONCLUSION(S): Type A personality may be associated with HT use among postmenopausal women, regardless of other predictors, including vascular and breast cancer risk factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast neoplasms 3acohort studies 3aconfidence interval 3ahormone replacement therapy 3apatients 3apostmenopause 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3awomen1 aConsoli, Silla M.1 aPanjo, Henri1 aNabi, Hermann1 aGoldberg, Marcel1 aZins, Marie1 aRinga, Virginie0 tFertility and sterility.g2012 Oct., v. 98, no. 4 p.929-936dElsevier Inc.x0015-02827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.06.0203Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03277naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011700161300001800278500002000296520160200316592002801918596004101946596004101987596003902028596002502067650002402092650001402116650001202130650001302142650002102155650001502176650002902191650001202220650001802232650002102250650003302271650002502304650001202329700001902341700002502360700001802385700002102403700002302424700002102447700002102468700002002489700002702509773011602536856007402652852000902726655001202735IND60614900420221122113604.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061490042DNAL7 a10.1111/ecog.036412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRead, Quentin D.10aAmong‐species overlap in rodent body size distributions predicts species richness along a temperature gradient  ap. 1718-1727.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aTemperature is widely regarded as a major driver of species richness, but the mechanisms are debated. Niche theory suggests temperature may affect richness by filtering traits and species in colder habitats while promoting specialization in warmer ones. However, tests of this theory are rare because niche dimensions are challenging to quantify along broad thermal gradients. Here, we use individual‐level trait data from a long‐term monitoring network spanning a large geographic extent to test niche‐based theory of community assembly in small mammals. We examined variation in body size among 23 communities of North American rodents sampled across the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), ranging from northern hardwood forests to subtropical deserts. We quantified body size similarity among species using a metric of overlap that accounts for individual variation, and fit a structural equation model to disentangle the relationships between temperature, productivity, body size overlap, and species richness. We document a latitudinal gradient of declining similarity in body size among species towards the tropics and overall increase in the dimensions of community‐wide trait space in warmer habitats. Neither environmental temperature nor net primary productivity directly affect rodent species richness. Instead, temperature determines the community‐wide niche space that species can occupy, which in turn alters richness. We suggest a latitudinal gradient of trait space expansion towards the tropics may be widespread and underlie gradients in species diversity.  aPublisher supplied data  a1550765cNational Science Foundation  a1550745cNational Science Foundation  a1356/15cIsrael Science Foundation  cMichigan State Univ. 3aambient temperature 3abody size 3adeserts 3ahabitats 3ahardwood forests 3amonitoring 3anet primary productivity 3arodents 3asmall mammals 3aspecies richness 3astructural equation modeling 3atemperature profiles 3atropics1 aGrady, John M.1 aZarnetske, Phoebe L.1 aRecord, Sydne1 aBaiser, Benjamin1 aBelmaker, Jonathan1 aTuanmu, Mao-Ning1 aStrecker, Angela1 aBeaudrot, Lydia1 aThibault, Katherine M.0 tEcography.g2018 Oct., v. 41, no. 10 p.1718-1727dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3867072x0906-75907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.036413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02740naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245012500161300001800286520101700304592002801321596009801349596007401447596007301521596007501594596007101669650001501740650002101755650001301776650001101789650002201800650002201822650001301844650001101857700001601868700001501884700001601899700001501915700001601930700001601946700001201962700001501974700005601989773012102045856008302166852000902249655001202258IND60767008420221116163121.0220213e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076700842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-022-06925-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qi10aEnhanced sulfur redox kinetics by hollow structured NiCo2O4 entangled with acidified MWCNTs for lithium sulfur batteries  ap. 4704-4715.  aAlthough lithium–sulfur battery is considered to be a competitive system for efficient energy storage, the shuttle effect of polysulfides and sluggish electrode reaction kinetics still hinder its practical application. Herein, we synthesized acidified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (AMWCNT)/NiCo₂O₄@S as an efficient cathode material for lithium–sulfur batteries. The AMWCNT skeleton can be used as an electron conductivity enhancer and physico-chemical adsorption sites for polysulfides, and the hollow structured NiCo₂O₄ spheres can not only accommodate the volume change during cycling, but also accelerate the redox kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect. Thus, the AMWCNT/NiCo₂O₄@S cathode delivers an initial capacity of 958.8 mAh·g⁻¹ at 0.5 C, and the capacity remains 700.3 mAh·g⁻¹ with a low capacity decay rate of 0.090% per cycle after 300 cycles. The unique structure design provides a potential host material for the high-capacity and -stability lithium–sulfur batteries.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018000021223ZK21cthe talents project of Beijing Municipal Committee Organization Department  a2021JCCXJD01cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2021YJSJD01cFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities  a2021-HZ-808cKey R & D and transformation projects in Qinghai Province  a21314401DcKey R & D and transformation projects in Hebei Province 3aadsorption 3acarbon nanotubes 3acathodes 3aenergy 3alithium batteries 3areaction kinetics 3askeleton 3asulfur1 aDeng, Yirui1 aMa, Jingru1 aJin, Xiaohe1 aLi, Minjie1 aWu, Mengwei1 aWang, Qiang1 aGe, Ben1 aZhang, Lei1 aLiu, Ruiping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2277-785X0 tJournal of materials science.g2022 Feb., v. 57, no. 7 p.4704-4715dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-022-06925-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02890naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245011500161500002000276520143200296592002801728596006301756596005901819650004401878650002201922650002501944650001601969650002001985650002702005650003402032650003302066650001102099650002102110650002102131650001802152700001302170700001602183700001502199700001202214700001802226773011302244856007802357852000902435655001202444IND60627723720190311000000.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062772372DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2018001142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jia‐Li10aComparison of Mechanical Reinforcement Effects of Cellulose Nanofibers and Montmorillonite in Starch Composite  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBoth cellulose nanofibers (CNF) and montmorillonites (MMT) are nanoscale reinforcement fillers that have shown reinforcing effects in polymer nanocomposites. CNFs belong to one‐dimensional nanofibers while MMT is part of two‐dimensional clay platelets, which show difference in shape, size, and composition. This study systematically compares their morphology and dispersion properties in a corn starch (CS) matrix, interactions with the matrix, and the resulting reinforcing effects on the CS matrix. Transparent CS/CNF and CS/MMT nanocomposites comprising up to 7 wt% nanofillers are obtained via solution casting. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X‐ray diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), and tensile testing, thermogravimetry analysis (TGA), moisture uptake (Mu), and light transmittance (Tr) are used to examine the above‐mentioned properties of CS composites. It is found that the tensile properties, optical transparency, and water barrier properties of CS films are significantly improved whether adding a certain amount of CNF or MMT. However, the tensile strength increment of CS composites reinforced with CNF is slightly higher than that of MMT‐reinforced CS composites due to higher aspect ratio of CNF. From the results, it can be concluded that CNF is highly compatible with starch and can reinforce the starch phase efficiently to prepare green nanocomposite films.  aPublisher supplied data  a20170099cSichuan University Experiment Technique Projects  a51603134cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray diffraction 3acellulose nanofibers 3acorn starch 3amontmorillonite 3apolymer nanocomposites 3ascanning electron microscopes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3astarch 3atensile strength 3athermogravimetry 3atransmittance1 aZhou, Mi1 aCheng, Geng1 aCheng, Fei1 aLin, Yi1 aZhu, Pu‐Xin0 tStärke =.g2019 Jan., v. 71, no. 1-2 p.e1800114-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2018001143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02311naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245012100161300001800282520121900300592002801519650001901547650002001566650001801586650001801604650001801622650001901640650001701659700002701676700002101703700002301724700001901747773011101766856007501877852000901952655001201961IND60529107420221119004933.0160717e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910742DNAL7 a10.1021/ac301424b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSant, Himanshu J.10aCharacterization of Polymerized Liposomes Using a Combination of dc and Cyclical Electrical Field-Flow Fractionation  ap. 8323-8329.  aCharacterization of polymerized liposomes (PolyPIPosomes) was carried out using a combination of normal dc electrical field-flow fractionation and cyclical electrical field-flow fractionation (CyElFFF) as an analytical technique. The constant nature of the carrier fluid and channel configuration for this technique eliminates many variables associated with multidimensional analysis. CyElFFF uses an oscillating field to induce separation and is performed in the same channel as standard dc electrical field-flow fractionation separation. Theory and experimental methods to characterize nanoparticles in terms of their sizes and electrophoretic mobilities are discussed in this paper. Polystyrene nanoparticles are used for system calibration and characterization of the separation performance, whereas polymerized liposomes are used to demonstrate the applicability of the system to biomedical samples. This paper is also the first to report separation and a higher effective field when CyElFFF is operated at very low applied voltages. The technique is shown to have the ability to quantify both particle size and electrophoretic mobility distributions for colloidal polystyrene nanoparticles and PolyPIPosomes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric power 3aelectrophoresis 3afractionation 3ananoparticles 3aparticle size 3apolymerization 3apolystyrenes1 aChakravarty, Siddharth1 aMerugu, Srinivas1 aFerguson, Colin G.1 aGale, Bruce K.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 84, no. 19 p.8323-8329dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac301424b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02516naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159300001800270500001500288520125900303592002801562650003701590650001201627650001501639650001501654650001201669650002101681650001101702650001401713650002301727650001101750650001101761650002201772650001101794650001501805653001701820700002601837700002401863773011101887856007501998852000902073655001202082IND60529107520221119004431.0160717e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910752DNAL7 a10.1021/ac30142522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalker, E.

By monitoring the π–π* aromatic carbon transition for reduced GO (270 nm) and GO (230 nm), we observe the growth of GO in KCl upon applying oxidizing potentials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) are used to confirm sample composition and location of salt ions within the electrode. Formation of EGO stable enough to be observed by UV–vis is found to be unique to alkali chloride supporting electrolytes due to formation of a solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) which incorporates the alkali cation to stabilize the negatively charged oxygen functional groups while the presence of chloride anion acts as a passivation agent that protects the electrode surface from dissolution. The spectroelectrochemical approach highlights the detection and study of EGO that cannot be detected by electrochemical measurements. Specifically, the amount of EGO observed by UV–vis scales with increasing cation size (Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺) despite all the cations showing identical electrochemical response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3alithium 3amonitoring 3aelectrodes 3acations 3aelectrochemistry 3acarbon 3apotassium 3apotassium chloride 3aoxygen 3asodium 3amass spectrometry 3aoxides 3ainterphase 0aelectrolytes1 aVanden Bout, David A.1 aStevenson, Keith J.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 84, no. 19 p.8190-8197dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac30142523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03418naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245011600166520208000282592002802362650001602390650001202406650001602418650001902434650001102453650001402464650002402478650002302502650001802525650001102543651001002554653001002564653002402574653002502598653002802623653001002651700005502661700001402716700001302730700001302743773011902756856008802875852000902963655001202972IND60700935420221121084532.0220809e20201110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070093542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yong10aSpecific differences and responses to reductions for premature mortality attributable to ambient PM2.5 in China  aAlthough recent assessments have quantified the impact of ambient PM₂.₅ on public health in China, air quality managers would benefit from assessing specific differences in premature mortality and its responses to air quality improvement. Using PM₂.₅ data simulated by an observation-fused air quality model and an integrated exposure-response model for the full range of PM₂.₅, we determined the premature mortality attributable to ambient PM₂.₅ across mainland China in 2016. Overall, the total number of PM₂.₅-related deaths nationwide was 1.31 million, of which lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke represented 0.13, 0.13, 0.42, and 0.62 million, respectively. Per capita PM₂.₅-related mortality in China was 95 per 100,000 person-years, and that of elderly people aged ≥75 years (1166 deaths per 100,000) was much higher than that of young people aged 25–44 years (11 deaths per 100,000). Additionally, there were significant spatial differences in premature deaths, which mainly occurred in regions with high PM₂.₅ levels or/and population density. Halving deaths across mainland China required an average of 63% reduction of PM₂.₅ nationwide and a decrease by 73% in high concentration regions exceeding 70 μg/m³ and 19% in low concentration locales below 10 μg/m³. Moreover, reducing PM₂.₅ to the WHO interim target I (IT-1) of 35 μg/m³ would only result in a 12.6% reduction in premature mortality, while a more exacting standard (reducing PM₂.₅ to 10 μg/m³) would avoid 73.0% of mortality. In particular, there is a large potential for reducing the high PM₂.₅-related mortality in heavily polluted locales. In conclusion, to further reduce premature mortality across mainland China, targets stricter than the IT-1 and tight policies to improve air quality and protect public health are necessary, especially for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and patients with cardio-cerebrovascular diseases, particularly in areas with high premature mortality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aelderly 3aenvironment 3alung neoplasms 3amodels 3amortality 3amyocardial ischemia 3apopulation density 3apublic health 3astroke 3aChina 0aPM2.5 0aPremature mortality 0aSpecific differences 0aResponses to reductions 0aChina1 aZhao, Xiuge1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1272-53861 aLiao, Qin1 aTao, Yan1 aBai, Yun0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 10, v. 742 p.140643-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02743naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002500155245014500180300001600325520127800341592002801619650001301647650001301660650001201673650001701685650001001702650001501712650001301727650001801740650001301758650001901771650001201790650001801802650001701820650001401837650002301851650001001874650001101884650001701895650002901912650001101941653001701952653002001969653002901989653001202018773010802030856009002138852000902228655001202237IND60534585420221118141022.0190405e201510  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053458542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKaminarides, Stelios12aA modified form of Myzithra cheese produced by substituting the fresh cheese whey by dried whey protein concentrate and ovine milk and cream  ap. 118-122.  aA modified form of Myzithra cheese (M) was produced by substituting the fresh cheese whey by dried whey protein concentrate 65% (WPC 65%). The proportion of the materials used in the production of the modified Myzithra cheese blend was: 16.1% WPC, 49.9% water, 8.0% ovine milk and 26.0% ovine cream. The mixture was placed in polyethylene package before being subjected to heat treatment at 90°C for 30min. A control Myzithra cheese (C) was also produced in the traditional way. Both cheeses were submitted to microbiological, physicochemical and rheological analyses as well as organoleptic tests 1 day after production and following 25 days in cold storage. The modified Myzithra cheese (M) had a higher lactose, potassium and sodium content and lower total bacteria, protein, ash, calcium, hardness and adhesiveness than C-Myzithra cheese, while yeasts and moulds were absent. Also, M-Myzithra cheese remained unchanged organoleptically and texturally during cold storage, whereas C-Myzithra cheese deteriorated. Sensory evaluation revealed that M-Myzithra cheese was of good quality and can cover the annual consumption demand for Myzithra cheese, thus helping to resolve the problem of seasonal production of C-Myzithra cheese while simultaneously exploiting the WPC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3abacteria 3acalcium 3acold storage 3acream 3adried whey 3aewe milk 3afresh cheeses 3ahardness 3aheat treatment 3alactose 3amolds (fungi) 3apolyethylene 3apotassium 3asensory evaluation 3asheep 3asodium 3awhey cheeses 3awhey protein concentrate 3ayeasts 0aWhey cheeses 0aMyzithra cheese 0aWhey protein concentrate 0aTexture0 tSmall ruminant research.g2015 Oct., v. 131 p.118-122dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03219naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001900155245007400174300001600248506002800264520193000292592002802222506003702250650001102287650001402298650001202312650001402324650002302338650001102361650001302372650001702385650001002402653001402412653001302426653002902439653001502468653001002483700001902493773018602512856009002698852000902788655001202797IND60739717820221207114400.0200116e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073971782DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2019-1-113-1172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFesenko, A. N.10aBuckwheat breeding and production in Russia during the past 100 years  ap. 113-117.  aResource is Open Access  aAverage buckwheat yield in Russia has increased from 0.49 to 0.94 t/ha (1.9 times) in the period from the 1960s to 2011-2017, which is comparable to the growth of wheat yields for the same period (2.1 times, from 1.18 to 2.42 t/ha). However, if the growth in wheat yields occurred gradually, the entire growth of buckwheat yield falls on the beginning of the 21st century. Such differences in dynamics indicate that the increase in buckwheat yield is not related to the improvements in agricultural technology or climate changes. Nor it is related to any significant changes in the structure of buckwheat sowing regions, as the average yield in the most important region of buckwheat cultivation, Altai Territory, is only 0.91 t/ha (i. e. less than the country’s average). Chronologically, the period of an abrupt increase in the yield of buckwheat in Russia coincides with widespread introduction of cultivars with determinate growth habit (determinants). Since 1999, the share of determinant varieties in the total area under buckwheat in Russia has increased from 8.2 to 56.7%. Apparently, it was a main cause for the significant growth of buckwheat yield in Russia. Determinant cultivars based on the d (det) mutation are characterized by reduced plant height, reduced number of flowers on shoots, and more intensive and fast blossoming of inflorescences (and, consequently, more intensive and fast maturation). The increased morphological potential of productivity (the number of vegetative nodes on the stem and first – order branches) ensures a higher level of yield for these cultivars. At present, our lab is developing determinant buckwheat cultivars using some additional mutations. A major success in this work has been the world’s first determinant cultivar with green flowers (the gc mutation) named ‘Design’, which develops thicker and stronger fruit stalks with higher resistance to seed shattering.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRussia 3abuckwheat 3aclimate 3acultivars 3adeterminate growth 3afruits 3amutation 3aplant height 3awheat 0abuckwheat 0abreeding 0adeterminate growth habit 0aproduction 0ayield1 aFesenko, I.

As part of a search for new sources of resistance, a group of radiation-induced rust-resistant wheat Agropyron intermedium [(Host) P.B.] derivatives originally developed by A. Wienhues were investigated. Resistance to leaf rust [Puccinia recondita Roberge ex Desmaz. f. sp. tritici (Eriks. & E. Henn) D.M. Henderson] was transferred to the spring wheat cultivar Thatcher. The inheritance of leaf-rust resistance was studied in F₃ lines developed from the fifth backcross to Thatcher. A number of backcross lines with different types of resistance were selected and evaluated for rust reaction in greenhouse and field tests. RL6097 had gene Lr38 present in wheat A. intermedium T6DS-6DL-7Ai#2L chromosome translocation (where a 4.19-μm segment of the long arm of A. intermedium chromosome 7Ai#2 replaced a 1.45-μm segment of the long arm of wheat chromosome 6D) derived from translocation line T7 as identified by C-banding. The male transmission rate of this translocation was reduced. Although this line was highly resistant to leaf rust, its grain yield was low. None of the other backcross lines had A. intermedium chromatin. RL6093 had an unidentified gene for leaf rust resistance from addition line T2. Two genes, Lr3bg (RL6094) and Lr16 (RL6096), were obtained from T6. Adult-plant resistance to leaf rust was also transferred from several of the translocation lines. This resistance may be different from that previously reported, and may have originated from the translocation lines' donor parent ‘Heine FV’. Of the genes found, Lr38 may not be useful in wheat breeding because of the reduced yield of RL6097; however, the gene for seedling resistance in RL6093 and the adult-plant resistance in RL6095 should be useful.

However, cracking characteristics of GBR during exposure to different drying stages, unclear especially the critical conditions for cracking. In this study, experiments and numerical simulations were performed in an attempt to predict the cracking behavior of GBR under different drying stages through intragranular drying kinetics. Our results showed that the variations in cracking probability could be divided into three different stages. This phenomenon was dominated by the close relationship between particle strength and moisture gradient. The cumulative effect of moisture gradient is one of the important leading to crack initiation and evolution. Moreover, a prediction model of cracking probability as a function of drying time was proposed. Finally, the critical water evaporation coefficient was introduced to quantify the cracking safe region of GBR.  aPublisher supplied data 3abrown rice 3aevaporation 3aprediction 3aprobability 3atechnology 0aGerminated brown rice particles 0aIntragranular drying kinetics 0aCracking safe region 0aCritical water evaporation coefficient 0aCracking mechanism1 aHe, Yurong1 aTang, Tianqi1 aZhai, Ming0 tPowder technology.g2022 July, v. 406 p.117587-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.1175873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245011700200300001600317506007600333520011900409592002800528506003700556650001600593650002500609650000900634700001200643700001400655700001900669700001500688700001800703700001700721773011200738856007700850852000900927655001200936IND60171938620221207095243.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017193862DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.112.2058642doi7 aPMC36412272pmcid7 a235036912pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jinjie13aAn Autoregulatory Loop Controlling Arabidopsis HsfA2 Expression: Role of Heat Shock-Induced Alternative Splicing  ap. 512-521.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA new heat stress-induced splice variant is involved in the self-regulation of HsfA2 transcription in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis 3aalternative splicing 3aheat1 aSun, Na1 aLiu, Meng1 aLiu, Jiancheng1 aDu, Bojing1 aWang, Xinjing1 aQi, Xiaoting0 tPlant physiology.g2013 May, v. 162, no. 1 p.512-521dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.2058643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100006100144245015800205500002000363520101000383592002801393596009601421650001301517650001601530650003801546650001801584650001401602650001301616650001901629650001901648650001301667650001901680650003101699650002101730650001201751650001601763700002201779700002601801773011301827856007801940852000902018655001202027IND60627724220190311000000.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062772422DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2018000652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSrikaeo, Khongsak1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4621-169010aEffects of Heating Temperatures and Acid Concentrations on Physicochemical Properties and Starch Digestibility of Citric Acid Esterified Tapioca Starches  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhysicochemical properties and starch digestibility of modified tapioca starch using various citric acid concentrations (10, 30, and 50 g/100 g dry starch) and heating temperatures (100, 120, and 140 °C for 5 h) are investigated. It is found that the degree of esterification increases with increasing dose of citric acid and heating temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry shows that citrate starch samples exposed to high acid dose (30 g/100 g citric acid) and temperature (120 °C) are resistant to gelatinization. In addition, transitional enthalpy also decreases with increasing concentration and temperature. The microstructure of esterified starch is observed to have agglomerated granules, with corrosions/fissures and small overlapping layers on the surfaces, which are observed in all modified samples. Citric acid esterification of tapioca starch provided advantages in terms of the increase resistant starch content and slow digestion rate when compared to native starch.  aPublisher supplied data  aFDA‐CO‐2559‐2939‐THcNational Science and Technology Development Agency of Thailand 3acitrates 3acitric acid 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aenthalpy 3aesterification 3agelatinization 3agranules 3amicrostructure 3aphysicochemical properties 3aresistant starch 3atapioca 3atemperature1 aHao, Phạm Thị1 aLerdluksamee, Chutima0 tStärke =.g2019 Jan., v. 71, no. 1-2 p.e1800065-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl50456x0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.2018000653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02133naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002300146245010500169300001800274520111100292592002801403650001301431650002301444650001701467650003101484650002201515650002501537700001901562700002101581773012601602856008201728852000901810655001201819IND60567508420221120111624.0170422e20160211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056750842DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.5b115562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHahn, Konstanze R.10aStructural, Vibrational, and Thermal Properties of Nanocrystalline Graphene in Atomistic Simulations  ap. 3026-3035.  aTwo different methods have been applied to create differently structured nanocrystalline graphene samples used in molecular dynamics simulations. In the first method, graphene sheets are generated by grain growth from individual nucleation seeds. The second method applies Voronoi tessellation to define single crystalline domains in the simulation cells. The differently generated nanocrystalline graphene sheets show significant variations in the grain size distribution and the shape of the crystalline domains. Furthermore, out-of-plane corrugation is found to be more pronounced in samples generated by the Voronoi method, in particular for small grain sizes (≤14 nm). Marginal differences are observed in the distribution of polygonal rings in the grain boundaries which might result from the geometrical shape of the grain boundaries. Thermal conductivity has been determined using the approach-to-equilibrium molecular dynamics formalism. A lower thermal conductivity is observed in Voronoi samples for grain sizes between 5 and 14 nm which is attributed to the stronger out-of-plane corrugation.  aPublisher supplied data 3agraphene 3amolecular dynamics 3ananocrystals 3aparticle size distribution 3asimulation models 3athermal conductivity1 aMelis, Claudio1 aColombo, Luciano0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 120, no. 5 p.3026-3035dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b115563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03728naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245015300171300001400324520227200338592002802610650001102638650001102649650001302660650001102673650001402684650002402698650002402722650001702746650001302763650000902776650001402785650002502799650001002824650001902834650000902853650001402862653002402876653001702900653001402917653002702931653002402958653002702982700001903009773010703028856009003135852000903225655001203234IND60534585720221118140947.0190405e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053458572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHatcher, S.10aGenetic parameters for breech cover, wrinkle and wool coverage scores and their implications for Merino sheep breeding programs and flock management  ap. 36-46.  aThere is an increased impetus within the Australian sheep industry to pursue a genetic solution to increase the bare area around the breech and reduce the degree of breech wrinkles in order to reduce the incidence of flystrike and the need for surgical mulesing. Breeding programs seeking either a genetic increase in bare skin area around the breech or a decrease in wrinkling require accurate estimates of genetic parameters for breech cover, wrinkle and wool coverage traits as well as the phenotypic and genetic correlations between these traits. Genetic parameters for breech cover, breech wrinkle, body wrinkle, neck wrinkle and wool coverage were estimated from a Merino genetic resource flock at various ages from marking (breech cover and breech wrinkle), to yearling and adult (all traits). The breech cover and wool coverage traits were lowly heritable (h2<0.16), while the various wrinkle traits were moderately heritable (h2 range 0.26–0.34). While all traits will respond to selection, genetic improvement of breech cover and wool coverage are likely to be slower and potentially more difficult due to their low heritability estimates. The various breech cover and wrinkle traits are moderately correlated, phenotypically and genetically, both across age assessments (marking, yearling and adult) and with each other. The phenotypic and genetic correlations were medium to high, particularly between the yearling and adult expressions of these traits. It is likely that selection at yearling age, 10–13 months, may be sufficient for genetic improvement programs seeking to decrease the extent of wool coverage around the breech or the degree of wrinkling on the breech or body of sheep. Such genetic improvement programs would have no impact on wool coverage due to negligible phenotypic and genetic correlations between this trait and the breech cover and wrinkle traits. There is potential for the phenotypic variation in breech cover and wrinkle traits to be exploited by commercial sheep producers to support various on-farm decisions including truncation selection to keep or cull individuals with high breech cover or wrinkle scores, mating allocation as well as potential flock segmentation into ‘easy care’ versus normal management mobs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMerino 3aadults 3abreeding 3aflocks 3aflystrike 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic improvement 3aheritability 3amulesing 3aneck 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3asheep 3asheep industry 3awool 3ayearlings 0aGenetic improvement 0aHeritability 0aVariation 0aPhenotypic correlation 0aGenetic correlation 0aWithin flock selection1 aPreston, J.W.V0 tSmall ruminant research.g2015 Sept., v. 130 p.36-46dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl44843x0921-44887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2015.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02415naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245013300153300001800286520128400304592002801588650002301616650001501639650002401654650001701678650001701695650002101712650001801733700001501751700001501766700001501781700001901796700001501815700001601830773011101846856007501957852000902032655001202041IND60529108020221119004146.0160717e20121002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052910802DNAL7 a10.1021/ac301566k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNoble, J.10aOptical Scattering Artifacts Observed in the Development of Multiplexed Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy Nanotag Immunoassays  ap. 8246-8252.  aHere we describe scattering based signal suppression artifacts encountered while developing multiplex lateral flow (LF) immunoassay using surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) “nanotags” as analyte labels. Using these SERS nanotags, we have produced a quantitative test for inflammation biomarkers that is transferable to the point of care (POC). The SERS assay shows similar performance when compared with a fluorescent nanoparticle POC test. Here, using cardiac and inflammation biomarkers, we highlight the need to carefully optimize the concentration of assay components when using SERS nanotags and a single-line multiplexing approach. We show that in certain circumstances the SERS signal may be suppressed, leading to a significant underestimation of the analyte concentrations. Using electron microscopy and optical spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the error in the measurement is associated with the light scattering properties of the nanotags. These findings will be applicable to other nanoparticle labels with high light scattering coefficients. Through careful modification of the assay to reduce the impact of light scattering, it is possible to produce quantitative assays, but potentially at the expense of multiplexing capability and assay sensitivity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiomarkers 3aelectron microscopy 3aimmunoassays 3ainflammation 3alight scattering 3ananoparticles1 aAttree, S.1 aHorgan, A.1 aKnight, A.1 aKumarswami, N.1 aPorter, R.1 aWorsley, G.0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 84, no. 19 p.8246-8252dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac301566k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03522naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245018200182500001900364520174600383592002802129650001502157650001102172650001302183650001502196650001502211650001702226650001602243650001602259650001702275650001502292650000902307650002002316650001102336650002902347650001602376650002002392650001802412650001502430651001002445653002102455653002802476653001502504653003502519653005102554700003302605700006102638700006502699773011902764856008802883852000902971655001202980IND60700935920221121041855.0210114e20201125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070093592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarbieri, Maria Vittoria10aImproved fully automated method for the determination of medium to highly polar pesticides in surface and groundwater and application in two distinct agriculture-impacted areas.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWater is an essential resource for all living organisms. The continuous and increasing use of pesticides in agricultural and urban activities results in the pollution of water resources and represents an environmental risk. To control and reduce pesticide pollution, reliable multi-residue methods for the detection of these compounds in water are needed. In this context, the present work aimed at providing an analytical method for the simultaneous determination of trace levels of 51 target pesticides in water and applying it to the investigation of the target pesticides in two agriculture-impacted areas of interest. The method developed, based on an isotopic dilution approach and on-line solid-phase extraction-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, is fast, simple, and to a large extent automated, and allows the analysis of most of the target compounds in compliance with European regulations. Application of the method to the analysis of selected water samples collected at the lowest stretches of the two largest river basins of Catalonia (NE Spain), Llobregat and Ter, revealed the presence of a wide suite of pesticides in the Llobregat basin, some of them at concentrations above the water quality standards (irgarol and dichlorvos) or the acceptable method detection limits (methiocarb, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid), and much cleaner waters in the Ter River basin. Risk assessment of the pesticide concentrations measured in the Llobregat River indicated high risk due to the presence of irgarol, dichlorvos, methiocarb, azinphos ethyl, imidacloprid, and diflufenican (hazard quotient (HQ) values>10), and moderate potential risk in the Ter River, associated to the occurrence of bentazone and irgarol (HQ > 1).  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomation 3abasins 3abentazon 3acompliance 3adichlorvos 3adiflufenican 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3aimidacloprid 3amethiocarb 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3atandem mass spectrometry 3athiacloprid 3awater pollution 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3aSpain 0aPolar pesticides 0aTransformation products 0aOccurrence 0aOn-line solid-phase extraction 0aLiquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry1 aMonllor-Alcaraz, Luis Simón1 aPostigo, Cristina1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7344-70441 aLópez de Alda, Miren1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9347-27650 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 25, v. 745 p.140650-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02341naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010400163300001600267520117300283592002801456650001901484650001601503650001501519650001601534650001901550650003401569650001801603650000901621653001001630653003001640653002301670653000901693653001301702653001701715653001101732700001701743773008601760856007601846852000901922655001201931IND60481644920221122144933.0160208e20150414xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048164492DNAL7 a10.1515/hf-2014-02972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTukiainen, Pekka14aThe cellular level mode I fracture behaviour of spruce and birch in the RT crack propagation system  ap. 157-165.  aThe effect of the microscopic structure and the moisture content (MC) of wood on its fracture behaviour has been investigated. Green and air-dried spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and birch (Betula pendula Roth.) wood were subjected to pure mode I loading in the radial- tangential (RT) crack propagation system. Tests were carried out in situ in an environmental scanning electron microscope to observe crack propagation at the cellular level. Crack-tip displacement fields were computed by digital image correlation, and crack propagation was observed from the images captured during testing. Both the MC and the microscopic structure were found to affect the fracture process. In the air-dried birch and spruce, only microcracking caused large displacements ahead of the crack-tip. In spruce, the microcracking zone was larger than in birch. In green birch and spruce, microcracking was less evident than in the air-dried specimens, and in some cases, there were notable deformations in a few cells ahead of the crack-tip before crack extension. Microcracking is considered to be the main toughening mechanism in spruce and birch in the RT crack propagation system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula 3aPicea abies 3aair drying 3adeformation 3adigital images 3ascanning electron microscopes 3awater content 3awood 0abirch 0adigital image correlation 0adisplacement field 0aESEM 0afracture 0aRT direction 0aspruce1 aHughes, Mark0 tHolzforschung.g2015 Apr. 14, v. 70, no. 2 p.157-165dDe Gruyterx1437-434X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/hf-2014-02973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03645naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245019800169300001800367520210400385592002802489650001802517650001202535650001002547650001002557650001602567650001402583650001802597650002202615651000902637651001802646651001702664653001802681653002202699653000902721653001102730653003102741653002702772653002902799653003302828653001302861700001702874700001602891700001502907700001202922773011102934856008503045852000903130655001203139IND60558900720221119080612.0161119e20161124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055890072DNAL7 a10.1080/00222933.2016.12102602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamacho, A.I.10aNew Parabathynellidae species in Africa: the first bathynellids from Chad and an assay of their phylogenetic position in the order Bathynellacea (Crustacea: Malacostraca) based on 18S sequences  ap. 2691-2726.  aTwo new species of the genera Haplophallonella Serban and Coineau, 1975a and Racovitzaibathynella Serban and Coineau, 1994 are described from Africa. This is the first record of the members of the order Bathynellacea Chappuis, 1915 from Chad. Representatives of the genus Haplophallonella have hitherto been known only from the Ivory Coast type locality, and Racovitzaibathynella only from South Africa. Representatives of Haplophallonella irenae sp. nov. and Racovitzaibathynella dumonti sp. nov. have a unique combination of morphological characters. Haplophallonella irenae sp. nov. includes: seven-segmented antennule; five-segmented antenna; labrum with special morphology, clefted; mandible without proximal tooth; no epipodite on thoracopod I; bidentated exopod of male thoracopod VIII; triangular female thoracopod VIII; presence of basal seta on exopod of uropod and three plumose setae on endopod of uropod. Racovitzaibathynella dumonti sp. nov. includes: seven-segmented antennule; five-segmented antenna with sexual dimorphism and without seta on segment two; no epipodite on thoracopods I and II; outer lobe of male thoracopod VIII almost square, does not cover the posterior part of dentate lobe; the posterior lobe covers one part of dentate lobe, exopod with pointed distal end, basipod with distal end bilobed and endopod as two unequal smooth setae; almost triangular female thoracopod VIII and five to seven similar spines on sympod of uropod. Sequences of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene from 12 specimens of Racovitzaibathynella dumonti sp. nov. and two specimens of Haplophallonella irenae sp. nov. were obtained and analysed to complete the morphological description with molecular data. We have used these data to make a preliminary phylogenetic analysis with all genera of the world for those whose sequences are available (18S). Phylogenetic reconstruction of the Parabathynellidae family shows how the new African species remain clearly separated from European and Australian genus groups. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:4E7EB201-8922-403C-9546-AF8E9A409776  aPublisher supplied data 3aBathynellacea 3afemales 3agenes 3amales 3anew species 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asexual dimorphism 3aChad 3aCote d'Ivoire 3aSouth Africa 0aBathynellacea 0aParabathynellidae 0aChad 0aAfrica 0asubterranean aquatic fauna 0amorphological taxonomy 0aHaplophallonella sp. nov 0aRacovitzaibathynella sp. nov 0a18S rRNA1 aBrancelj, A.1 aDorda, B.A.1 aCasado, A.1 aRey, I.0 tJournal of natural history.g2016 Nov. 24, v. 50, no. 43-44 p.2691-2726dTaylor & Francisx1464-52627nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222933.2016.12102603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03670naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001900188245010900207300001600316506007600332520170400408592002802112506003702140650002502177650001302202650001102215650001002226650001302236650001702249650001302266650001902279650002202298650002202320650003502342650001802377650002402395650003202419650002602451650001002477650002702487650001802514650001302532650001702545650003502562650001102597650001202608650002802620650001302648650004702661650001402708650001902722650003302741651001102774700001802785700001902803700002702822773010202849856004802951852000902999655001203008IND50068083920221207103952.0130724e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006808392DNAL7 a237610162pmid7 aPMC37209882pmcid7 a10.1007/s13353-013-0154-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWawrocka, Anna10a11p13 deletions can be more frequent than the PAX6 gene point mutations in Polish patients with aniridia  ap. 345-351.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAniridia is a rare, bilateral, congenital ocular disorder causing incomplete formation of the iris, usually characterized by iris aplasia/hypoplasia. It can also appear with other ocular anomalies, such as cataracts, glaucoma, corneal pannus, optic nerve hypoplasia, macular hypoplasia, or ectopia lentis. In the majority of cases, it is caused by mutation in the PAX6 gene, but it can also be caused by microdeletions that involve the 11p13 region. Twelve unrelated patients of Polish origin with a clinical diagnosis of aniridia were screened for the presence of microdeletions in the 11p13 region by means of multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA). Additionally, the coding regions of the PAX6 gene were sequenced in all probands. MLPA examination revealed different size deletions of the 11p13 region in five patients. In three cases, deletions encompassed the entire PAX6 gene and a few adjacent genes. In one case, a fragment of the PAX6 gene was deleted only. In the final case, the deletion did not include any PAX6 sequence. Our molecular findings provide further evidence of the existence of the distant 3′ regulatory elements in the downstream region of the PAX6 gene, which is known from other studies to influence the level of protein expression. Sequence analysis of the PAX6 gene revealed the three different point mutations in the remaining four patients with aniridia. All the detected mutations were reported earlier. Based on accomplished results, the great diversity of the molecular basis of aniridia was found. It varies from point mutations to different size deletions in the 11p13 region which encompass partly or completely the PAX6 gene or cause a position effect.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aabnormal development 3acataract 3acornea 3agenes 3aglaucoma 3anerve tissue 3apatients 3apoint mutation 3aprotein synthesis 3asequence analysis 2aAniridiaxethnologyxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Deletion 2aChromosomes, Human, Pair 11 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aExons 2aEye Proteinsxgenetics 2aGene Deletion 2aGenomics 2aHeterozygote 2aHomeodomain Proteinsxgenetics 2aHumans 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPaired Box Transcription Factorsxgenetics 2aPhenotype 2aPoint Mutation 2aRepressor Proteinsxgenetics 0aPoland1 aSikora, Agata1 aKuszel, Lukasz1 aKrawczynski, Maciej R.0 tJournal of applied genetics.g2013 Aug., v. 54, no. 3 p.345-351dSpringer-Verlagx1234-19837nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13353-013-0154-0  aDNAL 7aarticle03014naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024005100092040001800143100001700161245010200178300001600280500000900296500001500305520183400320592002802154650001602182650001002198650001602208650002402224650002102248650001602269650001302285650001002298650000902308651001402317653002202331653001502353700002002368773012102388852000902509856009802518655001202616IND2037211420221118230749.0191122e199307  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203721142DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1993.0011183X003300040028x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBoard, J.

Merr.] culture could be better understood if LI effects on the reproductive period [first flower (R1) through physiological maturity (R7)] were clarified. The primary objective was to determine yield and yield component responses to a LI gradient during R1 to R7. Field studies were conducted during 1989 and 1990 at a late planting with ‘Centennial’ determinate soybean using 50-cm row spacing. The test was conducted at Baton Rouge, LA, on a Mhoon silty clay soil (fine.silty, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Fluvaquent). Treatments were a control (no defoliation) and four partial defoliation treatments that consisted of keeping the area 12.5 cm to both sides of the interrow midline (i.e., 50% of the interrow area) free of leaf blade material until pod initiation (R3), pod elongation (R4), start of seed filling (R5), or mid-seed filling (R6.5). These treatments resulted in a LI gradient during R1 to R7, without affecting node production or leaf area index (LAI) and total dry matter (TDM) by R1. In response to reduced LI, pods per reproductive node and pod number (both formed during R3-R5) declined. Similar source/sink ratios [crop growth rate (CGR) at R5 ÷ pod number] at seed initiation were maintained across all treatments. Thus seed per pod and seed size (formed during R5–R7) were unaffected. In conclusion, in cases such as narrow rows where LI is increased throughout the reproductive period, the determining effect on yield occurs during R1 through R5. Results also indicated that the relationship between seed number and LI (during R1–R7) occurs through adjustments in pod number. Approved for publication by the Director of the Louisiana Agric. Exp.

Thermal conductivity of a material is usually lower in an amorphous structure than in a crystalline structure. Most thermoelectrics are based on crystalline semiconductors with the electronic structure optimized to produce a high power factor. Calculations based on density functional theory and semiclassical methods, together with previous experimental results, suggest that the power factor of amorphous ZnO-based compounds could be as high as that of crystalline ZnO. Thermal conductivity of amorphous ZnO is estimated to be only ∼1/25 of that of crystalline ZnO, according to the molecular dynamics calculations presented here. The computed power factor and the lattice thermal conductivity together indicate a figure of merit zT over 0.2 at 600 K for amorphous ZnO. These numbers also suggest that amorphous ZnSnO₃ could be a prime candidate to study amorphous thermoelectrics, as its estimated thermoelectric parameters are comparable to those known for the state-of-the-art microstructural or nanostructured ZnO.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrystal structure 3amolecular dynamics 3asemiconductors 3athermal conductivity 3azinc oxide1 aCheng, Yu-Ting1 aFalk, Michael L.0 tThe Journal of Physical Chemistry C.g2016 Feb. 11, v. 120, no. 5 p.2529-2535dAmerican Chemical Societyx1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcc.5b116183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03348naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245004900168520176400217592002801981650001502009650001002024650001102034650002602045650001502071650001902086650002002105650001502125650001302140650002102153650001502174650002302189650004002212650001302252650001802265650002902283650001602312650002602328653001402354653001402368653001702382653002402399653001702423653001902440700003302459700002302492700001602515700003302531700003602564773009902600856008602699852000902785655001202794IND60679060020221121224948.0200110e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067906002DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.1031822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRojo, Carmen10aCharophyte stoichiometry in temperate waters  aIn recent years, little scrutiny has been devoted to charophytes with regard to carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents, their ratios and the factors controlling them. Data from published literature, and our own unpublished data, will be used along with environmental data to depict overall statistical distributions and controlling factors of charophyte stoichiometry, along with two hypotheses already suggested for plankton. Data on whole and decarbonated plants will be reviewed separately, but the role of the phosphorus-bound, external crust in the charophyte metabolism is still unclear. These algae have an intermediate carbon content, and lower nitrogen and phosphorus contents, among other aquatic plants. Hence their C:N and C:P ratios are usually higher than those of other submerged plants. Phosphorus is the outstanding key factor for charophyte growth and stoichiometry. Charophyte P content appears to be related to C, N and P sedimentary contents; a higher P content will result in increased growth rates. The maximal growth rates recorded occur at charophyte C:N:P ratios of 343-759:18-44:1, higher than the well-known Redfield values for optimal growth in other algae. While PAR irradiance partly controlled charophyte nitrogen content and the C:N ratio, UV-B radiation increased C and N content, albeit not affecting nutrient ratios. We conclude that the light:nutrient and the growth rate hypotheses hold true for charophytes. Increasing temperatures by global warming could decrease charophyte P content, thereby augmenting the C:P ratio. Further studies on charophyte stoichiometry are encouraged, specifically to disentangle the relationship between plant and carbonate crust and the role of stonewort stoichiometry in aquatic system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCharophyta 3aalgae 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acarbonates 3aglobal warming 3alight intensity 3ametabolism 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 3aplankton 3astoichiometry 3asubmerged aquatic plants 3atemperature 3aultraviolet radiation 0aNutrients 0aCharaceae 0aPlant growth 0aControlling factors 0aUV radiation 0aEutrophication1 aSánchez-Carrillo, Salvador,1 aRodrigo, María A.1 aPuche, Eric1 aCirujano Bracamonte, Santos,1 aÁlvarez-Cobelas, M.q(Miguel),0 tAquatic botany.g2020 Feb., v. 161 p.103182-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2019.1031823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02647naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245014500171500001900316520110800335592002801443650001501471650001501486650001601501650001801517650001901535650001701554650001401571650001701585650001301602650001901615650001901634650002001653650002301673650001701696650001801713653001801731653002101749653002301770653002401793700001501817700001701832700001801849700001501867700001301882700001801895773011901913856008802032852000902120655001202129IND60700936120221122200157.0201223e20201120xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070093612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Huabin10aPreparation of a novel bio-adsorbent of sodium alginate grafted polyacrylamide/graphene oxide hydrogel for the adsorption of heavy metal ion  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA novel bio-adsorbent named SA-PAM/GO hydrogel composites was synthesized through free radical polymerization. The structure and performance were characterized and analyzed by BET, SEM-EDS, FTIR and TGA. After modification, the BET surface area increased more than tripled, which was consistent with SEM results. Under optimal conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity of Cu²⁺ and Pb²⁺ were 68.76 mg/g and 240.69 mg/g, respectively. In addition, the research of kinetics and isotherms displayed that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model fitted the data well. After further research, the different adsorption mechanism including physical adsorption, chemical adsorption and electrostatic interactions were discussed. The chemical adsorption accompanying the ion exchange process was confirmed as the staple adsorption mechanism. Furthermore, the adsorbent still maintained good adsorption capacity after 5 cycles of adsorption-regeneration. Therefore, the SA-PAM/GO hydrogel composites have potential to remove the heavy metal ions from water body effectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aenvironment 3afree radicals 3agraphene oxide 3aheavy metals 3ahydrogels 3aion exchange 3akinetics 3apolyacrylamide 3apolymerization 3asodium alginate 3asorption isotherms 3asurface area 3asurface water 0aBio-adsorbent 0aHeavy metal ions 0aAdsorption kinetic 0aAdsorption isotherm1 aYang, Yuru1 aLin, Zongkun1 aZhao, Binchan1 aWang, Jing1 aXie, Jun1 aZhang, Aiping0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Nov. 20, v. 744 p.140653-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1406533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01271naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094024002200125024001900147040001800166100001500184245011800199300001400317506007600331520007800407592002800485506003700513650001600550650001600566650001500582650002200597700001300619700001800632700001500650700001600665700002000681773011000701856007700811852000900888655001200897IND60171939720221207111120.0150602e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017193972DNAL7 a10.1104/pp.112.2121422doi7 aPMC36412322pmcid7 a235359432pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, Jiafu12aA Genetic and Metabolic Analysis Revealed that Cotton Fiber Cell Development Was Retarded by Flavonoid Naringenin  ap. 86-95.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aFlavonoids and flavenoid synthesis affect white cotton fiber development.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afiber cells 3alint cotton 3anaringenin 3aplant development1 aTu, Lili1 aDeng, Fenglin1 aHu, Haiyan1 aNie, Yichun1 aZhang, Xianlong0 tPlant physiology.g2013 May, v. 162, no. 1 p.86-95dAmerican Society of Plant Biologistsx0032-08897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.112.2121423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01863naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006900165520082200234592002801056650002001084650002001104650001601124650001101140650001601151650002301167650001801190653002801208653001301236653001101249653003101260700001601291773011501307856008201422852000901504655001201513IND60779258420221117224133.0220706e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077925842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2022.1131082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuusk, Andres10aValidation of the hot-spot model with terrestrial laser scanning  aValidation of the hot-spot theoretical model was carried out with extensive terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) measurements in the Järvselja RAMI pine stand.

Furthermore, many studies have suggested that an increase in N availability may facilitate further invasions. However, most of these studies predicted the positive feedback without considering the preference for N forms of invasive plants. Therefore, we cultivated four common invasive species (Mikania micrantha, Ipomoea cairica, Wedelia trilobata and Bidens pilosa) in South China with hydroponic media containing different forms of N (i.e. NO₃⁻, NH₄NO₃ and NH₄⁺) at equimolar concentrations. Our results showed that the N forms significantly affected the growth, biomass allocation and physiological traits of the plants. All four invasive plants supplied with NO₃⁻ alone had better performance and greater allocation to root biomass than did plants that were supplied with NH₄⁺ alone. Moreover, the photosynthetic rate, pigment content and photosystem II activity of plants supplied with NO₃⁻ or NH₄NO₃ were significantly higher than those of plants supplied with NH₄⁺alone. The results suggested that all four invasive plants preferred NO₃⁻ rather than NH₄⁺, and changes in NO₃⁻ played an important role in furthering the invasions of these plants than did changes in NH₄⁺. Our results implied that decreasing NO₃⁻ may be a useful tool for controlling and managing invasive plants preferring NO₃⁻. In addition, this study highlighted the importance of considering plant N form preference to better understand plant invasions.  aPublisher supplied data  a31670479cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017A030313187cNatural Science Foundation of Guangdong  a201607020027cScience and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou  cScientific Research Fund of Hongda Zhang 3aBidens pilosa 3aIpomoea cairica 3aMikania micrantha 3aSphagneticola trilobata 3aammonium 3aammonium nitrate 3abiomass 3acase studies 3adry matter partitioning 3aecological invasion 3ahydroponics 3ainvasive species 3anitrogen 3aphotosystem II 3aweeds 3aChina1 aChen, B‐M1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1891-87520 tWeed research.g2019 Feb., v. 59, no. 1 p.49-57dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.123443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01817naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245004800160300001600208520091000224592002801134650000801162650001501170650002401185650001901209650001801228650002201246700001301268773010901281856008101390990002301471852000901494655001201503IND60094270720221116155302.0141104e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009427072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.sbi.2012.06.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBida, JP10aSquaring theory with practice in RNA design  ap. 457-466.  aRibonucleic acid (RNA) design offers unique opportunities for engineering genetic networks and nanostructures that self-assemble within living cells. Recent years have seen the creation of increasingly complex RNA devices, including proof-of-concept applications for in vivo three-dimensional scaffolding, imaging, computing, and control of biological behaviors. Expert intuition and simple design rules—the stability of double helices, the modularity of noncanonical RNA motifs, and geometric closure—have enabled these successful applications. Going beyond heuristics, emerging algorithms may enable automated design of RNAs with nucleotide-level accuracy but, as illustrated on a recent RNA square design, are not yet fully predictive. Looking ahead, technological advances in RNA synthesis and interrogation are poised to radically accelerate the discovery and stringent testing of design methods.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA 3aalgorithms 3agenetic engineering 3aimage analysis 3ananomaterials 3anucleotide motifs1 aDas, R.,0 tCurrent Opinion in Structural Biology.g2012 Aug., v. 22, no. 4 p.457-466dElsevier Ltdx0959-440X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbi.2012.06.0033Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02560naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013800155300001400293500002000307520110300327592002801430596007501458650001601533650002601549650001801575650002201593650001501615650001201630650001401642650002001656650001101676650001001687650002001697650001001717651001001727700001701737700001701754700001701771700001301788700001501801700001301816700005601829773011101885856007301996852000902069655001202078IND60627724920221118041711.0190128e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062772492DNAL7 a10.1111/wre.123372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUghade, B R12aA definitive method for distinguishing cultivated onion from its weedy mimic, Asphodelus fistulosus, at multiple developmental stages  ap. 39-48.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe onion, Allium cepa, is an important vegetable crop around the world. Globally, India ranks second in onion production, but yields are often much lower than in many other onion producing countries. This study reports on one major contributing factor to low onion yields in India: the presence of a weedy mimic that is morphologically similar to onion until the onset of flowering. We used morphological and molecular methods to identify this mimic as Asphodelus fistulosus, an exotic weed not previously reported in India. Our study indicated that molecular markers derived from the rbcL and/or matK chloroplast genes in a DNA barcoding approach allow accurate identification of this weed using any tissue and even at early developmental stages. Our results also showed that visual examination of seed lots coupled with DNA barcoding analysis of samples of 5–10 individual seeds can be used to confirm identification. The ability to easily identify contaminating material before and during cultivation can allow farmers to minimise production losses and prevent further spreading of this weed.  aPublisher supplied data  cMinistry of Food Processing Industries, Government of India, New Delhi 3aAllium cepa 3aAsphodelus fistulosus 3aDNA barcoding 3achloroplast genes 3acrop yield 3afarmers 3aflowering 3agenetic markers 3aonions 3aseeds 3avegetable crops 3aweeds 3aIndia1 aKhilare, V C1 aSangale, D M1 aKorhale, G A1 aIngle, P1 aTathe, A E1 aPatil, R1 aKhedkar, G D1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2060-785X0 tWeed research.g2019 Feb., v. 59, no. 1 p.39-48dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl44597x0043-17377nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/wre.123373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002500139245006400164300001600228500002000244520161100264592002801875650002701903650001101930650001101941650001101952650002001963650000901983650001201992650001002004650001302014650001302027650002202040650002202062650001602084650001102100650000902111700002602120700002702146700002602173700002502199700002102224773009402245856007302339852000902412655001202421IND60571878520221118065133.0170712e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057187852DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.213082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGloneková, Markéta14aThe weight of Rothschild giraffe—Is it really well known?  ap. 423-431.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aDespite being regularly bred in zoos, giraffes remain a challenge, especially in terms of feeding. Assessment of factors influencing growth and weight changes during ontogeny, as well as analysis of weight fluctuations in adult individuals, may become a critical point in captive diet evaluation. Knowledge about weight is a crucial husbandry tool; however, such data are rarely acquired. Using a unique dataset from regularly weighed Rothschild giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis rothschildi) from Prague zoo, we determined the growth functions of male and female giraffes and calculated weight gains during giraffe ontogeny. The mean weights of adult males and females were 1307 ± 52 and 835 ± 45 kg, respectively confirming the large overall dimensions of G. c. rothschildi in comparison with other giraffe subspecies. As the giraffe is a polygynous species showing considerable sexual dimorphism, we expected male calves to have larger first weights and faster growth during the most intensive period of maternal care. Growth rates and daily weight gains were higher in males than in females during the whole postnatal period. Males grew faster and longer than females. However, differences in weight between males and females appeared as late as after 1 year of age. The weight of adult males and non‐pregnant adult females fluctuated significantly across seasons, being the highest during the autumn and winter months, respectively which may reflect the different effects of sexual activity and feeding ratios in males and females.

Sp. tritici D.M. Henderson] was widespread in Canada and the USA in 1986 and some Canadian cultivars were less resistant than expected. Studies on the inheritance of leaf rust resistance were begun to provide information of use to durum wheat breeders. The inheritance of adult plant resistance to race 15 of leaf rust was investigated in six durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) cultivars, Lloyd, Medora, Pelissier, Quilafen, Stewart 63, and Wakooma, which had been previously shown to carry genes for seedling resistance. Each cultivar had been crossed and backcrossed to a susceptible line, RL6089. Four of the F₂ populations and 29 or 30 F₂ families from each of the six backcrosses were tested with race 15 in a field nursery. The results were compared with those for the same material tested at the seedling stage in a greenhouse. The combined data showed that each of the genes for seedling resistance was effective at the adult plant stage in the field. The segregation of the BC₁F₂ progenies indicated that Lloyd carries a dominant gene and Pelissier a recessive gene, that are effective only in adult plants. Thus, all of the seedling resistance genes are of potential value to durum wheat breeders and Lloyd and Pelissier carry additional genes for adult plant resistance that should also be useful.

The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Reproductive Management Center (RMC) gathers data on contraception use and provides recommendations. Although apes have been given oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) for at least 30 years, there have been no published reports with basic information on why the pill is administered, formulations and brands used, and effects on physiology and behavior. Here, we report survey results characterizing OCP use in bonobos (Pan paniscus) housed in North American zoos, as well as information accumulated in the RMC's Contraception Database. Of 26 females treated, there have been no failures and nine reversals. The most commonly administered OCP formulation in bonobos contained ethinyl estradiol (EE) 35 μg/norethindrone 1 mg. Few females on combined oral contraceptives (COCs) were given a continuous active pill regimen; a hormone‐free interval of at least 5 days was allowed in most. Crushing the pill and mixing with juice or food was common. Females on COCs seldom experienced breakthrough estrus or bleeding, while these conditions were sometimes observed for females on continuous COCs. All females on COCs exhibited some degree of perineal swelling, with a mean score of 3 or 3+ most commonly reported. Behavioral changes included less sexual behavior, dominant females becoming subordinate, and a negative effect on mood. No appreciable change in weight was noted. Taken together, these results indicate that OCPs are an effective and reversible contraceptive option for bonobos that can be used by zoos and sanctuaries to limit reproduction.

The Au nanodisks are abruptly heated by a sub-picosecond optical pulse; time-resolved changes in the temperature of the Au nanodisk and the liquid near the nanodisk/liquid interface are monitored by measurements of transient changes in optical transmission. The interface thermal conductance G of nanodisks coated with a hydrophilic self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate varies over the range 90 < G < 190 MW m–² K–¹ as the composition of the liquid mixture is changed from pure ethanol to pure water. With increasing hexyl-β-d-glucoside concentration in water, the interface thermal conductance of hydrophilic nanodisks decreases from 190 MW m–² K–¹ to 130 MW m–² K–¹ as the concentration is varied between pure water and 100 mM glucoside. For hydrophobic surfaces, G = 70 ± 10 MW m–² K–¹.

The performance of the TD-GC/TOF MS system was evaluated using liquid standards of 19 target VOCs prepared in the range of 35 pg to 2.79 ng per μL. Studies were carried out using both total ion chromatogram (TIC) and extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) mode. EIC mode was used for calibration to reduce background and to improve signal-to-noise. The detectability of 19 target VOCs, if assessed in terms of method detection limit (MDL, per US EPA definition) and limit of detection (LOD), averaged 5.90 pg and 0.122 pg, respectively, with the mean coefficient of correlation (R²) of 0.9975. The minimum quantifiable mass of target analytes, when determined using real air samples by the TD-GC/TOF MS, is highly comparable to the detection limits determined experimentally by standard. In fact, volumes for the actual detection of the major aromatic VOCs like benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) in ambient air samples were as low as 1.0 mL in the 0.11–2.25 ppb range. It was thus possible to demonstrate that most target compounds including those in low abundance could be reliably quantified at concentrations down to 0.1 ppb at sample volumes of less than 10 mL. The unique sensitivity of this advanced analytical system can ultimately lead to a shift in field sampling strategy with smaller air sample volumes facilitating faster, simpler air sampling (e.g., use of gas syringes rather than the relative complexity of pumps or bags/canisters), with greatly reduced risk of analyte breakthrough and minimal interference, e.g., from atmospheric humidity. The improved detection limits offered by this system can also enhance accuracy and measurement precision.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUnited States Environmental Protection Agency 3aair 3abags 3abenzene 3acorrelation 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography 3ahumidity 3amass spectrometry 3apumps 3arisk reduction 3asyringes 3atoluene 3avolatile organic compounds 3axylene1 aKim, Ki Hyun,0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2012 Oct. 02, v. 84, no. 19 p.8284-8293dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fac301792x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04088naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245009400176300001600270520244000286592002802726650001502754650002802769650002002797650002802817650001002845650001202855650000902867650001902876650001002895650002002905650001202925650002302937650001202960650001302972650002202985650002003007650002403027650001703051650001503068650002003083653001503103653001703118653004303135700001803178700002003196700001803216700002203234700002503256773016003281856008403441852000903525655001203534IND60612772820221119103446.0180907e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061277282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.clnesp.2018.05.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBravo-José, Patricia10aPrevalence of sarcopenia and associated factors in institutionalised older adult patients  ap. 113-119.  aSarcopenia is a syndrome characterised by a progressive and generalised loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life and death. The main aim of the present study was to establish the prevalence of sarcopenia using EWGSOP-defined criteria in institutionalised older adult patients in long-term care institutions. A secondary purpose was to identify the risk factors that develop Sarcopenia in this population.A Multicentre cross-sectional study was conducted in 334 institutionalised older adult patients, where the prevalence of sarcopenia and its relation with certain risk factors were measured. Physical performance was measured by gait speed, muscle strength measured by a handheld dynamometer and skeletal muscle mass measured using bioimpedance analysis. Different variables were collected: body mass index (BMI), diseases documented in the clinical record, the numbers of falls, the level of activity and functional ability.Two hundred eighty five individuals were included. According the EWGSOP algorithm and the cut-off points proposed by Masanes et al. for the Spanish population, 118 (41.4%) participants presented sarcopenia, of which 32 patients (27%) suffered from moderate sarcopenia, 78 patients (66%) were identified as severe sarcopenia patients and only 8 (7%) were classified as sarcopenic obesity. More female residents (96 females (81.4%) vs. 22 males (18.6%), p < 0.0001) tended to be sarcopenic. Patients diagnosed with sarcopenia tended to be more functionally impaired and had a more unfavourable BMI than those who were not sarcopenic (Barthel score 40.93 vs, 49.22, p = 0.0034 and BMI 23.57 vs, 27.61, p < 0.0001). Results from regression analysis indicated that those older than 85 years old (OR 2.495, 95% CI 1.401–4.441), the female gender, (OR 3.215, 95%CI 1.635–6.324) and whose BMI was lower than 22 (OR 5.973, 95% CI 2.932–12.165) appeared to be associated with sarcopenia, whereas the Barthel Index and other factors were not.The present study suggests that sarcopenia is highly prevalent in patients living in long-term care institutions, especially in female patients. Our findings support that the muscle mass was negatively associated with poor nutritional status and poor capacity to develop basic activities of daily living that indicates high dependency of these patients and high necessity of care.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3abioelectrical impedance 3abody mass index 3across-sectional studies 3adeath 3afemales 3agait 3along term care 3amales 3amuscle strength 3amuscles 3anutritional status 3aobesity 3apatients 3aphysical activity 3aquality of life 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3asarcopenia 3askeletal muscle 0aSarcopenia 0aNursing home 0aInstitutionalised older adult patients1 aMoreno, Elena1 aEspert, Minerva1 aRomeu, María1 aMartínez, Pilar,1 aNavarro, Concepción0 tClinical nutrition ESPEN.g2018 Oct., v. 27 p.113-119dElsevier LtdaEuropean Society for Clinical Nutrition and MetabolismwJournal:23538x2405-45777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2018.05.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03439naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100007500140245018900215300001800404520207100422592002802493650001302521650001602534650002102550650002202571650002102593650001502614650000902629650001302638650002102651650001702672650001702689650002102706700001802727700001802745700002302763700001702786773014302803856007402946852000903020655001203029IND60642454020221121070655.0190507e20160914xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064245402DNAL7 a10.1039/c6tb01807f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCongX.

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was selected as the target analyte to exhibit the analytical performance of this platform. Specifically, nitrogen-doped mesoporous TiO₂ (mTiO₂:N) was firstly synthesized through an evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) method. Then, an mTiO₂:N/Au hybrid structure was prepared through depositing Au nanoparticles on the surface of the mTiO₂:N film and this acted as the photoelectrochemical matrix to immobilize the complementary DNA (cDNA) of the CEA aptamer probe (pDNA). CdTe@CdS core–shell QDs as sensitization agents were covalently bound at the front-end of pDNA. After pDNA was hybridized with cDNA, the labels of the CdTe@CdS core–shell QDs were very close to the mTiO₂:N/Au electrode surface, resulting in an evidently enhanced photocurrent intensity due to the generation of the sensitization effect. When the aptasensor was incubated with CEA and Exo-I simultaneously, CdTe@CdS QD labeled pDNA (denoted QD–pDNA) became specifically bound with CEA and meanwhile was separated from the electrode surface, leading to an obviously weakened sensitization effect and a decreased photocurrent intensity. Moreover, as Exo-I could digest the single strand form of pDNA, the previously bound CEA was released and continuously interacted with the rest of the pDNA on the electrode surface, causing further decreased photocurrent intensity. The well-designed photoelectrochemical aptasensor exhibited a low detection limit of 0.12 pg mL⁻¹ and a wide linear range from 0.5 pg mL⁻¹ to 10 ng mL⁻¹ for CEA detection, and it also showed good selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The proposed signal amplification strategy provides a promising universal photoelectrochemical platform for sensitively detecting various biomolecules at low levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantigens 3aaptasensors 3achemical bonding 3acomplementary DNA 3aelectric current 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ananogold 3aoligonucleotides 3aporous media 3aquantum dots 3atitanium dioxide1 aFan, Gao-Chao1 aWang, Xiaolei1 aAbdel-Halim, E.

Genetic manipulation of fatty acid composition in rice bran oil to increase oleic acid levels at the expense of linoleic acid and palmitic acid would not only add extra value to the rice, but also enhance health benefits for consumers. Four putative rice microsomal Δ12-fatty acid desaturase (OsFAD2) genes were identified as potentially important target genes to achieve this improvement. Reverse transcription–PCR analysis indicated that OsFAD2–1 was the most highly expressed gene in rice grains. RNA interference (RNAi) suppression of the expression of OsFAD2–1 resulted in an increase of oleic acid and a reduction of linoleic and palmitic acids in T3 grains. The research here showed that in the rice grains, the OsFAD2–1 enzyme was an effective target for raising oleic acid levels at the expense of the oxidatively unstable linoleic acid and the cholesterol-raising palmitic acid.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aRNA interference 3afatty acid composition 3agenes 3agenetic engineering 3alinoleic acid 3aoleic acid 3apalmitic acid 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3arice 3arice bran oil 0aFAD2 0alinoleic acid 0aoleic acid 0aOryza sativa 0apalmitic acid 0aRNAi1 aLiu, Qing1 aLi, Zhongyi1 aButardo, Vito M.1 aBlanchard, Christopher L.1 aRahman, Sadequr0 tFunctional plant biology.g2013, v. 40, no. 10 p.996-1004dCSIRO Publishingx1445-44087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/FP12301  aDNAL 7aarticle02837naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100005900139245008000198300001600278500002000294520170400314592002802018650002302046650001102069650001302080650000902093650001802102650000902120650001102129650001302140650001102153650001902164650001502183700001902198700002402217773012802241856007302369852000902442655001202451IND60614897620221117210143.0181002e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061489762DNAL7 a10.1111/eff.124012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, Aaron M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8278-959910aBig floods, big knowledge gap: Food web dynamics in a variable river system  ap. 898-909.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWhile flow regime is widely recognised as an over‐arching feature structuring aquatic ecosystems, the influence of flood events on feeding habits in fish assemblages inhabiting variable environments remains largely unknown. In this study, we investigated how diets of a fish assemblage changed in response to fluctuations in hydrology in a highly variable, wet‐dry tropical Australian river. We compared dietary habits, trophic guilds and intra‐ and interspecific dietary overlap and diet breadth across different seasons. Wet‐season floods acted as major geomorphic and ecological perturbations that exerted substantial effects on the trophic dynamics of the terapontid assemblage, particularly through the removal of in‐stream plant production and detritus. Forced by major shifts in food source availability due to seasonal flooding, fishes responded to these perturbations by marked changes in diet, with significant guild switching following wet‐season floods. Rather than the predictable, gradual, changes in consumer–resource interactions associated with the gentler seasonal flood pulse evident in other tropical river systems, study results instead emphasised rapid and profound changes to species' diets and trophic interactions following abrupt flood pulses. These sudden shifts in food sources may also explain some of the lack of clarity in discrimination of specific carbon sources or species' trophic levels evident in isotopic food web studies from the region. Results indicate that the effects of flood pulses on assemblage trophic interactions may differ among ecosystem types and across the broad potential scale of hydrological disturbance mediated by flood events.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquatic ecosystems 3acarbon 3adetritus 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afish 3afloods 3aforaging 3arivers 3atrophic levels 3awet season1 aPusey, Brad J.1 aPearson, Richard G.0 tEcology of freshwater fish.g2018 Oct., v. 27, no. 4 p.898-909dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895938x0906-66917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.124013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02240naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245012900204300001800333500001900351520102300370592002801393596008401421650001501505650002101520650001701541650002001558700001401578700001901592700002401611700001801635700002401653773012101677856008301798852000901881655001201890IND60717559520221120114653.0201117e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071755952DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-05472-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRemya, T.

With the plethora of knowledge on major drivers of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar and brown trout Salmo trutta recruitment, there is a requirement to explore less known species, such as European grayling Thymallus thymallus, whose postemergence time coincides with period of increasing temperature and low discharge. This study assessed drivers of grayling recruitment in a southern English chalk stream, a system vulnerable to discharge and temperature alterations under future climate change predictions. The analyses explored age 0+ grayling survival in relation to conspecific and heterospecific densities and discharge‐ and temperature‐derived factors. The final mixed‐effects model revealed a positive relationship between age 0+ grayling survival and incubation temperature anomaly and age 0+ trout abundance. Similarly, postincubation temperature anomaly had a positive effect on 0+ grayling survival, but only up to a threshold temperature of 13.5°C, beyond which it had a negative effect. In contrast, increasing number of days with low discharge postincubation negatively influenced age 0+ grayling survival, with no evidence of an effect of elevated discharges following spawning. Our results emphasise the importance of maintaining natural discharge regimes in salmonid rivers by tackling multiple stressors operating at the catchment scale, including land and water use to mitigate for predicted climate driven changes. In addition, further research on recruitment drivers in less stable, rain‐fed systems, is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo salar 3aSalmo trutta 3aThymallus 3achalk 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acold-water fish 3aegg production 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 3aspawning 3astreams 3atemperature 3atrout 3awatersheds1 aBritton, J.

Changing aqueous solution pH from 4.0 to 8.0, the peptides carried more negative charges that reduced the aggregation of the peptides. In vitro cytotoxicity study verified that the peptides were much safer than sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In pH 4.0–8.0 aqueous solutions, the peptides presented better surface activities than SDS. The apparent critical micelle concentration (CMC) values of the peptides were much smaller than the CMC value of SDS, the pC₂₀ values (ability to reduce surface tension of 20 mN/m) of the peptides were much larger than the pC₂₀ value of SDS, and the surface pressure πCMC values of the peptides were similar to the value of SDS. In addition, the peptides had non-foaming property, good emulsifying capacity and emulsion stability at acidic condition. This study demonstrates that renewable, safe, degradable and low cost peptides produced by hydrolysis of food protein have excellent surface activities. Deamidated zein peptides with adjustable hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity are promising alternatives to chemical surfactants in food industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3aaqueous solutions 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3adietary protein 3aemulsifying properties 3aemulsions 3afood industry 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3amicelles 3amoieties 3apH 3apeptides 3asodium dodecyl sulfate 3asurface tension 3asurfactants 3azein 0aEmulsification 0aFoaming 0aSurface tension 0aPeptide 0aProtein hydrolysis 0aZein1 aXu, Guangrui1 aZhang, Zhe1 aLi, Hongxiang1 aYao, Ping0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Mar. 05, v. 540 p.150-157dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.12.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02612naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010200169300001600271520117500287592002801462650001501490650003501505650001301540650000901553650001301562650001801575650001301593650001501606650001601621650001101637650001601648653002501664653001801689653003501707653003501742653002701777700001601804700001501820700001201835700001501847700001501862700001901877700002001896773010601916856008702022852000902109655001202118IND60618009620221122050515.0200517e20180305xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061800962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.12.0712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Guansong10aSurfactant-assisted shape separation from silver nanoparticles prepared by a seed-mediated method  ap. 136-142.  aSo far from the suggestion of a seed-mediated method, there has been considerable development in the controllable synthesis of anisotropic nanoparticles. However, the formed nanoparticles often exhibit considerable polydispersity in their size or shape. In this work, we improved the surfactant-assisted shape separation method that were different from gold nanorods reported previously to purify silver nanotriangles and investigated the important parameters systematically. The results showed that relative amount of CTAB to AgNPs (which was determined by the concentration and volume of CTAB) and the temperature of CTAB were the critical roles in the separation of silver nanotriangles. Silver nanospheres, small nanotriangles and big nanotriangles were separated successfully from their associated nanoparticles by the surfactant-assisted shape separation in twice. The separated nanoparticles have higher regularity and more uniform size, which is important to enlarge the application scope of silver nanomaterials. This improved method allows us to purify silver or other metal nanoparticles prepared by a facile seed-mediated method in high efficiency and yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanisotropy 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3acolloids 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananorods 3ananosilver 3ananospheres 3asilver 3atemperature 0aSilver nanoparticles 0aNanotriangles 0aCetyltrimethylammonium bromide 0aSurfactant-assisted separation 0aA seed-mediated method1 aJin, Wenxiu1 aZhang, Wen1 aWu, Kai1 aHe, Jiahui1 aZhang, Yan1 aChen, Qingyuan1 aZhang, Wanzhong0 tColloids and surfaces.g2018 Mar. 05, v. 540 p.136-142dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2017.12.0713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02590naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011100166300001400277520119800291592002801489650001201517650001101529650001801540650001501558650001601573650001001589650001601599650000901615650001401624650001301638650002101651650000901672650001301681650001201694650001001706650000901716653001701725653001401742653001201756653000901768653001001777653001601787700001701803700001901820700001501839700001601854773009701870856008401967852000902051655001202060IND60122625920221121035404.0150325e20140102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012262592DNAL7 a10.1080/19476337.2013.7820712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Yu-Wei10aEffects of germination on iron, zinc, calcium, manganese, and copper availability from cereals and legumes  ap. 22-26.  aGerminated grains are extensively used in weaning and geriatric foods. Germination generally improves the nutrient content and digestibility of foods. The present investigation examined the influence of germination of faba bean, soybean, rice, and wheat on the availability of iron, zinc, calcium, manganese, and copper. Germination increased the availability of iron by >fourfold from faba bean and soybean and by >twofold from rice, whereas such a beneficial influence was not seen in wheat. The availability of zinc from rice and wheat increased to an extent of 80% and 87%, respectively, as a result of germination. However, germination reduced the availability of zinc from faba bean and soybean. Germination increased the availability of calcium from faba bean, soybean, and rice. Germination did increase the availability of manganese from soybean (14.4%) and rice (43%), whereas germination did not exert any influence on availability of copper from rice and wheat; it significantly decreased (12.7% and 14.3%, respectively) the same from faba bean and soybean. Thus, germination could be an appropriate food-based strategy to gain iron and other minerals maximally from food grains.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3acopper 3adigestibility 3afaba beans 3afood grains 3afoods 3agermination 3airon 3amanganese 3aminerals 3anutrient content 3arice 3asoybeans 3aweaning 3awheat 3azinc 0aavailability 0afaba bean 0asoybean 0arice 0awheat 0agermination1 aXie, Wei-Hua1 aJin, Xiao-Xiao1 aWang, Qian1 aHe, Yi-Jian0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2014 Jan. 2, v. 12, no. 1 p.22-26dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2013.7820713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245006600168300001600234500001900250520162000269592002801889596006401917650001601981650001301997650001702010650001102027650001302038650001802051650001202069650001302081650002502094650001902119650001402138650003002152650001402182650001302196650001902209650002602228650002202254650000902276651001602285700002802301700001702329700005502346773012902401856008202530852000902612655001202621IND60723998120221120233524.0210119e202101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072399812DNAL7 a10.1007/s00203-020-02048-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDahal, Ram Hari10aLuteolibacter luteus sp. nov., isolated from stream bank soil  ap. 377-382.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA non-motile, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped and yellow-colored bacterium, designated G-1-1-1ᵀ was obtained from soil sampled at Gwanggyo stream bank, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea. Cells were aerobic, catalase positive, grew optimally at 25–30 °C and hydrolysed aesculin and casein. A phylogenetic analysis based on its 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain G-1-1-1ᵀ formed a lineage within the genus Luteolibacter. The closest members were Luteolibacter flavescens GKXᵀ (97.7% sequence similarity) and Luteolibacter arcticus MC 3726ᵀ (97.3%). The sequence similarities with other members of the genus Luteolibacter were ≤ 93.9%. The genome of strain G-1-1-1ᵀ was 6,412,079 bp long with 5176 protein-coding genes. The diagnostic amino acid of cell-wall peptidoglycan of strain G-1-1-1ᵀ was meso-diaminopimelic acid. The only respiratory quinone was menaquinone-9 and the principal polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and unidentified phospholipids. The predominant cellular fatty acids were iso-C₁₄:₀, C₁₆:₁ ω9c, C₁₆:₀, C₁₄:₀ and anteiso-C₁₅:₀. The DNA G + C content was 61.0 mol%. The anti-SMASH analysis of whole genome showed eight putative biosynthetic gene clusters responsible for various secondary metabolites. Based on genomic, chemotaxonomic, phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses, strain G-1-1-1ᵀ represents a novel species in the genus Luteobacter, for which the name Luteolibacter luteus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is G-1-1-1ᵀ (= KACC 21614ᵀ = NBRC 114341ᵀ).  aPublisher supplied data  aNRF-2019R1F1A1058501cNational Research Foundation of Korea 3aamino acids 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acasein 3acatalase 3achemotaxonomy 3aesculin 3agenomics 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptidoglycans 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylethanolamines 3aphylogeny 3aquinones 3ariparian areas 3asecondary metabolites 3asequence homology 3asoil 3aSouth Korea1 aChaudhary, Dhiraj Kumar1 aKim, Dong-Uk1 aKim, Jaisoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3876-39220 tArchives of microbiology.g2021 Jan., v. 203, no. 1 p.377-382dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl49610x0302-89337nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-020-02048-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02514naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245008100169520120300250592002801453650002401481650002301505650002501528650002601553650002601579650002501605653002401630653001201654653002501666653002201691653001901713700005901732700001701791700001301808700001501821700001401836700001601850700002001866773011201886856008501998852000902083655001202092IND60748022520221119190322.0210911e20211201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074802252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1197512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaolei10aUV assisted backwashing for fouling control in membrane bioreactor operation  aMembrane fouling is a major bottleneck to cost effective application of membrane bioreactor (MBR) for wastewater treatment. This study evaluated a novel fouling control strategy of using UV irradiation to enhance the effectiveness of backwashing. Coupling UV irradiation with NaClO backwashing resulted in significantly lower membrane fouling, suggesting a higher fouling control efficacy than only NaClO backwashing. The signal molecule (C8-HSL) monitoring results suggested the NaClO backwashing could remove the foulants but lead to bacterial stress and thus resulted in more signal molecule being secreted by the microorganisms in the MBR. In contrast, UV irradiation in the mixed liquor constantly suppressed the signal molecule levels and thereby inhibited the fouling development. The confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis suggested that the significant formation of large bacterial aggregates on the membrane surface were avoided after UV assisted backwashing compared to permeate or NaClO backwashing without UV irradiation. Besides, the UV assisted backwashing did not significantly affect the microbial community structure and compromise the water treatment performance of the MBR.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity structure 3acost effectiveness 3amembrane bioreactors 3amicrobial communities 3aultraviolet radiation 3awastewater treatment 0aMembrane bioreactor 0aFouling 0aPermeate backwashing 0aNaClO backwashing 0aUV irradiation1 aCheng, Xiaoying1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8132-94111 aReng, Jiayao1 aMa, Xiao1 aLiu, Qiang1 aYao, Ping1 aNgo, Hao H.1 aNghiem, Long D.0 tJournal of membrane science.g2021 Dec. 01, v. 639 p.119751-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12468x0376-73887nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.memsci.2021.1197513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04023naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006600139245020700205500001900412500002000431520211500451592002802566596009302594596005002687650001202737650001902749650002002768650002902788650001602817650001502833650001602848650002102864650001902885650001502904650001302919650001802932650001302950650000902963650001902972650001102991650001103002650002003013650001103033650002303044700002303067700001903090700005803109700002203167700001803189700001603207700001503223773012503238856007303363852000903436655001203445IND60735971320221116204109.0210430e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073597132DNAL7 a10.1002/hyp.141352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeathwaite, Ann Louise1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8791-003910aSpatial and temporal dynamics of nitrogen exchange in an upwelling reach of a groundwater‐fed river and potential response to perturbations changing rainfall patterns under UK climate change scenarios  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe report the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of hyporheic exchange flows (HEFs) and nitrogen exchange in an upwelling reach of a 200 m groundwater‐fed river. We show how research combining hydrological measurement, geophysics and isotopes, together with nutrient speciation techniques provides insight on nitrogen pathways and transformations that could not have been captured otherwise, including a zone of vertical preferential discharge of nitrate from deeper groundwater, and a zone of rapid denitrification linking the floodplain with the riverbed. Nitrate attenuation in the reach is dominated by denitrification but is spatially highly variable. This variability is driven by groundwater flow pathways and landscape setting, which influences hyporheic flow, residence time and nitrate removal. We observed the spatial connectivity of the river to the riparian zone is important because zones of horizontal preferential discharge supply organic matter from the floodplain and create anoxic riverbed conditions with overlapping zones of nitrification potential and denitrification activity that peaked 10–20 cm below the riverbed. Our data also show that temporal variability in water pathways in the reach is driven by changes in stage of the order of tens of centimetres and by strength of water flux, which may influence the depth of delivery of dissolved organic carbon. The temporal variability is sensitive to changes to river flows under UK climate projections that anticipate a 14%–15% increase in regional median winter rainfall and a 14%–19% reduction in summer rainfall. Superimposed on seasonal projections is more intensive storm activity that will likely lead to a more dynamic and inherently complex (hydrologically and biogeochemically) hyporheic zone. We recorded direct evidence of suppression of upwelling groundwater (flow reversal) during rainfall events.

One control mechanism is the priming effect (PE) which consists in stimulating SOM mineralization with the addition of fresh, energetic plant material. In this study, we quantified C mineralization and PE in soils sampled in two contrasted long-term (40 years) tillage treatments which deeply modified soil properties (e.g. organic C concentration, microbial biomass, pH). We hypothesized that soil tillage might affect these processes through changes in C addition rates, nutrient availability, and long-term variations in SOM content and microbial communities. We investigated the relationship between PE intensity, tillage and nutrients availability in soil samples taken in no till (NT) and full inversion tillage (FIT) in two layers (0–5 and 15–20 cm). Soils were incubated with or without addition of 13C labeled cellulose and mineral nutrients. Potential C mineralization and primed C were measured during 262 days. Unlabeled soil microbial biomass C was determined at the end of the experiment to separate apparent and real priming effect.Basal cumulative C mineralization in the control soil ranged from 363 to 1490 mg kg−1 soil at day 262. It was strongly correlated with soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Specific mineralization rates were 44.8 and 68.8 g kg−1 SOC in the 0–5 cm layer for the FIT and NT treatments, respectively and were strongly linked with the particulate organic matter content (r = 0.99***). These results suggest that SOC was more active in the upper layer of the NT treatment due to the high concentration of readily-decomposable, particulate organic matter. The cellulose was entirely metabolized after 60 days and its kinetics of mineralization was affected neither by tillage, depth nor nutrients. The percentage of cellulose C released as CO2 represented 55–61% of the added cellulose-C at day 262. A positive PE was found in all treatments and its kinetics was parallel to that of cellulose mineralization. The cumulative PE significantly varied with nutrients level but not tillage, ranging from 73 to 78 mg kg−1 under high nutrients level and from 116 to 136 mg kg−1 in low nutrients level. No significant differences were found in unlabeled microbial biomass C between control and amended soil, suggesting no apparent priming effect. We conclude that the priming was mainly controlled by nutrient availability but not tillage, in spite of strong tillage-induced changes in SOC concentration and microbial biomass. Since PE is known to depend on C addition rate, tillage is expected to affect in situ PE through variations in the ratio of fresh carbon to nutrient concentration along the soil profile.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3amineralization 3anutrient content 3aparticulate organic matter 3ano-tillage 3amicrobial communities 3aconventional tillage 3asoil organic carbon 3anutrient availability 3asoil properties 3amicrobial biomass 3acellulose 3asoil amendments 3asoil microorganisms 3apH 3aagricultural management 3asoil sampling 3asoil profiles 3anutrients 0acarbon 0aMicrobial biomass 0aNo till 0aNutrient mining 0aPriming effect 0aSoil organic carbon mineralization 0aFull inversion tillage1 aMary, Bruno1 aFontaine, Sébastien,1 aPerveen, Nazia1 aRevaillot, Sandrine1 aCohan, Jean-Pierre0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 78 p.332-339dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.07.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001700141245008200158520133900240592002801579650001301607650002201620650002301642650001401665650001101679650001001690650002101700650001401721650001301735650002501748650001801773650001901791650001001810650002001820650001801840650001301858651001001871700002001881700002301901700002101924700002201945700002101967700002601988700001902014700001902033700002102052700002402073700002002097773012002117856007502237852000902312655001202321IND60745344020221120164321.0210723e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074534402DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110719492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPepe, Paola 10aTowards an Integrated Approach for Monitoring Toxoplasmosis in Southern Italy  aToxoplasmosis is a widespread worldwide zoonotic infection caused by the intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii. This protozoan infection is considered one of the most important food-borne parasitic zoonoses globally. Beyond its impact on public health, toxoplasmosis has also important veterinary implications, because it causes miscarriage or congenital malformations in livestock with negative economic impacts. An integrated monitoring programme aimed to deepen the epidemiological data on toxoplasmosis and to identify the risk factors that may favour T. gondii infections in animals and humans was conducted in an endemic area of southern Italy. The monitoring activities were based on the following tasks: (i) parasitological analysis and risk factors for T. gondii in livestock (sheep, goat, cattle and water buffalo) farms; (ii) serological and molecular monitoring at slaughterhouse in meat-producing livestock; (iii) analysis of hospital discharge records (HDRs); (iv) outreach activities (information, dissemination and health education) to farmers, vet practitioners and school-age children. The present study confirmed a very high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in livestock farms (e.g., up to 93.1% in sheep farms) in southern Italy and highlighted the potentially significant public health risk in this area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aProtozoa 3aToxoplasma gondii 3aabortion (animals) 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3agoats 3ahealth education 3ahospitals 3aoutreach 3aprotozoal infections 3apublic health 3aseroprevalence 3asheep 3aslaughterhouses 3atoxoplasmosis 3azoonoses 3aItaly1 aBosco, Antonio 1 aCapuano, Federico 1 aBaldi, Loredana 1 aGiordano, Angela 1 aMancusi, Andrea 1 aBuonanno, Marialuisa 1 aMorena, Luigi 1 aPinto, Renato 1 aSarnelli, Paolo 1 aCringoli, Giuseppe 1 aRinaldi, Laura 0 tAnimals.g2021 June 30, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110719493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02097naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002200112245011700134300001600251500001900267520098000286592002801266650001901294650001301313650001101326650001301337650001601350650001301366653002801379653002001407653002501427653001101452653002701463700001901490700001801509700001701527700001401544700001501558773011701573852000901690655001201699IND60723689620221122002611.0210117e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072368962DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Sukhwinder10aDevelopment and testing of a wide row ridger, inter row cultivator and digger for nucleus seed potato production  ap. 155-161.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNucleus seed potato, in traditional seed production system, is grown in two stages. In stage I indexed seed tubers are planted at 1200 x 1200 mm spacing and in stage II planting is done clone-wise in 1200 x 200 mm geometry. Traditional machines and equipment used for potato production are not suited for the crop geometry of stage I and stage II. Therefore most of the field work in these initial stages of seed potato production is carried out manually, which causes lot of human drudgery and is more time consuming. To mechanize production of potato in stage I and II, three tractor operated equipment viz. wide row ridger, inter row cultivator and a digger shaker were developed and field tested. Effective field capacity of wide row ridger, cultivator and digger was found to be 0.5 ha/h, 0.6 ha/h and 1.44 ha/day respectively. All these newly designed machines were successful in replacing the traditional machines and manual field operations except for potato picking.  aPublisher supplied data 3afield capacity 3ageometry 3ahumans 3apotatoes 3aseed tubers 3atractors 0adevelopment and testing 0awide row ridger 0ainter row cultivator 0adigger 0aseed potato production1 aParveen Kumar,1 aSingh, Manjit1 aKumar, Dhruv1 aSingh, BP1 aPandey, SK0 tPotato journal.g2011 July, v. 38, no. 2 p.155-161dThe Indian Potato AssociationwJournal:2078x0973-59097nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03332naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009100171300001600262520149300278592002801771650001101799650002301810650002901833650001701862650001401879650002101893650001801914650001601932650001701948650001301965650001901978650000901997650002202006650001502028650001102043650002102054650000902075650002302084650001802107650001302125650001302138650001802151650002002169650002402189650001502213653002602228653001302254653001702267653005202284653002502336700001902361700002502380700001702405700001702422700001802439773014302457856008502600852000902685655001202694IND60636832420221119220254.0190411e20190221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063683242DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2017.13847162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahato, Neelima10aCitrus essential oils: Extraction, authentication and application in food preservation  ap. 611-625.  aCitrus EOs is an economic, eco-friendly and natural alternatives to chemical preservatives and other synthetic antioxidants, such as sodium nitrites, nitrates or benzoates, commonly utilized in food preservation. Citrus based EOs is obtained mainly from the peels of citrus fruits which are largely discarded as wastes and cause environmental problems. The extraction of citrus oils from the waste peels not only saves environment but can be used in various applications including food preservation. The present article presents elaborated viewpoints on the nature and chemical composition of different EOs present in main citrus varieties widely grown across the globe; extraction, characterization and authentication techniques/methods of the citrus EOs; and reviews the recent advances in the application of citrus EOs for the preservation of fruits, vegetables, meat, fish and processed food stuffs. The probable reaction mechanism of the EOs based thin films formation with biodegradable polymers is presented.

In this study, effect of trichloroethylene (TCE) on community structure and activity of methanotrophs, as well as TCE degradation efficiency was investigated in waste biocover soil (WBS), which was collected from a landfill bioreactor treating organic waste, in comparison with LCS. The CH4 oxidation activity and TCE degradation rate were higher in WBS compared to those in LCS. The TCE degradation rates in both soils were enhanced with the increase of TCE concentration within 50 ppmv. Compared to LCS, the TCE inhibitory concentration that caused inhibition of CH4 oxidation activity was greater for WBS. The abundance of mmoX was similar in both soils during the whole experiment, while the average abundance of pmoA in WBS was about two orders of magnitudes higher than in LCS. Type I methanotrophs (Methylocaldum, Methylomonas, Methylosarcina and Methylobacter) and type II methanotrophs (Methylocystis) were abundant in both soils. Among them, type I methanotrophs Methylocaldum and Methylobacter dominated in WBS, while type II methanotrophs Methylocystis predominated in LCS. The relative abundance of Methylobacter increased with an increase of TCE concentration and exposure time in both soils, especially in WBS, indicating that Methylobacter seemed tolerant to TCE and/or may play an important role in the TCE degradation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMethylobacter 3aMethylocaldum 3aMethylocystis 3aMethylomonas 3aMethylosarcina 3abioreactors 3acommunity structure 3aexposure duration 3agases 3alandfills 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3aorganic wastes 3aoxidation 3asoil 3atrichloroethylene 0aCH4 oxidation 0aMethanotrophs 0aTrichloroethylene 0aLandfill gas 0aLandfill cover soil1 aBai, Yun1 aSu, Yao1 aYao, Yijun1 aHe, Ruo0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 78 p.118-127dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245015300163300001600316520174700332592002802079650001502107650001502122650002202137650001202159650002002171650001502191650001502206650002402221650002202245650001402267650002302281650001002304650001602314700001402330700001502344700001502359700001502374700002002389700001502409773011702424856008102541852000902622655001202631IND60441819220221120173039.0151027e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044181922DNAL7 a10.1007/s10653-015-9709-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPark, J. H.10aEvaluation of phosphorus adsorption capacity of sesame straw biochar on aqueous solution: influence of activation methods and pyrolysis temperatures  ap. 969-983.  aThe phosphorus (P) adsorption characteristic of sesame straw biochar prepared with different activation agents and pyrolysis temperatures was evaluated. Between 0.109 and 0.300 mg L⁻¹ in the form of inorganic phosphate was released from raw sesame straw biochar in the first 1 h. The release of phosphate was significantly enhanced from 62.6 to 168.2 mg g⁻¹ as the pyrolysis temperature increased. Therefore, sesame straw biochar cannot be used as an adsorbent for P removal without change in the physicochemical characteristics. To increase the P adsorption of biochar in aqueous solution, various activation agents and pyrolysis temperatures were applied. The amount of P adsorbed from aqueous solution by biochar activated using different activation agents appeared in the order ZnCl₂ (9.675 mg g⁻¹) > MgO (8.669 mg g⁻¹) ⋙ 0.1N-HCl > 0.1N-H₂SO₄ > K₂SO₄ ≥ KOH ≥ 0.1N-H₃PO₄, showing ZnCl₂ to be the optimum activation agent. Higher P was adsorbed by the biochar activated using ZnCl₂ under different pyrolysis temperatures in the order 600 °C > 500 °C > 400 °C > 300 °C. Finally, the amount of adsorbed P by activated biochar at different ratios of biochar to ZnCl₂ appeared in the order 1:3 ≒ 1:1 > 3:1. As a result, the optimum ratio of biochar to ZnCl₂ and pyrolysis temperature were found to be 1:1 and 600 °C for P adsorption, respectively. The maximum P adsorption capacity by activated biochar using ZnCl₂ (15,460 mg kg⁻¹) was higher than that of typical biochar, as determined by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. Therefore, the ZnCl₂ activation of sesame straw biochar was suitable for the preparation of activated biochar for P adsorption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3aaqueous solutions 3abiochar 3amagnesium oxide 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apotassium hydroxide 3apotassium sulfate 3apyrolysis 3asorption isotherms 3astraw 3atemperature1 aOk, Y.

Tyrosinase is the most prominent target for inhibitors of melanin production. In this study, we investigated whether arbutin and its prodrug, arbutin undecylenic acid ester, might inhibit phenoloxidase (PO), a tyrosinase-like enzyme. Molecular docking simulation results suggested that arbutin and arbutin undecylenic acid ester can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of PO. Arbutin undecylenic acid ester with an IC₅₀ 6.34 mM was effective to inhibit PO compared to arbutin (IC₅₀ 29.42 mM). In addition, arbutin undecylenic acid ester showed low cytotoxicity in Drosophila S2 cells and the compound inhibited the melanization reaction. Therefore, the results of this study have demonstrated that arbutin undecylenic acid ester as a potential inhibitor of PO. We successfully designed a new platform utilizing Drosophila melanogaster and Bombyx mori as animal models propounding fast, cheap, and high effectiveness in method to screen tyrosinase inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBombyx mori 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aanimals 3acytotoxicity 3ahyperpigmentation 3amelanin 3amelanization 3amonophenol monooxygenase 3aresearch 3askin neoplasms 0aArbutin 0aDrosophila 0aPhenoloxidase 0aTyrosinase inhibitor1 aSalim, Emil1 aAsri, Rangga Meidianto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6962-54181 aNainu, Firzan1 aHori, Aki1 aYulianty, Risfah1 aHatta, Mochammad1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8456-42031 aRifai, Yusnita1 aKuraishi, Takayuki1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9493-60820 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2021 Apr. 02, v. 547 p.75-81dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2021.02.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03405naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245012100171520192400292592002802216650000802244650002002252650001102272650002402283650002302307650001002330650002202340650001402362650002202376650001502398650001102413650002302424650002502447650001102472651001002483653002102493653000802514653002602522653002002548653002702568653002302595700001502618700001702633700001702650700001602667773011902683856008802802852000902890655001202899IND60727068420221123025345.0220103e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072706842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Qingling10aDeclined trend in herbaceous plant green-up dates on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau caused by spring warming slowdown  aThere has been much debate on the temporal change trend and existence of a turning point in spring green-up date (GUD) of plants on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Most previous studies on the QTP used remote sensing data, which have large uncertainties. In this study, using a large amount of long-term ground observation data at 27 phenological stations across the QTP (1694 GUD records), we showed that on the whole, QTP herbaceous plant GUD insignificantly advanced during 1982–2017. Although the direction of the GUD trend did not change from 1982 to 2017, the magnitude of the advancing trend greatly weakened after 1999. According to our estimated results from 28 paired GUD time series, the overall GUD trend shifted from −2.70 days/decade during 1982–1999 to −0.56 days/decade during 2000–2017. This finding contrasts with the conclusions of previous satellite-based studies, which either reported a continuous significant advancement of GUD or a turning point in the mid-to-late 1990s. Through partial correlation analysis and partial least squares regression, we found that winter and spring air temperatures were the primary climatic factors that influenced the temporal change in GUD, and both had negative effects on GUD. The decreased GUD trend was mainly attributable to the warming slowdown in spring. On average, the spring warming rate decreased by 52.43% after 1999, whereas the winter warming rate displayed no obvious change. This study also found that the GUD of forbs showed stronger sensitivity to air temperature change than that of sedges and grasses. This indicates that forbs are more competitive in adaptation to climate warming, which might shift plant community structure and affect ecosystem service function. Moreover, the declined advancement in GUD implies that the spring phenologically driven increase in carbon uptake may have also slowed in the past two decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair temperature 3acarbon 3acommunity structure 3aecosystem services 3aforbs 3aherbaceous plants 3aphenology 3aplant communities 3asatellites 3aspring 3atemporal variation 3atime series analysis 3awinter 3aChina 0aSpring phenology 0aGUD 0aTemporal change trend 0aClimate warming 0aPlant functional group 0aGround observation1 aLi, Baolin1 aJiang, Yuhao1 aChen, Xiuzhi1 aZhou, Guoyi0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 10, v. 772 p.145039-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02400naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245010600171300001600277520102200293592002801315650002401343650001801367650001801385650001601403650002501419650002501444650002701469650001301496653003001509653002501539653001801564653001601582653002501598653002701623700002201650700002101672700001701693700001901710773014301729856008501872852000901957655001201966IND60636832620221119220346.0190411e20190221xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063683262DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2017.13861582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuerin, Justine10aMilk fat globule membrane glycoproteins: Valuable ingredients for lactic acid bacteria encapsulation?  ap. 639-651.  aThe membrane (Milk Fat Globule Membrane – MFGM) surrounding the milk fat globule is becoming increasingly studied for its use in food applications due to proven nutritional and technological properties.

The nutritional, health benefits and techno-functional properties of the MFGM are then discussed. Finally, new techno-functional opportunities of MFGM glycoproteins as a possible ingredient for Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) encapsulation are detailed. The ability of MFGM to form liposomes entrapping bioactive compounds has been already demonstrated. One drawback is that liposomes are too small to be used for bacteria encapsulation.

Root exudates, which represent a growth regulator in peanut–soil feedback processes, play a principal role in soil sickness. The growth inhibition of a species in an in vitro bioassay enriched with root exudates and allelochemicals is commonly viewed as evidence of an allelopathic interaction. However, for some of these putative examples of allelopathy, the results have not been verified in more natural settings with plants continuously growing in soil. In this study, the phenolic acids in peanut root exudates, their retention characteristics in an Udic Ferrosol, and their effects on rhizosphere soil microbial communities and peanut seedling growth were studied. Phenolic acids from peanut root exudates were quickly metabolized by soil microorganisms and did not accumulate to high levels. The peanut root exudates selectively inhibited or stimulated certain communal bacterial and fungal species, with decreases in the relative abundance of the bacterial taxa Gelria glutamica, Mitsuaria chitosanitabida, and Burkholderia soli and the fungal taxa Mortierella sp. and Geminibasidium hirsutum and increases in the relative abundance of the bacterial taxon Desulfotomaculum ruminis and the fungal taxa Fusarium oxysporum, Bionectria ochroleuca and Phoma macrostoma. The experimental application of phenolic acids to non-sterile and sterile soil revealed that the poor performance of the peanut plants was attributed to changes in the soil microbial communities promoted by phenolic acids. These results suggest that pathogenic fungal accumulation at the expense of such beneficial microorganisms as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, mycorrhizal fungi induced by root exudates, rather than direct autotoxicity induced by root exudates, might represent the principal cause underlying the soil sickness associated with peanut plants. We hope that our study will motivate researchers to integrate the role of soil microbial communities in allelopathic research, such that their observed significance in soil sickness during continuous monocropping of fields can be further explored.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBurkholderia 3aClonostachys rosea 3aDesulfotomaculum ruminis 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aMitsuaria chitosanitabida 3aMortierella 3aPhoma 3aallelochemicals 3aallelopathy 3abeneficial microorganisms 3abioassays 3acontinuous cropping 3acrop yield 3agrowth regulators 3agrowth retardation 3amycorrhizal fungi 3apeanuts 3aphenolic acids 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3arhizosphere 3aroot exudates 3aseedling growth 3asoil 3asoil sickness 3asubtropics 3aChina 0aPeanut root exudates 0aPhenolic acids 0aSoil microbial community 0aSoil sickness 0aAllelopathic effects1 aDing, Chang-feng1 aHua, Ke1 aZhang, Tao-lin1 aZhang, Ya-nan1 aZhao, Ling1 aYang, Yi-ru1 aLiu, Jin-guang1 aWang, Xing-xiang0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 78 p.149-159dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02679naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100003500141245009900176520119700275592002801472650001601500650001201516650001301528650001401541650001201555650001301567650001301580650002201593650002701615650001601642650001801658700003701676700002601713700002801739700002801767700003601795700003701831700003201868700003001900700002701930700002601957700002201983773012002005856007502125852000902200655001202209IND60745344320221120164407.0210723e20210630xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074534432DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110719602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveira, Rodrigo Fortunato de10aEffect of Aging on the Quality of Breast Meat from Broilers Affected by Wooden Breast Myopathy  aThis study aimed to evaluate the effects of aging on the quality of breast meat from broilers affected of wooden breast. Samples that were classified as normal (control), moderate (hardness verified only in one region of breast fillet), and severe (hardness verified in all the extension of breast fillet) were evaluated fresh and after three and seven days of aging. Normal samples and samples with a moderate degree of myopathy showed greater water-holding capacity, which may benefit the processing industry of poultry meat. During the aging process, increase was observed in total collagen concentration (from 0.41% in normal samples to 0.56% in samples with severe degree). Samples of chicken breast affected by moderate degree showed higher myofibril fragmentation index (MFI = 115) than normal chicken samples (95.65). Although chicken samples affected with severe degree of wooden breast myopathy are more tender than normal chicken breasts, they produce more exudate, which can be detrimental to the processing of poultry meat. The aging process may improve the reduction of cooking weight loss and protein loss in exudation of broilers’ breasts affected by wooden breast myopathy.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreast meat 3abreasts 3acollagen 3aexudation 3afillets 3ahardness 3aindustry 3aprotein depletion 3awater holding capacity 3aweight loss 3awooden breast1 aMello, Juliana Lolli Malagoli de1 aFerrari, Fábio Borba1 aSouza, Rodrigo Alves de1 aPereira, Mateus Roberto1 aCavalcanti, Erika Nayara Freire1 aVillegas-Cayllahua, Erick Alonso1 aFidelis, Heloisa de Almeida1 aGiampietro-Ganeco, Aline 1 aFávero, Maísa Santos1 aSouza, Pedro Alves de1 aBorba, Hirasilva 0 tAnimals.g2021 June 30, v. 11, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110719603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02340naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100001900166245010200185300001400287520135600301592002801657653001801685653000901703653001501712653001901727653001601746700002001762700001901782773011401801856011401915852000902029655001202038IND60124271620221120070220.0151025e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012427162DNAL7 a10.3377/1562-7020(2006)41[51:EOBAOI]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUys, Charmaine10aEffect of burn area on invertebrate recolonization in grasslands in the Drakensberg, South Africa  ap. 51-65.  aOur study examined the short-term response of grassland invertebrate communities to fire in the South African Drakensberg, in relation to distance from the edge of a burn. We aimed to establish which species survive fire and the dynamics of the post-fire recolonization process, and thereby contribute to establishing the ideal area of a prescribed burn for invertebrate conservation. Four transects were sampled two and 12 weeks after burning. Along each transect one unburnt control and four burnt sites were quantitatively sampled. Richness, abundance and diversity were calculated for each site and canonical correspondence analysis was applied to transect and morphospecies counts to determine the impact of distance from the edge of the burn on community structure. Distance from burn edge affected invertebrate richness and abundance, especially for flying insects. Burning appeared to minimally impact on wingless invertebrates, suggesting they tolerated fire by finding refuge. Invertebrate community structure changed with increasing distance from burn edge two weeks, but not 12 weeks post-burn. A distance of 280 m from burn edge appears to allow sufficient recolonization to maintain invertebrate diversity. Taxa found in the unburnt control and site closest to the edge in burnt grassland may be fire sensitive and require further study.  aPublisher supplied data 0ainvertebrates 0afire 0agrasslands 0arecolonization 0aDrakensberg1 aHamer, Michelle1 aSlotow, Robert0 tAfrican zoology.g2006 Apr., v. 41, no. 1 p.51-65dThe Zoological Society of Southern Africax1562-70207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3377%2F1562-7020%282006%2941%5B51%3AEOBAOI%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03948naa a2200769 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245019500187300001400382500001500396520136700411592002801778650003701806650001101843650001501854650001401869650002701883650002601910650002201936650002601958650002801984650002302012650001102035650002402046650000902070650001202079650001302091650002602104650001202130650001302142650001302155650001002168650001802178650002502196650001202221650006002233650003702293650004102330650004102371650002802412650005702440650002802497650005502525650002402580650001402604650004602618650006502664650006602729650006502795650003402860650002902894650002702923650000902950650001402959653001802973700001902991700001603010773008303026856004803109852000903157655001203166IND50061885220221118235720.0130320e201301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006188522DNAL7 a226483722pmid7 a10.1007/s00572-012-0447-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Rakshapal10aSynergy between Glomus fasciculatum and a beneficial Pseudomonas in reducing root diseases and improving yield and forskolin content in Coleus forskohlii Briq. under organic field conditions  ap. 35-44.  a2019-12-06  aRoot rot and wilt, caused by a complex involving Fusarium chlamydosporum (Frag. and Cif.) and Ralstonia solanacearum (Smith), are serious diseases affecting the cultivation of Coleus forskohlii, a crop with economic potential as a source of the medicinal compound forskolin. The present 2-year field experiments were conducted with two bioinoculants (a native Pseudomonas monteilii strain and the exotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus fasciculatum) alone and in combination under organic field conditions in order to evaluate their potential in controlling root rot and wilt. Combined inoculation of P. monteilii with G. fasciculatum significantly increased plant height, plant spread, and number of branches; reduced disease incidence; and increased tuber dry mass of C. forskohlii, compared to vermicompost controls not receiving any bioinoculants. Increase in tuber yields was accompanied by an increase in plant N, P, and K uptake. Co-inoculation of P. monteilii with G. fasciculatum significantly improved the percent AM root colonization and spore numbers retrieved from soil. This suggests P. monteilii to be a mycorrhiza helper bacterium which could be useful in organic agriculture. The forskolin content of tubers was significantly increased by the inoculation treatments of P. monteilii, G. fasciculatum, and P. monteilii + G. fasciculatum.  aPublisher supplied data 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3atubers 3acrop yield 3aforskolin 3aRalstonia solanacearum 3afield experimentation 3adisease incidence 3aPseudomonas monteilii 3aFusarium chlamydosporum 3aorganic production 3aspores 3aGlomus fasciculatum 3asoil 3arooting 3abranches 3aPlectranthus barbatus 3awilting 3aroot rot 3abacteria 3afungi 2aBase Sequence 2aBiological Transport 2aBiomass 2aColeusxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aColforsinxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aDNA, Bacterialxchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA, Ribosomalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aFusariumxpathogenicity 2aGlomeromycotaxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycorrhizaexisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aOrganic Agriculture 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPseudomonasxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aRalstoniaxpathogenicity 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil 2aSymbiosis 0aroot diseases1 aSoni, Sumit K.1 aKalra, Alok0 tMycorrhiza.g2013 Jan., v. 23, no. 1 p.35-44dSpringer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-012-0447-x  aDNAL 7aarticle03841naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002100159245010700180300001600287500000900303520168900312592002802001650001502029650001902044650002202063650002102085650001502106650001202121650001602133650002102149650001502170650002102185650001302206650001602219650001902235650002102254650001602275650001502291650001802306650001502324650001602339650003402355650001402389650001602403650003502419650002402454650005802478650005802536650000902594650001002603650002002613650004202633650001702675651001102692700002002703700001702723700001702740700001902757700001302776700001702789700001602806700001902822773019202841852000903033856007703042655001203119IND4463513720221120234504.0191028e200301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446351372DNAL7 a125495552pmid7 a10.2134/jeq2003.16202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWigington, P. J.10aNitrate Removal Effectiveness of a Riparian Buffer along a Small Agricultural Stream in Western Oregon  ap. 162-170.  aepub  aThe Willamette Valley of Oregon has extensive areas of poorly drained, commercial grass seed lands. Little is know about the ability of riparian areas in these settings to reduce nitrate in water draining from grass seed fields. We established two study sites with similar soils and hydrology but contrasting riparian vegetation along an intermittent stream that drains perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) fields in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. We installed a series of nested piezometers along three transects at each site to examine NO₃–N in shallow ground water in grass seed fields and riparian areas. Results showed that a noncultivated riparian zone comprised of grasses and herbaceous vegetation significantly reduced NO₃–N concentrations of shallow ground water moving from grass seed fields. Darcy's law–based estimates of shallow ground water flow through riparian zone A/E horizons revealed that this water flowpath could account for only a very small percentage of the streamflow. Even though there is great potential for NO₃–N to be reduced as water moves through the noncultivated riparian zone with grass–herbaceous vegetation, the potential was not fully realized because only a small proportion of the stream flow interacts with riparian zone soils. Consequently, effective NO₃–N water quality management in poorly drained landscapes similar to the study watershed is primarily dependent on implementation of sound agricultural practices within grass seed fields and is less influenced by riparian zone vegetation. Wise fertilizer application rates and timing are key management tools to reduce export of NO₃–N in stream waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aE horizons 3aLolium perenne 3aephemeral streams 3afertilizer rates 3agrass seed 3agrasses 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3alandscapes 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3apiezometers 3ariparian areas 3ariparian buffers 3astream flow 3avegetation 3awater quality 3awatersheds 2aAgriculture 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aEcosystem 2aFertilizers 2aLoliumxchemistryxphysiology. 2aModels, Theoretical 2aNitratesxisolation & purificationxpharmacokinetics. 2aNitrogenxisolation & purificationxpharmacokinetics. 2aRain 2aTrees 2aWater Movements 2aWater Pollutionxprevention & control 2aWater Supply 3aOregon1 aGriffith, S.

The adsorption test showed that the chlorpyrifos adsorptive power for the AS soil containing high organic matter content was greater than that for the GW soil. The extent of the time-dependent removal of chlorpyrifos in the tested soils was not significantly different except at 90 days after the treatment. The availability of a chemical-specific residue model developed in this study was statistically assessed to estimate the chlorpyrifos residue in soil solutions that could be absorbed into plants. The values modeled using the soil experimental data were satisfactory, having a mean deviation of 32 % from the measured data. The correlation between the modeled and measured data was acceptable, with mean coefficients of correlation (R ²) of 0.89. Furthermore, the average of the residual error was low at 0.43, which corresponded to a mean factor of −1.9. The developed model could be used as a critical tool to predict the subsequent plant uptake of chlorpyrifos.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achlorpyrifos 3acorrelation 3aedaphic factors 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3asoil 3asolutions1 aLee, Sung-Eun1 aKim, Jang-Eok0 tEnvironmental geochemistry and health.g2015 Dec., v. 37, no. 6 p.1017-1027dSpringer Netherlandsx0269-40427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10653-015-9721-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01525naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005400094040001800148100002200166245011300188300001400301520051500315592002800830653002100858653002500879653002300904653002500927700002600952700002000978773011400998856011401112852000901226655001201235IND60124271720221120070121.0151025e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012427172DNAL7 a10.3377/1562-7020(2006)41[67:AORITS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Merwe, M.10aAspects of reproduction in the seasonally breeding African yellow bat, Scotophilus dinganii (A.

A context-dependent stated choice experiment  aVehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology could turn electric vehicles (EVs) into a potentially valuable solution to the problem of increased load demand caused by large-scale EV integration. Successful market penetration of V2G relies not only on developing the technology itself, but also on EV drivers' willingness to participate in this technology. This paper aims to explore Dutch EV drivers' preferences for participating in V2G contracts. In particular, we conduct a context-dependent stated choice experiment to examine the impact of EV recharging technology on the V2G contract preferences. Two contexts have been designed: the current EV recharging time and fast recharging. Our results show that in the context of current recharging time, Dutch EV drivers in general prefer not to participate in V2G contracts, while the opposite is true in the context of fast recharging. With regard to specific V2G contract attributes, Dutch EV drivers are most concerned about ‘discharging cycles’. Also important to them is ‘the guaranteed minimum battery level’, but its importance drops significantly in the fast charging context. In addition, ‘monthly remuneration’ and ‘plug-in time’ also influence people's preferences for adopting V2G. From these findings, we draw the implications for the aggregator and policy makers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abatteries 3aelectric vehicles 3aenergy policy 3amarkets 3apeople 0aVehicle-to-grid 0aDutch EV drivers' preference 0aContext-dependent stated choice experiment 0aRecharging time1 aMeijssen, Aart Gerard1 aAnnema, Jan Anne1 aLukszo, Zofia0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Sept., v. 156 p.112410-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1124103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01826naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245011500174300001600289520081700305592002801122653002101150653003101171653001501202653002001217653002501237700002201262700001901284700002401303773009401327856008201421852000901503655001201512IND60596226720221120081622.0180615e20160816xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059622672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.poly.2015.11.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcGarry, Katherine R.10aSynthesis and characterization of (π-allyl)palladium(II) complexes containing dialkylbiaryl phosphine ligands  ap. 101-109.  aNeutral (π-allyl)palladium(II) halide complexes, which are air and moisture tolerant, containing dialkylbiaryl (alkyl=cyclohexyl or t-butyl) phosphine ligands, have been synthesized and characterized by ¹H, ³¹P, ¹³C NMR spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and elemental analysis.

In this study, a novel gene BpRAV1 was cloned from white birch (Betula platyphylla). BpRAV1 protein is localized in the nucleus and serves as a transcriptional activator. The expression of BpRAV1 was induced by salt and osmotic stress treatments. BpRAV1-overexpression birch seedlings exhibited dramatically less ROS accumulation and reduced cell death in response to salt and osmotic stresses. BpRAV1 can specifically bind to the known RAV1A element. In addition, a novel cis-acting element (termed RBS1) bound by BpRAV1 was identified by transcription factor (TF)- centered Y1H assay. BpRAV1 activated the RAV1A and RBS1 elements to induce the expression of SOD and POD genes, resulting in increased SOD and POD activities to enhance ROS scavenging ability, thus improving salt and osmotic stress tolerance. These results indicate that BpRAV1 is a positive regulator governing abiotic stress response.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBetula pendula subsp. mandshurica 3acell death 3agenes 3aosmotic stress 3aplant response 3aregulatory sequences 3astress response 3astress tolerance 3atransactivators 0aBpRAV1 0aCis-acting elements 0aGene expression 0aROS scavenging 0aAbiotic stress response1 aZhang, Kaimin1 aYang, Chuanping0 tPlant science.g2022 Feb., v. 315 p.111131-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl38764x0168-94527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.1111313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02134naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001900149245009100168520109800259592002801357650002001385650001601405650001101421650001801432650001101450650001201461653002701473653002301500653001601523653002401539653001301563700002001576773009501596856008401691852000901775655001201784IND60742239320221118070958.0211213e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074223932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1124122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYunusov, Timur10aDistributional effects of Time of Use tariffs based on electricity demand and time use  aThe introduction of Time of Use (ToU) tariffs may affect residential electricity consumers differently depending not only on their financial position but also time availability. The aim of this paper is to identify socio-demographic groups which may be financially advantaged or disadvantaged by the introduction of ToU tariffs. Assuming no behavioural change, we impose ToU tariffs on UK half hourly smart meter data and the synthetic demand profiles for different household composition generated using the 2014–2015 UK Time Use Survey data and optimisation of energy consumption per activity against the smart meter data. The distributional effects of ToU tariffs are obtained for customer segmentation and socio-demographic groups, and presented in terms of peak to off-peak ratios and impacts on the synthetic demand profiles. Findings on the distributional effects of ToU tariffs reveal regional differences (e.g. positive effects for high income groups in London) and household composition similarities (e.g. positive effects for households with children not in the high-income group).  aPublisher supplied data 3abehavior change 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy policy 3aincome 3asurveys 0aDistributional effects 0aElectricity demand 0aFlexibility 0aTime of use tariffs 0aTime use1 aTorriti, Jacopo0 tEnergy policy.g2021 Sept., v. 156 p.112412-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12439x0301-42157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enpol.2021.1124123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245012400173300001400297520203100311592002802342650002202370650002402392650002302416650001802439650001102457650002402468650001402492650001802506650001202524650001102536650001802547650001902565650001202584650001202596650002302608650001102631650001802642650001002660653001802670653002202688653001502710653001802725653001402743700001102757700001702768700001602785700001302801700001902814773009602833856009002929852000903019655001203028IND60636609220221116213356.0200106e20190530xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063660922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXu, Hongqiang10aFertilization, survival and growth of reciprocal crosses between two oysters, Crassostrea gigas and Crassostrea nippona  ap. 91-96.  aCrassostrea nippnoa is a potential aquaculture species because of its unique flavor, delicious taste and edibility during the summer, while C. gigas is a major global aquaculture species due to the fast growth rate, high disease resistance and strong environmental adaptability. This study firstly described the reciprocal hybridization between the two oyster species, and four crosses were produced: C. gigas ♀ × C. gigas ♂ (GG), C. gigas ♀ × C. nippona ♂ (GN), C. nippona ♀ × C. gigas ♂ (NG) and C. nippona ♀ × C. nippona ♂ (NN). The embryonic development of reciprocal crosses was similar to that of the pure crosses. However, fertilization rates were obviously different between the reciprocal hybrids and parental species, where the fertilization rates of reciprocal hybrids were significantly lower than those of parental species. At larval stages, the survival rates of the hybrid cohorts were significantly lower than those of inbred cohorts, and the critical stage of reciprocal hybrids where highest mortality occurred was the umbo period. The growth rate of GN progeny was not different from the inbred cohorts, while the growth rate of the NG progeny was higher than that of inbred cohorts. Furthermore, both hybrid cohorts had normal metamorphosis and produced viable spats. During the spat stage, the survival rates of reciprocal hybrids were not different from that of GG spat but were much higher than that of the NN spat. The growth rates of reciprocal hybrids were comparable to that of GG spat but significantly higher than that of NN spat. The shell height of the reciprocal crosses GN and NG were increased by 46.66% and 60.75% compared with the NN cross at day 360, respectively. The reciprocal hybrids had significant survival advantage and growth heterosis compared to NN cohort. The results demonstrated that the cross NG was deemed to be the better hybridization combination for genetic improvement, which could have a potential utilization for oyster aquaculture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aCrassostrea nippona 3adisease resistance 3aembryogenesis 3aflavor 3agenetic improvement 3aheterosis 3ahybridization 3ahybrids 3alarvae 3ametamorphosis 3aoyster culture 3aoysters 3aprogeny 3areciprocal crosses 3asummer 3asurvival rate 3ataste 0aHybridization 0aCrassostrea gigas 0aC. nippona 0aFertilization 0aHeterosis1 aLi, Qi1 aHan, Ziqiang1 aLiu, Shikai1 aYu, Hong1 aKong, Lingfeng0 tAquaculture.g2019 May 30, v. 507 p.91-96dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03055naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111024002100141040001800162072000900180072000900189072000900198100001700207245014100224300001800365500002400383520101500407650001901422650002001441650002501461650002001486650001701506650001601523650003201539650002301571650001101594650002301605650001401628650001301642650001401655650001201669650001401681650000901695650001201704650001401716650002101730650001101751650001401762650000901776650001001785650001701795650005801812650002601870650001701896653002801913700002301941773012001964852000902084856011202093856008002205930003302285945002502318946001302343961001302356655001202369IND4427347720221118120945.0091015e200910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442734772DNAL7 a198252922pmid7 a10.1603/022.038.05052doi7 a10113/372232hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL500 0aL0011 aTaylor, R.M.10aHow Dietary Plant Nectar Affects the Survival, Growth, and Fecundity of a Cursorial Spider Cheiracanthium inclusum (Araneae: Miturgidae)  ap. 1379-1386.  aIncludes references  aWe measured the effects of plant nectar consumption on Cheiracanthium inclusum (Hentz) (Miturgidae), an agriculturally important spider. Newly emerged spiderlings were reared on the eggs of Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) at four prey densities, 1, 5, 25, or 125 eggs, three times a week, with or without nectar. Nectar came from the extrafloral nectaries of Indian almond, Terminalia cattapa L. (Combretaceae). The addition of nectar to prey (1) allowed spiderlings on the 1-egg diet to survive longer and molt many more times; (2) allowed virtually all of the spiderlings on the 5-egg diet to become small adults and 50% to mate and reproduce versus those without nectar, none of which matured to adulthood; and (3) increased fecundity of females on 5-egg and 25-egg diets to the level of females fed five times the amount of prey. These results show that spiders that feed on nectar increase their fitness with increased survival, growth, and fecundity, particularly when density of prey is inadequate or marginal. 3aCheiracanthium 3anatural enemies 3apredatory arthropods 3aHelicoverpa zea 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3apredator-prey relationships 3apopulation density 3anectar 3aTerminalia catappa 3anectaries 3aforaging 3amortality 3amolting 3afecundity 3adiet 2aAnimals 2aBody Size 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aFertility 2aMale 2aMoths 2aPlant Nectar 2aSpidersxanatomy & histologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aTerminaliaxchemistry 2aTime Factors 0aCheiracanthium inclusum1 aPfannenstiel, R.S.0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2009 Oct., v.  38, no.  5 p.1379-1386dEntomological Society of Americax0046-225X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/372233Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/022.038.05053Available from publisher's Web site  a20100107b20100205c00000000  aINDd2CTe2009/12/16  aOther US  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02949naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245019300167300001800360520106100378592002801439650002501467650003101492650002001523650002501543650002301568650001701591650002001608650001701628650001301645650001701658650003201675650001901707650001801726650001301744650001801757650001701775650001701792650002501809650003201834700002501866700002301891700002301914700001901937700001801956700001901974700001901993700001702012700002202029700002602051700002002077700001802097773011802115856008202233990002302315852000902338655001202347IND60090982620221120113641.0141103e20111215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009098262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.09.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKiem, Phan Van10aChemical constituents of the rhizomes of Hedychium coronarium and their inhibitory effect on the pro-inflammatory cytokines production LPS-stimulated in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells  ap. 7460-7465.  aThe rhizomes of Hedychium coronarium have been used for the treatment of inflammation, skin diseases, headache, and sharp pain due to rheumatism in traditional medicine. From this plant, three new labdane-type diterpenes 1–3, named coronarins G–I as well as seven known 4–10, coronarin D, coronarin D methyl ether, hedyforrestin C, (E)-nerolidol, β-sitosterol, daucosterol, and stigmasterol were isolated.

They were evaluated for inhibitory effects on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. Among of them, compounds 1, 2, and 6 were significant inhibitors of LPS-stimulated TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12 p40 productions with IC₅₀ ranging from 0.19±0.11 to 10.38±2.34μM. The remains of compounds showed inactivity or due to cytotoxicity. These results warrant further studies concerning the potential anti-inflammatory benefits of labdane-type diterpenes from H. coronarium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHedychium coronarium 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3abeta-sitosterol 3achemical composition 3achemical structure 3acytotoxicity 3adendritic cells 3aditerpenoids 3aheadache 3ainflammation 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3ainterleukin-12 3ainterleukin-6 3arhizomes 3askin diseases 3aspectroscopy 3astigmasterol 3atraditional medicine 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aThuy, Nguyen Thi Kim1 aAnh, Hoang Le Tuan1 aNhiem, Nguyen Xuan1 aMinh, Chau Van1 aYen, Pham Hai1 aBan, Ninh Khac1 aHang, Dan Thuy1 aTai, Bui Huu1 aTuyen, Nguyen Van1 aMathema, Vivek Bhakta1 aKoh, Young-Sang1 aKim, Young Ho0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 21, no. 24 p.7460-7465dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.09.1293Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001200147245008100159300001600240520130700256592002801563650002501591650001501616650001001631650001801641650001201659650001101671650001101682650001801693650001501711650001601726700001801742700002201760773009701782856008101879990002301960852000901983655001201992IND60093517520221119100328.0141103e20131218xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009351752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ces.2013.09.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Lu10aHeterogeneous modeling of chemical-looping combustion. Part 1: Reactor model  ap. 233-249.  aHeterogeneous modeling is used to investigate the significance of intraparticle diffusion, temperature fluctuations, and dispersion on predicting fixed-bed chemical-looping combustion (CLC) reactors. The model is validated against chemical-looping reduction experiments from the literature that utilize methane as fuel and a Ni-based oxygen carrier. The effect of particle size on CLC reduction reactions is studied by examination of the Weisz–Prater and Mears criteria for internal and external mass transfer limitations. Homogeneous and heterogeneous models are applied for two particle sizes and it is shown that diffusion limitations are significant for the larger particle. Furthermore, non-ideal flow patterns are evaluated, where superior predictions are obtained by considering the effects of dispersion and convection. Radial dispersion in each experiment is analyzed in detail and the predicted temperature fluctuations inside the reactor and particle are presented. Lastly, the heterogeneous model is applied to design a particle that maximizes chemical-looping efficiency, measured as fuel conversion and product selectivity. Enhancements to the overall reaction rate and temperature profile are observed for the optimal particle size as a result of reducing the intraparticle resistance.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical engineering 3acombustion 3afuels 3amass transfer 3amethane 3amodels 3aoxygen 3aparticle size 3aprediction 3atemperature1 aZhou, Zhiquan1 aBollas, George M.0 tChemical engineering science.g2013 Dec. 18, v. 104 p.233-249dElsevier Ltdx0009-25097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ces.2013.09.0213Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03034naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002700151245012600178300001600304520151000320592002801830650002301858650001601881650001401897650002501911650003001936650001801966650001401984650001801998650002202016650001102038650000902049650001002058650003002068651001002098651001102108651001802119653002602137653003002163653001802193653001602211653003002227653001702257700002102274700002502295773011302320856008602433852000902519655001202528IND60583972520221119203135.0180831e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058397252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengtsson-Palme, Johan10aCan branding and price of pharmaceuticals guide informed choices towards improved pollution control during manufacturing?  ap. 137-146.  aPharmaceutical manufacturing can lead to substantial discharges of active pharmaceutical ingredients into the environment, with local consequences to the environment and, in the case of antibiotics, potentially global implications in terms of increasing risks for resistance development. In this study, we used Swedish sales data for pharmaceuticals combined with data on the origin of the active ingredients to determine if price pressure and generic substitution are related to the estimated general environmental performance and the perceived corruption levels of the production countries. In line with the general perception, India was the largest producer of generics, while Europe and the USA dominated for branded products. We found that the price and environmental performance index of the production countries were linked, but that this relationship was largely explained by whether the product was original or generic. Although this relationship would allow buyers to select products that are more likely to originate from countries that, in general terms, have better pollution control, it lacks resolution. We conclude that to better allow consumers, hospitals and pharmacies to influence the environmental impact of their product choices, there is need for regulation as well as transparency in the production chain. To this end, emissions from manufacturing need to be measured, allowing for control and follow-up on industry commitments towards sustainable manufacturing of pharmaceuticals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aantibiotics 3aemissions 3aenvironmental impact 3aenvironmental performance 3ageneric drugs 3ahospitals 3amanufacturing 3apollution control 3aprices 3arisk 3asales 3asustainable manufacturing 3aIndia 3aSweden 3aUnited States 0aAntibiotic resistance 0aEnvironmental performance 0aGeneric drugs 0aOutsourcing 0aPharmaceutical production 0aTransparency1 aGunnarsson, Lina1 aLarsson, D.G.

The two biologically active compounds, namely, kojic acid and trolox, were conjugated via an ester bond as they are expected to behave synergistically. The antioxidant activity and the tyrosinase inhibitory activity of this novel kojic acid derivative on melanogenesis were evaluated. Compound 3a exhibited potent tyrosinase inhibitory activity and radical scavenging activity. Limited structure–activity relationship (SAR) investigations indicated that the tyrosinase inhibitory activities may originate from the kojic acid moiety, and the radical scavenging activity may be due to the phenolic hydroxyl group of trolox. Compound 3a also exhibited potent depigmenting activity in a cell-based assay. The limited SAR investigations revealed that the depigmenting activity of 3a may be due to the synergistic activities of kojic acid and its trolox moiety.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3afree radical scavengers 3akojic acid 3amelanogenesis 3astructure-activity relationships1 aRho, Ho Sik1 aBaek, Heung Soo1 aJoo, Yung Hyup1 aHong, Yong Deog1 aShin, Song Seok1 aPak, Yŏng-ho,1 aPark, Soo Nam0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters.g2011 Dec. 15, v. 21, no. 24 p.7466-7469dElsevier Ltdx0960-894X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.09.1223Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02742naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003500147245010100182300001400283520128300297592002801580650002501608650001301633650001001646650001201656650000901668650001801677650001101695650001601706650001301722650001101735650002201746650002101768650000901789650001401798650000901812650001601821650001301837650002901850650002601879700002901905700002101934700003001955700002801985700002702013700003302040773009402073856004802167852000902215655001202224IND50063370420221118043241.0130324e201303  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006337042DNAL7 a10.1007/s12042-013-9117-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ados Santos, Railson Schreinert10aTranscriptional Regulation of Seven ERFs in Rice Under Oxygen Depletion and Iron Overload Stress  ap. 16-25.  aSubmergence can affect plant development due to the stress of oxygen depletion. Another consequence of submergence is toxicity to plants by an excess soluble iron when the soil is under anaerobic conditions. Currently, much attention has been given to the role of ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) family, especially when plants respond to conditions of oxygen depletion. Considering such a scenario, we aimed to evaluate the transcriptional response of seven ERF genes in leaves of rice seedlings subjected to conditions of anoxia (N₂), hypoxia (submergence), and iron overload (2,000 mg L⁻¹ of FeSO₄.7H₂O). All the analyzed genes showed differential transcriptional expression in response to these three stresses. Analyses in the promoter region of these transcription factors indicated that the promoter region closest to the transcription start site is most responsible for the differential response of these genes under conditions of oxygen absence (anoxia) or reduction (hypoxia). On the other hand, the promoter relationship was not detected for iron stress. The methylation of these regions as a mean of regulation is also suggested as well as the possibility of redundancy of different genes expressed at similar times and stressful conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic conditions 3aethylene 3agenes 3ahypoxia 3airon 3airon overload 3aleaves 3amethylation 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aplant development 3apromoter regions 3arice 3aseedlings 3asoil 3asubmergence 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aKrüger, Mariana Madruga1 aPegoraro, Camila1 aMadabula, Frederico Pedro1 ada Maia, Luciano Carlos1 aRombaldi, Cesar Valmor1 aOliveira, António Costa de,0 tTropical plant biology.g2013 Mar., v. 6, no. 1 p.16-25dSpringer-Verlagx1935-97567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12042-013-9117-1  aDNAL 7aarticle03435naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002100137245016600158300001400324520217200338592002802510650002502538650002302563650001702586650001202603650002002615650001202635650001802647650000902665650001002674650002202684650002002706650001102726650001302737651001402750700002102764700002502785700002502810773009802835856007102933852000903004655001203013IND50067212420221118174039.0130618s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006721242DNAL7 a10.1071/ZO120872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeaves, Linda E.10aPaternally inherited genetic markers reveal new insights into genetic structuring within Macropus fuliginosus and hybridisation with sympatric Macropus giganteus  ap. 58-68.  aThere are several aspects of biology in which the contribution of males and females is unequal. In these instances the examination of Y chromosome markers may be used to elucidate male-specific attributes. Here, male dispersal patterns and genetic structuring were examined using four Y-microsatellite loci in 186 male western grey kangaroos, Macropus fuliginosus, from throughout the species’ trans-continental distribution. In addition, 52 male grey kangaroos were examined to investigate hybridisation between M. fuliginosus and the eastern grey kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, in their region of sympatry in eastern Australia. Detected Y chromosome diversity was low, resulting from low effective male population size due to skewed sex ratios and a polygynous mating system. As expected, male dispersal was high across the range. However, the Lake Torrens–Flinders Ranges region appears to have significantly restricted male movement between eastern and central/western Australia. There was little evidence to suggest that other barriers (Nullarbor Plain and Swan River Valley) previously identified by nuclear and mitochondrial DNA marker studies restrict male movement. Hence, the admixture events previously identified may be associated with high male dispersal. Within the region of sympatry between M. fuliginosus and M. giganteus in eastern Australia, four M. giganteus individuals were found to possess M. fuliginosus Y-haplotypes. These results confirm the occurrence of hybridisation between male M. fuliginosus and female M. giganteus. Additionally, the introgression of M. fuliginosus Y-haplotypes into M. giganteus populations indicates that at least some male hybrids are fertile, despite evidence to the contrary from captive studies. This study has provided insights into the male contribution to population history, structure and hybridisation in M. fuliginosus, which were not predicted by comparisons between biparentally and maternally inherited markers. This highlights the importance of direct examination of the Y chromosome to provide novel insights into male-mediated processes, especially where the contribution of the sexes may differ.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMacropus fuliginosus 3aMacropus giganteus 3aY chromosome 3afemales 3agenetic markers 3ahybrids 3aintrogression 3aloci 3amales 3amitochondrial DNA 3apopulation size 3arivers 3asympatry 3aAustralia1 aZenger, Kyall R.1 aPrince, Robert I.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of those sectors on the municipal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita in the south-central region of Brazil during that period. To that end, we constructed a theoretical model, estimating its parameters with a generalized method of moments system estimator and using spatial dynamic panel data to estimate the direct (municipal) effects and indirect (regional) effects. The cumulative direct and indirect effects increased the real municipal GDP per capita by 1028 $ in the host municipalities and by 324 $ in each of their 15 closest neighboring municipalities. On the basis of our findings, we can infer that the effects of establishing a sugar mill or ethanol plant are most significant for the host municipality and persist for at least 10 years after operations begin. Our results also indicate that sugarcane production has a significant, positive impact on municipal GDP per capita, not only in the municipalities where that production takes place but also in neighboring municipalities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aethanol 3agross domestic product 3amodels 3asugarcane 3asugars 3aBrazil 0aSugarcane sector 0aSugar sector 0aEthanol sector 0aSugarcane industry 0aSocioeconomic impact 0aSpatial dynamic panel1 aBacchi, Mírian Rumenos Piedade1 aCaldarelli, Carlos Eduardo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6739-71830 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Aug., v. 91 p.116-125dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02697naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001700146245023000163300001800393520123600411592002801647650001601675650002201691650001801713650003001731650002201761650002201783650001501805650003101820650001401851650002801865650002001893650001901913650002401932650001901956700001901975700001801994700002302012700001602035773012102051856008202172852000902254655001202263IND60561677720221118034006.0170122e20160331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056167772DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b006612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSugimoto, Yu10aUnderstanding of the Effects of Ionic Strength on the Bimolecular Rate Constant between Structurally Identified Redox Enzymes and Charged Substrates Using Numerical Simulations on the Basis of the Poisson–Boltzmann Equation  ap. 3122-3128.  aTo understand electrostatic interactions in biomolecules, the bimolecular rate constants (k) between redox enzymes and charged substrates (in this study, redox mediators in the electrode reaction) were evaluated at various ionic strengths (I) for the mediated bioelectrocatalytic reaction. The k value between bilirubin oxidase (BOD) and positively charged mediators increased with I, while that between BOD and negatively charged mediators decreased with I. The opposite trend was observed for the reaction of glucose oxidase (GOD). In the case of noncharged mediators, the k value was independent of I for both BOD and GOD. These results reflect the electrostatic interactions between the enzymes and the mediators. Furthermore, we estimated k/k° (k° being the thermodynamic rate constant) by numerical simulation (finite element method) based on the Poisson–Boltzmann (PB) equation. By considering the charges of individual atoms involved in the amino acids around the substrate binding sites in the enzymes, the simulated k/k° values well reproduced the experimental data. In conclusion, k/k° can be predicted by PB-based simulation as long as the crystal structure of the enzyme and the substrate binding site are known.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acids 3abilirubin oxidase 3abinding sites 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3achemical elements 3acrystal structure 3aelectrodes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aequations 3afinite element analysis 3aglucose oxidase 3aionic strength 3amathematical models 3athermodynamics1 aKitazumi, Yuki1 aShirai, Osamu1 aYamamoto, Masahiro1 aKano, Kenji0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Mar. 31, v. 120, no. 12 p.3122-3128dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b006613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02461naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002200190245011200212300001500324506007600339520111200415592002801527506003701555650004201592650001801634650001501652650002901667650001801696653001401714653002301728653003101751653000801782653000701790653000801797700002501805700002501830773009101855856008401946852000902030655001202039IND60625223020221207112311.0190326e20190215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062522302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.12.0012doi7 aPMC63878532pmcid7 a305295482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWolfe, Michael B.10aGlobal analysis of RNA metabolism using bio-orthogonal labeling coupled with next-generation RNA sequencing  ap. 88-103.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMany open questions in RNA biology relate to the kinetics of gene expression and the impact of RNA binding regulatory factors on processing or decay rates of particular transcripts. Steady state measurements of RNA abundance obtained from RNA-seq approaches are not able to separate the effects of transcription from those of RNA decay in the overall abundance of any given transcript, instead only giving information on the (presumed steady-state) abundances of transcripts. Through the combination of metabolic labeling and high-throughput sequencing, several groups have been able to measure both transcription rates and decay rates of the entire transcriptome of an organism in a single experiment. This review focuses on the methodology used to specifically measure RNA decay at a global level. By comparing and contrasting approaches and describing the experimental protocols in a modular manner, we intend to provide both experienced and new researchers to the field the ability to combine aspects of various protocols to fit the unique needs of biological questions not addressed by current methods.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 0aRNA decay 0aMetabolic labeling 0aHigh-throughput sequencing 0a4sU 0aEU 0aBrU1 aGoldstrohm, Aaron C.1 aFreddolino, Peter L.0 tMethods.g2019 Feb. 15, v. 155 p.88-103dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12000x1046-20237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ymeth.2018.12.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200745 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094024004000137024004700177040001800224100001900242245014800261300001500409506007600424506003100500520156400531592002802095596008302123506003702206650001502243650002302258650001402281650001102295650002602306650001302332650001102345650001102356650002802367650001302395650002102408650002002429651001302449651001202462651001302474651001602487653002002503653002302523653001802546653001802564653001402582653001102596653002802607653000802635653000802643653000802651653000802659653001302667653001302680653000702693653000602700653000602706653000902712653000902721700001602730700001802746700001802764773011902782856008702901856004502988961000903033852000903042655001203051IND60526768520221215142809.0190410e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676852DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0052chorus7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0052doi7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0052chorusOpen  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDierking, R.M.10aYield, biomass composition, and N use efficiency during establishment of four Miscanthus × giganteus genotypes as influenced by N management  ap. 98-107.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCHORUS License Information  aFew studies have examined N management strategies to accelerate Miscanthus establishment. Our objectives were: (i) determine differences in biomass yield among various M. × giganteus genotypes as influenced by N management during establishment; (ii) quantify the impact of genotype and N management on biomass composition; and (iii) determine how M. × giganteus genotype and N management influence nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Four M. × giganteus genotypes were planted near Schochoh, KY and Lafayette, IN in 2010. A two-year total N application of 150 kg ha−1 was applied using various combinations of 50, 75, and 100 kg ha−1 y−1. Control N rates included 0 and 150 kg ha−1 each year. Yield, composition, and NUE of the MS and IL clones were similar. Two-year cumulative yields of Nagara were higher than the other genotypes in KY, and the IL clone in IN. There was no response of yield to N on the silt loam soil in KY, whereas high biomass yields were achieved with 50 kg ha−1 y−1 of N on the sandy loam soil in IN. Yields of plots provided high N in Season 1 were similar to unfertilized control plots in Season 2 suggesting little N carryover from Season 1 to 2. Biomass fiber concentrations were not influenced by N-fertilization, but high leaf retention of the Nagara lines reduced biomass cellulose and lignin concentrations. Site-specific genotypic differences in NUE were observed. Annual N applications of 50 kg ha−1 is recommended to enhanced Miscanthus yield during establishment on the coarse-textured soils.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Institute of Food and Agriculturedhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000058250 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMiscanthus 3abiomass production 3acellulose 3aclones 3acoarse-textured soils 3agenotype 3aleaves 3alignin 3anutrient use efficiency 3aplanting 3asandy loam soils 3asilt loam soils 3aIllinois 3aIndiana 3aKentucky 3aMississippi 0aMiscanthus Keng 0aClonal differences 0aBiomass yield 0aEstablishment 0aCellulose 0aLignin 0aNitrogen use efficiency 0aNDF 0aADF 0aADL 0aGHG 0aIL clone 0aMS clone 0aOP 0aC 0aN 0aANUE 0aPNUE1 aAllen, D.J.1 aBrouder, S.M.1 aVolenec, J.J.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Aug., v. 91 p.98-107dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0053Available from publisher's site40uhttp://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/5267685  aUSDA  aDNAL 7aarticle02362naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245010100162520096100263592002801224650001201252650002801264650000901292650001701301650001701318650001501335650000901350650001701359650002101376650002201397650000901419650001901428650001501447650001401462653002201476653002601498653002101524700001701545700001601562700005301578700001401631700001601645700001601661773011201677856008201789852000901871655001201880IND60744320420221118120003.0220103e202110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074432042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fct.2021.1124102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChe, Siyan10aHesperidin prevents the combined toxicity of decabromodiphenyl ether and sodium nitrite in vitro  aDecabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) and Sodium nitrite (SN) coexist in the processing meat and fish foods, but there is no research considering them together. The present study aimed to investigate the binary mixture's toxicity of BDE-209 and SN and explore the protective effect of hesperidin (Hsp) on the combined toxicity. Results showed that compared with the impact of BDE-209 or SN alone, the binary mixture had a synergistic toxic effect on impairing the viability of HepG2 cells, accompanied by oxidative stress, Ca²⁺ accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction. The increase of γ-H2AX fluorescent foci and micronuclei number also indicated its genotoxicity. Pretreatment of Hsp could significantly alleviate the above damage caused by the binary combination. These findings revealed the toxicological interaction of BDE-209 and SN and highlighted that food containing abundant natural flavonoids, as hesperidin, could reduce this toxicological risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3acalcium 3adecabromodiphenyl ether 3afish 3afluorescence 3agenotoxicity 3ahesperidin 3ameat 3amitochondria 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3arisk 3asodium nitrite 3atoxicology 3aviability 0aCombined toxicity 0aHigh content analysis 0aFoodborne poison1 aYuan, Jinwen1 aChen, Sunni1 aLi, Shiqi1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0906-35881 aZhang, Li1 aRuan, Zheng1 aYao, Yanbin0 tFood and chemical toxicology.g2021 Oct., v. 156 p.112410-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl33424x0278-69157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2021.1124103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02299naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245004300179300001600222520092300238592002801161650001701189650001601206650002401222650001101246650003101257650000901288650000801297650001901305650001201324650000701336650002201343650001301365650001201378650002001390650001401410653002601424653000901450653002001459653002301479653002501502653001901527700001201546700002001558700001801578773010101596856008701697852000901784655001201793IND60542246320221119171713.0190402e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054224632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.03.0512doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomero de Ávila, M.D.10aDry-cured ham restructured with fibrin  ap. 519-528.  aThe viability of a fibrinogen–thrombin system (FT) to bind fresh deboned hams for incorporation in the salting and ripening processes, to produce cured ham, was studied.

Climate matching techniques have been used to overcome this limitation by prioritising regions in the target weed’s native range to survey for climatically-matched control agents. However, climate matching has been criticised for not considering that climatically compatible regions may not contain host-plant populations, which is especially important for weeds with an unknown or uncertain native distribution. To overcome this limitation, an ecological niche modelling approach (MaxEnt) was used to identify “sweet-spots” to search for candidate biological control agents for two African grasses that are invasive in Australia, namely: Sporobolus pyramidalis P. Beauv. and S. natalensis (Steud.) Dur. & Schinz (Poaceae) (giant rat’s tail grasses). “Sweet-spots” were identified by overlaying rasters indicative of climatic suitability for plant growth, reproduction and survival (i.e. models calibrated using native range occurrences) and climatic compatibility with intended biological control agent release sites in Australia (i.e. models calibrated using invaded range occurrences). This approach reduced the total geographic search area by 3.8–7.5 million km2 (57–88% of the total search area), with respect to traditional climatic matching techniques. The models identified: eastern South Africa, eastern Madagascar, Ethiopia, Kenya and coastal West Africa (S. pyramidalis only) as high-priority regions to search for potentially climatically-matched biological control agents. These findings are discussed in the context of guiding and optimising the native range component of this biological control programme, and how this increases the likelihood of successfully managing weed infestations in Australia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSporobolus indicus var. pyramidalis 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3aclimate 3agrasses 3ahost plants 3amodels 3aniches 3aplant growth 3areproduction 3asurveys 3aweed control 3aweeds 3aAustralia 3aEthiopia 3aKenya 3aMadagascar 3aSouth Africa 3aWestern Africa 0aClimate matching 0aThermal physiology 0aEstablishment 0aAgent prioritisation 0aSporobolus pyramidalis 0aSporobolus natalensis0 tBiological control.g2019 Feb., v. 129 p.37-44dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl48419x1049-96447nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.11.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002500152245007200177300001600249520114600265592002801411650001501439650001201454650002501466650001101491650001901502650001201521650002301533650001701556650001501573650001601588650001901604650001901623650000701642650002501649650001101674653001701685653002101702653001201723653002501735700002201760700002401782700002001806700001601826700002101842700002801863773010601891856008701997852000902084655001202093IND60526768620221121200659.0190410e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKandylis, Panagiotis10aAcidogenesis of cellulosic hydrolysates for new generation biofuels  ap. 210-216.  aThis article presents a comprehensive review on hydrolysis and acidogenesis of lignocellulosic waste biomass and makes clear new perspectives in biofuel research. Specifically, the acidogenesis of lignocellulosics and liquid effluent have been discussed extensively with potential goal the production of a new generation biofuel. This new biofuel can be produced through esterification of volatile fatty acids with ethanol (produced simultaneously during the acidogenesis) or/and with another alcohol. That will overcome the major problems faced during bioethanol production and concerns the high energy demand of the bioethanol production plant. Specifically, it was found that the main volatile fatty acids formed are formic, acetic, propionic, butyric, lactic and valeric. Their formation depends on NADH/NAD+ proportion and on conditions such as pH, organic load and chemical composition of the waste is treated. These conditions look to affect microorganisms survival and the formation of predominant acetic, butyric and lactic acid. The use of γ-alumina promotes the formation of volatile fatty acids simultaneously with bio-ethanol.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioethanol 3abiomass 3achemical composition 3aenergy 3aesterification 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3alactic acid 3alignocellulose 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3avolatile fatty acids 3awastes 0aAcidogenesis 0aLignocellulosics 0aBiofuel 0aVolatile fatty acids1 aBekatorou, Argyro1 aPissaridi, Katerina1 aLappa, Katerina1 aDima, Agapi1 aKanellaki, Maria1 aKoutinas, Athanasios A.0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Aug., v. 91 p.210-216dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02524naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015500177520135000332592002801682650001401710650001101724650001101735650002201746650001301768650002701781650002001808650001501828653002601843653001501869653000901884653002201893653002101915700001901936773010001955856008602055852000902141655001202150IND60744320520221118115939.0210904e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074432052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shang Yin Vanson10aGenetic analyses reveal fine-scale genetic structure between lagoon and open water spoon seagrass (Halophila ovalis) populations around Dongsha Island  aIn recent years, anthropogenic impacts are causing a dramatic decline of marine ecosystems, especially in seagrass ecosystems located exclusively in subtidal zone. A full understanding of seagrass dispersal mechanisms and connectivity is very important for successful restoration, conservation, and management of seagrasses.Halophila ovalis, a seagrass considered a pioneer species that is widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region, was collected from 4 sites (one in the lagoon and three from open water area) situated in the waters of Dongsha Island to reveal its fine scale connectivity with newly developed microsatellite loci. The results of F-statistics, principal coordinates analysis, and assignment test showed a concordant result that the population inhabiting the semiclosed lagoon is genetically isolated from other populations inhabiting the coastal area of the island. This fine scale genetic structure may shape by physical barriers (restricted water exchange) and the low dispersal capacity of H. ovalis. In conclusion, the lagoon of Dongsha Island could be an isolated habitat in which taxa have experienced unique evolutionary histories; future studies investigating the potential genetic novelty of additional taxa in that area are needed in order to validate the conservation significance of the lagoon of Dongsha Island.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHalophila 3abotany 3acoasts 3agenetic structure 3ahabitats 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apioneer species 3aseagrasses 0aSeagrass connectivity 0aFine scale 0aSSRs 0aLimited gene flow 0aHydrocharitaceae1 aHsu, Chi-Hsuan0 tAquatic botany.g2021 Sept., v. 174 p.103421-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11301x0304-37707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2021.1034213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002300152245012000175300001400295520113800309592002801447650002501475650001001500650002301510650001801533650001801551650001701569650002001586650001301606650001301619650001301632653001201645653001601657653002301673653003201696653001801728700002001746700001901766700001501785700001901800700001801819700001601837773010401853856008701957852000902044655001202053IND60526768720221121200730.0190410e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuruhashi, Kenichi10aEffects of culture medium salinity on the hydrocarbon extractability, growth and morphology of Botryococcus braunii  ap. 83-90.  aHere, we investigated the effects of culture medium salinity on the hydrocarbon extractability, growth and morphology of Botryococcus braunii strain Showa. At all tested salinities, the hydrocarbon recovery rate increased during the first or second cell division, which occurred within 7 days. Algal growth in modified Chu13 medium did not differ significantly from that in medium with 0.3% seawater salinity (0.3%SM) to which seawater (3.6%, salinity was 36 g L−1) was diluted. In contrast, culturing in 0.3% seawater salinity improved hydrocarbon extractability and shortened the time required for hydrocarbon extraction. This change supposed to be due to the decrease in the production of polysaccharides which prevent non-polar solvent from contacting hydrocarbons. Additionally, there was an increase in the colony sizes and flotation of the alga when cultured in 0.3% seawater salinity. The results of our experiments suggest that culturing B. braunii in a medium with the appropriate salinity can reduce the input energy and the costs incurred from harvest to hydrocarbon extraction without decreasing biomass production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotryococcus braunii 3aalgae 3abiomass production 3acell division 3aculture media 3ahydrocarbons 3apolysaccharides 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asolvents 0aBiofuel 0aHydrocarbon 0aSolvent extraction 0aBotryococcus braunii race B 0aSaline medium1 aHasegawa, Fumio1 aSaga, Kiyotaka1 aKudou, Sou1 aOkada, Shigeru1 aKaizu, Yutaka1 aImou, Kenji0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Aug., v. 91 p.83-90dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04133naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002300155245018100178300001600359520212500375592002802500650002502528650002002553650002502573650002502598650002402623650002502647650002402672650002702696650001902723650001302742650001702755650001902772650001602791650001902807650002302826650000902849650001602858650003202874650002602906650001002932650002102942650002002963650002802983650001703011650002503028650001903053650002103072650001303093653003103106653002103137653002503158653002103183700001903204700002603223700002603249700001803275773009103293856009003384852000903474655001203483IND60636609620221116213748.0191002e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063660962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.1812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerakhshesh, Negin10aExposure of liver cell culture from the orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, to benzo[a]pyrene and light results in oxidative damage as measured by antioxidant enzymes  ap. 534-544.  aAmong the various toxicants discharged into aquatic environments, benzo (a) pyrene (BaP) has been shown to effect on the antioxidant system of fish and the evaluation of its impact on biota is of considerable concern. The aim of the present study was to use the primary hepatocyte culture obtained from the orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides, to evaluate the adverse effects of benzo (a) pyrene (BaP) on cell viability and liver antioxidant system. BaP was selected for its high ability to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress. The liver was minced by a scalpel and digested in the PBS solution with 0.1% collagenase IV at room temperature for 20 min. Then, the cell suspension was transferred to a plate contained an equal amount of Leibovitz's L-15 medium with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU mL−1 of penicillin and 100 μg mL−1 streptomycin. 5 mL of cell suspension were plated into sterile 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks at the density of 1.5 × 106 cell/ml L-15 and incubated at 30 °C for two weeks. The medium was renewed after 24–48 h. The number of the liver cells was adjusted to 4 × 106 after two weeks. 10−4 mol l−1 was verified by MTT assay as the IC50 of BaP. Then, hepatocytes were exposed to three concentrations of BaP (10−5, 2 × 10−5, 3 × 10−5 mol L−1) and incubated for 24 h. Samples were collected after 6, 12 and 24 h and the amounts of SOD, CAT, GPx, LPO, LDH, AST, ALT, ALP and total protein were analyzed. The results showed that, 10−5 mol L−1 of BaP was not significantly toxic to cultivated hepatocytes, however, the sensitivity of cells to BaP increased in a dose-related pattern. The activity of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) and liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, LDH) significantly increased, though the amount of LPO, total antioxidant power and total protein decreased dose-dependently in BaP-exposed cells. In conclusion, according to the finding of the present study, BaP has a high potential to induce the oxidative stress in primary liver cell culture of E. coioides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEpinephelus coioides 3aadverse effects 3aalanine transaminase 3aalkaline phosphatase 3aambient temperature 3aantioxidant activity 3aaquatic environment 3aaspartate transaminase 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3acatalase 3acell culture 3acell viability 3acollagenase 3aculture flasks 3afetal bovine serum 3afish 3ahepatocytes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alactate dehydrogenase 3aliver 3aoxidative stress 3aprotein content 3areactive oxygen species 3astreptomycin 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissue culture 3atoxic substances 3atoxicity 0aPrimary hepatocyte culture 0aOxidative stress 0aEpinephelus coioides 0aBenzo (a) pyrene1 aSalamat, Negin1 aMovahedinia, AbdolAli1 aHashemitabar, Mahmoud1 aBayati, Vahid0 tChemosphere.g2019 July, v. 226 p.534-544dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.03.1813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02114naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100003200144245012700176520094300303592002801246650002301274650001901297650001601316650001301332650002101345650001101366650001301377650002801390650002201418700002201440700002701462700003001489700001901519773012601538856007901664852000901743655001201752IND60790848720221118003207.0220826e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079084872DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110816092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTsermpini, Evangelia Eirini10aMolecular Mechanisms Related to Responses to Oxidative Stress and Antioxidative Therapies in COVID-19: A Systematic Review  aThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a leading global health and economic challenge. What defines the disease’s progression is not entirely understood, but there are strong indications that oxidative stress and the defense against reactive oxygen species are crucial players. A big influx of immune cells to the site of infection is marked by the increase in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Our article aims to highlight the critical role of oxidative stress in the emergence and severity of COVID-19 and, more importantly, to shed light on the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms. We have reviewed the available literature and clinical trials to extract the relevant genetic variants within the oxidative stress pathway associated with COVID-19 and the anti-oxidative therapies currently evaluated in the clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment, in particular clinical trials on glutathione and N-acetylcysteine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aacetylcysteine 3aglutathione 3anitrogen 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen 3apandemic 3areactive oxygen species 3asystematic review1 aGlamočlija, Una 1 aUlucan-Karnak, Fulden 1 aRedenšek Trampuž, Sara 1 aDolžan, Vita 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110816093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245007700172300001600249520125500265592002801520650002101548650001201569650001601581650001001597650001401607650001001621650001101631653001601642653002401658653000901682653000901691653001301700653001301713700003301726700001801759700002201777700002401799773010101823856008701924852000902011655001202020IND60542246520221119171719.0190402e20140915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054224652DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMarican, Adolfo14aThe binding of 4-ethylguaiacol with polyaniline-based materials in wines  ap. 486-492.  a4-ethylguaiacol (4-EG) is one of the important compounds responsible for the “Brett character” (i.e. spicy and smoky aromas) found in wines contaminated with Brettanomyces yeast. In this trial, the ability of polyaniline-based materials (PANI-EB and PANI-ES) was tested as a potential fining agent for the removal of 4-EG in wine. First, a screening study was developed in order to determine the binding capacity of 4-EG by PANI materials in 12% ethanol solution. Then, the capturing ability of PANI against 4-EG was evaluated with a solution containing gallic acid (GA), 4-methyl-catechol (4-MC), in which the concentration of the phenolic compounds were maintained as in the real wine. The results obtained showed that the retention percentage varied between 0 to 100% (4-EG), 13.81% to 72.32% (GA), and 0 to 17.39% (4-MC), depending on the interaction time and amount of the PANI used. Finally, the capturing capacity of PANI-EB and PANI-ES against 4-EG was evaluated in a real wine sample containing originally 3.10±0.13mgL−1 of 4-EG and 2.55±0.10gL−1 of other total phenolic compounds. The analyses performed indicated that PANI-EB is more effective in removing 4-EG than PANI-ES, with retention percentages varying between 36 and 50%.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding capacity 3aethanol 3agallic acid 3aodors 3ascreening 3awines 3ayeasts 0aPolyaniline 0aConjugated polymers 0aWine 0a4-EG 0aQuEChERS 0aHPLC-DAD1 aCarrasco-Sánchez, Verónica1 aJohn, Amalraj1 aFelipe Laurie, V.1 aSantos, Leonardo S.0 tFood chemistry.g2014 Sept. 15, v. 159 p.486-492dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02304naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001900141245006900160300001800229500001400247520110600261592002801367650002101395650001901416650001801435650002001453650001501473650003601488650002001524650000901544650000901553653001401562653000901576653001601585653001401601700002201615773018501637856007501822852000901897655001201906IND60692286820221123044014.0200502e20050101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069228682DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.69.19352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUEKI, Nobuhiko10aStructural Stabilities of Recombinant Scombridae Fish Myoglobins  ap. 1935-1943.  aNAL-light  aAn expression system of recombinant myoglobins (Mb) of 3 scombridae fish species was constructed. The stability of these Mbs was compared with native Mbs purified from slow skeletal muscle. The addition of hemin during the cultivation of an Escherichia coli strain harboring a pGEX-2T expression vector was found to be necessary to prevent recombinant Mb from degrading and to attain its proper folding. The stabilities of recombinant Mbs were generally lower than those of native Mbs, partly due to the absence of post-translational modification. The α-Helical content of bullet tuna recombinant Mb at 10 °C was the lowest (29.0%) among the recombinant Mbs examined (the values for bluefin tuna and bigeye tuna Mbs being 34.8 and 35.5%, respectively). On the other hand, the stabilities of recombinant Mbs of bluefin tuna and bigeye tuna against denaturants (urea and guanidine hydrochloride) were found to be similar, whereas bullet tuna recombinant Mb exhibited the lowest stability among these Mbs. The pattern of temperature-dependent decrease in the α-helical content supported these results.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEscherichia coli 3aThunnus obesus 3abiotechnology 3agenetic vectors 3aguanidines 3apost-translational modification 3askeletal muscle 3atuna 3aurea 0amyoglobin 0afish 0arecombinant 0astability1 aOCHIAI, Yoshihiro0 tBioscience, biotechnology, and biochemistry.g2005 Jan. 1, v. 69, no. 10 p.1935-1943dJapan Society for Bioscience, Biotechnology, and AgrochemistrywJournal:18959x1347-69477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1271/bbb.69.19353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02940naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012700169300001600296520148700312592002801799650002201827650001101849650001901860650002001879650001401899650001101913650001301924650001301937650000901950650001201959650002301971650001801994650003302012650001702045650001802062650001602080650003702096653002002133653001102153653001102164653000902175653001102184653001302195700002402208773010602232856008702338852000902425655001202434IND60526768920221121200754.0190410e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAluha, James10aSynthetic fuels from 3-φ Fischer-Tropsch synthesis using syngas feed and novel nanometric catalysts synthesised by plasma  ap. 330-339.  aNanometric carbon-supported catalysts based on cobalt and iron (Co/C, Fe/C and CoFe/C) were synthesised by plasma method for application in Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). FTS tests were conducted at reaction conditions (ca 533 K, 2 MPa) over the catalyst, in a feed stream of 60% mol fraction H2 and 30% mol fraction CO at 1.0 cm3s−1g−1 of catalyst for 24 h. Prior to this, the catalysts were pre-treated at 673 K either in pure H2 or CO flowing at 250 cm3 min−1 for 24 h. Results showed that higher temperature promoted better CO conversion; up to 100% for the Co/C catalyst at 533 K. However, lower temperatures were more conducive for the selectivity of Co/C catalyst towards gasoline (C4C12) and diesel (C13C20) fractions, since production of undesired products such as CO2 and CH4 was prevalent at higher temperatures. At 493 K, the CoFe/C bimetallics were almost inert, but at 533 K, they showed improved CO conversion. When compared to the Co/C catalyst, Fe-containing catalysts suppressed both CO2 and CH4 production. Moderated H2O production was witnessed in the CO-reduced catalysts, contrasting with catalysts pre-treated in H2 gas. Catalyst characterisation by BET surface area, XRD analysis and microscopy (SEM & TEM) showed that plasma synthesis produces catalysts with consistency, having highly dispersed nanoparticle metal moieties, interspersed with various forms of metallic, carbidic and intermetallic CoFe species in the carbon matrix support.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acobalt 3agasoline 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amethane 3amethane production 3ananoparticles 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asurface area 3asynthesis gas 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aFischer-Tropsch 0aPlasma 0aCarbon 0aIron 0aCobalt 0aCatalyst1 aAbatzoglou, Nicolas0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Dec., v. 95 p.330-339dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02967naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001600155245010700171520158200278592002801860650001501888650002201903650001501925650002301940650002201963650002801985650001702013651001102030651000902041651001102050651001802061653002302079653002202102653001902124653002302143653005102166700003002217700002502247700002102272700001902293773011002312856009002422852000902512655001202521IND60758139220221120060845.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075813922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1043162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Yunyu12aA global analysis of multifaceted urbanization patterns using Earth Observation data from 1975 to 2015  aUrbanization as a global phenomenon is a multifaceted process. Here we do the first global attempt to characterize the complexity of urbanization from 1975 to 2015 in terms of population, built-up structure, and greenness per 5 × 5 km² grid covering global inhabited areas, using Earth Observation data sources. Our results emphasize the multifaceted nature of urbanization that varies greatly across regions and times, in addition to the steady expansion of built-up land. Increased population density and built-up patch density were the dominant characteristics in Asia and Africa, while urbanization in Europe and North America took a rather steady pace, combined with widespread greening. According to the urbanization types identified by a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm, a large proportion of urban and suburban areas experienced two dynamic urbanization types – built-up extension/leapfrog and built-up infill with large population increase. During different historical periods (1975–1990, 1990–2000, and 2000–2015), annual rates of increase in population and built-up density were slowing coinciding with an increasing greenness – signaling that urbanization processes are becoming less intense, more compact, and ‘greener’ over the most recent period. Our findings facilitate the comprehensive understanding of global urbanization that is a complex process with many local variations and characteristics, and underscore the need for region-based strategies towards sustainable development instead of a ‘one-size-fits-all’ policy for cities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3apopulation density 3apopulation growth 3asustainable development 3aurbanization 3aAfrica 3aAsia 3aEurope 3aNorth America 0aBuilt-up expansion 0aPopulation change 0aGreenness loss 0aUrbanization types 0aSocial–land cover–environment interactions1 aTsendbazar, Nandin-Erdene1 avan Leeuwen, Eveline1 aFensholt, Rasmus1 aHerold, Martin0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Mar., v. 219 p.104316-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1043163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01823naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002400153245008400177300002000261520074700281592002801028650003701056650001401093650001301107650001101120650001401131650001101145700002401156700002201180700002001202700002101222700002501243773010701268856008901375852000901464655001201473IND60583580420171214000000.0171019e20171019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058358042DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b018632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzmán, Héctor J.10aX-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis of Hydrotreated Athabasca Asphaltenes  ap. 10706-10717.  aC7 asphaltenes from Athabasca crude oil were hydrotreated using a commercial NiW/Al₂O₃ catalyst and analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results showed that the catalyst performed better in the removal of sulfur rather than nitrogen and that sulfur concentration is higher at the surface in comparison to the bulk structure. Moreover, the sample after reaction had a higher oxygen content in comparison to the untreated asphaltene, indicating poor hydrodeoxygenation performance of the catalyst in addition to a higher reactivity toward atmospheric oxygen at the surface of the asphaltene. The latter is proposed to arise once the layer of resin covering the asphaltene is partially converted during the hydrotreating process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3apetroleum 3asulfur1 aIsquierdo, Fernanda1 aCarbognani, Lante1 aVitale, Gerardo1 aScott, Carlos E.1 aPereira-Almao, Pedro0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Oct. 19, v. 31, no. 10 p.10706-10717dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b018633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02402naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001800155245007900173520118600252592002801438650001101466650001201477650002201489650002001511650001501531650000901546650001101555650001701566650001501583651001001598651001801608653003501626653002601661653003201687653002301719653002301742700001801765773011001783856009001893852000901983655001201992IND60758139320221120060856.0220207e202203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075813932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1043172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuo, Kaisheng10aIncreasing urban flood risk in China over recent 40 years induced by LUCC  aLand use/cover change (LUCC) caused by urbanization has a great impact on urban hydrological systems, among which urban pluvial floods are particularly prominent and have attracted worldwide attention. Although some previous studies have shown that urban LUCC increases urban pluvial flood risk and reduces urban flood regulation service (UFRS) in individual cities, there has not been a nationwide quantitative assessment in China. Here, we use a data-driven hydrological model and constructed indicators to clarify the quantitative impact of LUCC on China's UFRS and its spatial pattern from 1977 to 2018. Our analysis revealed that LUCC has caused China's UFRS to decline by 13.39%, from 31.34% in 1977 to 17.95% in 2018. Spatially, the UFRS decline in all river basins in China was greater than 10%, and the UFRS in almost all cities was decreasing. Especially in the densely distributed eastern Yangtze River basin, Pearl River basin, Southeast basin, Haihe River basin and Huai River basin, their UFSR values decreased by 11.89%, 12.17%, 12.34% and 10.81%, respectively. This is a warning that China's urban land conversion has greatly increased the urban pluvial flood risk.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasins 3adecline 3ahydrologic models 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3arisk 3arivers 3aurbanization 3awatersheds 3aChina 3aYangtze River 0aUrban flood regulation service 0aStormwater management 0aUrban land use/cover change 0aPluvial flood risk 0aHydrological model1 aZhang, Xuejun0 tLandscape and urban planning.g2022 Mar., v. 219 p.104317-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12405x0169-20467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2021.1043173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02443naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002200146245011600168300001800284520143100302592002801733650002201761650001601783650002001799650002301819650001701842650001601859700002201875700002001897773012101917856008202038852000902120655001202129IND60561678320221118033948.0170122e20160331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056167832DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b012542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllhusen, John S.10aStructural Origins of Cholesterol Accelerated Lipid Flip-Flop Studied by Sum-Frequency Vibrational Spectroscopy  ap. 3157-3168.  aThe unique structure of cholesterol and its role in modulating lipid translocation (flip-flop) were examined using sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (SFVS). Two structural analogues of cholesterolcholestanol and cholestenewere examined to explore the influence of ring rigidity and amphiphilicity on controlling distearoylphosphocholine (DSPC) flip-flop. Kinetic rates for DSPC flip-flop were determined as a function of sterol concentration and temperature. All three sterols increased the rate of DSPC flip-flop in a concentration-dependent manner following the order cholestene > cholestanol > cholesterol. Rates of DSPC flip-flop were used to calculate the thermodynamic activation free energy barrier (ΔG‡) in the presence of cholesterol, cholestanol, and cholestene. The acyl chain gauche content of DSPC, mean lipid area, and membrane compressibility were correlated to observed trends in ΔG‡. ΔG‡ for DSPC flip-flop showed a strong positive correlation with the molar compression modulus (K*) of the membrane, influenced by the type and concentration of the sterol added. Interestingly, cholesterol is distinctive in maintaining invariant membrane compressibility over the range of 2–10 mol %. The results in this study demonstrate that the compression modulus of a membrane plays a significant role in moderating ΔG‡ and the kinetics of native, protein-free, lipid translocation in membranes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3acholesterol 3acompressibility 3aphysical chemistry 3aspectroscopy 3atemperature1 aKimball, Dylan R.1 aConboy, John C.0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2016 Mar. 31, v. 120, no. 12 p.3157-3168dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-52077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.jpcb.6b012543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01724naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245008300174300001600257520085300273592002801126650001101154650001201165650002601177650002401203700001501227773011301242856008201355852000901437655001201446IND60756650320221120191617.0211114e200606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075665032DNAL7 a10.1007/s00335-005-0189-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKendziorski, Christina12aA review of statistical methods for expression quantitative trait loci mapping  ap. 509-517.  aWith high-throughput technologies now widely available, investigators can easily measure thousands of phenotypes for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. Microarray measurements are particularly amenable to QTL mapping, as evidenced by a number of recent studies demonstrating utility across a broad range of biological endeavors. The early success stories have impelled a rapid increase in both the number and complexity of expression QTL (eQTL) experiments. Consequently, there is a need to consider the statistical principles involved in the design and analysis of these experiments and the methods currently being used. In this article we review these principles and methods and discuss the open questions most likely to yield significant progress toward increasing the amount of meaningful information obtained from eQTL mapping experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenome 3amammals 3amicroarray technology 3aquantitative traits1 aWang, Ping0 tMammalian genome.g2006 June, v. 17, no. 6 p.509-517dSpringer New YorkwJournal:jnl3870068x0938-89907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00335-005-0189-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002300144245014800167520143500315592002801750650001701778650002501795650002601820650001901846650002301865650001301888650001601901650001301917650002001930650002801950650001701978700002201995700002302017700002902040700002802069700002502097700002202122773012602144856007902270852000902349655001202358IND60790849020221118003212.0220826e20220819xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079084902DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110816132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNitti, Mariapaola 10aHormesis and Oxidative Distress: Pathophysiology of Reactive Oxygen Species and the Open Question of Antioxidant Modulation and Supplementation  aAlterations of redox homeostasis leads to a condition of resilience known as hormesis that is due to the activation of redox-sensitive pathways stimulating cell proliferation, growth, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Instead, supraphysiological production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) exceeds antioxidant defence and leads to oxidative distress. This condition induces damage to biomolecules and is responsible or co-responsible for the onset of several chronic pathologies. Thus, a dietary antioxidant supplementation has been proposed in order to prevent aging, cardiovascular and degenerative diseases as well as carcinogenesis. However, this approach has failed to demonstrate efficacy, often leading to harmful side effects, in particular in patients affected by cancer. In this latter case, an approach based on endogenous antioxidant depletion, leading to ROS overproduction, has shown an interesting potential for enhancing susceptibility of patients to anticancer therapies. Therefore, a deep investigation of molecular pathways involved in redox balance is crucial in order to identify new molecular targets useful for the development of more effective therapeutic approaches. The review herein provides an overview of the pathophysiological role of ROS and focuses the attention on positive and negative aspects of antioxidant modulation with the intent to find new insights for a successful clinical application.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3aantioxidant activity 3abiochemical compounds 3acarcinogenesis 3acell proliferation 3adistress 3ahomeostasis 3ahormesis 3apathophysiology 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics1 aMarengo, Barbara 1 aFurfaro, Anna Lisa1 aPronzato, Maria Adelaide1 aMarinari, Umberto Maria1 aDomenicotti, Cinzia 1 aTraverso, Nicola 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 Aug. 19, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110816133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001800152245016400170300001600334520098300350592002801333650001701361650001901378650000901397650001901406650001801425650001501443650001101458650001901469650002201488650001401510650001001524651001201534653001801546653000901564653002401573653001101597653001401608653002001622700001901642700002301661773010001684856008701784852000901871655001201880IND60542246820221119171849.0190402e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054224682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.03.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Pengzhan10aFlavonol glycosides and other phenolic compounds in buds and leaves of different varieties of black currant (Ribes nigrum L.) and changes during growing season  ap. 180-189.  aPhenolic compounds in buds and leaves of three varieties of black currant in Finland were identified by HPLC-DAD–ESI-MS/MS. Forty-three phenolic compounds of flavonol glycosides, proanthocyanidins and phenolic acids were found in variety “Mikael” whereas only thirty-five in “Mortti” and “Jaloste n:o 15”. Glycosides of quercetin and kaempferol were the major phenolics. Rutin, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoise, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, quercetin-3-O-(6″-malonyl)-glucoside and a kaempferol-malonylhexoside were the most abundant flavonol glycosides. The contents of flavonol glycosides ranged from 1 to 7mg/g fresh weight in leaves showing typically an increasing trend from July to August, reaching the highest values in early October in “Mikael” and the end of August in “Mortti” and “Jaloste n:o 15”.

As the population is increasing and demand of various commodity is increasing rapidly therefore production planning is required which reduces the environmental effect, improves energy efficiency and also meet the forecasted demand. In this paper, two objectives carbon emission and energy consumption are taken in parallel consideration and methodology is proposed for production planning via existing and new process routes for minimizing one objective while imposing a maximum limit on the other objective. The proposed methodology is graphical and based on the concepts of pinch analysis that gives physical insight to the problem. Current production scenario utilizes existing process routes and to meet the future demand new process routes (based on best available techniques) are to be added. Production planning is to be calculated via each process route in order to minimize energy consumption and carbon emission. Proposed methodology is illustrated via two examples. First example consists of general production planning and the second example consists of production planning of crude steel. The planning is carried for two cases, in the first case carbon emission is constrained within a maximum limit and energy consumption is minimized while in the other case energy consumption is constrained within a maximum limit and carbon emission is minimized. Thus, proposed methodology provides flexibility to the planner to consider either of the two cases based on scenario and other requirements and it reduces the excess burden of carbon emission and energy consumption while satisfying the demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3abest available technology 3acarbon 3aenergy efficiency 3aenvironmental impact 3aplanning 3asteel 3asustainable development 0aProduction planning 0aPinch analysis 0aEnergy consumption 0aCarbon emission 0aLimiting composite curve1 aChaturvedi, Nitin Dutt0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 171 p.312-321dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02505naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013700173300001600310520096500326592002801291650001101319650002901330650001201359650001201371650001201383650002501395650001201420650002301432650001701455650001301472650001701485650001501502650002601517650001901543650001301562650001201575650001501587650001101602653001501613653002801628653001501656653002501671653002001696700001801716700002001734700001901754773010601773856008701879852000901966655001201975IND60526769220221121200647.0190410e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052676922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Ting-Hsiang14aThe addition of hydrolyzed rice straw in xylose fermentation by Pichia stipitis to increase bioethanol production at the pilot-scale  ap. 204-209.  aThe pretreatment of agricultural biomass by diluted acid is often employed to facilitate the release of monosaccharide for the subsequent enzyme hydrolysis for lignocellulosic ethanol production. However, furfural and hydroxymethylfurfural are usually generated and markedly decrease the yield of pentose fermentation during this pretreatment. In the present study, the enhancement of lignocellulosic ethanol production was successfully demonstrated at pilot scale with extra addition of hydrolyzed rice straw into pentose fermentation by Pichia stiptis. This way has resulted into the increase of P. stiptis cell mass was shown to play a positive role. The ethanol yield, 0.45 gp/gs, with the addition of hydrolyzed rice straw in hemicellulosic hydrolysate from plywood, bagasse and bamboo were increase 20–51% to demonstrate the applicability of this technology in a variety of lignocellulosic ethanol processes due to the efficient conversion of xylose.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPichia 3aScheffersomyces stipitis 3abagasse 3abamboos 3abiomass 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3afermentation 3afurfural 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3alignocellulose 3apentoses 3aplywood 3arice straw 3axylose 0aHydrolysis 0aLignocellulosic ethanol 0aRice straw 0aPentose fermentation 0aPichia stipitis1 aGuo, Gia-Luen1 aHwang, Wen-Song1 aHuang, Shir-Ly0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2016 Aug., v. 91 p.204-209dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2016.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01992naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002100153245008700174300002000261520089600281592002801177650001401205650001701219650001501236650001001251650001301261650003201274650001901306650001701325650001401342700002201356700002901378700001801407773010701425856008901532852000901621655001201630IND60583580720171214000000.0171019e20171019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058358072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b018872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSophonrat, Nanta10aCo-pyrolysis of Mixed Plastics and Cellulose: An Interaction Study by Py-GC×GC/MS  ap. 11078-11090.  aUnderstanding of the interaction between cellulose and various plastics is crucial for designing waste-to-energy processes. In this work, co-pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) and cellulose was performed in a Py-GC×GC/MS system at 450–600 °C with ratios 70:30, 50:50, and 30:70. Polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were then added to the mixture with different ratios. It was found that co-pyrolysis of PS and cellulose promotes the formation of aromatic products with a large increase in the yield of ethylbenzene as compared to the calculated value from individual feedstock. This indicates interactions between cellulose and PS pyrolysis products. Observations from experiments including more than one type of plastics indicate that the interactions between different plastics are more pronounced than the interaction between plastics and cellulose.  aPublisher supplied data 3acellulose 3aethylbenzene 3afeedstocks 3afuels 3aplastics 3apolyethylene terephthalates 3apolypropylenes 3apolystyrenes 3apyrolysis1 aSandström, Linda1 aJohansson, Ann-Christine1 aYang, Weihong0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Oct. 19, v. 31, no. 10 p.11078-11090dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b018873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03851naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245019000167300001600357520192800373592002802301650002802329650001602357650001302373650001502386650001802401650002002419650001302439650002202452650001902474650001702493650001502510650001202525650001502537650001202552650001402564650002302578650001402601650001102615650001302626650002402639650001202663650003602675650003202711653002202743653001702765653003002782653002402812653002202836653001502858700001702873700005702890700001602947700001802963700001402981700001502995773011203010856008203122852000903204655001203213IND60625223720221119105313.0190411e201903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062522372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fsi.2018.11.0612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Shengnan10aIdentification and functional characterization of grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 and its soluble form with potentiality for targeting inflammation  ap. 393-402.  aTumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) signals through two distinct cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2 in mammals. In the present study, grass carp Tnfr2 (gcTnfr2) was isolated and characterized. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis suggested that gcTnfr2 was a homolog of goldfish and zebrafish Tnfr2. Tissue distribution assay showed gctnfr2 transcripts were expressed in all examined tissues similar to gctnfr1. To functionally characterize the newly cloned molecule, gcTnfr2 was overexpressed in COS7 cell lines and it showed the ability to mediate the recombinant grass carp Tnf (rgcTnf)-α-triggered NF-κΒ activity and gcil1b promoter activity, clarifying its role in mediating Tnf-α signaling. The recombinant soluble form of gcTnfr2 (rgcsTnfr2) was prepared and it was able to interact with rgcTnf-α with higher affinity than that of rgcsTnfr1. Moreover, grass carp soluble Tnfr2 (gcsTnfr2) were detected in the culture medium of grass carp head kidney leukocytes (HKLs) and heat-inactivated A. hydrophila challenge significantly induced its production, indicating involvement of gcsTnfr2 in inflammation response. In agreement with this notion, rgcsTnfr2 effectively antagonized the effect of rgcTnf-α on il1b mRNA expression in HKLs, suggesting anti-Tnf-α property of gcsTnfr2. To strengthen the anti-inflammatory role of soluble Tnfr2, bacteria were injected intraperitoneally in grass carp followed by rgcsTnfr2. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining of head kidney, spleen and intestine showed that rgcsTnfr2 could significantly improve infection-induced histopathological changes. These results functionally identified gcTnfr2 and its soluble form, particularly highlighting the role of gcsTnfr2 against Tnf-α-triggered inflammatory signaling. In this line, rgcsTnfr2 displayed anti-inflammatory potentiality during infection, thereby providing a powerful mediator of inflammation control in fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCtenopharyngodon idella 3aDanio rerio 3abacteria 3acell lines 3aculture media 3agene expression 3agoldfish 3aheat inactivation 3ahistopathology 3ainflammation 3aintestines 3akidneys 3aleukocytes 3amammals 3aphylogeny 3asequence alignment 3ashellfish 3aspleen 3astaining 3atissue distribution 3atissues 3atumor necrosis factor receptors 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aTnf-α receptor 2 0aSoluble form 0aFunctional identification 0aBacterial infection 0aAnti-inflammation 0aGrass carp1 aWang, Xinyan1 aLi, Chenglong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0323-35501 aFeng, Shiyu1 aZhang, Anying1 aYang, Kun1 aZhou, Hong0 tFish & shellfish immunology.g2019 Mar., v. 86 p.393-402dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl4175048x1050-46487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.11.0613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02604naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245007700169300001200246500001100258520122700269592002801496596002201524596004401546596004401590650001601634650001901650650001801669650002401687650001701711650001401728650002101742650003001763650001101793700003501804700001801839700002501857700002701882700005801909773011101967856008302078852000902161655001202170IND60756650620221120191548.0211208e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075665062DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-021-03777-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDi Fino, Luciano10aNitro-fatty acids: electrophilic signaling molecules in plant physiology  ap. 120.  aReview  aMAIN CONCLUSION: Nitro fatty acids (NO2-FA)have relevant physiological roles as signaling molecules in biotic and abiotic stress, growth, and development, but the mechanism of action remains controversial. The two main mechanisms involving nitric oxide release and thiol modification are discussed. Fatty acids (FAs) are major components of membranes and contribute to cellular energetic demands. Besides, FAs are precursors of signaling molecules, including oxylipins and other oxidized fatty acids derived from the activity of lipoxygenases. In addition, non-canonical modified fatty acids, such as nitro-fatty acids (NO₂-FAs), are formed in animals and plants. The synthesis NO₂-FAs involves a nitration reaction between unsaturated fatty acids and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). This review will focus on recent findings showing that, in plants, NO₂-FAs such as nitro-linolenic acid (NO₂-Ln) and nitro-oleic acid (NO₂-OA) have relevant physiological roles as signaling molecules in biotic and abiotic stress, growth, and development. Moreover, since there is controversy on mechanisms of action of NO₂-FAs as signaling molecules, we will provide evidence showing why this aspect needs further evaluation.  aPublisher supplied data  a2013-0800canpcyt  aGM125944cnational institutes of health  aDK112854cnational institutes of health 3aLewis acids 3aabiotic stress 3alipoxygenases 3amechanism of action 3anitric oxide 3aoxylipins 3aplant physiology 3areactive nitrogen species 3athiols1 aArruebarrena Di Palma, Andrés1 aPerk, Enzo A.1 aGarcía-Mata, Carlos1 aSchopfer, Francisco J.1 aLaxalt, Ana M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8225-24410 tPlanta.g2021 Dec., v. 254, no. 6 p.120-120dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl46291x0032-09357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-021-03777-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03150naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245016000209520177800369592002802147650002502175650001602200650002102216650001202237650001302249650001602262650002102278650001702299650002302316650001402339650002102353653002202374653002402396700002002420700005802440700001802498700002002516773010902536856008602645852000902731655001202740IND60744321220221118120016.0211206e20211015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074432122DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1103602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllouzi, Hasna1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9575-432010aSeed-priming with H2O2 alleviates subsequent salt stress by preventing ROS production and amplifying antioxidant defense in cauliflower seeds and seedlings  aIn the present study, we examined the impact of three seed priming agents; H₂O₂, GA₃ and NaCl on the oxidative stress status in primed seed germination dynamics and growth establishment of cauliflower seedlings subsequently grown under salt stress. Results showed beneficial effect of all priming agents in improving plant responses to salinity. However, specific differences, depending on development stage, organ and priming type were recorded. At the germination stage, GA₃ was the most advantageous agent to accelerate seedling emergence. At the seedling stage, seedlings obtained from redried H₂O₂-primed seeds showed the highest level of seed superoxide anion (5-fold) and H₂O₂ (4-fold), resulting in higher MDA content (2.4-fold). At the same time, priming seeds with H₂O₂ triggered the overall seedling antioxidant defense, including enzymatic (SOD, CAT, GPX and APX) and non-enzymatic systems (AsA, GSH and proline). Salinity restricted the growth of both leaves (43%) and roots (60%) of cauliflower seedlings issued from unprimed seeds. Under primed conditions, the relative contribution of GA₃ and NaCl was more associated with growth establishment and osmotic adjustment. However, H₂O₂ role was greatly correlated with the antioxidant defense. Indeed, salt-treated seedlings issued from H₂O₂-primed seeds showed the lowest levels of superoxide anion, H₂O₂ and MDA, resulting in the highest activities of the entire antioxidant systems. These findings support the hypothesis that cauliflower plants, when exposed to salt stress benefit from H₂O₂ seed priming, as a pre-germination stimulus, to prevent itself from subsequent oxidative injuries, which supports the hypothesis of “stress memory” of subsequent salt stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3acauliflower 3aoxidative stress 3aproline 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseed germination 3aseed priming 3aseedling emergence 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide anion 0aHydrogen peroxide 0a“Stress memory”1 aOueslati, Samia1 aHessini, Kamel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8929-92341 aRabhi, Mokded1 aAbdelly, Chedly0 tScientia horticulturae.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 288 p.110360-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4108x0304-42387nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scienta.2021.1103603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02387naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003200151245016800183300001400351520089800365592002801263650001601291650001601307650001201323650001801335650001101353650000901364650001201373650000901385650001701394650001801411650001401429650001301443650001101456650001701467653002501484653003301509653001201542653002001554653001701574653003401591700001901625700002201644700002101666773011101687856008601798852000901884655001201893IND60583973920221119203202.0180831e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058397392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMallampati, Srinivasa Reddy10aSustainable recovery of precious metals from end-of-life vehicles shredder residue by a novel hybrid ball-milling and nanoparticles enabled froth flotation process  ap. 66-75.  aIt is hereby reported a simple, effective and sustainable method for the recovery of precious metals from end-of-life vehicle shredder residue and/or automobile shredder residue based on a hybrid ball-milling and microbubble froth flotation process. A ball-milling treatment of automobile shredder residue along a mixture of Fe/Ca/CaO nanoparticles had as main result the entrapment of precious metals and in subsidiary an improvement of the floatability of the various size fraction particles (1.0, 0.425, and 0.25 mm, respectively). Therefore, a separation of the settled fraction (poor in precious metals) and the floating fraction yielded a recovery of approximately 83–89% precious metals in the latter. Scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy maps of gold (Au), silver (Ag), platinum (Pt), palladium (Pd), Iridium (Ir), and copper (Cu) confirmed that result.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aautomobiles 3acalcium 3acalcium oxide 3acopper 3agold 3airidium 3airon 3amicrobubbles 3ananoparticles 3apalladium 3aplatinum 3asilver 3aspectroscopy 0aEnd-of-life vehicles 0aAutomobile shredder residues 0aE-waste 0aPrecious metals 0aBall-milling 0aNanoparticles froth flotation1 aLee, Byoung Ho1 aMitoma, Yoshiharu1 aSimion, Cristian0 tJournal of cleaner production.g2018 Jan. 10, v. 171 p.66-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:11967x0959-65267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03084naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245011400160520175500274592002802029650002202057650001302079650002502092650001702117650001702134650000902151650001402160650001102174650001702185650001202202650001102214650001502225650002002240650001602260650001402276650001202290650001802302650001202320700002502332700002202357700003302379773012602412856007902538852000902617655001202626IND60790849420221118002818.0220826e20220820xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079084942DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110816162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Yihe 10aActivation and Inhibition of Human Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) by HOCl, Myeloperoxidase and Chloramines  aMatrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9, gelatinase B) plays a key role in the degradation of extracellular-matrix (ECM) proteins in both normal physiology and multiple pathologies, including those linked with inflammation. MMP9 is excreted as an inactive proform (proMMP9) by multiple cells, and particularly neutrophils. The proenzyme undergoes subsequent processing to active forms, either enzymatically (e.g., via plasmin and stromelysin-1/MMP3), or via the oxidation of a cysteine residue in the prodomain (the “cysteine-switch”). Activated leukocytes, including neutrophils, generate O₂⁻ and H₂O₂ and release myeloperoxidase (MPO), which catalyzes hypochlorous acid (HOCl) formation. Here, we examine the reactivity of HOCl and a range of low-molecular-mass and protein chloramines with the pro- and activated forms of MMP9. HOCl and an enzymatic MPO/H₂O₂/Cl⁻ system were able to generate active MMP9, as determined by fluorescence-activity assays and gel zymography. The inactivation of active MMP9 also occurred at high HOCl concentrations. Low (nM—low μM) concentrations of chloramines formed by the reaction of HOCl with amino acids (taurine, lysine, histidine), serum albumin, ECM proteins (laminin and fibronectin) and basement membrane extracts (but not HEPES chloramines) also activate proMMP9. This activation is diminished by the competitive HOCl-reactive species, methionine. These data indicate that HOCl-mediated oxidation and MMP-mediated ECM degradation are synergistic and interdependent. As previous studies have shown that modified ECM proteins can also stimulate the cellular expression of MMP proteins, these processes may contribute to a vicious cycle of increasing ECM degradation during disease development.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasement membrane 3acysteine 3aextracellular matrix 3afibronectins 3agelatinase B 3agels 3ahistidine 3ahumans 3ainflammation 3alaminin 3alysine 3amethionine 3amyeloperoxidase 3aneutrophils 3aoxidation 3aplasmin 3aserum albumin 3ataurine1 aChuang, Christine Y.1 aHawkins, Clare L.1 aDavies, M.

With the aid of tryptophan, graphene can stably disperse in water due to the non-covalent π–π interactions between graphene and tryptophan. By mixing the aqueous dispersion of tryptophan-functionalized graphene and the xylene solution of polypropylene-graft-maleic anhydride (MAPP), a binary phase system was obtained. The graphene nanosheets continuously transferred from water phase into xylene phase as the reaction between MAPP and tryptophan at the water/oil interface proceeded. The structure of the resultant PP-f-graphene nanosheets was carefully characterized by spectroscopy and microscopy methods. The results confirmed that MAPP chains have been successfully bonded onto graphene surfaces. PP/PP-f-graphene nanocomposites were fabricated by melt blending. A well-dispersed PP-f-graphene in PP matrix was realized due to the strong adsorption between graphene and functionalized PP. The addition of only 0.6 wt% of PP-f-graphene increased the tensile strength and flexural modulus of PP by 20.8% and 44.6%, respectively. The crystallization temperature and rate of PP were also elevated by the incorporation of PP-f-graphene. Making use of the interaction between graphene and functionalized PP is a facile method to improve the dispersion of graphene in the PP matrix.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanhydrides 3acrystallization 3agraphene 3amelting 3amicroscopy 3ananocomposites 3ananosheets 3aoils 3apolypropylenes 3astabilizers 3atemperature 3atensile strength 3atryptophan 3axylene1 aWang, Dongrui1 aLi, Xinxin1 aLiu, Meijing1 aHu, G.-H.q(Guo-Hua),1 aDang, Zhi-Min0 tRSC advances.g2014 Jan. 27, v. 4, no. 17 p.8799-8807dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra47112h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03312naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245013800173300001600311520166500327592002801992650001702020650001802037650002902055650001902084650001902103650002602122650001602148650002902164650002102193650001902214650001202233650002002245650001102265650001802276650001202294650001902306650000902325650000802334650001402342650001802356653001802374653002702392653001902419653001802438653002302456653002202479700002502501700002402526773011302550856008602663852000902749655001202758IND60583974120221119202603.0180831e20180110xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058397412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jclepro.2017.09.2842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBordoloi, Nirmali10aEffectiveness of plant growth regulators on emission reduction of greenhouse gas (Nitrous oxide): An approach for cleaner environment  ap. 333-344.  aGlobal climate change is one of the most prominent and complex environmental problems caused by increasing concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Rice paddies are an important anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas approximately 298 times stronger than carbon dioxide. Identifying a suitable mitigation method for N2O emissions from rice agriculture, while maintaining optimum crop productivity is strongly needed. A 2-year field study was conducted on rice to assess N2O emissions in response to the application of different plant growth regulators (PGRs). The PGRs abscisic acid (ABA) and cytozyme (20 mg L⁻¹), kinetin (10 and 20 mg L⁻¹) and wet tea extract (1:20 w/w) along with distilled water as control were sprayed at the tillering and panicle initiation stages of rice. Compared with control treatment, exogenously applied ABA and kinetin (10 and 20 mg L⁻¹) significantly (p < 0.01) reduced N2O emission primarily through regulation of leaf growth, stomatal frequency, and xylem vessel size of rice plants. Cytozyme and kinetin improved the grain yield through efficient photosynthesis. Leaf area index, tiller number, leaf photosynthesis, and transpiration were found to be directly associated (p < 0.05) with N2O emission.

Soybean is an important economic crop affected by waterlogging stress. The current study investigates the effects of waterlogging stress on the leaf physiology and yield of two soybean varieties (Kenfeng 14, waterlogging-tolerant and Kenfeng 16, waterlogging-sensitive) and the mitigation effect of uniconazole (S3307) in promoting growth and productivity under waterlogging conditions. The results showed that waterlogging stress increased antioxidant enzyme activity and decreased the contents of non-enzymatic antioxidants such as AsA and GSH. Furthermore, the content of MDA and H₂O₂ increased significantly, indicating oxidative stress and O₂⁻· production rate also improved, and the increase in the waterlogging-sensitive variety Kenfeng 16 was greater than that of the waterlogging-tolerant variety Kenfeng 14. Spraying S3307, however, increased the activities of antioxidants such as SOD, POD, CAT, and APX. GR, MDHAR, and DHAR increased the content of non-enzymatic antioxidants, effectively inhibited the increase of MDA, H₂O₂ content, and O₂⁻· production rate, and alleviated the loss of yield factors caused by waterlogging stress. The waterlogging-tolerant variety Kenfeng 14 recovered better than the waterlogging-sensitive variety Kenfeng 16. In summary, S3307 ameliorated the effects of waterlogging stress on the physiological characteristics of soybean leaves and improved yield as a result of improved antioxidant defense mechanisms that impeded lipid peroxidation. Thus, S3307 could decelerate the damages caused by waterlogging stress to some extent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidant enzymes 3acrop production 3aenzyme activity 3aleaves 3alipid peroxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological response 3aplant physiology 3asoybeans 3auniconazole 0aSoybean 0aEnzymatic defense system 0aAsA–GSH cycle 0aYield1 aZhou, Hang1 aFeng, Naijie1 aXiang, Hongtao1 aLiu, Yang1 aWang, Feng1 aLi, Wan1 aFeng, Shengjie1 aLiu, Meiling1 aZheng, Dianfeng0 tJournal of plant physiology.g2022 Jan., v. 268 p.153579-dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl39020x0176-16177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jplph.2021.1535793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02277naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012600167300002000293520103400313592002801347650002101375650001501396650001201411650000901423650001501432650002001447650002501467650001901492650001301511650001401524650001601538650001901554700001601573700001901589700001301608700001401621700001501635773010701650856008901757852000901846655001201855IND60583581020221119181940.0171019e20171019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058358102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.7b018952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDong, Yan10aNovel Method of Ultralow SO2 Emission for CFB Boilers: Combination of Limestone Injection and Activated Carbon Adsorption  ap. 11481-11488.  aCirculating fluidized bed coal-fired boilers that adopt conventional measures of improving desulfurization efficiency exhibit difficulty in achieving ultralow SO₂ emission. To solve this problem, our team originally proposed a desulfurization process of limestone injection into furnace with desulfurization of activated carbon (AC) in the rear. In this process, most of the SO₂ in furnace is initially removed. The rest is transported to the AC desulfurization device and adsorbed by AC. The utilized AC is then thermally regenerated. The SO₂ released by thermal regeneration is sent back to the furnace and is ultimately removed by limestone. AC adsorption and desorption experiments are conducted in this study. Furthermore, the parameters of the process are optimized, and the economic feasibility of the process is assessed. Compared with that of two-stage desulfurization, the cost of the proposed process is higher but still affordable. Therefore, the process is economically affordable and technologically feasible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated carbon 3aadsorption 3aboilers 3acoal 3adesorption 3adesulfurization 3aeconomic feasibility 3afluidized beds 3afurnaces 3alimestone 3amethodology 3asulfur dioxide1 aLi, Yuzhong1 aZhang, Liqiang1 aCui, Lin1 aZhang, Bo1 aDong, Yong0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Oct. 19, v. 31, no. 10 p.11481-11488dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.7b018953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02610naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245009200162520136100254592002801615650001301643650001001656650001301666650001401679650002901693650002101722650001701743650001101760650001801771650001101789650001301800650002201813650001601835650002201851650002801873700002301901700003301924700001701957773012601974856007902100852000902179655001202188IND60790849620221118002843.0220826e20220722xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079084962DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox110814192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLipert, Anna 14aThe Effect of Herbal Supplements on Blood Pressure: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis  aHerbal supplements rich in phenolic compounds are evidenced to have a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, they are suggested to be included in diets for people with hypertension (HT). HT is a global health problem and is estimated to affect billions of people until the end of 2025. For this reason, every possible and effective solution preventing HT should be considered. The aim was to perform an updated meta-analysis and review of recently published studies to evaluate the effect of selected herbal supplements on blood pressure reduction. We searched the PubMed database with specified selection criteria, analysing the RCT studies from 2011 to 2021. A total of 31 studies were included in the analysis, and the meta-analysis was conducted on the data from 16 of them. The general effect size of all the supplements via placebo was d = 1.45, p < 0.05 for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and d = 0.31, p < 0.05 for diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The meta-analysis and review of the literature demonstrated that herbal supplements, such as resveratrol, cherry juice, beetroot juice, bergamot extracts, barberry, and pycnogenol, can be effective in blood pressure reduction and cardiovascular prevention, but attention should be paid to their appropriate dosage due to the possibility of side effects from the digestive system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBerberis 3abeets 3acherries 3adatabases 3adiastolic blood pressure 3adigestive system 3ahypertension 3ajuices 3ameta-analysis 3apeople 3aplacebos 3aprotective effect 3aresveratrol 3asystematic review 3asystolic blood pressure1 aSzadkowska, Iwona 1 aMatusiak-Wieczorek, Ewelina 1 aKochan, Ewa 0 tAntioxidants.g2022 July 22, v. 11, no. 8dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox110814193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011200168300001600280520238000296592002802676650001302704650001102717650000902728650002002737650001402757650001602771650003002787650000902817650001502826650001402841650001302855650002102868650001202889650001702901650001102918650001602929650002002945650001802965650001602983650001502999651001703014651001003031700001503041700001603056700001503072700001903087700001403106700001603120773008503136856008703221852000903308655001203317IND60085122520221119015457.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008512252DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.03.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSacchi, E.10aOrigin and fate of nitrates in groundwater from the central Po plain: Insights from isotopic investigations  ap. 164-180.  aOriginal data and information from recent studies are presented with the goal of identifying the N sources, sinks, major transformations and sites of accumulation within groundwater of the Lombardy plain. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of stable isotopes (δ15NNO3, δ18ONO3 and δ11B) in fulfilling these objectives. The area covered by this study accounts for about 18% of the Po catchment and 30% of the Po plain area. Nitrates in groundwater are not homogeneously distributed: concentrations >50mgL−1 are often observed at the Alpine foothills, while values below 25mgL−1 characterise other areas, especially the lower plain. An inventory of the potential N sources is conducted, revealing a complex pattern, as the distribution of nitrates in groundwater does not fully match the distribution of any of the identified N sources. In the higher plain, groundwater contamination is favoured by (i) the high permeability of the unsaturated zone and of the aquifer; (ii) the great depth of the water table; (iii) intensive cattle raising and the consequent manure effluents; (iv) the large amount of water used for irrigation. Stable isotopes of dissolved nitrates indicate the absence of denitrification, while the coupled use of B isotopes evidences, even in rural areas, a contribution from septic effluents. At the transition between the higher and the lower plain, in the so called “spring belt”, substantial recycling to the surface of the contaminated groundwater occurs, affecting the N content of surface water. Denitrification is evidenced in the lower plain both by hydrochemical (Fe, Mn) and isotopic tools, and is favoured by a shallow water table, within 5m of the surface. Denitrification is estimated to remove about 40–60% of the initial nitrates from groundwater in maize fields, and up to 80% in rice fields.The findings suggest that, in order to limit the N export to the Po river and ultimately to the Adriatic Sea, groundwater contamination first needs to be remediated. The amount of N estimated to be stored in the higher plain is about 370,000t as N–NO3- or about 1tha−1. If only agricultural N is regarded as a source, this stock would result from approximately 15a of surplus N accumulation. If mitigation only targets the agricultural N surplus, recovery times in the order of decade(s) are to be expected for the aquifers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acattle 3acorn 3adenitrification 3aeffluents 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3airon 3airrigation 3amanganese 3anitrates 3anitrogen content 3apaddies 3apermeability 3arivers 3arural areas 3astable isotopes 3asurface water 3awater table 3awatersheds 3aAdriatic Sea 3aItaly1 aAcutis, M.1 aBartoli, M,1 aBrenna, S.1 aDelconte, C.A.1 aLaini, A.1 aPennisi, M.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2013 July, v. 34 p.164-180dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.03.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02342naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009000166520116500256592002801421650001201449650001101461650000901472650001601481650001601497650001201513650000901525651001001534653002201544653001601566653001901582653002701601653002701628700001201655700001501667700001701682700001701699773011901716856008801835852000901923655001201932IND60727065320221123033607.0220205e20210615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072706532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Yuan10aHealth risks from groundwater arsenic on residents in northern China coal-rich region  aShanxi Province of northern China is a typical mining concentration and arsenism area. Years of mining activities have resulted in serious regional groundwater problems in Shanxi. Therefore, it is of great significance to know the health risk of groundwater arsenic on residents under the background of mining activities. Kriging interpolation was used to illustrate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the health risks on groundwater arsenic based on a ten-year investigation. The groundwater arsenic concentrations decreased over time and the distribution of high arsenic concentrations shrank. High arsenic concentrations were mainly distributed in the northern and middle basin areas. The forecasted area of high risks in coal mining areas was 5623 km², which was larger than that in non-coal mining areas. The residents living around mining areas were more vulnerable to exposure to groundwater arsenic. Further, the output map outlines the high-risk zones in order to protect the safety of drinking water for residents. This study may be helpful for the policy-makers to adopt a lower limit for groundwater arsenic to the worst affected regions and groups.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarsenic 3abasins 3acoal 3aenvironment 3agroundwater 3akriging 3arisk 3aChina 0aArsenic poisoning 0aCoal mining 0aDrinking water 0aExposure to pollutants 0aHealth risk assessment1 aLi, Ji,1 aMi, Wujuan1 aXie, Shulian1 aBi, Yonghong0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 15, v. 773 p.145003-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03806naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001100153245011600164300001600280520233900296592002802635650002902663650001302692650001502705650001202720650001502732650001402747650001602761650001502777650001602792650002202808650001302830650001302843650001002856650001102866650001702877650001302894650001302907650001102920650001602931650001802947651001202965700001502977700002402992700001503016700001903031700001703050700001603067773008503083856008703168852000903255655001203264IND60085122620221119015309.0160903e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008512262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.03.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRe, V.10aProcesses affecting groundwater quality in arid zones: The case of the Bou-Areg coastal aquifer (North Morocco)  ap. 181-198.  aThe coastal aquifer of Bou-Areg (Morocco) has been studied to identify the main processes causing groundwater salinization, using a multi tracer (general chemistry and isotopes – δ2H, δ18O, δ13C, δ15NNO3, δ18ONO3) geochemical approach. Groundwater is characterized by the widespread occurrence of brackish waters (TDS<500mgL−1) with high cation contents, which are balanced by elevated dissolved NO3- (reaching a maximum of 208mgL−1) and Cl−. Lagoon samples represent a mixture of fresh water and sea water, showing a Na/Cl ratio in agreement with that of sea water and an excess of Ca. The high Ca values represent the main peculiarity of the groundwater–lagoon water system. Two types of groundwater could be identified: (i) freshwater, separated from the whole system and located at the limit of the irrigated area, characterized by low TDS, depleted isotopic composition and relatively high quality; and (ii) water mainly recharged by mountain runoff, interacting with local recharge and acquiring salinity from different sources, thus creating a complex system of dilute waters. Hydrochemical results confirm that the high salinity of the aquifer is caused by the coexistence of dissolution of evaporate rocks and carbonates from Miocene strata, water–rock interaction, and human impacts due to agricultural return flows. The latter represents the main contribution to groundwater salinization, especially in the central part of the aquifer, as well as one of the main causes of the general increase in NO3- concentrations. Only locally, in the southern part of the aquifer, close to the city of Kariat Arkmane, the high salinization observed may be attributed to the presence of lagoon water intrusion. The isotopic composition of dissolved NO3- indicates manure and septic effluents, especially in urban areas and in the central part of the plain, and synthetic fertilizers in the agricultural zone as the main drivers for human induced pollution. The study shows that agricultural return flow has significantly modified the chemistry of the system and it is a prime example of the human-induced changes over coastal environments. Saline water intrusion from the lagoon in the shallow aquifer is negligible, while discharge of polluted groundwater into the lagoon has been found to partially alter its quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquifers 3aarid zones 3acalcium 3acarbonates 3aeffluents 3afertilizers 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3airrigated farming 3aisotopes 3anitrates 3arocks 3arunoff 3asaline water 3asalinity 3aseawater 3asodium 3aurban areas 3awater quality 3aMorocco1 aSacchi, E.1 aMartin-Bordes, J.L.1 aAureli, A.1 aEl Hamouti, N.1 aBouchnan, R.1 aZuppi, G.M.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2013 July, v. 34 p.181-198dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01851naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002100112245005900133300001400192500001900206520078200225592002801007650002601035650001201061650001701073650001501090650001801105650001301123650001701136653001101153653001401164653001601178653001701194700001601211700001401227700001201241700002001253700001901273773015201292852000901444655001201453IND60723685920221117160821.0210117e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072368592DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, V.

In the present study, the optimization process for the luminescence production of a newly isolated Photobacterium sp. NAA-MIE using response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) is investigated. RSM and ANN are the most favored techniques and efficient methods for the optimization of medium components, especially for nonlinear systems. This analysis presents the comparative evaluation between RSM and ANN aimed at their particular empirical modeling and predictive ability. RSM predicted the optimized condition with four major variables at glycerol concentration of 0.16%, NaCl of 2.49%, pH at 7.4 and tryptone of 2.97% with 260,748.94 RLU of the maximum luminescence production. The accuracy of the RSM model equations was measured with R² of 0.9001 and adjusted R² of 0.8001. ANN predicted optimum condition at a glycerol concentration of 0.10%, NaCl of 2.46%, pH at 7.5 and tryptone of 1.97% with 237,481.32 RLU. The study demonstrated that ANN accomplishes more than RSM with a higher R² value of 0.968 and low mean percentage error and root mean square error, which were 0.003 and 3.66, respectively. Both models are presented as suitable predictive models on the basis of mathematical modeling to optimize and improve biological systems for future upscaling processes with ANN as more predictive and having more fitting potentiality compared to RSM.  aPublisher supplied data  a(GP-IPM/2017/9532800)cPutra Grant  a(6300893-10201)cYayasan Pak Rashid Grant UPM 3aPhotobacterium 3abioassays 3abioluminescence 3aglycerol 3aneural networks 3apH 3aresponse surface methodology 3atryptones 3aIndia1 aHalmi, Mohd Izuan Effendi1 aGani, Siti Salwa Abd1 aZaidan, Uswatun Hasanah1 aOthman, Radziah1 aShukor, Mohd Yunus Abd0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, India, Section B: biological sciences.g2020 Oct., v. 90, no. 4 p.797-810dSpringer IndiawJournal:20704x0369-82117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40011-019-01154-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02709naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007800170300001600248520103800264536010801302592002801410596005901438650002401497650001101521650001301532650000901545650001101554650001201565650001301577650003301590650002301623650001601646650001801662650001801680653001501698653002801713653002601741653001201767653002901779653003401808700002201842700002101864700002301885700002101908700002401929700002101953773011101974856008502085852000902170655001202179IND60636829820221121042855.0190411e20190125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063682982DNAL7 a10.1080/07373937.2018.14446352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPawlak, Tomasz10aMicrowave vacuum drying and puffing of the meat tissue - process analysis  ap. 156-163.  aTenderization based on papain and microwave vacuum drying and puffing (MVDP) as well as adequate processing conditions enabled expansion of slices of the raw meat tissue. The main aim of the study was to use the response surface method and find the conditions of puffing that could maximize the expansion of meat during MVDP. The bound was set on the expansion: the most expanded puffings should be of good quality, including a desirable porous structure. The best combination of values of the MVDP process conditions (e.g., the initial moisture content in meat slices, microwave energy, and the vacuum absolute pressure) was found during experiments using the central composite design. The volume of slices puffed under these conditions was 1.60–1.78 times greater than the volume of slices before MVDP, and the sensory quality index remained acceptable. The research showed that pretreatment reduced the hardness of sample by over 25% and increased its crispiness, which was confirmed in cryo-scanning electron microscopy images.  aThis work was supported by the Poznań University of Life Sciences, Poland [The fund number 508-52-11].  aPublisher supplied data  a508-52-11cPoznań University of Life Sciences, Poland 3aelectron microscopy 3aenergy 3ahardness 3ameat 3apapain 3apuffing 3araw meat 3aresponse surface methodology 3asensory properties 3atenderizing 3avacuum drying 3awater content 0aMeat snack 0amicrowave vacuum drying 0aprocessing conditions 0apuffing 0aquality of puffed snacks 0aresponse surface method (RSM)1 aGawałek, Jolanta1 aRyniecki, Antoni1 aStangierski, Jerzy1 aSiatkowski, Idzi1 aPeplińska, Barbara1 aPospiech, Edward0 tDrying technology.g2019 Jan. 25, v. 37, no. 2 p.156-163dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12238x1532-23007nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07373937.2018.14446353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245017100184300001800355520146400373592002801837650002101865650001801886650002601904650002401930650000901954650001901963650001101982653002101993653000802014653002602022653001102048700002002059700001802079700001902097700002202116700001902138773013902157856008202296852000902378655001202387IND60516270720221118042941.0190726e20130928xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051627072DNAL7 a234111522pmid7 a10.1017/S00071145130002022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuhn, Tilman,10aFish consumption and the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke in the German arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC-Germany)  ap. 1118-1125.  aRecent meta-analyses have confirmed that fish consumption is related to decreased risks of ischaemic stroke and fatal CHD, while there seem to be no clear associations between fish consumption and the risks of haemorrhagic stroke and non-fatal CHD. As no studies in German populations have been reported to date, we assessed whether fish consumption as recorded by FFQ between 1994 and 1998 was related to incident myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke within the German arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted based on the data of 48 315 participants aged 35–65 years at baseline. The median fish intake was 16·4 g/d (25th–75th percentile 8·2–28·8 g/d). During a mean follow-up of 8·1 years, 605 incident MI and 525 incident strokes have been documented. After multiple adjustment, fish consumption was not related to incident MI (hazard ratio (HR) 0·84, 95 % CI 0·66, 1·08, Pₜᵣₑₙd= 0·21) or stroke (HR 0·96, 95 % CI 0·73, 1·26, Pₜᵣₑₙd= 0·67). Separate analyses for fatal MI, ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke did not show significant associations, either. With regard to non-fatal MI, there was a non-significant trend for an inverse association (HR 0·78, 95 % CI 0·59, 1·03, Pₜᵣₑₙd= 0·07). Overall, fish consumption was not related to the risks of MI and stroke in the EPIC-Germany study.  aPublisher supplied data 3afish consumption 3ameta-analysis 3amyocardial infarction 3aregression analysis 3arisk 3arisk reduction 3astroke 0aFish consumption 0aCVD 0aMyocardial infarction 0aStroke1 aTeucher, Birgit1 aKaaks, Rudolf1 aBoeing, Heiner1 aWeikert, Cornelia1 aBuijsse, Brian0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 Sept. 28, v. 110, no. 6 p.1118-1125dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130002023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245011800173520168300291592002801974650001302002650002202015650001202037650003102049650002102080650001602101650001902117650001202136650001302148650001402161650001102175650001102186650001302197650001802210650001502228651001002243653001202253653001902265653001502284653001002299653001402309653001302323700001902336700001702355700001702372700002002389700002202409773011902431856008802550852000902638655001202647IND60727065620221123033449.0220103e20210610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072706562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeeraert, Naomi10aInvestigating the link between Pearl River-induced eutrophication and hypoxia in Hong Kong shallow coastal waters  aWe present geochemical analysis of 75 surface water samples collected in 2016 in Hong Kong coastal waters. We found that nitrogen distribution around Hong Kong can be characterized by two regimes driven by the influence of the Pearl River: 1) a regime where nitrate is the dominant species of nitrogen, associated with lower salinity and more faecal coliform and 2) a regime where dissolved organic nitrogen is dominant, associated with higher salinity and fewer faecal coliform. While the impact of the Pearl River on Hong Kong coastal waters is well characterized, we used the sharp contrast between the nitrogen regimes to produce new evidence about the role of the Pearl River on the generation of local hypoxia in Hong Kong. The impact of nitrate originating from the Pearl River on the generation of hypoxia in Hong Kong might be less important than previously thought, as no sign of eutrophication was found within the zones dominated by dissolved organic nitrogen and an historical decoupling of surface processes and bottom water oxygenation was observed. Moreover, we measured elevated ammonium levels and rapid cycling of ammonium and dissolved organic nitrogen in Victoria Harbour suggesting local sources, such as wastewater, might be rapidly oxidized and thus play an important role in the consumption of oxygen locally. A first-order calculation highlighted the potential for wastewater to drive the observed seasonal decline in oxygen. Taken together, these evidences suggest that eutrophication might not be the primary driver in the generation of seasonal hypoxia and that oxidation of ammonium released locally might play a bigger role than initially thought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium 3acoliform bacteria 3adecline 3adissolved organic nitrogen 3adominant species 3aenvironment 3aeutrophication 3ahypoxia 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3arivers 3asalinity 3asurface water 3awastewater 3aChina 0aHypoxia 0aEutrophication 0aPear River 0aChina 0aPollution 0aNitrogen1 aArchana, Anand1 aXu, Min Nina1 aKao, Shuh-Ji1 aBaker, David M.1 aThibodeau, Benoit0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 10, v. 772 p.145007-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03098naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245016400169520161900333592002801952650001301980650001601993650001502009650001002024650002502034650002602059650001802085650001802103650000902121650002002130650001402150650001802164650001702182650001302199651001002212653001502222653002302237653001502260653001602275653001802291653002602309700001702335700001602352700002002368773011902388856008802507852000902595655001202604IND60727065720221123033537.0220103e20210620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072706572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalvo, Sara10aPesticide contamination in water and sediment of the aquatic systems of the Natural Park of the Albufera of Valencia (Spain) during the rice cultivation period  aThe Natural Park of the Albufera (Valencia, Spain) is a Mediterranean wetland where rice cultivation dominates the agricultural activity. The purpose of this study was to offer broader information about the current state of the wetland assessing the contamination by pesticides in four aquatic habitats during the rice cultivation period in 2016. Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS) was used to determine the pesticides in water and sediment samples from the rice fields, Lake Albufera and irrigation and outlet channels. 21 pesticides were detected in our samples (seven already forbidden by European legislation). Higher values than 10000 ng L⁻¹ of accumulated pesticides had been observed in the water samples of the midterm of the cultivation period (July). The sediment samples presented values ten times lower than the water samples. The habitat showed significant differences in the concentrations of the water and sediment samples (Two-way Permanova, p < 0.05) at the end and in the midterm of the cultivation period, respectively. Bentazone and tricyclazole were the dominant and most ubiquitous pesticides in the habitats. The quantities also calculated in real water volume showed that the rice fields and Lake Albufera supported more than 100 kg of pesticides in July. Finally, negative effects in the phytoplankton and some taxa of the biota of the Natural Park were predicted in the risk assessment (Risk Quotient >1). The data provided in this work should show concern about the impact of pesticides in Mediterranean systems subjugated to agricultural pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3abentazon 3aenvironment 3airrigation 3alakes 3alaws and regulations 3aliquid chromatography 3aphytoplankton 3arelative risk 3arice 3arisk assessment 3asediments 3aspectrometers 3atricyclazole 3awetlands 3aSpain 0aHerbicides 0aHydrological cycle 0aFungicides 0aRice fields 0aRisk quotient 0aMediterranean wetland1 aRomo, Susana1 aSoria, Juan1 aPicó, Yolanda,0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 June 20, v. 774 p.145009-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.1450093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04268naa a2200697 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004600113040001800159100001300177245010900190300001800299520212700317592002802444650000802472650002202480650001302502650001302515650001102528650001402539650002102553650001302574650002302587650001202610650001402622650002802636650001002664650001202674650001402686650001202700650001402712650005602726650001202782650002702794650004302821650004002864650002702904650003602931650002302967650000902990650002802999650004503027650004303072650003303115650004603148653001303194653001603207653001403223653001603237653002103253700001703274700001903291700002003310700001703330773010903347856009303456852000903549655001203558IND50063022420221123024446.0190318e20130401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006302242DNAL7 a234532532pmid7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.06.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGibb, Z.10aQuercetin improves the postthaw characteristics of cryopreserved sex-sorted and nonsorted stallion sperm  ap. 1001-1009.  aExcessive reactive oxygen species generation during sex sorting and cryopreservation of stallion sperm leads to DNA fragmentation, lipid peroxidation, and motility loss. In this study we investigated whether antioxidant supplementation during sex sorting and cryopreservation could ameliorate the effects of reactive oxygen species on stallion sperm. In experiment 1, the postthaw characteristics of stallion sperm (N = 9) cryopreserved in the presence or absence of catalase (200 U/mL), cysteine (0.2 mg/mL), or quercetin (0.15 mM) was examined. Motility and acrosome integrity were assessed at 0, 1, and 3 hours after thawing. The sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA; detectable DNA fragmentation index [DFI], mean DFI, and DFI) was used to assess DNA integrity immediately after thawing. Quercetin increased the total postthaw motility (25.3% vs. 20.9%; P < 0.05), but there was no beneficial effect of catalase or cysteine. Based on these results, the effect of quercetin during cryopreservation on the postthaw zona binding ability of sperm was assessed using a heterologous (bovine) zona binding assay. Quercetin increased the number of sperm bound per oocyte (13.6 vs. 9.2; P < 0.05) compared with the control. In experiment 2, the effect of quercetin (0.15 mM) in the media used during semen storage and transport, Hoechst 33342 staining and cryopreservation of stallion sperm (N = 9) was investigated. Motility, acrosome integrity, and viability were assessed at 0, 1, and 3 hours after thawing and SCSA was performed at 0 hours after thawing. Quercetin supplementation during sex sorting and cryopreservation improved DNA integrity (SCSA; detectable DFI of 54.9% vs. 74.6%, P < 0.05; mean DFI of 270.2 vs. 288.1, P < 0.05; and DFI of 26.3% vs. 28.5%, P < 0.05) compared with control sex-sorted sperm. There was no beneficial effect of quercetin on the motility, acrosome integrity, or viability of sex-sorted sperm. In conclusion, quercetin significantly improved the motility and zona binding ability of cryopreserved stallion sperm, and reduced DNA fragmentation in sex-sorted, cryopreserved stallion sperm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacrosome 3acatalase 3acattle 3achromatin 3acryopreservation 3acysteine 3alipid peroxidation 3aoocytes 3aquercetin 3areactive oxygen species 3asemen 3asorting 3astallions 3athawing 3aviability 2aAcrosomexdrug effectsxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aAnimals 2aCatalasexpharmacology 2aCryopreservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aCryoprotective Agentsxpharmacology 2aCysteinexpharmacology 2aDNA Fragmentationxdrug effects 2aHorsesxphysiology 2aMale 2aQuercetinxpharmacology 2aSemen Preservationxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSex Preselectionxmethodsxveterinary. 2aSperm Motilityxdrug effects 2aZona Pellucidaxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 0aStallion 0aSex sorting 0aQuercetin 0aAntioxidant 0aCryopreservation1 aButler, T.J.1 aMorris, L.H.A.1 aMaxwell, W.M.C.1 aGrupen, C.G.0 tTheriogenology.g2013 Apr. 01, v. 79, no. 6 p.1001-1009dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2012.06.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02093naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001700112245011300129300001600242500001900258520105000277592002801327650001701355650001101372650001601383650001701399650001501416650000901431650001801440651001001458653001201468653001801480653001501498653001401513653001201527700001701539773015401556852000901710655001201719IND60723686620221120120622.0210117e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072368662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDevi, Sugani10aQuality of muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) as influenced by plant spacing and levels of pruning under greenhouse  ap. 121-123.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aA study was carried out to determine the quality of muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) as influenced by plant spacing and levels of pruning under greenhouse during 2011 at Sardarkurshinagar, Gujarat, and consisting 12 treatments laid out in a completely randomized block design with factorial concept.

It is well known that adhesion strength becomes significantly reduced in a moist environment. To understand the mechanisms at the electronic structure level, we perform atomic dynamics simulations on various Al and epoxy resin interface systems with water molecules inserted in the contact region. In accordance with experimental conditions, the Al layer is surface-oxidized to a depth of 10 Å while the bisphenol A type epoxy molecule has both OH and ether groups. Shear deformations are simulated using the hybrid quantum-classical method in which about 1500 atoms at the contact region are treated with density functional theory. For the first time, calculated adhesion strengths compare well with the experimental values. Three types of chemical reactions that affect the adhesion strength occur depending on the terminal functional groups of the Al oxide surface and the water layer formation. Separate calculations confirm small barrier energies for all of the reaction processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3abisphenol A 3achemical reactions 3adeformation 3adensity functional theory 3aepoxides 3amanufacturing 3amoieties1 aUranagase, Masayuki0 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 16, v. 122, no. 31 p.17748-17755dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b035493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03565naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006000151245010600211300001400317500001500331520196900346592002802315650001602343650001802359650002102377650003102398650002302429650002402452650001102476650001802487650002902505650001802534650002602552650002002578650001102598650001602609650002102625651001202646653000802658653002402666653001602690653001102706653001302717653001402730700001802744700001702762700002302779700002002802773010602822856008602928852000903014655001203023IND60540338020221120222025.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054033802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.06.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeltre, Clément1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6423-902710aAssessing soil constituents and labile soil organic carbon by mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy  ap. 41-50.  a2019-12-06  aRecent progress in microphone sensitivity has dramatically increased the performance of Fourier transform mid-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS). This technique offers benefits over reflectance spectroscopy techniques because the level of sample reflectance has little effect on the PAS signal. This also means that it should be advantageous for soil analysis because of its highly opaque nature. However, only a limited number of studies have so far applied FTIR-PAS to soil characterization and investigation is still required into its potential to determine soil organic carbon (SOC) degradability. The objective of this study was to assess the potential of FTIR-PAS for the characterisation of the labile fraction of SOC and more classical soil parameters, such as carbon and clay content, for a range of 36 soils collected from various field experiments in Denmark. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to correlate the collected FTIR-PAS spectra with the proportion of soil organic carbon mineralised after 238 days of incubation at 15 °C and pF 2 (C238d) taken as an indicator of the labile fraction of SOC. Results showed that it is possible to predict total organic carbon content, total nitrogen content and the labile fraction of SOC using FTIR-PAS with an accuracy similar to or better than near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. FTIR-PAS offered the advantage over NIR of allowing identification of chemical compounds that correlated positively or negatively with the labile fraction of SOC. Spectral bands corresponding to aliphatic, methyl, amide III and polysaccharides compounds were positively correlated with C238d, whereas bands corresponding to aromatics, amines, amides II and carboxylic acids were negatively correlated with C238d. In conclusion, FTIR-PAS has proved to be a powerful tool for characterising soil composition and its labile SOC fraction, offering several benefits over reflectance spectroscopy techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acorrelation 3aclay fraction 3anitrogen content 3aphotoacoustic spectroscopy 3aaromatic compounds 3asoil organic carbon 3aamides 3aleast squares 3areflectance spectroscopy 3asoil analysis 3afield experimentation 3apolysaccharides 3aamines 3areflectance 3acarboxylic acids 3aDenmark 0aNIR 0aSoil organic matter 0aSoil carbon 0acarbon 0aFTIR-PAS 0aStability1 aBruun, Sander1 aDu, Changwen1 aThomsen, Ingrid K.1 aJensen, Lars S.0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2014 Oct., v. 77 p.41-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2014.06.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03221naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100002400153245011800177300001600295520205100311592002802362650001202390650001302402650002002415650001002435650001702445650001302462650001102475650002302486650001402509650001602523650001202539650001202551650001302563650001202576700002402588700001702612773008402629856008902713852000902802655001202811IND4465288720221118235919.0141110e20120521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446528872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.02.0272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWoolley, Lindsey D.10aMortality reduction in yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) larval rearing by optimising Artemia feeding regimes  ap. 161-167.  aMortality is a major concern in larval fish rearing during exogenous feeding. An important cause of mortality of larval yellowtail kingfish (Seriola lalandi) during the rotifer — Artemia weaning period was hypothesised as being due to larval sinking response after satiated feeding prior to dusk. This paper documents the effect of larval body density change under different Artemia feeding regimes and adds to the understanding of the cause of mortality of yellowtail kingfish larvae. The change in body density was used as a tool to determine the time of last feed in a day to ensure larvae were neutrally buoyant at dusk. An adaptive Artemia feeding regime was implemented, in which the amount of feed applied to the larvae was modified based on the body density. Larvae were denser than the seawater in which they were reared when fully satiated with Artemia. The time required to return to pre-feeding density significantly decreased with larval age. At 12days post hatch (dph), the peak in body density of larvae fed Artemia to satiation was 1.0320gcm⁻³ and they did not return to a pre-feeding body density (1.0260gcm⁻³), for approximately 10h. By 19dph, larval body density only increased to 1.0275gcm⁻³ when larvae were fully satiated and they were neutrally buoyant again by 4h. The decrease in larval body density when fully satiated at 16dph demonstrated that overfeeding larvae with Artemia should be avoided prior to dusk before this age to maintain neutral buoyancy. The use of the adaptive regime reduced mortality by 20% compared with the control, from 13 to 17dph, without sacrificing larval growth. Transition to Artemia feeding is a critical stage for yellowtail kingfish larvae and mortalities can be significantly reduced during this period by managing the timing of Artemia feeds throughout the day. The strategy of an adaptive feeding method may be considered a novel management tool to prevent larval sinking and associated mortality during the period of weaning from rotifers to Artemia during larval rearing.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aRotifera 3aSeriola lalandi 3afeeds 3afish culture 3ahatching 3alarvae 3alarval development 3amortality 3aoverfeeding 3arearing 3asatiety 3aseawater 3aweaning1 aPartridge, Gavin J.1 aQin, Jian G.0 tAquaculture.g2012 May 21, v. 344-349 p.161-167dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.02.0273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002300137245013000160300001600290500001900306500002000325520171600345592002802061596002202089596003402111596005002145596007902195650002402274650001102298650001102309650001202320650001502332650001402347650002302361650001202384650001402396650001402410650002002424650001402444650002402458700002802482700001802510700005502528773012402583856007102707852000902778655001202787IND60723504620221120120044.0210114e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072350462DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.60922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aA Hamilton, Jamora10aEffects of novaluron ingestion and topical application on German cockroach (Blattella germanica) development and reproduction  ap. 877-885.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Insect growth regulators disrupt insect development and reproduction. Chitin synthesis inhibitors (CSIs) allow the insect to grow normally, but because chitin is an essential component of the cuticle, formation of a new cuticle and ecdysis are prevented and the insect dies. CSIs can also kill embryos by disrupting their normal development. We evaluated the potential utility of novaluron in bait formulations against the German cockroach (Blattella germanica L.). RESULTS: The minimum novaluron intake that interfered with molting and reproduction was assessed by exposing nymphs and adult females to novaluron. Results showed that 1 day of feeding on 0.1% novaluron was sufficient to disrupt molting in nymphs and prevent adult females from developing viable oothecae. The long‐term effects on gravid females were investigated by feeding females 0.1% novaluron for different 5‐day intervals during successive stages of gestation. Results demonstrated that gravid females fed novaluron during any period of gestation were able to produce viable eggs. To determine if ingestion of novaluron affected mating success and fertility of adult males, males were fed novaluron and then allowed to mate with untreated virgin females. Males that fed on novaluron successfully mated, and the females produced viable oothecae. Finally, direct comparisons revealed that novaluron is equally effective by ingestion and topical application. CONCLUSIONS: Novaluron caused mortality in nymphs and interfered with ootheca production in adult females, but only before they formed an ootheca. It successfully reduced German cockroach populations in cages and has potential to be incorporated in cockroach baits.  aPublisher supplied data  cBayer CropScience  cBlanton J.

Both versions adopted Taiwanese anthropometric cut-offs, but T2 further had the BMI item replaced by CC. We compared the ability of the two SF in rating the nutritional status of 2674 elderly Taiwanese in the 1999 ‘Taiwan Longitudinal Survey on Aging’ with their respective full versions. We evaluated the agreement between the SF and full scales with weighted κ and performed Cox regression analysis for the follow-up 4-year mortality according to nutritional status rated at baseline. The results showed that the agreements between the respective SF and the full MNA were good (weighted κ: 0·679 for T1 and 0·667 for T2). Both SF performed well in predicting follow-up 4-year mortality relative to the full MNA. In conclusion, MNA-T1-SF and -T2-SF have good consistency with the full MNA and have quite comparable abilities in rating the nutritional status of elderly Taiwanese. Both SF versions appear appropriate for functioning as stand-alone units for rating the nutritional status of the elderly in community-living settings or the general population.  aPublisher supplied data 3abody mass index 3acalf circumference 3acohort studies 3aelderly 3alongitudinal studies 3amortality 3anutrition assessment 3anutritional status 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3aTaiwan 0aMini-Nutritional Assessment 0aNutritional assessment 0aMalnutrition 0aElderly 0aTaiwan1 aChang, Tsui-Lan1 aWang, Jiun-Yi0 tBritish journal of nutrition.g2013 Sept. 28, v. 110, no. 6 p.1126-1132dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl45200x1475-26627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00071145130003663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03601naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012300187300001600310520178000326592002802106650001402134650001502148650002502163650001002188650002302198650002202221650001102243650001402254650002202268650001702290650002602307650001302333650001502346650001202361650001202373650003702385650002302422650004502445650002802490650004502518650002802563650002302591650002202614650004702636650002702683650002402710650002602734650004702760651001802807651001302825700001902838773008502857856004802942852000902990655001202999IND50069550120221120062156.0130928e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006955012DNAL7 a234562422pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-013-2624-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, Laura J.10aIntraspecific variation overrides origin effects in impacts of litter-derived secondary compounds on larval amphibians  ap. 449-459.  aSecondary compounds leached from plant litter can negatively affect aquatic amphibian larvae. Non-native plants and their potentially distinct secondary compounds may constitute cryptic threats to native amphibians. We used the availability of both native and introduced Phragmites australis (common reed) populations in North America to assess the importance of origin, intraspecific variation, and two purified classes of compounds (tannins and saponins; gradients 0-25 mg L(-1)) on two common and widespread amphibians (Ambystoma maculatum, spotted salamander, and Lithobates palustris, pickerel frog). In experiments with purified compounds, high tannin concentrations reduced A. maculatum survival and developmental rate while high saponin concentrations reduced survival, developmental rate, and size of L. palustris and reduced A. maculatum developmental rate. In experiments using leaf litter extracts of 14 different P. australis populations, A. maculatum larval survival varied among populations but plant origin (native or introduced) did not explain this variation. In contrast to the lack of effects of purified saponins, increases in saponin concentrations in P. australis leachates significantly decreased A. maculatum survival. Our results suggest: (1) secondary compounds can impact larval amphibian survival and development in species-specific ways; (2) impacts of P. australis on A. maculatum vary among P. australis populations, reflecting intraspecific variation in secondary chemistry; and (3) origin (whether the plant is native or introduced) is a poor predictor of P. australis effects on A. maculatum. Scientists and managers may need to move beyond considering origin as a predictive variable when managing plant communities to benefit amphibians.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmbystoma 3aLithobates 3aPhragmites australis 3afrogs 3aindigenous species 3aintroduced plants 3alarvae 3aleachates 3aplant communities 3aplant litter 3asalamanders and newts 3asaponins 3ascientists 3atannins 2aAnimals 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aIntroduced Species 2aLarvaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aLongevityxdrug effects 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPoaceaexchemistry 2aRandom Allocation 2aRanidaexgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aSaponinsxpharmacology 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTanninsxpharmacology 2aUrodelaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aNorth America 0aNew York1 aBlossey, Bernd0 tOecologia.g2013 Oct., v. 173, no. 2 p.449-459dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-013-2624-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01389naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002600138245012300164300001800287520032400305592002800629650001300657650002300670650002300693650002600716650002700742650001100769650002200780700002500802700002600827773012800853856007300981852000901054655001201063IND60658220420221120025757.0190816e20080409xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065822042DNAL7 a10.1039/b800496j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan der Kamp, Marc W.10aHigh-level QM/MM modelling predicts an arginine as the acid in the condensation reaction catalysed by citrate synthase  ap. 1874-1876.  aHigh-level ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) modelling of citryl-CoA formation in citrate synthase reveals that an arginine residue acts as the proton donor; this proposed new mechanism helps to explain how chemical and large scale conformational changes are coupled in this paradigmatic enzyme.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarginine 3acatalytic activity 3achemical compounds 3acitrate (si)-synthase 3acondensation reactions 3amodels 3aquantum mechanics1 aPerruccio, Francesca1 aMulholland, Adrian J.0 tChemical communications.g2008 Apr. 9, , no. 16 p.1874-1876dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b800496j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02991naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245009000165300001800255520169500273592002801968650002201996650001902018650001702037650001702054650001702071650002102088650002902109650001402138650001302152650001102165650002202176650001502198650001402213650001302227650002102240651001002261651001102271700001502282700002002297700001402317773011202331856008102443852000902524655001202533IND60441817020221121220005.0151027e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6044181702DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-015-0950-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaiamonte, G.10aAgricultural landscapes and biodiversity conservation: a case study in Sicily (Italy)  ap. 3201-3216.  aThe diversity of life is made up not only of the diversity of plants and animal species, habitats and ecosystems, but also of the diversity of human cultures. These diversities interact with one another in complex ways and express the mutual adaptation between humans and the environment at local level. Sicilian traditional agro-ecosystems, due to the history of the territory and the resulting social and economic context, are configured in a heterogeneous mosaic rich in residual features of environmental value, which enhance the connectivity of the ecological network and support a high proportion of species that are rare or of conservation concern. As a case study we analyzed the characteristics of the cultural and natural landscape of the Madonie Mountains (Sicily), acknowledged as one of the most relevant biodiversity hotspots in the Mediterranean. In a G.I.S. environment, we created a digital naturalness grid map and a floristic map including extensive data collected in field. We measured landscape naturalness degree, using the Naturalness Evaluation Index, and analysed its relationship with plant species distribution. We produce evidence that the cultural processes that shape a traditional landscape can foster an amount of specific richness disproportionate to the area covered. The presence of even limited surfaces with remnant semi-natural vegetation cover, scattered within the agricultural land mosaic, positively affects biodiversity. Therefore, we suggest that environmental management plans and policies aimed at nature and biodiversity conservation should take into account not only natural and semi-natural habitats but also the key role of agro-ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aagroecosystems 3abiodiversity 3abiogeography 3acase studies 3aecological value 3aenvironmental management 3agrid maps 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alandscapes 3amountains 3asurfaces 3avegetation cover 3aItaly 3aSicily1 aDomina, G.1 aRaimondo, F.

Higher income groups displayed greater propensity to consume OFV, which was 70 percent in their income group. Consumers were having positive attitude and 47% of total respondents were willing to pay premium for organic. In contrast to conventional products, OFV were also perceived better in commodity factors like quality and freshness. Availability is one of the major concerns as OFV are primarily present in organized retail only, which itself has got less than 10 percent presence. Only 18 percent of buying takes place at organized retail where OFV is available in higher quantity. In long run, performance of OFV shall be significantly dependent on penetration of modern retail through various formats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer attitudes 3afreshness 3afruits 3ahorticulture 3aincome 3awillingness to pay 3aIndia 0aOrganic fruit and vegetables 0aawareness 0aconsumer 0aperception1 aGodara, Shiv Prakash1 aSingh, Babita1 aRamawat, Naleeni1 aSingh, Abhishek0 tProgressive horticulture.g2014 Mar., v. 46, no. 1 p.162-167dIndian Society of Horticultural Research and DevelopmentwJournal:2070x2249-52587nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002000143245007000163300001600233520105400249592002801303650001401331650001501345650002001360650002501380650001901405650001601424650001001440650001301450650001701463650002301480650001601503651001101519653001201530653002601542653001101568653002501579700002201604773014201626856007701768852000901845655001201854IND60715674920221120134917.0201030e20201026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071567492DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2020.00132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes-Prado, H.10aInsects used as foodstuff by indigenous groups in Morelos, Mexico  ap. 499-505.  aAnthropo-entomophagy has been practiced since pre-Hispanic times and today it is still preserved in certain places in Mexico. In addition, indigenous societies recognise the importance of insect consumption as an alternative source to conventional animal protein. In the state of Morelos, for example, insects are a significant part of the traditional diet of the inhabitants of rural areas. Nevertheless, no systematic research has been done to recognise the insect species used nor the aspects related to anthropo-entomophagy. This is the reason why this ethno-entomological research about edible insects was conducted. In this study, there is a report about 61 species of edible insects that are consumed in their different developmental stages in the state of Morelos. Grasshoppers (= chapulines) (Orthoptera) and bugs (= jumiles) (Hemiptera) stand out for their abundance and high degree of acceptance. The ways in which they are prepared and preserved range from rudimentary to highly elaborated, and some date from Mexican pre-Hispanic times.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHemiptera 3aOrthoptera 3aanimal proteins 3adevelopmental stages 3aedible insects 3aentomophagy 3afoods 3afoodways 3agrasshoppers 3aindigenous peoples 3arural areas 3aMexico 0aMorelos 0atraditional knowledge 0aethnos 0aanthropo-entomophagy1 aMoreno, J.M.

It is characterised by instability and experiences ongoing anthropomorphic change, both of which have a significant impact on the biodiversity of the estuary and surrounding area. Brachyurans (true crabs) play an integral role in the functioning and maintenance of this ecosystem. They are a food source for organisms at higher trophic levels, maintain nutrient balance, regulate trophic flow and aerate dense mud through the construction of burrows. However, since the early survey of Millard and Broekhuysen (1970), no study has focussed on this taxon, the identification of which is confounded by the existence of cryptic and pseudocryptic species. This study provides a census of the brachyuran species inhabiting the St Lucia estuarine lake, highlighting the changes in diversity that have occurred in this region between 1948 and 2012. A total of thirty species were found in the area during this period, five of which have not been recorded in previous literature. The extent to which regional endemic species, such as Paratylodiplax blephariskios, have been affected by the dynamics of the system is discussed. The distribution and abundance of three key species, namely P. blephariskios, Neosarmatium africanum and Hymenosoma projectum, are outlined; and possible reasons for observed changes are discussed. Future scenarios regarding the state of the estuary mouth and the stability of physico-chemical variables are also considered. Lastly, an annotated checklist illustrated by photographs is included to aid in identification of species for research and management purposes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrustacea 3aUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization 3abiodiversity 3aburrows 3acrabs 3aecosystems 3aestuaries 3aindigenous species 3alakes 3anutrient balance 3aphotographs 3aresearch management 3aspecies identification 3asurveys 3atemporal variation 3atrophic relationships 3awetlands 3aSouth Africa 0aCrustacea 0aBrachyura 0aSouth Africa 0aiSimangaliso Wetland Park 0aSt Lucia estuarine system 0atrue crabs 0adiversity 0aestuarine variability 0aillustrated checklist1 aPerissinotto, R.1 aTaylor, R.

A tandem deletion of residues Asp675 and Val676, that was expected to shift the position of the functionally important Trp677, resulted in higher cytochrome c reductase activity than that expected from previous studies on the importance of Asp675 and Trp677 in catalysis. Crystallographic determination of the structure of this variant revealed two conformations of the carboxy terminus. In one conformation (Mol A), the last α-helix is partially unwound, resulting in repositioning of all subsequent residues in β-strand 21, from Arg671 to Leu674 (corresponding to Ser673 and Val676 in the wild type structure). This results in the two C-terminal residues, Trp677 and Ser678, being maintained in their wild type positions, with the indole ring of Trp677 stacked against the isoalloxazine ring of FAD as seen in the wild type structure, and Ser673 occupying a similar position to the catalytic residue, Asp675. The other, more disordered conformation is a mixture of the Mol A conformation and one in which the last α-helix is not unwound and the nicotinamide ring is in one of two conformations, out towards the protein surface as observed in the wild type structure (1AMO), or stacked against the flavin ring, similar to that seen in the W677X structure that lacks Trp677 and Ser678 (1JA0). Further kinetic analysis on additional variants showed deletion or substitution of alanine or glycine for Trp677 in conjunction with deletion of Ser678 produced alterations in interactions of CYPOR with NADP⁺, 2′5′-ADP, and 2′-AMP, as well as the pH dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity. We postulate that deletion of bulky residues at the carboxy terminus permits increased mobility leading to decreased affinity for the 2′5′-ADP and 2′-AMP moieties of NADP⁺ and subsequent domain movement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalanine 3abiophysics 3acatalytic activity 3aindoles 3akinetics 3anicotinamide 3apH 0aFlavin oxidoreductase 0aCrystal structure 0aNADPH and NADH 0aP450 0aEnzyme domain movement1 aXia, Chuanwu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9075-871X1 aShen, Anna L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4388-28191 aKim, Jung-Ja P.0 tArchives of biochemistry and biophysics.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 701 p.108792-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11658x0003-98617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2021.1087923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03818naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024005500111040001800166072000900184100001600193245016400209300001600373500002400389500001500413520184500428650002102273650002102294650001802315650002302333650001902356650001902375650002102394650001502415650002302430650001602453650002502469650001302494650001002507650001202517650001002529650001102539650003302550650001702583650003202600650001302632650001502645650002402660650001702684651001302701651001302714653002802727653001902755653002602774700001602800700001702816700001802833773012002851852000902971856010502980930003303085945002503118946001303143655001203156IND4394712620221123030743.0070906e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439471262DNAL7 a175472332pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[470:EOTPIA]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aTrout, R.T.10aEfficacy of two pyrethroid insecticides applied as barrier treatments for managing mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) populations in suburban residential properties  ap. 470-477.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIncreased threat of mosquito-borne disease coupled with decreased tolerance of nuisance mosquitoes has opened a market for pest management professionals to offer mosquito control services for homeowners. A pest management professional applied bifenthrin (0.08%) and lambda-cyhalothrin (0.1%) at their maximum label concentrations as barrier treatments. We tested treatments residual efficacy in reducing adult mosquito populations and compared these chemicals against a water control at 24 residential properties (eight replications by three treatments). Mosquito populations were measured on each property by using five methods: CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps (without a light), human landing rates, CDC gravid traps, ovitraps, and sweep nets. Populations were monitored weekly for 2 wk before treatment and 8 wk posttreatment. Additionally, to confirm residual efficacy of each insecticide, a randomly treated leaf underwent a no-choice bioassay with laboratory-reared Aedes albopictus (Skuse). Trap collections were dominantly Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens L. Both insecticidal treatments significantly reduced Aedes spp. lambda-Cyhalothrin- and bifenthrin-treated sites had 89.5 and 85.1% fewer Ae. albopictus bites than the untreated control, respectively. Ae. albopictus bioassay results showed significant residual efficacy for both insecticides up to 6 wk posttreatment. There were no significant differences between properties treated with the two insecticides. In contrast, Culex spp. were not reduced by either insecticidal treatment. Our study indicated that barrier sprays applied to low-lying vegetation do not properly target adult daytime resting sites for Culex mosquitoes but that they can reduce Aedes mosquitoes. Perhaps by treating upper tree canopies Culex spp. abundance may be reduced. 3aAedes albopictus 3aresidual effects 3aCulex pipiens 3alambda-cyhalothrin 3amosquito bites 3asuburban areas 3amosquito control 3abifenthrin 3apopulation density 3aadulticides 3ainsecticide residues 3aspraying 2aAedes 2aAnimals 2aCulex 2aFemale 2aInsect Vectorsxdrug effects 2aInsecticides 2aMosquito Controlxstandards 2aNitriles 2aPyrethrins 2aSuburban Population 2aTime Factors 3aKentucky 0aKentucky 0apyrethroid insecticides 0abarrier sprays 0aresidential backyards1 aBrown, G.C.1 aPotter, M.F.1 aHubbard, J.L.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2007 May, v. 44, no. 3 p.470-477dEntomological Society of Americax0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-2585(2007)44[470:EOTPIA]2.0.CO;23Available from publisher's Web site  a20071128b20071210c00000000  aINDdNZMe2007/11/26  aOther US 7aarticle02381naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245011600162300002000278520120100298592002801499650001501527650002101542650001501563700006001578700002201638700002301660700006601683700002001749700005901769773013801828856008001966852000902046655001202055IND60608770120221119032651.0180809e20180727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060877012DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b038732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGhosh, Raja10aSpectral Signatures and Spatial Coherence of Bound and Unbound Polarons in P3HT Films: Theory Versus Experiment  ap. 18048-18060.  aThe origin of the mid-infrared (IR) spectral features for hole absorption in doped poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) films is investigated theoretically and experimentally. Using a Holstein-style Hamiltonian to treat vibronic coupling involving the prominent vinyl stretching mode, the low-energy peak (A) occurring in the spectral interval 0.1–0.15 eV is found to contain a substantial (sometimes dominant) intrachain-polarized component, in contrast to the predictions of the more conventional treatments based on self-trapped, mid-gap polaron states where peak A is entirely interchain in origin. A higher-energy peak (B) located between 0.35 and 0.7 eV and largely intrachain-polarized is also obtained and associated with the conventional P₁ polaron transition. Spectral signatures for polaron coherence based on peaks A and B are identified and used to analyze the molecular weight dependence of the IR spectral line shapes of P3HT doped with 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane. Generally, the polaron coherence lengths along the chain and stacking axes increase with molecular weight, which is consistent with similar studies conducted on hole absorption in undoped P3HT.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3amolecular weight 3aprediction1 aChew, Annabel R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9617-35281 aOnorato, Jonathan1 aPakhnyuk, Viktoria1 aLuscombe, Christine K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7456-13431 aSalleo, Alberto1 aSpano, Frank C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3044-67270 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 27, v. 122, no. 31 p.18048-18060dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b038733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03546naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245010900168300001600277520206300293592002802356650002902384650001402413650002002427650001902447650001602466650001602482650003002498650002502528650000902553650001102562650002102573650001302594650001802607650001802625650002302643650000902666650001602675650001102691650002002702650002002722650001902742650001602761651001002777700001602787700001902803700001302822773008502835856008702920852000903007655001203016IND60085123920221119015341.0160903e201308  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008512392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.04.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXing, Meng10aRelationship of nitrate isotopic character to population density in the Loess Plateau of Northwest China  ap. 110-119.  aNitrate pollution of groundwater is an increasingly serious anthropogenic problem. In this study, the hydrogeochemistry of major ions and stable isotope ratios of NO3- in groundwater were determined to identify the contamination sources and chemical transformation processes occurring in the shallow groundwater of Xi’an, the capital of Shaanxi province, NW China. Of a total of 32 groundwater samples, 31% had NO3-–N concentrations exceeding the accepted drinking water limit of 10mg-NL−1. Most of these samples were from the urban center of the study area, while samples with <10mg-NL−1 were mainly from suburban areas. Combined with information on NO3- and Cl−, the variation in isotopes of NO3- in the groundwater suggest a mixing of multiple NO3- sources in areas on the urban/suburban border. By determining rainwater and river water NO3- isotopic values, the groundwater recharge mode can be deduced for Xi’an city. Chemical fertilizers and nitrification of N-containing organic materials contribute NO3- to suburban groundwater, while sewage effluent and nitrification dominate NO3- distribution in urban groundwater. Nitrification from organic soil N, manure and sewage was significant in some sampling areas, and NO3- isotopic values from groundwater in Xi’an indicated that the effects of denitrification were not an obvious contributor. Thus, the δ15N–NO3- enrichment process is mainly caused by the intense anthropogenic activity in the city center. From the urban center to suburban areas, the mean δ15N–NO3- values varied from +16.4‰ to +5.4‰, and the mean NO3-–N concentrations varied from 28.0mgL−1 to 4.0mgL−1. In particular, the δ15N–NO3- value (r=−0.75, p<0.01) correlated more significantly with distance from the urban center than did the NO3-–N concentration data (r=−0.49, p<0.01), which suggests that NO3- isotopic values are an effective indicator of contamination sources. In addition, the δ15N–NO3- values and population density show a significant logarithmic correlation in Xi’an city.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3achlorides 3adenitrification 3adrinking water 3afertilizers 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3agroundwater recharge 3aions 3amixing 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anitrification 3aorganic soils 3apopulation density 3arain 3ariver water 3asewage 3asewage effluent 3astable isotopes 3asuburban areas 3aurban areas 3aChina1 aLiu, Weiguo1 aWang, Zhoufeng1 aHu, Jing0 tApplied geochemistry.g2013 Aug., v. 35 p.110-119dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2013.04.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02450naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001400143245010400157300001600261520102800277592002801305650001401333650001801347650002701365650002301392650001901415650001201434650001601446650001101462650001601473650001401489650001201503650001801515650000801533650001201541650001001553650001001563651001901573653002501592653001601617653001401633653001501647700001701662700001701679700002001696773014201716856007701858852000901935655001201944IND60715675020221120123853.0201030e20201026xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071567502DNAL7 a10.3920/JIFF2020.00202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKulma, M.10aInsect consumption in the Czech Republic: what the eye does not see, the heart does not grieve over  ap. 525-535.  aA survey to test customers´ experience and preferences regarding food insects in the Czech Republic has revealed that 37.8% of the 1,340 respondents had experienced eating insects.

For the first time, unusual spectroscopic changes and differential binding behavior of a tetracationic ethyl viologen tethered PDI derivative, PDEV, with calf-thymus DNA (ct-DNA) is reported here and is ascertained as due to the DNA compaction. From an initial aggregation on the DNA backbone, resulting in quenching in the emission intensity (turn off), with increase in ct-DNA concentration, a novel and strong fluorescence band (turn on) emerged in the blue region. Distinct absorption spectral changes having sharp features in vibronic patterns, increased fluorescence lifetime (from 0.33 to 4.5 ns), anisotropy values are also displayed on titration with ct-DNA corroborating the changes in microenvironment of PDEV in commensurate with structural transition from coil state to compact state. The structural changes in the DNA are also established from the circular dichroism spectra, viscosity measurements, and DNA melting data. The compaction is also directly visualized in the atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy images. Such compact DNA morphologies with redox-responsive donor–acceptor moieties are potential to create desired nanostructures with stimuli-responsive functionalities such as on–off switch, biosensor, drug delivery, and other optoelectronic devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorption 3aanisotropy 3aatomic force microscopy 3abiosensors 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adrugs 3aemissions factor 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3amelting 3amoieties 3ananomaterials 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis 3atitration 3aviscosity1 aPramanik, Bapan1 aShinde, Meenakshi N.1 aKhurana, Raman1 aBarooah, Nilotpal1 aBhasikuttan, Achikanath C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7224-04821 aDas, Debapratim1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2295-09661 aMohanty, Jyotirmayee1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2018-49060 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 July 16, v. 122, no. 31 p.18061-18069dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b038923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245012000171300001600291520096800307592002801275650001601303650001801319650002701337650001401364650000901378650001201387650001001399650001401409650001301423651001201436653001301448653002001461653001601481653001101497653001301508653001201521653001501533653001301548653001901561700002101580773009201601856007901693852000901772655001201781IND60124269020221117044142.0151025e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012426902DNAL7 a10.5733/afin.055.01072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSimone, Luiz Ricardo L.10aComparative Morphology of Dorsanum miran and Bullia granulosa from Morocco (Mollusca: Caenogastropoda: Nassariidae)  ap. 125-142.  aThe anatomy and taxonomy of two western African nassariids are explored, based on samples collected in Morocco.

Both possess the typical morphological and anatomical features of the family, including a pair of metapodial tentacles, a well-developed proboscis, elongated odontophore with fusion of cartilages, and highly concentrated central nervous system. Both species have in common the socket-like heads, bifid columellar muscles, and reduction of the gland of Leiblein. D. miran has well-developed eyes, cement gland, and preputial protection at the penis tip. B. granulosa lacks eyes, has multiplicity of some buccal mass muscles (transverse muscles and main dorsal tensor muscles — m2), and a thick-walled and broad anterior oesophagus.

In this paper, tetraarylethylenes with aggregation-induced emission were introduced to subphthalocyanine macrocycles at the axial direction and the periphery to improve the fluorescence emission properties. Results show that the modification at the two different positions of the subphthalocyanines has different effects on regulating the fluorescence performances. The subphthalocyanine modified axially by tetraphenylethylene shows outstanding fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) phenomenon, and the modification on the periphery of subphthalocyanine is conducive to enhance the fluorescence intensity. These distinctive performances have the potential applications in fluorescence sensor and probe.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3ageometry 0aSubphthalocyanine 0aAIE 0aFluorescence 0aFRET1 aYan, Liying1 aCao, Fei1 aLuo, Qianfu0 tTetrahedron letters.g2021 June 08, v. 73 p.153096-dElsevier LtdwJournal:11745x0040-40397nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tetlet.2021.1530963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100005300137245014000190300001600330500001900346500002000365520192200385592002802307596008102335596005902416596006802475650002302543650001502566650001602581650002002597650000902617650001402626650002002640650001902660650001502679650000902694650001202703651001002715700002102725700002002746700002302766700006302789773012402852856007102976852000903047655001203056IND60723505220221122103520.0210114e202102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072350522DNAL7 a10.1002/ps.60852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Yu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8421-207210aMutation in cyp51b and overexpression of cyp51a and cyp51b confer multiple resistant to DMIs fungicide prochloraz in Fusarium fujikuroi  ap. 824-833.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Fusarium fujikuroi is a plant pathogen that causes rice bakanae disease. Prochloraz is an imidazole‐class sterol, 14α‐demethylase inhibitor (DMI), which has been in use for several years as a foliar spray to control Fusarium spp. on agriculturally important monocot crops. F. fujikuroi is highly resistant to prochloraz treatment, and the aim of this study was to clarify the mechanism by which F. fujikuroi renders itself resistant to prochloraz. RESULTS: Recently, prochloraz‐resistant strains were identified over a vast geographical area in the agricultural regions of Zhejiang Province, China. It was found that 21.13% and 3.96% of the strains examined were highly resistant (HR) to prochloraz during 2017 to 2018. The HR strains contained a point mutation (S312T) in the FfCYP51B protein, while the strains identified with prochloraz susceptibility had no such point mutation in FfCYP51A/B/C. To confirm whether the mutations in FfCYP51B confer resistance to prochloraz, we exchanged the CYP51B locus between the sensitive strain and the resistant strain by homologous double exchange. The transformed mutants with a copy of the resistant fragment exhibited resistance to prochloraz, and the transformed mutants with a copy of the sensitive fragment exhibited sensitivity to prochloraz. Furthermore, qRT‐PCR analysis of Ffcyp51a/b/c gene expression revealed that Ffcyp51a and Ffcyp51b were significantly up‐regulated in the prochloraz‐resistant strains relative to the sensitive strains in F. fujikuroi. Contrary to our expectation, docking of prochloraz into the modeled binding pocket of FfCYP51B indicated that the affinity between prochloraz and the FfCYP51B increased after the amino acid at codon 312 changed to Thr. CONCLUSION: The point mutation S312T in FfCYP51B and overexpression of Ffcyp51a and Ffcyp51b together lead to the prochloraz‐resistant phenotype in F. fujikuroi.  aPublisher supplied data  a2015C02019cKey Research and Development Project of Zhejiang Province, China  a31801680cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017FR037cResearch Development Fund of Zhejiang A&F University 3aFusarium fujikuroi 3aLiliopsida 3aamino acids 3afoliar spraying 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aplant pathogens 3apoint mutation 3aprochloraz 3arice 3asterols 3aChina1 aMao, Cheng‐Xin1 aZhai, Xiao‐Yu1 aJamieson, Pierce A1 aZhang, Chuan‐Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3404-600X0 tPest management science.g2021 Feb., v. 77, no. 2 p.824-833dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl59519x1526-498X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ps.60853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03960naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245018000190300001600370520169300386650002502079650002202104650001202126650001302138650001402151650001302165650003102178650001802209650001202227650001102239650002102250650002702271650004102298650002802339650001002367650001902377650002902396650002202425650005302447650003202500650004902532650005002581650002602631650003102657650005302688650002102741650005702762650007402819650004002893650003102933653003402964700002302998700002903021700002003050773010203070852000903172856008503181930003303266946001103299655001203310IND4393511320221117174726.0070729e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439351132DNAL7 a175545522pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0480-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRudrappa, Thimmaraju 12aA degradation product of the salicylic acid pathway triggers oxidative stress resulting in down-regulation of Bacillus subtilis biofilm formation on Arabidopsis thaliana roots  ap. 283-297.  aBacillus subtilis, a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), induces growth response and protection against pathogenic organisms through colonization and biofilm formation on the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface. In the current investigation, we utilized various Arabidopsis defense pathway mutants in a series of studies and showed that the plants recognize B. subtilis by a chemical-dependent cascade, which is independent of the salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), or ethylene pathways. These experiments revealed the importance of root surface chemistry in colonization and biofilm formation by B. subtilis. It was found that B. subtilis FB17 could not form biofilms on the roots of NahG, a transgenic Arabidopsis line for salicylate hydroxylase that produces catechol as the degradation product of SA. These findings suggest that catechol may play a direct role in inhibiting B. subtilis FB17 biofilm formation on the NahG root surface, possibly through induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the roots. Using both in vitro microtitre plate and in planta assays we confirmed that catechol inhibited biofilm formation, but not the planktonic growth, of B. subtilis. Inhibition of biofilm formation was shown to be the result of a physiological response by B. subtilis to the presence of catechol, which resulted in the down-regulation of transcription of the yqxM-sipW-tasA and epsA-O operons, both of which are required for biofilm formation by B. subtilis. These data indicate that the suppression of biofilm formation on NahG plants was strongly influenced by the root-derived catechol production through ROS-mediated down-regulation of B. subtilis biofilm genes. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBacillus subtilis 3abiofilm 3acatechol 3achemistry 3aethylene 3agene expression regulation 3ajasmonic acid 3amutants 3aoperon 3aoxidative stress 3aphysiological response 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3areactive oxygen species 3aroots 3asalicylic acid 3atranscription (genetics) 3atransgenic plants 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aAscorbic Acidxpharmacology 2aBacillus subtilisxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aBiofilmsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aCatecholsxmetabolism 2aImmunity, Innatexgenetics 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxdrug effectsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 0aReactive oxygen species (ROS)1 aQuinn, William J. 1 aStanley-Wall, Nicola R. 1 aBais, Harsh P. 0 tPlanta.g2007 July, v. 226, no. 2 p.283-297dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0480-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20070729b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03301naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245007900182300001400261520149100275650002201766650002101788650001301809650002001822650002101842650003101863650001001894650001701904650002601921650001301947650001601960650002601976650001202002650002102014650002202035650003102057650003802088650002902126650002602155650004002181650001602221650002902237650002902266650002502295650004202320650004502362653001302407653002702420700002502447773010002472852000902572856008602581930003302667946001102700655001202711IND4391501920221117174658.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439150192DNAL7 a172164822pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-006-0463-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Dong Ju 10aRegulation of gibberellin 20-oxidase1 expression in spinach by photoperiod  ap. 35-44.  aThe multifunctional gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase [GA₅₃, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-oxidizing), EC 1.14.11] has been extensively investigated in various species at the genetic and molecular levels, but not at the protein level. Here, we report on expression of GA20ox1 protein in spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) in response to photoperiod. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant SoGA20ox1 in a chicken. These antibodies immuno-inhibited the enzymatic activity of the recombinant SoGA20ox1 and immuno-precipitated SoGA20ox1 (43 kDa) isolated from spinach shoot tips. Northern and western analyses showed that the levels of SoGA20ox1 transcript and protein increased in the blades, petioles, young leaves, and tips in response to long-day (LD) conditions. The transcript and protein levels of the SoGA20ox1 gene were up-regulated in the petioles and tips in a time-dependent manner. The estimated number of SoGA20ox1 protein molecules per cell was approximately 13-fold higher in tips grown in LD than in short-day (SD) conditions. The levels of SoGA20ox1 protein gradually decreased in tips when spinach plants grown in LD were transferred to SD conditions. SoGA20ox1 transcripts were detected by in situ hybridization in rapidly growing tissues--such as the shoot apical meristem, leaf and flower primordia, leaflets, and vascular tissues--but not in the expanding subapical region. In petioles, expression of SoGA20ox1 was detected in the companion cells. 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aapical meristems 3achickens 3aenzyme activity 3aflower primordia 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agibberellins 3ain situ hybridization 3apetioles 3aphotoperiod 3apolyclonal antibodies 3aspinach 3avascular tissues 2aBlotting, Western 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aIn Situ Hybridization 2aMixed Function Oxygenasesxgenetics 2aPhotoperiod 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRNA, Messengerxgenetics 2aRNA, Plantxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgenetics 2aSpinacia oleraceaxenzymologyxgenetics. 0aAntibody 0aGibberellin 20-oxidase1 aZeevaart, Jan A.

By using pituitary-scale tridimensional imaging for two of the least abundant cell lineages, the corticotropes and gonadotropes, we have now uncovered highly organized and interdigitated cell networks that reflect homotypic and heterotypic interactions between cells. Although newly differentiated corticotrope cells appear on the ventral surface of the gland, they rapidly form homotypic strands of cells that extend from the lateral tips of the anterior pituitary along its ventral surface and into the medial gland. As the corticotrope network is established away from the microvasculature, cell morphology changes from rounded, to polygonal, and finally to cells with long cytoplasmic processes or cytonemes that connect corticotropes to the perivascular space. Gonadotropes differentiate later and are positioned in close proximity to corticotropes and capillaries. Blockade of corticotrope terminal differentiation produced by knockout of the gene encoding the transcription factor Tpit results in smaller gonadotropes within an expanded cell network, particularly in the lateral gland. Thus, pituitary-scale tridimensional imaging reveals highly structured cell networks of unique topology for each pituitary lineage. The sequential development of interdigitated cell networks during organogenesis indicate that extensive cell:cell interactions lead to a highly ordered cell positioning rather than random patchwork.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanterior pituitary 3acell biology 3agene targeting 3aimage analysis 3aorganogenesis 3atopology 3atranscription factors1 aLafont, Chrystel1 aEl Yandouzi, Taoufik1 aChauvet, Norbert1 aConéjero, Geneviève1 aDrouin, Jacques1 aMollard, Patrice0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2011 July 26, v. 108, no. 30 p.12515-12520dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.11059291083Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110729  aOther US 7aarticle03600naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010100181300001800282520162400300650001701924650001201941650001301953650001601966650001501982650001201997650002302009650002002032650001502052650001402067650001402081650001202095650001902107650001002126650001202136650002202148650002402170650001202194650001302206650000902219650002302228650001802251650002302269650001602292650001702308650001702325650003302342653005002375653002402425653001702449653002902466700001502495700001802510700001502528700001602543700001302559700001402572700001602586700001802602700001602620773010402636852000902740856008502749930003302834946001102867655001202878IND4394859020221117164836.0070909e200710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439485902DNAL7 a175495142pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0553-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Z. G. 10aFine mapping of S31, a gene responsible for hybrid embryo-sac abortion in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 1087-1096.  aPartial abortion of female gametes and the resulting semi-sterility of indica x japonica inter-subspecific rice hybrids have been ascribed to an allelic interaction, which can be avoided by the use of wide compatibility varieties. To further understand the genetic mechanism of hybrid sterility, we have constructed two sets of hybrids, using as male parent either the typical japonica variety Asominori, or the wide compatibility variety 02428; and as female, a set of 66 chromosome segment substitution lines in which various chromosomal segments from the indica variety IR24 have been introduced into a common genetic background of Asominori. Spikelet semi-sterility was observed in hybrid between CSSL34 and Asominori, which is known to carry the sterility gene S31 (Zhao et al. in Euphytica 151:331-337, 2006). Cytological analysis revealed that the semi-sterility of the CSSL34 x Asominori hybrid was caused primarily by partial abortion of the embryo sac at the stage of the mitosis of the functional megaspore. A population of 1,630 progeny of the three-way cross (CSSL34 x 02428) x Asominori was developed to map S31. Based on the physical location of linked molecular markers, S31 was thereby delimited to a 54-kb region on rice chromsome 5. This fragment contains eight predicted open reading frames, four of which encode known proteins and four putative proteins.

Plant defensins have been introduced as transgenes into a range of species to increase host resistance to pathogens to which they were originally susceptible. However, the effectiveness and mechanism of interaction of the defensins with Phytophthora spp. have not been clearly characterized in planta. In this study, we expressed the Dahlia merckii defensin, DmAMP1, in papaya (Carica papaya L.), a plant highly susceptible to a root, stem, and fruit rot disease caused by Phytophthora palmivora. Extracts of total leaf proteins from transformed plants inhibited growth of Phytophthora in vitro and discs cut from the leaves of transformed plants inhibited growth of Phytophthora in a bioassay. Results from our greenhouse inoculation experiments demonstrate that expressing the DmAMP1 gene in papaya plants increased resistance against P. palmivora and that this increased resistance was associated with reduced hyphae growth of P. palmivora at the infection sites. The inhibitory effects of DmAMP1 expression in papaya suggest this approach has good potential to impart transgenic resistance against Phytophthora in papaya. 3aCarica papaya 3aDahlia 3aPhytophthora palmivora 3abioassays 3afinancial economics 3agenetically modified organisms 3agreenhouses 3agrowth retardation 3ahyphae 3aleaves 3apathogens 3aplant rots 3aproteins 3atransgenes 3avigor 2aCaricaxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aDahliaxgenetics 2aDefensinsxgenetics 2aImmunity, Innate 2aPhytophthoraxpathogenicity 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxmicrobiology 0aPlant microbe interaction1 aAgbayani, Ricelle 1 aMoore, Paul H. 0 tPlanta.g2007 June, v. 226, no. 1 p.87-97dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-006-0471-13Available from publisher's Web site.  a20070522b20070602c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03407naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002500164245009300189300001600282520150100298650002501799650001101824650001501835650001901850650002501869650001301894650001901907650001001926650001101936650002601947650002001973650001201993650002202005650003902027650003502066650002302101650001802124650002602142650002602168650003002194650003502224650004002259650003302299650003602332653001002368653003302378653002302411653001402434653002902448700002502477700002302502700001602525773010202541852000902643856008502652930003302737946001102770655001202781IND4393033520221117164839.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439303352DNAL7 a174068902pmid7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0510-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurczyńska, Ewa U. 10aHistological analysis of direct somatic embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh  ap. 619-628.  aIn Arabidopsis the in vitro culture of immature zygotic embryos (IZEs) at a late stage of development, on the solid medium containing synthetic auxin, leads to formation of somatic embryos via direct somatic embryogenesis (DSE). The presented results provide evidence that in IZE cells competent for DSE are located in the protodermis and subprotodermis of the adaxial side of cotyledons and somatic embryos displayed a single- or multicellular origin. Transgenic Arabidopsis lines expressing the GUS reporter gene, driven by the DR5 and LEC2 promoters, were used to analyse the distribution of auxin to mark embryogenic cells in cultured explants and develop somatic embryos. The analysis showed that at the start of the culture auxin was accumulated in all explant tissues, but from the fourth day onwards its location shifted to the protodermis and subprotodermis of the explant cotyledons. In globular somatic embryos auxin was detected in all cells, with a higher concentration in the protodermis, and in the heart stage its activity was mainly displayed in the shoot, root pole and cotyledon primordia. The embryogenic nature of dividing protodermal and subprotodermal cells accumulating auxin was confirmed by high expression of promoter activity of LEC2 in these cells. Analysis of symplasmic tracer (CFDA) distribution indicated symplasmic isolation between tissues engaged in DSE and other parts of an explant. Symplasmic isolation of somatic embryos from the explant was also detected. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aauxins 3acotyledons 3acultured cells 3adevelopmental stages 3aexplants 3areporter genes 3aroots 3ashoots 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asomatic embryos 3atissues 3atransgenic plants 2aArabidopsisxcytologyxembryology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aCell Communication 2aCell Division 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aEmbryonic Development 2aGlucuronidasexmetabolism 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aPromoter Regions, Geneticxgenetics 2aSeedsxcytologyxembryology. 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0aAuxin 0aDirect somatic embryogenesis 0aDR5::GUS construct 0aLEC2 gene 0aSymplasmic communication1 aGaj, Małgorzata D. 1 aUjczak, Agnieszka 1 aMazur, Ewa 0 tPlanta.g2007 Aug., v. 226, no. 3 p.619-628dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0510-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02964naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245015500168300001600323520160400339650001601943650001501959650001501974650001501989650002002004650001502024650001502039650003202054650001102086650001402097650001202111650001902123650001302142653001402155653001302169653002602182653001202208700002302220700002302243773010202266852000902368856008502377930003302462946001102495655001202506IND4393033120221117164832.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439303312DNAL7 a10.1007/s00425-007-0505-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonishi, Tomoyuki 10aChain elongation of pectic β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactan by a partially purified galactosyltransferase from soybean (Glycine max Merr.) hypocotyls  ap. 571-579.  aPectin is one of the major cell wall polysaccharides found in dicotyledonous plants. We have solubilized and partially purified a β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactosyltransferase (GalT) involved in the synthesis of the β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactan side chains of pectin. The enzyme protein was almost completely solubilized by mixing a crude microsomal preparation of etiolated 6-day-old soybean (Glycine max Merr.) hypocotyls with a detergent, Triton X-100 (0.75%, w/v), in buffer. The solubilized enzyme was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography. The crude membrane-bound GalT transferred Gal from UDP-Gal onto 2-aminobenzamide (AB)-derivatized β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactoheptaose (Gal₇-AB), leading to the formation of Gal₈-₁₁-AB by attachment of a series of one to four galactosyl residues; this is similar to what has previously been observed for 2-aminopyridine-derivatized β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactooligomer acceptors (Konishi et al. in Planta 218:833-842, 2004). The partially purified GalT, by contrast, was able to transfer more than 25 galactosyl residues and elongated the chains to about Gal₃₅-AB, thus almost reaching the length (43-47 Gal units) of native β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactan side chains found in pectic polysaccharides from soybean cotyledons (Nakamura et al. in Biosci Biotechnol Biochem 66:1301-1313, 2002). Enzyme activity increased with increasing chain length of β-(1[rightward arrow]4)-galactooligomers and reached maximal activity at heptaose, whereas galactooligomers higher than heptaose showed lower acceptor efficiency. 3aGlycine max 3acell walls 3acotyledons 3adetergents 3aenzyme activity 3aetiolation 3ahypocotyls 3aion exchange chromatography 3amixing 3aoctoxynol 3apectins 3asolubilization 3asoybeans 0aCell wall 0aGalactan 0aGalactosyltransferase 0aGlycine1 aKotake, Toshihisa 1 aTsumuraya, Yoichi 0 tPlanta.g2007 Aug., v. 226, no. 3 p.571-579dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-007-0505-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20070715b20070802c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03650naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100002000165245021200185300001800397500002400415500001500439520108300454650004401537650001101581650003201592650001801624650003001642650002101672650004301693650001101736650001501747650001901762650002201781650001601803650001201819650005001831650001801881650005001899650003601949650002701985650004502012650003102057650003602088650003302124650003002157650004702187650005602234650002402290653001602314653005402330653004502384653002602429653001702455653001602472700001802488700002202506700002802528700001702556700002402573773016202597852000902759856007702768930003302845945002502878946001302903655001202916IND4417142320221123014149.0090303e20090225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441714232DNAL7 a191829442pmid7 a10.1021/jf80335392doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8311 aGlauser, Gaetan10aDifferential Analysis of Mycoalexins in Confrontation Zones of Grapevine Fungal Pathogens by Ultrahigh Pressure Liquid Chromatography/Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry and Capillary Nuclear Magnetic Resonance  ap. 1127-1134.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn original approach was developed for the chemical and biological investigation of zone lines formed by the confrontation of fungi growing in confined spaces. Two wood-decaying fungi involved in esca disease, Eutypa lata and Botryosphaeria obtusa, were grown in Petri dishes. Metabolic profiles of pure fungal strains and confrontation zones were differentially analyzed by ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS). Selected metabolites induced by the confrontation were isolated and characterized by capillary NMR (CapNMR) at the submilligram level. Fungitoxic and phytotoxic assays were applied to the crude extracts and isolated molecules. While the extracts of pure strains were inactive, the extract from confrontation zones exhibited significant activities. A very strongly induced compound, O-methylmellein, may explain these toxic properties. The developed approach demonstrates the use of fungal confrontations as an original source of bioactive molecules and gives new insights into the study of esca disease. 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3agrapes 3ahost-pathogen relationships 3aphytotoxicity 3afungal diseases of plants 3aDiplodia seriata 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aEutypa 3amycotoxins 3aVitis vinifera 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolites 2aAlkynes 2aAscomycotaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aBenzaldehydes 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aHerbicidesxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aIsocoumarinsxtoxicity 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopyxmethods 2aMass Spectrometryxmethods 2aMycotoxinsxanalysisxtoxicity. 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Stemsxmicrobiology 2aSeedsxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aSpores, Fungalxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aVitisxmicrobiology 0aEutypa lata 0acapillary nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 0aultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography 0aBotryosphaeria obtusa 0aesca disease 0amycoalexins1 aGindro, Katia1 aFringeli, Juliane1 aJoffrey, Jean-Pierre De1 aRudaz, Serge1 aWolfender, Jean-Luc0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Feb. 25, v. 57, no. 4 p.1127-1134dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80335393Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/27  aOther US 7aarticle02509naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001900155245012100174300001800295500002400313500001500337520112700352650001301479650003301492650002201525650002601547650001701573650001601590650000901606653002001615653002601635700002001661700002001681700002301701700002001724773016201744852000901906856007701915930003301992945002502025946001302050655001202063IND4417141920221123014241.0090303e20090225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441714192DNAL7 a10.1021/jf803235m2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aQ1241 aYoshida, Hiroo10aAdvantage of LC-MS Metabolomics Methodology Targeting Hydrophilic Compounds in the Studies of Fermented Food Samples  ap. 1119-1126.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe utility of a liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method, using a pentafluorophenylpropyl (PFPP) bonded silica, was demonstrated in a metabolomics study of fermented food samples. Our LC-MS method was applied to Japanese fermented food (miso) of different stages of ripeness. The data acquired were evaluated by principal component analysis (PCA). The score plots indicated that the miso samples could be approximately classified into three groups, based on the stage of miso ripeness. The loading plots indicated that the ions responsible for group separation included not only amino acids and citric acid but also Amadori compounds. On the other hand, the miso samples were also analyzed by a conventional LC-MS method using an octadecyl (C18) column for comparison. The group separation of score plots from the conventional method was less clear than that from our method. The advantage of our LC-MS method is due to the different retention properties of the PFPP column and the C18 column with hydrophilic compounds. Our LC-MS method will be useful for the metabolic profiling of fermented food samples. 3asoybeans 3aprincipal component analysis 3amass spectrometry 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolomics 3ametabolites 3amiso 0afermented foods 0ahydrophilic compounds1 aYamazaki, Junko1 aOzawa, Shinichi1 aMizukoshi, Toshimi1 aMiyano, Hiroshi0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Feb. 25, v. 57, no. 4 p.1119-1126dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf803235m3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/27  aOther US 7aarticle02160naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100003500155245020100190300001800391500002400409520075600433650002701189650001701216650002201233650002301255650002201278650001101300650001301311650001301324650001301337653002301350700002101373700002501394773016201419852000901581856007701590930003301667945002501700946001301725655001201738IND4417150620221123001347.0090303e20090225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441715062DNAL7 a10.1021/jf803174c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ505 0aF6001 aMichodjehoun-Mestres, Laetitia10aIsolation, Characterization, and Determination of 1-O-trans-Cinnamoyl-β-d-glucopyranose in the Epidermis and Flesh of Developing Cashew Apple (Anacardium occidentale L.) and Four of Its Genotypes  ap. 1377-1382.  aIncludes references  a1-O-trans-Cinnamoyl-β-d-glucopyranose was purified from cashew apple (Anacardium occidentale L.) juice and unambiguously characterized.

We investigated the cellular pools of ATP and ADP in Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5 incubated at eight temperatures between 22°C and -80°C. Cellular ATP and ADP concentrations increased with decreasing temperature, and the most significant increases were observed in cells that were incubated as frozen suspensions (<-5°C). Respiratory uncoupling significantly decreased this temperature-dependent response, indicating that the proton motive force was required for energy adaptation to frozen conditions. Since ATP and ADP are key substrates in metabolic and energy conservation reactions, increasing their concentrations may provide a strategy for offsetting the kinetic temperature effect, thereby maintaining reaction rates at low temperature. The adenylate levels increased significantly <1 h after freezing and also when the cells were osmotically shocked to simulate the elevated solute concentrations encountered in the liquid fraction of the ice. Together, these data demonstrate that a substantial change in cellular energy metabolism is required for the cell to adapt to the low temperature and water activity conditions encountered during freezing. This physiological response may represent a critical biochemical compensation mechanism at low temperature, have relevance to cellular survival during freezing, and be important for the persistence of microorganisms in icy environments. 3afreezing 3aenergy 3aenzymes 3aenergy metabolism 3aadenosine diphosphate 3awater activity 3aadenosine triphosphate 3amicroorganisms 3asolutes 3awater temperature 3aphysiological response 3aPsychrobacter 3aice 3aprotons 3abiochemical mechanisms 3aenergy conservation 0aadaptation1 aChristner, Brent C.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology AEM.g2009 Feb. 1, v. 75, no. 3 p.711-718dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  aOther US 7aarticle02241naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245014800170300001600318500002400334500001500358520110100373650003101474650001201505650001501517650001101532650002001543650001801563650000901581650001001590650001601600650001101616653001501627700002001642700002301662773010601685852000901791856005501800655001201855IND4393096720221123001445.0070715e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439309672DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00914.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConrad, Klaus10aIncrease in activity, glycosylation and expression of cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase during the senescence of barley leaf segments in the dark  ap. 572-579.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of the study was to elucidate relations between senescence and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX, EC 1.4.3.18/1.5.99.12). Segments derived from first foliage leaves of Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Alexis were put with their bases into water and kept in darkness. Their senescence was characterized, e.g. by a 60% decline in chlorophyll within 5 days. During this time, the in vitro activity of CKX increased fast and markedly, e.g. 14-fold. Application of 10⁻⁴M kinetin (Kin), which slightly retarded the loss of chlorophyll, multiplied the enhancement of CKX activity strongly. Both in the presence and in the absence of Kin, the proportion of glycosylated to non-glycosylated CKX increased during senescence. By hybridization with an antisense RNA probe derived from a fragment of the CKX gene Zmckx1 of maize, an increase of the corresponding transcript of the barley gene Hvckx1 in segments incubated without Kin was shown. The content of base and riboside cytokinins slowly declined in such segments, which argues against triggering but for facilitating senescence processes by CKX. 3anucleic acid hybridization 3akinetin 3aRNA probes 3abarley 3aHordeum vulgare 3aglycosylation 3acorn 3agenes 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 0asenescence1 aMotyka, Václav1 aSchlüter, Torsten0 tPhysiologia plantarum.g2007 Aug., v. 130, no. 4 p.572-579dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0031-93177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-3054.2007.00914.x 7aarticle03822naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100001700174245011600191300001800307500002400325520141800349650002601767650001001793650002101803650001301824650002201837650002101859650002001880650001901900650002001919650002701939650002501966650002501991650003002016650001302046650001502059650001702074650002602091650005202117650003102169650001802200650003002218650001602248650001102264650001202275650002002287650004402307650001702351650004902368650004802417650001402465653001302479653001302492653002002505653002002525700002002545700003502565700002402600700002202624700002002646700002402666700003102690773016202721852000902883856007702892930003302969945002503002946001303027655001203040IND4417147620221122230130.0090303e20090225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441714762DNAL7 a191662932pmid7 a10.1021/jf80283682doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ504 0aT3001 aFrias, Juana10aInfluence of Germination with Different Selenium Solutions on Nutritional Value and Cytotoxicity of Lupin Seeds  ap. 1319-1325.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of different selenium solutions during germination of lupin seeds (Lupinus angustifolius L. cv. Zapaton) on the content of total selenium, protein, amino acids, soluble carbohydrates, total antioxidant activity, and cytotoxicity on HL-60 human leukemic cell line has been studied. Seeds were germinated in the presence of selenite (Na2SeO3) or selenate (Na2SeO4) solutions at different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/L) for 5 days at either 20 or 25 °C. The addition of inorganic Se forms significantly increased Se content in lupin sprouts in a dose-dependent manner. The highest Se content in lupin sprouts was observed when germination was carried out with selenate solutions at 20 °C (11 μg/g of dw) or 25 °C (14 μg/g of dw). The Se-enriched sprouts presented an improvement in antioxidant activity (up to 117.8 and 103.5 μmol of Trolox/g of dw) as well as in essential amino acid content, and no cytotoxicity was observed on HL-60 human leukemic cells. Lupin seeds germinated with 8 mg/L selenate solutions for 5 days at 20 °C exhibited a higher germination rate (>90%) and a higher concentration of some essential amino acids than those obtained in selenite solutions in the same germination conditions. Therefore, the employment of selenate solutions at a concentration of 8 mg/L and germination for 5 days at 20 °C may be suggested for the production of Se-enriched lupin sprouts. 3aLupinus angustifolius 3aseeds 3aseed germination 3aselenium 3aaqueous solutions 3anutrient content 3amineral content 3asprouts (food) 3aprotein content 3aamino acid composition 3acarbohydrate content 3aantioxidant activity 3aanticarcinogenic activity 3aleukemia 3acell lines 3acytotoxicity 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aAntineoplastic Agents, Phytogenicxpharmacology 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCarbohydrates 2aGerminationxdrug effects 2aHL-60 Cells 2aHumans 2aLupinus 2aNutritive Value 2aSeedsxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aSelenic Acid 2aSeleniumxadministration & dosagexanalysis. 2aSelenium Compoundsxadministration & dosage 2aSolutions 0aselenate 0aselenite 0asodium selenate 0asodium selenite1 aGulewicz, Piotr1 aMartinez-Villaluenga, Cristina1 aPilarski, Radosław1 aBlazquez, Enrique1 aJimenez, Begona1 aGulewicz, Krzysztof1 aVidal-Valverde, Concepcion0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Feb. 25, v. 57, no. 4 p.1319-1325dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf80283683Available from publisher's Web site  a20090331b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/27  aOther US 7aarticle02313naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001500158245010000173300001600273500002400289520106000313650002501373650001301398650001001411650002201421650002501443650001401468650001001482650001701492650001601509650004401525700001301569700001601582700001701598773010901615852000901724856008901733930003301822945002501855946001101880655001201891IND4401756620221122170815.0080222e20080403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.07.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF4001 aHabibi, Y.10aMorphological and structural study of seed pericarp of Opuntia ficus-indica prickly pear fruits  ap. 102-112.  aIncludes references  aThe morphological study of pericarp of Opuntia ficus-indica (OFI) seeds showed that the cells were mainly made up of spindle-shaped sclerenchyma fibers. The chemical composition of the pericarp revealed a significant amount of polysaccharides, with cellulose (35%) and xylan (27%). The structure of xylan and cellulose, both in isolated form and as a component of seed pericarp of OFI were studied by X-ray and CP/MAS 13C NMR spectroscopy. The supramolecular structure of xylan is very sensitive to the surrounding environment, in particular to the presence of water and of cellulose fibers. The cellulose fibers presented X-ray diagrams typical of secondary wall cellulose but they were sensitive toward NaOH since they started to be converted into cellulose II at a NaOH concentration as low as 8%. In seed pericarp, cellulose fibers interact with xylan polymers, causing these to adopt a conformation different to the one observed for xylan both in dry or hydrated form, suggesting that xylans were probably present as composites with cellulose fibers. 3aOpuntia ficus-indica 3apericarp 3aseeds 3acrystal structure 3achemical composition 3acellulose 3axylan 3aplant fibers 3afiber cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aHeux, L.1 aMahrouz, M.1 aVignon, M.R.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 Apr. 3, v. 72, no. 1 p.102-112dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.07.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02425naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100001700167245012500184300001600309500002400325500001500349520106400364650001901428650002301447650001901470650001601489650001901505650002101524650001201545650001301557653002101570653002101591700001301612700001201625700001201637700001801649700001201667773010901679852000901788856008901797930003301886945002501919946001101944655001201955IND4401757220221122170820.0080222e20080403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.07.0372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aLi, Xunjing.10aEffect of molecular weight of dextran on the phase behavior and microstructure of preheated soy protein/dextran mixtures  ap. 160-168.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of molecular weight of dextran on the phase behavior and microstructure of preheated soy protein (heat-induced soy protein aggregate)/dextran mixtures have not been reported before. Hereby mixed systems of heat-induced aggregates with different size and dextran with different molecular weight have been investigated at room temperature (25 °C) and pH 7.0. Phase diagrams were established by centrifugation, chemical assays and visual observation. The mixture of dextran with larger molecular weight and larger aggregate phase separated at lower biopolymer concentration. The microstructures of the phase separated mixtures were described using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which revealed the association of protein aggregates. The image analysis of the CLSM images showed that the histograms of the gray values were different significantly. Observations of small deformation rheology (G', G'') of the mixed system at concentrations corresponding to those of CLSM measurements provided additional information of the microstructures. 3amicrostructure 3aprotein aggregates 3aimage analysis 3asoy protein 3aheat treatment 3amolecular weight 3adextran 3agelation 0aphase transition 0aphase separation1 aDeng, F.1 aHua, Y.1 aQiu, A.1 aYang, Zhunhe.1 aCui, S.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 Apr. 3, v. 72, no. 1 p.160-168dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.07.0373Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02766naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001500165245006600180300001800246500002400264520124900288650002001537650002001557650001501577650001401592650001701606650001501623650002701638650001401665650001501679650002401694650005301718650003701771650003101808650001101839650006901850650003201919700001401951773016201965852000902127856007702136930003302213945002502246946001302271655001202284IND4401757820221122170810.0080222e20080227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175782DNAL7 a182475372pmid7 a10.1021/jf073037c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aAdachi, A.10aEfficiency of Spherosome for Removal of Chloroform from Water  ap. 1358-1360.  aIncludes references  aSpherosomes were elucidated to be a key for removal of chloroform by rice bran (Adachi, A.; Okano, T. Chemosphere 2002, 46, 87-92). On the basis of the above findings, a large amount of spherosomes was separated from rice bran using an industrial scale machine in order to investigate direct removal of chloroform by spherosome from tap water. The efficiency of removal of chloroform from water by rice bran spherosome was evaluated. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms conformed to the Freundlich isotherm (log-log linear). Adsorption of this compound by spherosome was observed in the pH range of 1-12. At equilibrium, the adsorption efficiency of spherosome for chloroform was higher than that of rice bran or activated carbon in the high chloroform concentration range (concentration > 0.1 g/L). In the low chloroform concentration range (concentration < 0.08 g/L), activated carbon adsorbs more chloroform than spherosome, but the adsorbed amount by spherosome is of the same order as that by activated carbon, which is several orders higher than that by rice bran. Chloroform was removed from tap water with an average removal efficiency of 90% after 90 min when spherosome (2 g/L) was added to tap water containing 0.105 mg/L of chloroform. 3awater treatment 3awater pollution 3achloroform 3arice bran 3alipid bodies 3aadsorption 3achemical concentration 3atap water 2aAdsorption 2aCharcoalxchemistry 2aChloroformxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aOryza. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aWater Purificationxmethods1 aOkano, T.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Feb. 27, v. 56, no. 4 p.1358-1360dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf073037c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02107naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100001300158245010400171300001600275500002400291520087500315650002401190650002201214650002101236650001401257650001501271650000901286650002101295650001601316650001901332650001601351653001601367700001301383700001301396773010901409852000901518856008901527930003301616945002501649946001101674655001201685IND4401757520221122170825.0080222e20080403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.08.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aWang, Y.10aEffect of enzymatic treatment on cotton fiber dissolution in NaOH/urea solution at cold temperature  ap. 178-184.  aIncludes references  aIn this communication, the dissolution behavior of enzyme pretreated cotton fibers in NaOH/urea solution is reported. The experimental results indicated that although the crystallinity of cotton linter almost did not change during the enzymatic pretreatment, the solubility of cellulose in cold NaOH/urea solution increased from 30% for original cotton fibers to 65% for enzymatic treated fibers, which was mainly attributed to the reduction of cellulose's molecular weight by the enzymatic treatment. Moreover, the dissolution time was also greatly shortened by the enzymatic pretreatment. The results suggest that the effect of crystallinity of the cellulose on the cellulose dissolution in NaOH/urea solution is much less than that of molecular weight. It was found that the temperature plays a dominating role to the cellulose fiber solubility in NaOH/urea solution. 3aenzymatic treatment 3acrystal structure 3amolecular weight 3acellulose 3asolubility 3aurea 3asodium hydroxide 3atemperature 3apolymerization 3alint cotton 0adissolution1 aZhao, Y.1 aDeng, Y.0 tCarbohydrate polymers.g2008 Apr. 3, v. 72, no. 1 p.178-184dApplied Science Publishersx0144-86177nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbpol.2007.08.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080515b20080606c00000000  aINDdLYNe2008/05/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02825naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002200174245004500196300001800241500002400259500001500283520108200298650002101380650002201401650002901423650001501452650001501467650001501482650001301497650001501510650001501525650003101540650002001571650005001591650001601641650001301657650002601670650002001696650001501716650001601731650003001747650003101777651001001808653003101818700002101849700001401870700002001884773016201904852000902066856007702075930003302152945002502185946001302210655001202223IND4401757420221122170851.0080222e20080227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175742DNAL7 a182475622pmid7 a10.1021/jf072878g2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ500 0aF6001 aBandyopadhyay, S.10aNew Slow-Releasing Molybdenum Fertilizer  ap. 1343-1349.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis paper describes a new water-insoluble molybdenum compound that has been developed as a slow-release fertilizer. The compound is an inorganic polymer formed by inclusion of molybdenum within a long-chain polyphosphate structure. It was designed by a process of “reverse engineering” of the molecule. Synthesis involved reaction of phosphoric acid with magnesium oxide, molybdenum trioxide, and sodium carbonate at 275 °C. Kinetics of reaction revealed complex multistage processes. X-ray diffraction patterns showed a crystalline nature with short-range as well as long-range ordering. The magnesium sodium polymolybdophosphate had ideal slow-release characteristics; it had low water solubility and high citrate solubility and was powdery, free flowing, and nonhygroscopic. Field testing showed an 80% increase in yield of green gram at a low dose of 0.04 kg/ha Mo. Nodulation increased by over 161%, and N content of gram increased by 20%. The slow-release fertilizer would provide an effective, low-cost, and environmentaly friendly alternative to Mo fertilization. 3anitrogen content 3areaction kinetics 3aslow-release fertilizers 3acrop yield 3amolybdenum 3amung beans 3apolymers 3anodulation 3asolubility 3aVigna radiata var. radiata 2aCrystallization 2aEnvironmental Pollutionxprevention & control 2aFertilizers 2aKinetics 2aMolybdenumxchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSolubility 2aTemperature 2aTrace Elementsxchemistry 2aX-Ray Diffractionxmethods 3aIndia 0aphysicochemical properties1 aBhattacharya, I.1 aGhosh, K.1 aVaradachari, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Feb. 27, v. 56, no. 4 p.1343-1349dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072878g3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02661naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001800137245016800155300001600323500002400339500001500363520125800378650003501636650001901671650002701690650003401717650001301751650002501764650002001789650003101809650001201840650002401852651001601876653001401892653002301906700001601929773008701945852000902032856009102041930003302132945002502165946001302190655001202203IND4417129720221122141210.0090302s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441712972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aX320 0aX700 0aX1001 aSung, Bongsuk10aHow External Political-Economic Forces Affect Firms' Attitudes Toward the Industrial Use of Genetically Modified Organisms: An Analysis in the South Korean Context  ap. 114-122.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBased on survey data, this article investigates the effects of external political-economic forces on firms' attitudes toward the industrial use of GMOs in the South Korean context by performing an ordered probit regression analysis. The survey, covering 240 firms, was conducted from November 15, 2005 through December 17, 2005. Results indicate that external political-economic pressures derived from government, consumers, industry, and markets were important for promoting firms' industrial use of GMOs. The most important variables (listed in order of decreasing importance) were market attractiveness, competitive intensity, consumer acceptance, and regulatory intensity in terms of the coefficient. Hence, in South Korea, to promote firms' industrial use of GMOs, the highest priority must be given to policy measures promoting market circumstances securing high profits. And these should be followed by policies that induce inter-firm competition, obtain consumer acceptance, and develop government regulations that are not a burden to firms. NGOs pressures (i.e., NGOs objection), firm's size, and dummies for firm types (i.e., food industry vs. others) were not significant factors affecting firms' attitudes towards the industrial use of GMOs. 3agenetically modified organisms 3aquestionnaires 3aattitudes and opinions 3anongovernmental organizations 3apolitics 3abusiness enterprises 3aprobit analysis 3aagricultural biotechnology 3asurveys 3aregression analysis 3aSouth Korea 0aeconomics 0aexternal pressures1 aJang, Homin0 tAgbioforum.g2008, v. 11, no. 2 p.114-122dUniversity of Missourix1522-936X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.agbioforum.org/v11n2/v11n2a05-sung.pdf3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090312b20090508c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/12  aOther US 7aarticle02906naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155072000900164100002300173245014700196300001400343500002400357500001500381520130500396650002101701650002201722650002301744650001001767650001501777650001401792650002201806650001601828650001701844650002701861650001701888650001401905650001101919650001601930653002001946653002001966653001401986700002302000700002802023700002502051773011902076852000902195856007702204930003302281945002502314946001302339655001202352IND4417105820221122141122.0090228e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441710582DNAL7 a10.1002/zoo.202122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aL300 0aL600 0aP0501 aTakahashi, Maressa10aEvaluating the utility of an accelerometer and urinary hormone analysis as indicators of estrus in a Zoo-housed koala (Phascolarctos cinereus)  ap. 59-68.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aInduced ovulators, such as the koala, do not always have overt signs of estrus, which makes pairing these animals for breeding purposes difficult to achieve in a zoo setting. This study examined the possibility of using alternative methods to behavioral sampling and weight fluctuations for monitoring estrus in a female koala of reproductive age. We attempt to gain an improved understanding of koala estrus and enhance our ability to detect it by combining a noninvasive technique for hormone analysis with a newer method for recording activity level. The findings suggest that activity levels were accurately measured using an accelerometer and increased activity was associated with one estrus behavior, bellowing. Weekly weight declines occur with increases in activity registered from the accelerometer. We also validated an assay to detect progesterone and estradiol in female koala urine in an attempt to detect an estrus spike. However, neither urinary concentrations of estradiol nor progesterone was associated with behavioral cues of estrus in our subject. We suggest that increased female activity, bellowing, and weight loss all indicate a pro-estrus state that requires proper male stimulation in order to achieve a full estrus display.

This work examined the potential of oil-in-water emulsions as a lycopene delivery system for foods. Oil-in-water emulsions containing lycopene were prepared using different kinds of surfactant (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) and oil types (corn oil, stripped corn oil, and hexadecane). The formation of fatty acid oxidation products and the degradation of lycopene and tocopherol were then monitored. Fatty acids and lycopene had greater stability in oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by cationic dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) or nonionic polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether than by anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Oxidative stability in the corn oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by SDS was in the following order: tocopherol < lycopene < fatty acids. When emulsions were prepared using different carrier oils, the lycopene stability was in the following order: nonstripped corn oil > hexadecane > tocopherol-stripped corn oil. Lycopene degradation rates were similar in emulsions with and without fatty acids, suggesting that lycopene loss was independent of the presence of fatty acids. These results suggest that the stability of lycopene in oil-in-water emulsions could be inhibited by altering the emulsion droplet interface and by the presence of tocopherols. 3alycopene 3atocopherols 3aoxidation 3aemulsions 3asurfactants 3astabilizers 3afood additives 3acooking fats and oils 3alipid peroxidation 3acorn oil 3ahexadecane 3achemical degradation 3aoxidative stability 2aCarotenoidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aEmulsions 2aExcipients 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aLipid Peroxidation 2aOilsxchemistry 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aSurface-Active Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aTocopherolsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aWaterxchemistry 0aanionic stabilizers 0acationic stabilizers 0anonionic stabilizers1 aXu, Z.1 aYue, X.1 aMcClements, D.J.1 aWeiss, J.1 aDecker, E.A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Feb. 27, v. 56, no. 4 p.1408-1414dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072929+3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle03239naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162100001400171245009900185300001800284500002400302520124500326650001601571650001301587650002901600650002901629650001701658650001801675650001801693650002001711650002301731650001901754650001401773650003101787650002401818650002301842650002601865650003301891650002901924650003001953650004201983650002202025650002702047650004002074650003802114650002702152650003702179700001702216700001702233700001802250700001502268700001802283700001702301773010802318852000902426856008302435930003302518945002502551946001302576655001202589IND4401759320221122141138.0080222e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175932DNAL7 a179771472pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-20-11-13532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF5001 aPessi, G.10aGenome-Wide Transcript Analysis of Bradyrhizobium japonicum Bacteroids in Soybean Root Nodules  ap. 1353-1363.  aIncludes references  aThe transcriptome of endosymbiotic Bradyrhizobium japonicum bacteroids was assessed, using RNA extracted from determinate soybean root nodules. Results were compared with the transcript profiles of B. japonicum cells grown in either aerobic or microaerobic culture. Microoxia is a known trigger for the induction of symbiotically relevant genes. In fact, one third of the genes induced in bacteroids at day 21 after inoculation are congruent with those up-regulated in culture by a decreased oxygen concentration. The other induced genes, however, may be regulated by cues other than oxygen limitation. Both groups of genes provide a rich source for the possible discovery of novel functions related to symbiosis. Samples taken at different timepoints in nodule development have led to the distinction of genes expressed early and late in bacteroids. The experimental approach applied here is also useful for B. japonicum mutant analyses. As an example, we compared the transcriptome of wild-type bacteroids with that of bacteroids formed by a mutant defective in the RNA polymerase transcription factor σ54. This led to a collection of hitherto unrecognized B. japonicum genes potentially transcribed in planta in a σ54-dependent manner. 3aGlycine max 3asoybeans 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3anitrogen-fixing bacteria 3aroot nodules 3amessenger RNA 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3amicrobial genetics 3acultured cells 3asymbiosis 3agene expression regulation 3asignal transduction 3atemporal variation 3atranscription factors 2aBacterial Proteinsxgenetics 2aBradyrhizobiumxgenetics 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenome, Bacterial 2aProtein Array Analysis 2aRNA, Bacterialxanalysisxgenetics. 2aRoot Nodules, Plantxmicrobiology 2aSoybeansxmicrobiology 2aTranscription, Geneticxgenetics1 aAhrens, C.H.1 aRehrauer, H.1 aLindemann, A.1 aHauser, F.1 aFischer, H.M.1 aHennecke, H.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2007 Nov., v. 20, no. 11 p.1353-1363dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-20-11-13533Available from publisher's Web site  a20080521b20080606c00000000  aINDd2CTe2008/04/17  aOther US 7aarticle03376naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001200165245015600177300001800333500002400351500001500375520103000390650001201420650001501432650001301447650002401460650002201484650002501506650001701531650000701548650002201555650001101577650001601588650002001604650001501624650002401639650001201663650002501675650002401700650004001724650005701764650002201821650002201843650001701865650002901882650001701911650003201928650002201960650003101982650002802013650002102041650001402062650002802076650002602104650001602130653001702146653002702163653003102190653002802221700001402249700001302263700001102276773016202287852000902449856007702458930003302535945002502568946001302593655001202606IND4401760620221122141135.0080222e20080227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440176062DNAL7 a181976162pmid7 a10.1021/jf07134102doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5061 aHua, Y.10aPurification and Characterization of a Novel Fibrinolytic Enzyme from Bacillus sp. nov.

SK006 producing four extracellular fibrinolytic enzymes was isolated from fermented shrimp paste, a traditional and popular Asian seasoning. One fibrinolytic enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a molecular mass of 43-46 kDa by SDS-PAGE and gel filtration chromatography. The specific activity was determined to be 11.2 units/mg using plasmin as a standard. The enzyme displayed optimal activity at 30 °C and pH 7.2. It was stable below 40 °C for 4 h between pH 5.0 and pH 11.0. Zinc ion stimulated the enzyme activity whereas Cu2+, Ca2+, Fe3+, and Hg2+ caused its inhibition. The fibrinolytic activity was strongly inhibited by PMSF and moderately inhibited by EDTA as well as PCMB. The enzyme exhibited a higher affinity toward N-Succ-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-pNA and was able to degrade fibrin clots either by forming active plasmin from plasminogen or by direct fibrinolysis. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was found to be AQSVPYEQPHLSQ, which is different from that of other known fibrinolytic enzymes. 3aenzymes 3afood paste 3aseafoods 3aBacillus (bacteria) 3aenzyme inhibition 3aamino acid sequences 3afibrinolysis 3apH 3atraditional foods 3ashrimp 3atemperature 3aenzyme activity 3ametal ions 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBacillusxenzymology 2aChromatography, Gel 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEndopeptidasesxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEnzyme Inhibitors 2aFermentation 2aFibrinolysinxmetabolism 2aFibrinolysis 2aFlavoring Agentsxchemistry 2aFood Microbiology 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMolecular Weight 2aPenaeidae 2aPlasminogenxmetabolism 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTemperature 0apurification 0aBacillus sp.nov.

Genetic bottlenecks may constrain the evolution of phenotypic traits that facilitate success in novel habitats. We examined the effect of introduction into novel environments on genetic diversity of an insect pest, Adelges cooleyi, which was introduced into the eastern United States during the mid nineteenth century. We compared variation in mitochondrial and nuclear genomes in native and introduced samples to determine the effect of introduction on genetic variation experienced by this insect. We also measured an ecologically important phenotype, variation in host preference, in both native and introduced samples to compare variation in that trait with molecular genetic variation. To further investigate the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation, we examined the degree to which mtDNA haplotypes provide information about host preference. Adelges cooleyi in eastern North America has significantly reduced genetic and phenotypic variation, but this low variation does not appear to have prevented persistence in a novel environment. Introduced insects appear to have retained host preference phenotypes similar to those of insects found where introductions likely originated. 3afounder effect 3ainsect pests 3aamplified fragment length polymorphism 3ahaplotypes 3amitochondrial DNA 3ahost plants 3aintroduced species 3agenetic variation 3ageographical variation 3aGilletteella cooleyi 3aphenotypic variation 3ahost preferences 3aEastern United States 0apopulation genetics1 aHawthorne, David J. 1 aRaupp, Michael J. 0 tBiological invasions.g2009 Apr., v. 11, no. 4 p.959-971dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-008-9308-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20090318b20090508c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/03/18  aNon-US 7aarticle03717naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162100001900171245017300190300001800363500002400381520135000405650002201755650002601777650002701803650001901830650002601849650000701875650002001882650001201902650002501914650001101939650002301950650001801973650001601991650002002007650004502027650002902072650002302101650003102124650004402155650004202199650002102241650003102262650002102293650001102314650003602325650003002361650004802391650005002439650004902489653002002538653002802558700002602586700001302612700001602625700001702641700002102658700001802679700001502697773010802712852000902820856008302829930003302912945002502945946001302970655001202983IND4401760120221122141141.0080222e200711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440176012DNAL7 a179771532pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-20-11-14212doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF5001 aSohlenkamp, C.14aThe Lipid Lysyl-Phosphatidylglycerol Is Present in Membranes of Rhizobium tropici CIAT899 and Confers Increased Resistance to Polymyxin B Under Acidic Growth Conditions  ap. 1421-1430.  aIncludes references  aLysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (LPG) is a well-known membrane lipid in several gram-positive bacteria but is almost unheard of in gram-negative bacteria. In Staphylococcus aureus, the gene product of mprF is responsible for LPG formation. Low pH-inducible genes, termed lpiA, have been identified in the gram-negative α-proteobacteria Rhizobium tropici and Sinorhizobium medicae in screens for acid-sensitive mutants and they encode homologs of MprF. An analysis of the sequenced bacterial genomes reveals that genes coding for homologs of MprF from S. aureus are present in several classes of organisms throughout the bacterial kingdom. In this study, we show that the expression of lpiA from R. tropici in the heterologous hosts Escherichia coli and Sinorhizobium meliloti causes formation of LPG. A wild-type strain of R. tropici forms LPG (about 1% of the total lipids) when the cells are grown in minimal medium at pH 4.5 but not when grown in minimal medium at neutral pH or in complex tryptone yeast (TY) medium at either pH. LPG biosynthesis does not occur when lpiA is deleted and is restored upon complementation of lpiA-deficient mutants with a functional copy of the lpiA gene.

Analysis of the haemolymph of infected mosquitoes through SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC showed up-regulation of five proteins of molecular weights 40, 66, 22, 14, and 7-kDa. Among these, only the 40-kDa was unknown and the others were comparable with those already reported as transferrin, attacin, lysozyme, and defensin, respectively. In the present study, the 40-kDa protein up-regulated upon infection was identified as actin through nano-LC-MS/MS analysis. Actin is known to be one of the cytoskeletal proteins up-regulated in the haemolymph, as part of the innate immune system, of Escherichia coli challenged Drosophila melanogaster larvae. For the first time, we have observed an increased level of actin in the haemolymph of W. bancrofti-infected Cx. quinquefasciatus. However, the exact mechanism of actin involvement in the immune system of this mosquito is yet to be studied. 3aCulex quinquefasciatus 3aWuchereria bancrofti 3amicrofilariae 3ainfection 3abiological development 3ahemolymph 3aactin 3aprotein synthesis 3agene expression regulation 3aimmune response 3ainsect immunity 3ainsect vectors 3aBancroftian filariasis 2aActinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aCulexxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aDefensinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aFemale 2aHemolymphxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aInsect Proteinsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aInsect Vectorsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aMuramidasexisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aTandem Mass Spectrometry 2aTransferrinxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aUp-Regulation 2aWuchereria bancroftixphysiology 0ahemolymph proteins 0agene upregulation1 aPaily, K.P.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2008 Mar., v. 118, no. 3 p.297-302dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2007.08.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/08/22  aOther US 7aarticle03777naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161100001100170245011000181300001600291500002400307500001500331520219200346650001302538650001802551650001602569650002102585650002002606650002302626650001802649650002402667650002402691650001402715650002002729650002102749650001802770650002402788650002402812653003102836653003202867653002502899700001302924700001202937773012802949852000903077856009203086930003303178945002503211946001103236655001203247IND4401762020221122104251.0080222e20071215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440176202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2007.01.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL6001 aHe, X.10aEffects of different dietary oil sources on immune function in cyclophosphamide immunosuppressed chickens  ap. 186-200.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn experiment with 3 x 2 factorial arrangement was carried out to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with different dietary oil sources on immune function in cyclophosphamide (CY) immunosuppressed chickens. Three hundred and sixty day old male Arbor Acre broiler chickens were randomly allocated into six treatments. The main factors consisted of dietary supplemental oil sources (45 g fish oil, maize oil or poultry oil per kilogram of diet) and immunosuppressive challenge (birds challenged with CY or treated with sterile saline). Growth performance, the relative weights of the spleen, thymus and bursa, antibody production, lysozyme activity and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis were investigated. The fish oil diets resulted in higher body weight gain, feed efficiency, lysozyme activity, anti-bovine serum albumin (BSA) and anti-NDV titers than the maize oil or poultry oil diets (P<0.05) in different growth periods. Chickens treated with CY showed significant decrease (P<0.05) in growth performance, the relative lymphoid organs' weight, lysozyme activity, antibody response to BSA and NDV when compared to the saline-treated control chickens. The interaction of oil source with CY on body weight gain, feed intake and anti-NDV titers was observed across different growth periods, i.e. fish oil attenuated the growth-suppressive and immunosuppressive effects of CY treatment. The effect of oil source was significant on the production of PGE2 (P<0.05), and the lowest level of PGE2 production was in fish oil (FO) fed chickens and the highest level was in maize oil (MO) fed chickens independent of CY treatment. The negative correlations were found between PGE2 synthesis and lysozyme activity in serum at the age of 28 d (R2 = -0.686, P<0.001), but no correlation was observed between PGE2 synthesis and antibody titers. The results suggest that dietary n - 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation enhanced the humoral immune response under not only the normal physiological status but also the immunosuppressive status, and the overall effects of fish oil on humoral immunity cannot be accounted for solely on the basis of PGE2-mediated effects. 3achickens 3aanimal growth 3adietary fat 3ahumoral immunity 3apoultry feeding 3aexperimental diets 3aimmunotherapy 3aplant fats and oils 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3afish oils 3aimmune response 3acyclophosphamide 3atissue weight 3adietary supplements 3aomega-6 fatty acids 0aprostaglandin E2 synthesis 0aimmunosuppression (therapy) 0aanimal fats and oils1 aYang, X.1 aGuo, Y.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2007 Dec. 15, v. 139, no. 3-4 p.186-200dElsevier Scientific Pub.

Occasionally, however, related and contradictory data are reported, including findings of mouse liver and kidney DNA adducts and damage following intraperitoneal (ip) injection. Mode-of-action investigations were therefore undertaken to determine the significance of these contradictory data while concurrently comparing results from ip and oral exposures. Exposure by ip injection indeed produced marked hepatic and renal toxicity, but oral administration did not. The results suggest that ip injection of GCHF may induce secondary effects mediated by local toxicity rather than genotoxicity. Furthermore, these results continue to support the conclusion that glyphosate and GCHF are not genotoxic under exposure conditions that are relevant to animals and humans. 3ahuman health 3aanimal health 3aglyphosate 3amechanism of action 3aintraperitoneal injection 3aoral administration 3agenotoxicity 3ahepatotoxicity 3anephrotoxicity 2aAdministration, Oral 2aAnimals 2aCarcinogens 2aDNA Adducts 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effects 2aGlycinexanalogs & derivativesxtoxicity. 2aHerbicidesxtoxicity 2aHumans 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aKidneyxdrug effects 2aLiverxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred ICR 2aRandom Allocation 2aRisk Assessment 2aSafety 2aToxicity Tests1 aHealy, C.E.1 aHotz, K.J.1 aKier, L.D.1 aMartens, M.A.1 aWilson, A.G.E.1 aFarmer, D.R.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Feb. 27, v. 56, no. 4 p.1517-1523dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072581i3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle03720naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100002300195245015500218300001600373500002400389520128600413650001401699650002801713650002301741650002401764650001201788650001801800650002501818650003201843650001801875650001101893650001401904650001801918650002401936650001201960650003801972650004902010650002202059650003002081650005502111650001102166650001902177650005902196650003102255650002502286650002902311650005102340650002502391650003902416650004802455650002602503650003802529700001702567700001802584700001902602700002002621700001802641700001902659700002102678773009402699852000902793856008902802930003302891945002502924946001302949655001202962IND4401762820221122104228.0080222e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440176282DNAL7 a179452182pmid7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2007.09.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL823 0aL0011 ad'Avila-Levy, C.M.10aCrithidia deanei: Influence of parasite gp63 homologue on the interaction of endosymbiont-harboring and aposymbiotic strains with Aedes aegypti midgut  ap. 345-353.  aIncludes references  aThe present study demonstrates that the endosymbiont of Crithidia deanei influences the expression of surface gp63 molecules. Ultrastructural immunocytochemical analysis shows the presence of the gp63-like protein in the protozoan flagellum and flagellar pocket, either attached to shed membranes or in a free form. This molecule is glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored to the plasma membrane as demonstrated by phospholipase C (PLC) treatment and cross-reacting determinant detection by immunoblotting. The gp63 molecule mediates the adhesive process of the protozoan to Aedes aegypti explanted guts, since the binding was reduced by pre-incubating the C. deanei parasites (wild and aposymbiotic strains) with anti-gp63 antibodies, PLC or PLC followed by anti-gp63 antibodies incubation. In addition, the number of wild C. deanei bound to A. aegypti explanted guts was twice as that of aposymbiotic parasites. Flow cytometry assays revealed that the reactivity of the wild strain with anti-gp63 antibodies was approximately twice as that of the aposymbiotic strain. We may conclude that higher expression of surface gp63 by the wild strain of C. deanei may positively influence this interaction, posing a prominent advantage for the endosymbiont-containing trypanosomatids. 3aCrithidia 3aouter membrane proteins 3ametalloproteinases 3aimmunocytochemistry 3astrains 3aendosymbionts 3aprotozoal infections 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aAedes aegypti 3amidgut 3ainfection 3acell adhesion 2aAedesxparasitology 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanximmunology 2aAntigens, Protozoanximmunologyxphysiology. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCell Adhesionxphysiology 2aCrithidiaximmunologyxphysiologyxultrastructure. 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGlycosylphosphatidylinositolsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aImmunohistochemistry 2aIntestinesxparasitology 2aMetalloendopeptidasesximmunologyxphysiology. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aProtozoan Proteinsximmunologyxphysiology. 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 2aType C Phospholipasesxmetabolism1 aSantos, L.O.1 aMarinho, F.A.1 aMatteoli, F.P.1 aLopes, A.H.C.S.1 aMotta, M.C.M.1 aSantos, A.L.S.1 aBranquinha, M.H.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2008 Mar., v. 118, no. 3 p.345-353dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2007.09.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/08/22  aOther US 7aarticle03424naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001400195245018200209300001600391500002400407520104700431650002201478650002501500650001901525650003601544650002901580650001701609650001801626650001601644650003201660650001701692650001501709650002101724650001201745650007601757650001401833650003201847650002801879650003201907650001901939650003501958650003901993650004402032650007002076650003602146650007502182653002602257700001802283700002202301700002402323700002102347700001902368700002102387700002402408700001902432773009402451852000902545856008902554930003302643945002502676946001302701655001202714IND4401762620140724000000.0080222e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440176262DNAL7 a179502832pmid7 a10.1016/j.exppara.2007.08.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL823 0aL810 0aS2001 aIzumi, E.10aTrypanosoma cruzi: Antiprotozoal activity of parthenolide obtained from Tanacetum parthenium (L.)

Feverfew is a traditional herbal medicine that has been used for the treatment of migraine, fever and arthritis. Activity against epimastigote forms was observed for crude extracts, fractions and parthenolide, and a progressive increase in the antitrypanosomal effect was observed in the course of the purification process. The pure compound showed IC50/96h and IC90/96h of 0.5 μg/ml and 1.25 μg/ml, respectively. The cytotoxic effect of parthenolide in LLMCK2 cells was 3.2 μg/ml (CC50/96h) and the selectivity index was 6.4. No hemolysis was detected for the pure compound. The internalization index of T. cruzi in LLMCK2 cells was reduced almost 51% at the concentration of 2 μg/ml of parthenolide, and 96.6% at 4 μg/ml. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy permitted observation of morphological modifications and ultrastructural alterations. 3aTrypanosoma cruzi 3aTanacetum parthenium 3aplant extracts 3achemical constituents of plants 3asesquiterpenoid lactones 3atrypanocides 3aepimastigotes 3aamastigotes 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3acytotoxicity 3acell lines 3aherbal medicines 2aAnimals 2aAntiprotozoal Agentsxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aCell Line 2aCell Survivalxdrug effects 2aHemolysisxdrug effects 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aMacaca mulatta 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Transmission 2aPlant Extractsxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aSesquiterpenesxisolation & purificationxpharmacologyxtoxicity. 2aTanacetum partheniumxchemistry 2aTrypanosoma cruzixdrug effectsxgrowth & developmentxultrastructure. 0atrypanocidal activity1 aMorello, L.G.1 aUeda-Nakamura, T.1 aYamada-Ogatta, S.F.1 aDias Filho, B.P.1 aCortez, D.A.G.1 aFerreira, I.C.P.1 aMorgado-Díaz, J.A.1 aNakamura, C.V.0 tExperimental parasitology.g2008 Mar., v. 118, no. 3 p.324-330dElsevierx0014-48947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2007.08.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080822b20080905c00000000  aINDdNZMe2008/08/22  aOther US 7aarticle02087naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002800154245004300182300001600225500012900241520113500370650002201505650001701527650002501544650001501569650001601584773014501600856005501745852000901800655001201809IND60594481520221122104233.0180516e20171222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059448152DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1189.622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToorn, M.

Attention will be paid to specific design approaches for botanical gardens that can be used in contemporary practice. The research method is partly based on literature analysis, partly on analysis of plans and partly on fieldwork. Overall, the principles of case study research are applied to research on design knowledge for day-to-day practice. The design principles of some historical and contemporary examples of botanical gardens will be analysed. It results in an elaboration of a contemporary design approach on the structural level. It focusses on continuity and development in which the structure enables continuity in the long run and at the same time allows for changes, developments and interventions on the short term. Botanical gardens offer a characteristic contribution to the rich diversity of the palette of urban green spaces and to the urban landscape in general. Designers can contribute by their ideas and realisation of those ideas in extending the diversity and specific quality of those urban landscapes. 3abotanical gardens 3acase studies 3agreen infrastructure 3alandscapes 3aurban areas0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Dec. 22, , no. 1189 p.323-328dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1189.62  aDNAL 7aarticle01602naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002600112245010000138300001600238520055800254650001700812650001800829650002600847650001700873650001200890650001100902650001800913650002100931650001100952651001800963700001700981773016100998856010801159852000901267655001201276IND60594481020221122104311.0180516s2013    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059448102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHovhannisyan, Vardges12aA Benefit-Function Approach to Studying Market  Power: An Application to the U.S. Yogurt Market  ap. 159-173.  aThis article provides a structural framework for studying the market performance of various food  industries.

However, predictions from a markup-pricing model—such as  high correlations between retail price and farm price and among prices across retailers in a city—  are not supported empirically. We document three common alternatives to markup pricing: fixed  (constant) pricing, periodic sales, and high-low pricing. These results inform the development of a  structural model of the vertical market chain in order to study the relationship among retailers and  producers in a prototypical fresh produce market. A series of simulations under different pricing  regimes are conducted to evaluate these pricing strategies’ affects on farm price, farm income,  and the variability of farm income. Results show that the alternative pricing strategies to markup  pricing exacerbate farm price and income volatility compared to markup pricing. This enhanced  farm-price volatility is also generally detrimental to farm income. 3afarm income 3afarmers 3afarms 3afresh market 3amodels 3aprediction 3aprices 3asales1 aSexton, Richard J.0 tJournal of agricultural and resource economics.g2013, v. 38, no. 2 p.141-158dWestern Agricultural Economics AssociationwJournal:jnl48977x1068-55027nnas40uhttp://www.waeaonline.org/jareonline/archives/38.2%20-%20August%202013/JAREAug20131Lip141.pdf  aDNAL 7aarticle03227naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001600154245012300170300001600293500012900309520174000438650002302178650001702201650001802218650001602236650001102252650001802263650002202281650002002303650001502323650001202338650001302350650001302363650003302376650001702409650001302426650002802439651001002467700001602477700001902493700001902512700001702531773014502548856005502693852000902748655001202757IND60594481820221122063618.0180516e20171222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059448182DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1189.652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLarcher, F.10aIntegrating historical and social knowledge for restoring and planning traditional fruit landscape in Piedmont (Italy)  ap. 339-342.  aPaper presented at the VI International Conference on Landscape and Urban Horticulture held June 20-25, 2016, Athens, Greece  aThe restoration and conservation of traditional rural landscapes is considered a priority at both the international and national level. Maintaining traditional features of agricultural activity and adopting a sustainable approach are imperative tools. Combining historical identity and sustainability is a big challenge for our society. In order to preserve and safeguard fruit growing in traditional rural system in Piedmont (North-West Italy) a multidisciplinary, integrated study was carried out. This research analyzed alternatives for the restoration of traditional orchard systems and proposed an innovative approach for maintaining traditional values and forecasting future land use changes. For identifying traditional landscape elements an historical study was performed. For analyzing public awareness concerning the future change factors and transformations affecting the traditional fruit landscape, one focus group meeting and five student workshops were conducted. Globalization, economic crisis of the local fruit market, agricultural trade and plant diseases were the main future change factors perceived by focus group participants. During focus groups, orchards disappearance/transformation and permanence/maintenance scenarios were built and discussed. During students' workshops, several change factors and future landscape scenarios were identified. The study showed that the historical knowledge and the participation and empowerment of multiple stakeholders can suggest solutions and strategies for the sustainable development of rural landscapes. Participatory approach might contribute to rural landscape planning policy and our results can be included in the future landscape planning programs and researches. 3aagricultural trade 3afocus groups 3afruit growing 3afruit trees 3afruits 3aglobalization 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3amarkets 3aorchards 3aplanning 3aplant diseases and disorders 3astakeholders 3astudents 3asustainable development 3aItaly1 aGullino, P.1 aMellano, M.

These installations often take place where no mulch has been used, and thus may significantly alter water relations between trees and soils. Although presumed to increase stormwater capture without any detriment to trees, their effect on root distribution, tree growth, soil water distribution, and drought resilience are unknown. In November 2014 12 Platanus ×acerifolia 'Bloodgood' whips were planted in simulated urban pervious pavement profiles, six constructed with pervious resin-bound gravel pavement (PRBGP) and six bare soil (BS), in a clay-loam soil in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. Root growth was monitored with minirhizotrons, stem diameter was measured throughout the growing season, and soil moisture was recorded at 10, 30 and 60 cm depths. After one growing season, trees in PRBGP were larger (59% greater stem diameter) than those in BS and developed a shallower root system, with 26% of minirhizotron frames having roots in the first 10 cm while 6% had roots below 37 cm, compared to trees in BS that had 12% of frames with roots in the first 10 cm and 21% with roots below 37 cm. These effects are congruent with the increased moisture (23% greater at 10 cm depth) observed under PRBGP during dry periods. A lag phase in root development was also observed in BS compared to trees in PRBGP. It was concluded that the installation of PRBGP increased growth of newly planted trees compared to BS. However, roots appeared to be shallower under PRBGP profiles, which may affect drought resilience of urban trees and potentially increase root/pavement conflicts. 3aPlatanus acerifolia 3adrought 3agravel 3agrowing season 3amulches 3apavements 3aroot growth 3aroot systems 3arooting 3asoil water 3astormwater 3astreet trees 3atree growth 3awater distribution 3aVirginia1 aDay, S.

Fuhr, R.J. Hance, J.R. Plimmer, and J.O. Nelson. Developed from a symposium sponsored by the Division of Agrochemicals, at the 213th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, April 3-17, 1997, San Francisco, California.  aThe assessment of the mobility of plant protection products in soil is a very important part within the authorization procedure for pesticides in the Federal Republic of Germany. In recent years lysimeter studies have been proven to be the best methods to assess the probability of pesticides entering into ground water. For substances with a DT50 value of more than 21 days and an adsorption constant Koc of less than 500, computer-aided model calculations at realistic worst case conditions are first conducted. If a concentration of 0.1 microgram/l or more is calculated, lysimeter studies have to be carried out. An authorization of the plant protection product is only granted if the concentration of the active substance in the leachate is less than 0.1 microgram/l averaged over one year. The lysimeter concept was also adopted by the EU Directive 91/414/EEC where in special cases lysimeter or field studies for the assessment of the mobility of active substances are required. In the last few years lysimeter studies were conducted for more than 40 active substances within the German authorization procedure. 3aGermany1 aSchinkel, K.0 tLysimeter concept : environmental behavior of pesticides.dWashington, DC : American Chemical Society : Distributed by Oxford University Press, c1998.7nnas  aDNAL  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03427naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002100110040001800131100001500149245016000164300001800324520170400342650002802046650001302074650001002087650001502097650002502112650002502137650001802162650002402180650004502204650001802249650002502267650002902292650006702321650001502388650002802403650002102431650002302452650005502475650003802530650002302568650002102591653002302612653002802635700001702663700001502680700002102695700001702716773008502733852000902818939003302827946001302860655001202873IND9205181620221122035052.0920819e199206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920518162DNAL7 a15974182pmid7 aPMC2061122pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCubo, M.T.10aMolecular characterization and regulation of the rhizosphere-expressed genes rhiABCR that can influence nodulation by Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae  ap. 4026-4035.  aA group of four rhi (rhizosphere-expressed) genes from the symbiotic plasmid of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae has been characterized. Although mutation of the rhi genes does not normally affect nodulation, in the absence of the closely linked nodulation genes nodFEL, mutations in the rhi genes can influence the nodulation of the vetch Vicia hirsuta. The DNA sequence of the rhi gene region reveals four large open reading frames, three of them constituting an operon (rhiABC) transcribed convergently toward the fourth gene, rhiR. rhiABC are under the positive control of RhiR, the expression of which is repressed by flavonoids that normally induce nod gene expression. This repression, which requires the nodD gene product (the transcriptional activator of nod gene expression), may be due to a cis effect caused by a high level of NodD-dependent expression from the adjacent nodO promoter, which is transcribed divergently from rhiR. RhiR shows significant similarities to a subfamily of transcriptional regulators that includes the LuxR and UvrC-28K proteins. RhiA shows limited homology to a short domain of the lactose permease, LacY, close to a region thought to be involved in substrate binding. No strong homologies were found for the other rhi gene products. It appears that RhiA and RhiB are cytoplasmic, whereas RhiC is a periplasmic protein, since it has a typical N-terminal transit sequence and a rhiC-phoA protein fusion expresses alkaline phosphatase activity. The biochemical role of the rhi genes has not been established, but it appears that they may play a role in the plant-microbe interaction, possibly by allowing the bacteria to metabolize a plant-made metabolite. 3aRhizobium leguminosarum 3aplasmids 3agenes 3anodulation 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aVicia hirsuta 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteinsxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA-Binding Proteins 2aFlavonoidsxpharmacology 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterialxdrug effectsxgenetics. 2aHesperidin 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOperonxgenetics 2aPlasmidsxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRhizobium leguminosarumxgenetics 2aSequence Alignment 2aTrans-Activators 0agenetic regulation 0amolecular sequence data1 aEconomou, A.1 aMurphy, G.1 aJohnston, A.W.B.1 aDownie, J.A.0 tJournal of bacteriology.g1992 June, v. 174, no. 12 p.4026-4035x0021-91937nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03161naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245008600170300001800256500002400274500001500298520158700313650002201900650002701922650001401949650002301963650002101986650002802007650001602035650001802051650001502069650000902084650001502093650002502108651001502133653002702148653001902175653002202194700001602216700001102232700001602243700001502259700001502274700001802289773014502307852000902452856007702461930003302538945002502571946001102596655001202607IND4401967620221122035203.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440196762DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28522doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT2001 aRehrah, D.10aEnhanced cholesterol- and triglyceride- lowering effect of West African green tea  ap. 1323-1329.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  a'The Vert' is a special type of green tea widely consumed in West Africa and locally associated with many health benefits. However, limited research has been conducted to evaluate its health benefits, such as its enhanced hypolipidemic potential. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the cholesterol- and triglyceride-lowering effects of West African green tea (WAGT) as affected by diet and tea intake, (2) determine the impact of WAGT consumption on the CHD risk ratio, and (3) explore possible mechanisms through which WAGT improves serum lipid profile. Forty-five male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of nine treatment combinations, three diets (regular, high-cholesterol, and trans-fat diets) and three fluid sources (no tea, diluted tea, and concentrated tea). After 6 weeks of feeding, animal blood, liver, and feces were harvested. Total cholesterol, HDLc, LDLc, and triglycerides in serum, liver, and feces were determined. The concentrations of bile acids in feces were also measured. WAGT significantly lowered serum and liver cholesterol (30% and 15%, respectively) and increased serum HDL cholesterol (30%). It also reduced liver enlargement caused by storage of excess lipids in high-cholesterol diet. Overall, the CHD risk ratio was cut by two-thirds in rats fed high-cholesterol diet and WAGT. A marked increase in fecal total lipids, cholesterol (60%), and bile acids (50%) was observed in rats that consumed WAGT compared to the control group. These beneficial effects could be attributed to the significantly high flavonoid content of WAGT. 3aCamellia sinensis 3acholesterol metabolism 3agreen tea 3aexperimental diets 3atriacylglycerols 3acardioprotective effect 3acholesterol 3aanimal models 3aflavonoids 3arats 3abile acids 3acholesteremic effect 3aMauritania 0aWest African green tea 0alipemic effect 0aprotective effect1 aAhmedna, M.1 aYu, J.1 aGoktepe, I.1 aHurley, S.1 aHanner, T.1 aRao-Patel, A.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 May, v. 87, no. 7 p.1323-1329dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28523Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02650naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092040001800122072000900140100001900149245016200168300001600330500002400346500001500370520118400385650002801569650002601597650001901623650002301642650001401665650003001679650002301709653001201732653002401744653002901768653002401797653003301821653002601854700001501880700002901895773010801924852000902032856008002041930003302121945002502154946001302179655001202192IND4401972520221122035040.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440197252DNAL7 a10.2136/vzj2006.01382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ2001 aRegalado, C.M.10aPerformance of the Commercial WET Capacitance Sensor as Compared with Time Domain Reflectometry in Volcanic Soils [Erratum: 2007 Aug., v. 6, issue 3, p. 529]  ap. 244-254.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAmong different alternatives, dielectric capacitance sensors may provide simultaneous readings of the volumetric water content and the soil solution electrical conductivity in the same sample volume at low cost. Reliability of capacitive sensors may be questioned, however, due to the low signal frequency at which they work, and also because of soil electrical conductivity effects on the water content estimation. In this study we evaluated the commercial capacitive WET Sensor (Delta-T Devices Ltd., Burwell, UK) compared with time domain reflectometry (TDR) in three volcanic soils with different textures. Although the WET Sensor uses internally the Hilhorst approach for describing the relationship between soil moisture and bulk and pore water electrical conductivity, results suggest that the Vogeler model is a better choice for the soils studied. The sensor provides good estimation of the bulk electrical conductivity, but determination of soil water content is biased. Thus, we propose an alternative empirical equation to determine the volumetric water content from the WET Sensor readings, the soil bulk density, and an estimate of the sensor's effective frequency. 3aelectrical conductivity 3adielectric properties 3avolcanic soils 3asoil water content 3aequations 3atime domain reflectometry 3acapacitance probes 0asensors 0acapacitance sensors 0avolumetric water content 0adielectric constant 0abulk electrical conductivity 0acapacitive WET Sensor1 aRitter, A.1 aRodriguez-Gonzalez, R.M.0 tVadose zone journal.g2007 May, v. 6, no. 2 p.244-254dSoil Science Society of Americax1539-16637nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2136/vzj2006.01383Available from publisher's Web site  a20080408b20080502c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/04/07  aOther US 7aarticle02985naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001600164245013200180300001800312500002400330500001500354520144000369650002201809650001701831650002801848650001301876650001801889650001601907650002001923650002301943650001401966650002101980650003602001650001402037650002302051651002102074653001502095653001402110653002402124700001902148773014502167852000902312856007702321930003302398945002502431946001102456655001202467IND4401970420221122035150.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440197042DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28812doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF140 0aQ500 0aQ1001 aTurkmen, N.10aDetermination of alkaloids and phenolic compounds in black tea processed by two different methods in different plucking seasons  ap. 1408-1416.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effects of two different rolling methods and three tea plucking seasons on alkaloids and phenolics, mainly flavan-3-ols and theaflavins, in black tea were studied using an improved high-performance liquid chromatographic method. Better separation of all tea compounds analyzed -- the most important factor for their identification and quantitation -- was achieved only with long elution gradients, which overcame the limitations of previously reported methods. Precision of the assay method was very high since intra-day and inter-day variations were within 0.76% and 1.66%, respectively. All analytes exhibited good linearity over the range evaluated with a correlation coefficient of 0.9987-1.000. Among the four solvents evaluated, 80% methanol was the most solvent for extracting individual tea compounds. The extraction method applied exhibited good repeatability (CV: 0.39-3.29%). The content of tea compounds analyzed varied with processing method and plucking season. Teas processed using the Cay-Kur method contained higher levels of identified phenolic compounds than orthodox teas, but their alkaloid content was similar to each other. The most abundant alkaloid in teas was caffeine, ranging from 17.84 mg g-1 dry weight in September plucking to 23.79 mg g-1 dry weight in May plucking. With respect to phenolic compounds, theaflavins were at the highest level, 14.27 mg g-1 dry weight, in Cay-Kur tea processed in May. 3aCamellia sinensis 3aharvest date 3afood processing quality 3acaffeine 3afood analysis 3atheobromine 3afood processing 3aseasonal variation 3ablack tea 3afood composition 3achemical constituents of plants 3aflavanols 3aphenolic compounds 3aTurkey (country) 0aharvesting 0aalkaloids 0atea plucking season1 aVelioglu, Y.S.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 May, v. 87, no. 7 p.1408-1416dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28813Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02523naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002300166245010400189300001600293500002400309500001500333520140600348650001501754650001001769650002301779650002201802650002301824651001401847653001701861773010501878852000901983856008801992930003302080945002502113946001102138655001202149IND4401982320221122005327.0080227e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440198232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2007.09.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aM3201 aHirst, Alastair J.10aSurrogate measures for assessing cryptic faunal biodiversity on macroalgal-dominated subtidal reefs  ap. 211-220.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA major impediment to the identification of priority areas for marine biodiversity conservation is a fundamental lack of information about the distribution of many marine species. Comprehensive species inventories for many areas currently do not exist, and performing detailed taxonomic surveys is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Accordingly, there is a need to develop simple and reliable rapid-assessment techniques for mapping marine biodiversity. One potential approach is to use 'surrogates' that function as proxies for the distribution of other, less easily sampled, 'cryptic' biota. Two potential surrogates for predicting arthropod faunal biodiversity on rock subtidal reefs were investigated in this study: (1) macroalgae, and (2) faunal subsets derived by aggregating the arthropod fauna at higher taxonomic levels. Faunal and macroalgal assemblage composition was only weakly correlated across sites reflecting broad faunal responses to changes in algal structural complexity and/or common environmental gradients. This suggests that algal species composition may not be very informative in mapping patterns of faunal species distribution on reefs. Instead, the best surrogates were related (i.e. nested), subsets of the faunal assemblages such as family-level taxon richness which was found to be a good predictor of arthropod species richness at independent test sites. 3amacroalgae 3areefs 3amarine environment 3aspecies diversity 3aaquatic arthropods 3aAustralia 0abiodiversity0 tBiological conservation.g2008 Jan., v. 141, no. 1 p.211-220dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2007.09.0253Available from publisher's Web site  a20100622b20100703c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/06/22  aNon-US 7aarticle03244naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100001700166245017300183300001300356500002400369500001500393520186700408650002202275650002502297650002402322650001402346650002202360650002602382650001702408651001502425651001402440700001702454700001902471700002102490700001902511773010202530852000902632856008802641930003302729945002502762946001102787655001202798IND4401984020221121234612.0080227e200801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440198402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocon.2007.07.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP050 0aL3001 aMurray, J.V.14aThe importance of ecological scale for wildlife conservation in naturally fragmented environments: A case study of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata)  ap. 7-22.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDetermining the ecologically relevant spatial scales for predicting species occurrences is an important concept when determining species-environment relationships. Therefore species distribution modelling should consider all ecologically relevant spatial scales. While several recent studies have addressed this problem in artificially fragmented landscapes, few studies have researched relevant ecological scales for organisms that also live in naturally fragmented landscapes. This situation is exemplified by the Australian rock-wallabies' preference for rugged terrain and we addressed the issue of scale using the threatened brush-tailed rock-wallaby (Petrogale penicillata) in eastern Australia. We surveyed for brush-tailed rock-wallabies at 200 sites in southeast Queensland, collecting potentially influential site level and landscape level variables. We applied classification trees at either scale to capture a hierarchy of relationships between the explanatory variables and brush-tailed rock-wallaby presence/absence. Habitat complexity at the site level and geology at the landscape level were the best predictors of where we observed brush-tailed rock-wallabies. Our study showed that the distribution of the species is affected by both site scale and landscape scale factors, reinforcing the need for a multi-scale approach to understanding the relationship between a species and its environment. We demonstrate that careful design of data collection, using coarse scale spatial datasets and finer scale field data, can provide useful information for identifying the ecologically relevant scales for studying species-environment relationships. Our study highlights the need to determine patterns of environmental influence at multiple scales to conserve specialist species such as the brush-tailed rock-wallaby in naturally fragmented landscapes. 3asimulation models 3aspatial distribution 3awildlife management 3aPetrogale 3awildlife habitats 3ahabitat fragmentation 3acase studies 3aQueensland 0aAustralia1 aLow Choy, S.1 aMcAlpine, C.A.1 aPossingham, H.P.1 aGoldizen, A.W.0 tBiological conservation.g2008 Jan., v. 141, no. 1 p.7-22dElsevier Science Ltd.x0006-32077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2007.07.0203Available from publisher's Web site  a20100621b20100703c00000000  aINDdYLPe2010/06/21  aNon-US 7aarticle02587naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148100001900157245018700176300001600363500002400379520121600403650001901619650002401638650001901662650001701681650001101698650001701709650002501726650001801751650004301769650001701812653002601829700002301855700002101878773010001899852000901999856008802008930003302096945002502129946001102154655001202165IND4401988820140724000000.0080227e20080118xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440198882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.0622doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ3001 aPezo, Davinson10aDetermination of the antioxidant capacity of active food packagings by in situ gas-phase hydroxyl radical generation and high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection  ap. 126-133.  aIncludes references  aAn experimental laboratory-made assembly to determine for the first time the antioxidant capacity with respect to hydroxyl (OH) radicals of several new active packagings directly in the materials has been developed. Gas-phase OH radicals are generated by UV-light irradiation of an aqueous H₂O₂ aerosol. After on-line reaction with up to eight parallel test samples, remaining OH is quantitatively trapped by a salicylic acid solution, and antioxidant capacity is indirectly assessed by HPLC-fluorescence determination of the high sensitive 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid formed. Several natural essential oils as well as active plastic films including in their formulation such oils have been subjected to oxidation. Polymers containing clove and oregano were the most efficient ones (up to 7.2 and 4.7 times, respectively, more antioxidant than blanks), whereas rosemary, citronella and propolis showed average efficiency. On the other hand, active materials containing ferulic acid, quercetin, catechin and thymol, as well as commercial active bags with ethylene-absorption properties, showed limited or none antioxidant protection.

The analytes were extracted from a 3mL sample solution using 4μL of hexyl acetate. After extraction, derivatization was carried out inside a glass microvial (1.1mm i.d.) using pentafluorobenzyl bromide (PFBBr). Triethylamine (TEA) was used as the reaction catalyst. The influence of derivatization reagent volume, catalyst amount, derivatization time and temperature on the yield of the in-microvial derivatization was investigated. Derivatization reaction was performed using 0.3μL of PFBBr and 0.4μL of TEA (10%, v/v in toluene) at 100°C during 5min. Also, the effects of different experimental SDME parameters such as selection of organic solvent, sample pH, addition of salt, extraction time and temperature of extraction were studied. Analytical parameters such as enrichment factor, precision, linearity and detection limits were also determined. The enrichment factors were between 83 and 157. The limits of detection (LOD) were in the range 1.2-7ng/L (S/N=3). The relative standard deviations obtained were below 10.1% (n =5). 3aherbicides 3aherbicide residues 3amicroextraction 3agas chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3awater pollution 0aacidic herbicides 0asingle-drop microextraction1 aFarajmand, Bahman0 tJournal of chromatography.g2008 Jan. 18, v. 1178, no. 1-2 p.17-23dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.0563Available from publisher's Web site  a20081203b00000000c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/05/06  aNon-US 7aarticle02123naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002600166245014500192300001400337500002400351520073300375650001901108650002301127650002301150650002701173650002001200650002301220650002201243653003201265700001701297700001901314700002101333700002101354700001801375700002301393773009501416852000901511856008801520930003301608945002501641946001101666655001201677IND4401986620221121225043.0080227e20080201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440198662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2007.11.1032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ5041 aDe Schutter, David P.10aOptimisation of wort volatile analysis by headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry  ap. 75-80.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this study was to create a simple, solventless technique without derivatisation in order to analyze a broad range of volatiles in beer wort.

The detection limits were well below the actual wort concentrations of the selected volatiles, ranging from 12ng/l for linalool to 0.53μg/l for furfural.

In this context, the mechanisms implied in salt concentration during dry season were studied by establishing salt budget with evaporation and drainage estimates inside and outside a saline patch. Drainage was estimated by Hydrus-1D modelling constrained by an hydrodynamic characterization and the profile of water contents at the end of dry season. Evaporation rates at the end of the dry season were computed by interpreting natural detailed profiles of deuterium (D) and chloride (Cl) contents. Because of the drastic diminution of hydraulic conductivity at saturation with depth and the decrease of groundwater level at the end of the cropping season, simulated hydrological balance with Hydrus-1D pointed out zero cumulated fluxes for depths of 39.5cm (outside the saline patch) and 37.5cm (inside the saline patch). Therefore, all the chloride accumulated in the very upper layers during dry season comes from the chloride that was present in the 0-39.5cm layers before the beginning of the drying. Inside the saline patch, the tentative Cl budget is coherent with the hypothesis of saturation of the profile by aquifer saline water during the flooding. Evaporation rates computed from the diffusion of chloride and deuterium at the end of the drying season, when the aquifer level was 1.4m deep, range between 0.121 and 0.378mmd-¹. This does not sustain the assumption of a considerable salinity contribution from the aquifer during the dry season. Moreover, evaporation estimates based on Cl and D diffusion equilibrium showed depleted rates (38-63%) inside the saline patch due to salt accumulation in the first 12cm of the soil. In the vapour transfer layer, estimated evaporation rate based on the vapour movement of D was in the same order of magnitude than computed rate assuming liquid Cl diffusion. This coincidence is attributed to the liquid fluxes that occurred during the expansion of the vapour transfer layer during the progression of the evaporation front. 3apaddy soils 3afields 3asoil salts 3asoil crusts 3aevaporation 3adrainage 3adeuterium 3adry season 3asoil profiles 3asaline soils 3achlorides 3aThailand 0asalt crusts1 aMacaigne, Peggy1 aMichelot, Jean-Luc1 aHartmann, Christian1 aSukchan, Somsak0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 348, no. 1-2 p.110-123dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.0393Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02720naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002100167245010700188300001600295500002400311500001500335520132000350650001101670650001601681650001101697650001101708650002301719650000901742650002401751650001101775650002101786650002201807651002001829651001401849653002001863653002001883653002201903700002101925700002001946773009301966852000902059856008902068930003302157945002502190946001102215655001202226IND4401995220221121190729.0080227e20080101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440199522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.0452doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aP200 0aX1001 aLeonard, Michael10aFrequency analysis of rainfall and streamflow extremes accounting for seasonal and climatic partitions  ap. 135-147.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe extreme value distributions of hydrologic variables such as rainfall and streamflow play a key role in the design of water-related infrastructure. The relationship between the intensity, frequency and duration of extreme values is commonly evaluated using observed annual maximum values. This paper considers maximum values that occur within a given season and the relationship between seasonal maxima and annual maxima. Using a climatic index, the seasonal and annual maxima are also partitioned into multiple climatic states so that comparisons of seasonal maxima both within and between climatic states can be made. The distributions of seasonal and annual rainfall maxima are investigated for numerous locations around Australia and a detailed analysis, involving both seasonal and climatic partitions, is given for the daily streamflows of the Murray-Darling Basin, Australia. The results demonstrate significant differences between seasonal distributions within and between climatic states. The application of seasonal extremes to an urban design scenario is illustrated for Scott Creek in the Adelaide Hills, South Australia. The methodology presented can be used in a general setting to gain insight into the relationship between extremes from seasonal and climatic periods to their annual counterparts. 3arivers 3astream flow 3awinter 3afloods 3aseasonal variation 3arain 3awatershed hydrology 3asummer 3aclimatic factors 3ahydrologic models 3aSouth Australia 0aAustralia 0aseasonal minima 0aseasonal maxima 0aseasonal extremes1 aMetcalfe, Andrew1 aLambert, Martin0 tJournal of hydrology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 348, no. 1-2 p.135-147dElsevierx0022-16947nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2007.09.0453Available from publisher's Web site  a20080620b20080704c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/06/20  aNon-US 7aarticle02757naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245011100127300001600238500001500254520153100269650000901800650002901809650001601838650001801854650001401872650002401886650002401910650001401934650003401948650001501982650001601997650001502013653003202028700001702060700001602077773021102093856005802304852000902362655001202371IND60594478720180710000000.0180516e199310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059447872DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, P.10aPrevaccination bovine viral diarrhea virus titers and subsequent reproductive performance in dairy heifers  ap. 236-240.  a2019-12-06  aThe study was conducted to determine if there was a relationship between prevaccination bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) titers in 14 month-old dairy heifers and time open during first lactation, length of the conception interval, fetal survival during the second pregnancy, and age at culling.

Evidence of exposure to BVDV prior to 14 months of age was demonstrated by serum-virus-neutralization titers greater than 1:4 for 97% and greater than or equal to 1:128 for 67% of the 72 heifers followed. No correlation was found for 38 pairs of prevaccination and postvaccination titers (p = 0.76). The risk of being culled was high for heifers (n = 41) with very low (1:2-1:8) or very high (> or = 1:256) titers, but low for heifers (n = 31) with moderate (1:16-1:128) prevaccination titers (p = 0.098). Risk of subsequent fetal loss was high for heifers (n = 30) with very low (1:2-1:16) or very high (> or = 1:256) prevaccination titers, compared to heifers (n = 24) with moderate (1:32-1:128) titers (p = 0.084). These findings suggest that prevaccination exposure to BVDV eliciting either a very weak or a very strong serological response may contribute to subsequent reproductive inefficiency and an increased risk of culling. 3arisk 3areproductive performance 3afetal death 3adairy heifers 3alactation 3aregression analysis 3aveterinary medicine 3apregnancy 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aviral load 3avaccination 3aconception 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aThurmond, M.1 aHietala, S.0 tCanadian journal of veterinary research.g1993 Oct., v. 57, no. 4 p.236-240dCanadian Veterinary Medical Association = Association canadienne                des vétérinaireswJournal:2054x0830-90007nnas40uhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1263634/  aDNAL 7aarticle02805naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001300112245014000125300001600265520152000281650001601801650001101817650001201828650001301840650001201853650001501865650002101880650002101901650001101922650001301933650002201946650002001968650000901988650002401997650001102021651001502032700002002047700001902067700001902086773021102105856005802316852000902374655001202383IND60594478820180710000000.0180516e199310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059447882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPare, J.10aEffect of birthweight, total protein, serum IgG and packed cell volume on risk of neonatal diarrhea in calves on two California dairies  ap. 241-246.  aThe objective of the study was to determine if there was a relationship between hematological, immunological and physiological variables of newborn calves and risk of diarrhea during the neonatal period. Four hundred and seventeen heifer calves from two dairies (A and B) in the San Joaquin Valley of California were enrolled at birth and scored daily, to 28 days of age, for evidence and severity of diarrhea (0 to 3). Calves were weighted at birth and blood sampled at two to five days of age to determine packed cell volume (PCV), total protein (TP) and IgG serum concentration. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine if age at onset of the first diarrhea episode and length of the first episode were associated with the hypothesized variables (PCV, TP, IgG and birthweight). The IgG concentration was not associated with the age at onset of diarrhea (p = 0.6052, Dairy A; p = 0.4393, Dairy B) but a high IgG concentration was associated with a decreased length of episode (p = 0.0325, Dairy A; p = 0.0912, Dairy B), particularly for calves born in the winter on dairy A (p = 0.0211). For calves born in the winter, those with either a high or a low birthweight had diarrhea at a younger age (p = 0.0102, Dairy A; p = 0.0020, Dairy B). Associations were also found for PCV and TP with both the age at onset and length of the first episode of diarrhea. Results suggest that parameters measurable at, or shortly after birth may have important prognostic value in evaluating risk of calf diarrhea. 3ablood serum 3acalves 3adairies 3adiarrhea 3aheifers 3ahematocrit 3aimmunoglobulin G 3alow birth weight 3amodels 3aneonates 3apostpartum period 3aprotein content 3arisk 3aveterinary medicine 3awinter 3aCalifornia1 aThurmond, M.

Adherence to nylon fibers and phagocytic activity of neutrophils from affected animals were significantly (p < 0.05) impaired as compared with those of controls. Neutrophils from affected heifers had decreased chemiluminescent (CL) responses when stimulated with opsonized zymosan, compared with those of controls. In contrast, neutrophils from affected heifers produced increased CL responses when stimulated with latex beads and phorbol myristate acetate compared with those of controls. The clinical findings, functional leukocyte abnormalities, deficiency in expression of CD18 on neutrophils, and the D128G mutation detected by DNA-PCR testing of affected heifers demonstrated that these heifers have bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD).

Calibration models were constructed using partial least squares (PLS) regression. A FA calibration model was constructed in the spectral range from 3033 to 700cm⁻¹. Oleic acid (62.0-80.0%), linoleic acid (5.3-15.0%), saturated fatty acids (SFA, 12.6-19.7%), mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA, 64.4-81.0%) and poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, 6.0-15.9%) were considered for chemometric analysis. PV (5.7-15.7meq O₂ kg⁻¹) was calibrated using the signal of the full spectral range 4000-700cm⁻¹ with first derivative pre-treatment. The LODs of the FTIR-chemometric methods were: 3.0% for oleic acid, 0.5% for linoleic acid, 1.3% for SFA, 3.0% for MUFA, 0.3% for PUFA and 1.0meq O₂ kg⁻¹ for PV. Analytical methods were evaluated by use of validation samples (n =25 for all the FA related parameters and n =10 for PV) with nearly quantitative recovery rates (98-103%). The proposed method provided results comparable to official procedures, with the advantages of being less expensive and more rapid. 3amonitoring 3afatty acid composition 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aolive oil 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aleast squares 3arapid methods 3areflectance 0avirgin olive oil1 aKaufman, Teodoro S.1 aCarlo, Michele Del1 aCerretani, Lorenzo1 aBendini, Alessandra1 aCichelli, Angelo1 aCompagnone, Dario0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 15, v. 114, no. 4 p.1549-1554dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.11.0293Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03134naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245014000170300001800310500002400328520168500352650001202037650001202049650001702061650002602078650001802104650002202122650002602144650001302170650001502183650001202198650002002210650002802230650002502258650002402283650001202307650001002319651001002329700002202339700002302361700001602384700002202400700002302422700002702445773011102472852000902583856004802592655001202640IND4457602120221121122950.0110506e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445760212DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-011-0025-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOtálora, Mónica G.10aRemnants fragments preserve genetic diversity of the old forest lichen Lobaria pulmonaria in a fragmented Mediterranean mountain forest  ap. 1239-1254.  aIncludes references  aFragmentation represents a serious threat to biodiversity worldwide, however its effects on epiphytic organisms is still poorly understood. We study the effect of habitat fragmentation on the genetic population structure and diversity of the red-listed epiphytic lichen, Lobaria pulmonaria, in a Mediterranean forest landscape. We tested the relative importance of forest patch quality, matrix surrounding fragments and connectivity on the genetic variation within populations and the differentiation among them. A total of 855 thalli were sampled in 44 plots (400 m²) of 31 suitable forest fragments (beeches and oaks), in the Sierra de Ayllón in central Spain. Variables related to landscape attributes of the remnant forest patches such as size and connectivity and also the nature of the matrix or tree species had no significant effects on the genetic diversity of L. pulmonaria. Values of genetic diversity (Nei's) were only affected by habitat quality estimated as the age patches. Most of the variation (76%) in all populations was observed at the smallest sampled unit (plots). Using multiple regression analysis, we found that habitat quality is more important in explaining the genetic structure of the L. pulmonaria populations than spatial distance. The relatively high level of genetic diversity of the species in old forest patches regardless of patch size indicates that habitat quality in a highly structured forest stand determines the population size and distribution pattern of this species and its associated lichen community. Thus, conservation programmes of Mediterranean mountain forests have to prioritize area and habitat quality of old forest patches. 3aLobaria 3aQuercus 3abiogeography 3aconservation programs 3aforest stands 3agenetic variation 3ahabitat fragmentation 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3alichens 3amontane forests 3apopulation distribution 3apopulation structure 3aregression analysis 3athallus 3atrees 3aSpain1 aMartinez, Isabel.1 aBelinchón, Rocío1 aWidmer, Ivo1 aAragón, Gregorio1 aEscudero, Adrián.1 aScheidegger, Christoph0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2011 June, v. 20, no. 6 p.1239-1254dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-011-0025-0 7aarticle02845naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168072000900177100001700186245010200203300001800305500002400323520133600347650001001683650002701693650003401720650001301754650001701767650001501784650002901799650002001828650002801848650001601876650003001892650002501922650002301947650002301970650001701993700001602010700001702026700002002043773009602063852000902159856009002168930003302258945002502291946001102316655001202327IND4416905920221121123002.0090228e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441690592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.11.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ113 0aQ203 0aQ503 0aQ3031 aEconomou, T.10aNisin-EDTA treatments and modified atmosphere packaging to increase fresh chicken meat shelf-life  ap. 1470-1476.  aIncludes references  aThe effect of nisin and EDTA treatments on the shelf-life of fresh chicken meat stored under modified atmosphere packaging at 4°C was evaluated. Chicken meat was subjected to the following antimicrobial treatment combinations: Nisin-EDTA treatments (added post-production to the chicken samples) included: N1 (no nisin-EDTA added; control sample), N2 (500IU/g; no EDTA added), N3 (1500IU/g; no EDTA added), N4 (500IU/g-10mM EDTA), N5 (1500IU/g-10 EDTA), N6 (500IU/g-50mM EDTA), N7 (1500IU/g-50 EDTA), N8 (10mM EDTA; no nisin added), and N9 (50mM EDTA; no nisin added). N3, N4, N5, N6 and N7 affected populations of mesophilic bacteria, Pseudomonas sp., Brochothrix thermosphacta, lactic acid bacteria, and Enterobacteriaceae. The antimicrobial combination treatments N5, N6 and N7 had a significant effect on the formation of volatile amines, trimethylamine nitrogen (TMA-N) and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) in chicken meat. The use of MAP in combination with nisin-EDTA antimicrobial treatments resulted in an organoleptic extension of refrigerated, fresh chicken meat by approximately 1-2 days (N2), 3-4 days (N3 and N4), 7-8 days (N5), 9-10 (N7) and by 13-14 days (N6).

The coconut oil extracted under hot conditions (HECO) contained more phenolic substances than the coconut oil extracted under cold conditions (CECO). The antioxidant potential of HECO was higher than that of CECO as demonstrated by DPPH assay, deoxyribose assay and in vivo assay of serum antioxidant capacity. It is the common belief that virgin coconut oil extracted under cold conditions preserves several thermally unstable antioxidants and, as a result, better beneficial qualities can be expected for virgin coconut oil. However, high temperatures used in the hot extraction of coconut oil favour the incorporation of more thermally stable phenolic antioxidants into coconut oil. Therefore, the consumption of HECO may result in the better improvement of antioxidant related health benefits compared with the consumption of CECO. 3aphenolic compounds 3aantioxidant activity 3acoconut oil 3aextraction 3aheat treatment 3afood processing 3afood processing quality 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3afree radical scavengers 3afatty acid composition 3arats 3aanimal models 3aexperimental diets 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 0acold extraction 0ahot extraction1 aHapuarachchI, Chamil D.1 aEkanayake, Sagarika0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 15, v. 114, no. 4 p.1444-1449dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.11.0383Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/31  aNon-US 7aarticle03812naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245012400163300001600287500002400303520248000327650002902807650002302836650002502859650001502884650001402899650002502913650002202938650001802960650001202978650001202990650001503002650003803017650001503055650001303070650001803083650002003101650002503121651001503146700001703161700002703178773009203205852000903297856004803306655001203354IND4408494820221121090148.0080801e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440849482DNAL7 a10.1007/s11056-008-9093-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMuhammed, Nur10aForest policy and sustainable forest management in Bangladesh: an analysis from national and international perspectives  ap. 201-216.  aIncludes references  aThis paper includes a review of international sustainable forestry development followed by an analysis of forest policies in Bangladesh. There have been four different government forest policies in Bangladesh since 1894. The first two forest policies (1894 and 1955) were exploitative in nature. Most of the regulatory documents were developed during the first two policy periods. The third forest policy instituted in 1979 by the sovereign Bangladesh government had contradictory elements and mutually inconsistent policy statements. It addressed for the first time forestry extension through mass motivation campaign. Current forest policy formulated in 1994 has been considered to be the most elaborate policy in the history of the country. Under this policy, participatory social forestry has been institutionalized in Bangladesh. The analysis shows that, although it is possible to attain the stated policy targets, progress is slow and is blocked on several fronts. A number of identified technical, managerial and logistical problems are hindering policy and program implementation. In addition, corruption contributes to the observed problems. The real strength of Bangladesh forestry is locally based, participatory forestry, co-management of protected areas and highly motivated people who increasingly recognize the need for a healthy forest ecosystem that will provide future economic stability. Because it is the rich homestead forests of Bangladesh that generate the majority of commercial forestry products, it is important that education continues at the grass-roots level. In addition, educated forestry and environment professionals have been identified as the future driving forces towards better, and sustainable, forest management. Results of this study make it clear that Bangladesh and other developing countries are not presently in a position to accept and adopt internationally derived forest policies due to inadequate institutional support, political instability and poor governance. Therefore, along with development of criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management and forest certification, international policy scientists must consider institutional development, professional skill development, identification and adoption of indigenous technology and long-term financial support in developing countries. Without these, all international processes, policies and directives will be of little value and produce few substantive results. 3acollaborative management 3aconservation areas 3adeveloping countries 3aecosystems 3aeducation 3aforest certification 3aforest management 3aforest policy 3aforests 3afunding 3agovernance 3ainternational policy and programs 3amotivation 3apolitics 3aprofessionals 3asocial forestry 3asustainable forestry 3aBangladesh1 aKoike, Masao1 aRahman, Farhana Haque.0 tNew forests.g2008 Sept., v. 36, no. 2 p.201-216dSpringer Netherlandsx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11056-008-9093-8 7aarticle02771naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001600186245017300202300001400375500002400389520088800413650001601301650001501317650001901332650001301351650002501364650001601389650002401405650001801429650001701447650001501464650001701479650002301496650001001519650000701529650002401536650002301560650004401583650002001627650001201647650001901659650001401678650002501692650002001717653002001737700001801757700001601775700001901791700002101810700001901831700001901850773008501869852000901954856008901963930003302052945002502085946001102110655001202121IND4416909220221121090227.0090228e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441690922DNAL7 a204166052pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2008.12.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ102 0aQ5021 aQuilo, S.A.10aEffects of potassium lactate, sodium metasilicate, peroxyacetic acid, and acidified sodium chlorite on physical, chemical, and sensory properties of ground beef patties  ap. 44-52.  aIncludes references  aBeef trimmings were treated with 3% potassium lactate (KL), 4% sodium metasilicate (NMS), 0.02% peroxyacetic acid (PAA) or 0.1% acidified sodium chlorite (ASC) or left untreated (CON).

The NMS and PAA patties were redder (a[low asterisk] , P <0.05) than CON on days 0-3. Panelists found KL, NMS, PAA, and ASC patties to have less (P <0.05) or similar (P >0.05) off odor to CON on days 0-3. The NMS and PAA treated patties had lower (P <0.05) lipid oxidation than the CON at days 0, 3, and 7.

Two sample preparation methods were compared: a direct measurement of the tomato paste and an extraction method using hexane to isolate carotenoids. HPLC was used as the reference method. Cross-validated (leave-one-out) partial least-squares regression (PLSR) was used to create calibration models to predict these phytonutrient concentrations in blind test samples. The infrared spectra showed unique marker bands at 957 and 968 cm-1 for lycopene and β-carotene, respectively. Multivariate analysis of the infrared spectral data gave correlation coefficients (r values) of >0.9 between the ATR-IR predicted and HPLC reference values, and standard errors of cross-validation (SECV) of 0.5 and 0.04 mg/100 g of juice for lycopene and β-carotene, respectively. ATR-IR could provide the tomato industry with a simple, rapid, and high-throughput technique for the determination of tomato quality. 3atomato juice 3afood composition 3anutrient content 3alycopene 3abeta-carotene 3afood analysis 3ainfrared spectroscopy 3arapid methods 0aattenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy1 aShiroma-Kian, Cecilia1 aHalim, Yuwana1 aFrancis, David1 aRodriguez-Saona, Luis E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2009 Feb. 25, v. 57, no. 4 p.1105-1112dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf802920z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aINDdRHFe2009/03/27  aOther US 7aarticle02298naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137100001200146245009100158300001800249500002400267520106000291650001101351650003101362650002701393650001801420653002201438653002201460653002601482700001101508700001301519700001201532700001101544700001301555773016301568852000901731856007701740930003301817945002501850946001301875655001201888IND4401747320221121064238.0080221e20070711xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440174732DNAL7 a10.1021/jf063363c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5051 aZhu, D.10aStudy of Wavelet Denoising in Apple's Charge-Coupled Device Near-Infrared Spectroscopy  ap. 5423-5428.  aIncludes references  aDiscrete wavelet transform was used to eliminate the noise in the charge-coupled device near-infrared (CCD-NIR) spectra of apple. The influence of three parameters (wavelet function, decomposition level, and threshold) on the predictive ability of the calibration model was investigated. The result showed that the db, sym, and bior wavelet families performed well, while the coif, dmey, and haar wavelets were not able to denoise effectively. The best decomposition level was 2. The threshold selection rules of the default, Birge-Massart, and Penalty had good denoising results, while SURE, Sqtwolog, Heuristic SURE, and Minimax set all detailed coefficients to zero due to their high threshold values. The best denoising result was obtained with the combination of the bior3.3 wavelet function, two levels of decomposition, default threshold selection rule, and the soft thresholding method. The optimal model of soluble solids content was constructed. The relative standard deviation of prediction decreased from 7.79 to 5.82% after wavelet denoising. 3aapples 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3anondestructive methods 3afruit quality 0awavelet transform 0awavelet denoising 0acharge coupled device1 aJi, B.1 aMeng, C.1 aShi, B.1 aTu, Z.1 aQing, Z.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2007 July 11, v. 55, no. 14 p.5423-5428dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf063363c3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080325b20080404c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/03/25  aOther US 7aarticle03337naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156072000900165100002300174245006900197300001800266500002400284500001500308520126000323650001301583650001401596650001401610650001301624650003101637650001901668650001301687650002101700650001401721650001401735650003001749650003701779650002801816650002801844650001401872650004701886650001301933650002301946650001501969650001101984650002101995650002002016650002002036650005702056650002102113650002402134653002502158653001202183700002702195700002402222700001902246700002802265700002702293773016202320852000902482856007702491930003302568945002502601946001302626655001202639IND4401752020221121064144.0080222e20080227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175202DNAL7 a182110152pmid7 a10.1021/jf072911z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aSilva-Sánchez, C.10aBioactive Peptides in Amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) Seed  ap. 1233-1240.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAmaranth seeds are rich in protein with a high nutritional value, but little is known about their bioactive compounds that could benefit health. The objectives of this research were to investigate the presence, characterization, and the anticarcinogenic properties of the peptide lunasin in amaranth seeds. Furthermore, to predict and identify other peptides in amaranth seed with potential biological activities. ELISA showed an average concentration of 11.1 μg lunasin equivalent/g total extracted protein in four genotypes of mature amaranth seeds. Glutelin fraction had the highest lunasin concentration (3.0 μg/g). Lunasin was also identified in albumin, prolamin and globulin amaranth protein fractions and even in popped amaranth seeds. Western blot analysis revealed a band at 18.5 kDa, and MALDI-TOF analysis showed that this peptide matched more than 60% of the soybean lunasin peptide sequence. Glutelin extracts digested with trypsin, showed the induction of apoptosis against HeLa cells. Prediction of other bioactive peptides in amaranth globulins and glutelins were mainly antihypertensive. This is the first study that reports the presence of a lunasin-like peptide and other potentially bioactive peptides in amaranth protein fractions. 3aalbumins 3aglutelins 3aprolamins 3apeptides 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3aamaranth grain 3agenotype 3afood composition 3aglobulins 3aapoptosis 3aanticarcinogenic activity 2aAmaranthusxchemistryxgenetics. 2aAnticarcinogenic Agents 2aAntihypertensive Agents 2aApoptosis 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assayxmethods 2aGenotype 2aGlutensxchemistry 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aMolecular Weight 2aNutritive Value 2aPeptide Mapping 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxisolation & purification. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 0abioactive properties 0alunasin1 aBarba de la Rosa, A.P.1 aLeón-Galván, M.F.1 aDe Lumen, B.O.1 aLeón-Rodríguez, A. de1 aGonzalez de Mejía, E.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Feb. 27, v. 56, no. 4 p.1233-1240dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf072911z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle04110naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100002100207245012500228300001600353500002400369500001500393520203700408650001802445650001302463650001702476650003302493650001402526650000802540650001402548650001702562650002302579650002102602650002602623650002302649650002402672650001902696650002802715650001402743650001102757650001102768650002502779650001202804650002502816650001902841650005202860650002902912650004602941650002402987650001203011650002203023651001003045653001103055700002803066700001903094700001803113773008403131852000903215856008303224930003303307945002503340946001103365655001203376IND4417133520221121064220.0090302e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441713352DNAL7 a192039582pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpn0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aK001 0aP210 0aF500 0aX1001 aNortes, Pedro A.10aSeasonal effects of deficit irrigation on leaf photosynthetic traits of fruiting and non-fruiting shoots in almond trees  ap. 375-388.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aWe investigated seasonal trends in, and relationships between, leaf structural properties, leaf nitrogen concentration, and maximum (A(m)) and potential (A(p)) leaf net CO2 assimilation of 1-year-old fruiting (f) and current-year non-fruiting (nf) shoots in 5-year-old almond trees (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb cv Marta). These trees had been subjected in the previous 4 years to either full irrigation (FI regime) or sustained deficit irrigation (DI) at 50% of standard crop evapotranspiration during the entire growing season (DI regime) in the semiarid climate of southeast Spain. Measurements were made during an entire growing season on sun-exposed leaves. Leaf dry mass per unit area (W(a)), area and dry-mass-based leaf N concentrations (N(a) and N(w), respectively), and area and dry-mass-based A(m) (A(ma) and A(mw), respectively) were lower in f-leaves than in nf-leaves. Changes in leaf structural attributes induced by DI were more pronounced in nf-leaves than in f-leaves, the latter being little affected. Over the entire growth season, A(m) and A(p) were correlated negatively with W(a) and positively with N(w) for both the leaf classes and the irrigation regimes. When calculated with respect to total leaf N concentration, maximum photosynthetic nitrogen-use efficiency (PNUE(m)) was significantly higher in f-leaves than in nf-leaves, with no significant differences between the leaf classes among the irrigation regimes. However, when PNUE(m) was calculated with respect to photosynthetic N, no significant effect of leaf class or irrigation regime was observed. Overall, our results showed that DI and FI trees exhibited similar seasonal patterns of leaf structural properties and maximum and potential leaf net CO2 assimilation rates, but there were distinct N-allocation patterns between f- and nf-leaves. In the DI treatment, leaf structural adjustments appeared to operate to maintain a high N status in the leaves of fruit-bearing shoots, to the detriment of N resources allocated to vegetative shoots. 3aPrunus dulcis 3anitrogen 3agas exchange 3adry environmental conditions 3aphenology 3aage 3aleaf area 3awater stress 3adeficit irrigation 3aclimatic factors 3aMediterranean climate 3aseasonal variation 3aregression analysis 3aphotosynthesis 3anutrient use efficiency 3anut trees 3aleaves 3ashoots 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aClimate 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhotosynthesis 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxmetabolism 2aPrunusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRegression Analysis 2aSeasons 2aWaterxmetabolism 3aSpain 0atraits1 aGonzalez-Real, Maria M.1 aEgea, Gregorio1 aBaille, Alain0 tTree physiology.g2009 Mar., v. 29, no. 3 p.375-388dHeron Pubx0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpn0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02378naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100002100198245010500219300001600324500002400340500001500364520060700379650001500986650001901001650001101020650001001031650001801041650001401059650002001073650001701093650001801110650001201128650001101140650002401151650001901175650004101194650003801235650003101273653002301304653001901327653001601346653001601362653002501378700001901403700001701422700001801439700001901457700001901476773008401495852000901579856008301588930003301671945002501704946001101729655001201740IND4417132620221121064323.0090302e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441713262DNAL7 a192039422pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpn0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aX600 0aX620 0aX1001 aJupp, David L.B.10aEstimating forest LAI profiles and structural parameters using a ground-based laser called 'Echidna'  ap. 171-181.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThere are many techniques for measuring leaf area index (LAI) and forest canopy foliage profiles but their accuracy is questionable.

Here, we demonstrate that the Arabidopsis trithorax-like factor ATX1, which trimethylates histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), is involved in dehydration stress signaling in both abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent and ABA-independent pathways. The loss of function of ATX1 results in decreased germination rates, larger stomatal apertures, more rapid transpiration and decreased tolerance to dehydration stress in atx1 plants. This deficiency is caused in part by reduced ABA biosynthesis in atx1 plants resulting from decreased transcript levels from NCED3, which encodes a key enzyme controlling ABA production. Dehydration stress increased ATX1 binding to NCED3, and ATX1 was required for the increased levels of NCED3 transcripts and nucleosomal H3K4me3 that occurred during dehydration stress. Mechanistically, ATX1 affected the quantity of RNA polymerase II bound to NCED3. By upregulating NCED3 transcription and ABA production, ATX1 influenced ABA-regulated pathways and genes. ATX1 also affected the expression of ABA-independent genes, implicating ATX1 in diverse dehydration stress-response mechanisms in Arabidopsis. 3aArabidopsis 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3achromatin 3agenes 3agermination 3ahistones 3alysine 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3atranspiration 2aAbscisic Acidxbiosynthesis. 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aDNA Methylation 2aDehydration 2aDioxygenasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aHistonesxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Stomataxgrowth & development 2aPlant Transpiration 2aRNA Polymerase IIxmetabolism 2aSeedlingsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSignal Transduction 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransgenes1 aAvramova, Zoya1 aFromm, Michael0 tplant journal.g2011 June, v. 66, no. 5 p.735-744dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2011.04534.x 7aarticle03931naa a2200697 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189072000900198100001900207245010100226300001600327500002400343500001500367520186300382650002702245650002802272650002002300650001902320650002502339650001602364650001002380650001402390650002102404650001602425650001902441650001702460650001302477650002102490650001002511650001102521650002502532650002602557650002502583650002702608650004502635650005602680650002902736650005102765650002902816650002602845650000902871650003202880653002402912653002002936700002002956773008402976852000903060856008303069930003303152945002503185946001103210655001203221IND4417132320221121064203.0090302e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441713232DNAL7 a192039452pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpn0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF500 0aF600 0aJ500 0aJ200 0aK0011 aZhang, Junling10aRoot proliferation of Norway spruce and Scots pine in response to local magnesium supply in soil  ap. 199-206.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNutrient sources in soils are often heterogeneously distributed. Although many studies have examined the root responses to local N and P enrichments in the soil, less research was conducted on root responses to Mg patches. New roots of pre-grown Mg-insufficient and Mg-sufficient plants of Norway spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) seedlings were allowed to grow into four other pots of equal size, which were placed under the tree-bearing pot. Soils in the lower pots were either unfertilised, or supplied with Mg, or NPK or a mixture of NPKMg sources. Plants were harvested after 9 months of growth. Compared to the corresponding controls (Mg versus unfertilised and NPKMg versus NPK), Mg additions did not have a significant effect on either root dry matter, total root length (TRL) or specific root length (SRL), irrespective of tree species and plant Mg nutritional status. In contrast, NPK and NPKMg additions significantly increased the root dry matter and TRL in the nutrient-rich soil patch, and decreased SRL in Norway spruce. However, the observed root morphological changes did not occur in Scots pine. Root Mg concentrations were increased in Mg-rich soil patches, but those accumulations varied with tree species. Mg accumulation in a marked patch was measured only in newly grown roots of Mg-sufficient Norway spruce, whereas a more homogenous distribution of Mg concentration was observed for all newly grown roots in Mg-insufficient trees in the four soil treatments. In Scots pine, Mg accumulations occurred in both Mg-insufficient and Mg-sufficient plants. These results suggest that Mg patches in the soil may not lead to a local increase in root growth, but to Mg uptake and root Mg accumulation. Tree roots react differently to Mg patches in comparison to their response to N or P patches in the soil. 3achemical concentration 3ainterspecific variation 3aplant nutrition 3asoil nutrients 3aspatial distribution 3aPicea abies 3atrees 3amagnesium 3aPinus sylvestris 3aroot growth 3aplant response 3aforest soils 3aconifers 3aplant morphology 3aroots 3ashoots 2aBiological Transport 2aMagnesiumxmetabolism 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPiceaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPinus sylvestrisxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxphysiology 2aPotassiumxmetabolism 2aSoil 2aTreesxgrowth & development 0aspecies differences 0aroot plasticity1 aGeorge, Eckhard0 tTree physiology.g2009 Feb., v. 29, no. 2 p.199-206dHeron Pubx0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpn0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03030naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138072000900156100001100165245014600176300001800322500002400340500001500364520110000379650002401479650002701503650002201530650000901552650001801561650001701579650001601596650002601612650003401638650005001672650002501722650003401747650003101781650003501812650003201847651001001879653001701889653001201906653002301918653002901941653004301970700001102013700001302024700001502037700001402052700001502066700001602081773016202097852000902259856007702268930003302345945002502378946001302403655001202416IND4401751120221121064118.0080222e20080227xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440175112DNAL7 a181988312pmid7 a10.1021/jf073020u2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aLi, P.10aOptimizing Ultraperformance Liquid Chromatographic Analysis of 10 Diterpenoid Compounds in Salvia miltiorrhiza Using Central Composite Design  ap. 1164-1171.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA rapid, sensitive, reproducible, and accurate ultraperformance liquid chromatographic (UPLC) method was developed for the simultaneous determination of 10 diterpenoid compounds (tanshinone I, tanshinone IIA, cryptotanshinone, dihydrotanshinone I, 1,2-dihydrotanshinquinone, methylenetanshinquinone, miltirone, 5,6-dehydrosugiol, sugiol, and przewalskin) in Salvia miltiorrhiza for the first time. Central composite design was applied as a powerful tool to optimize the most dominant parameters that influence the resolution of UPLC, that is, gradient, flow rate, and column temperature. Under optimum conditions, all peaks except 1,2-dihydrotanshinquinone and methylenetanshinquinone could be baseline separated within 8 min. Furthermore, the contents of these compounds in S. miltiorrhiza samples collected from different provinces of China have also been compared. The results showed that UPLC is one of the most efficient methods for the analysis of diterpenoid compounds in S. miltiorrhiza and that it is a potential method for quality control of this valuable traditional Chinese medicine. 3aSalvia miltiorrhiza 3ageographical variation 3achemical analysis 3aflow 3arapid methods 3aditerpenoids 3atemperature 3aliquid chromatography 3aOriental traditional medicine 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquidxmethods 2aDiterpenesxanalysis 2aMedicine, Chinese Traditional 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSalvia miltiorrhizaxchemistry 2aSensitivity and Specificity 3aChina 0aoptimization 0adanshen 0agradient condition 0acentral composite design 0aultraperformance liquid chromatography1 aXu, G.1 aLi, S.P.1 aWang, Y.T.1 aFan, T.P.1 aZhao, Q.S.1 aZhang, Q.W.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2008 Feb. 27, v. 56, no. 4 p.1164-1171dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf073020u3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090311b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/02/16  aOther US 7aarticle02493naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245014100146300001500287520121700302650001501519650001501534650002201549650001201571650002301583650002001606650003101626650002101657650002901678650004501707650001901752650002101771700001701792700001701809700001701826700001601843773014601859852000902005930003302014945001302047946001102060655001202071IND2197095820221121053504.0990218e19980611ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219709582DNAL7 a96305372pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoshikawa, K.10a1H NMR study of dynamics and thermodynamics of acid-alkaline transition in ferric hemoglobin of a midge larva (Tokunagayusurika akamusi)  ap. 89-100.  aOne of the components of hemoglobin from the larval hemolyph of Tokunagayusurika akamusi possesses naturally occurring substitution at the E7 helical position (Leu E7) [M. Fukuda, T. Takagi, K. Shikama, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1157 (1993) 185-191]. Its oxygen affinity is almost comparable to those of mammalian myoglobins and it exhibits Bohr effect. Both acidic and alkaline forms of the ferric hemoglobin have been investigated using 1H NMR in order to gain insight into molecular mechanisms for relatively high oxygen affinity and Bohr effect of this protein. The NMR data indicated that the acidic form of the protein possesses pentacoordinated heme, and that the alkaline form possessing OH- appears with increasing the pH value. pH titration yielded a pK value of 7.2 for the acid-alkaline transition, and this value is the lowest among the values reported so far for various myoglobins and hemoglobins. The kinetic measurements of the transition revealed that the activation energy for the dissociation of the Fe-bound OH-, as well as the dissociation and association rates, decrease with increasing the pH value. These pH dependence properties are likely to be related to the Bohr effect of this protein. 3aentomology 3aarthropods 3aanimal physiology 2aAnimals 2aDipteraxchemistry 2aHemexchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLarvaxchemistry 2aMethemoglobinxchemistry 2aNuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular 2aThermodynamics 2aWaterxchemistry1 aYamamoto, Y.1 aKamimura, S.1 aMatsuoka, A.1 aShikama, K.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1998 June 11, v. 1385, no. 1 p.89-100x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19990405b19990413c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03809naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157100002000166245009800186300001600284500002400300500001500324520215600339650003702495650002202532650001502554650002002569650002702589650001802616650002202634650002002656650003402676650001902710650002102729650001202750650002602762650002402788650002202812651001802834653002802852653002202880653001902902653002202921653002102943700002202964773010302986852000903089856008803098930003303186945002503219946001103244655001203255IND4416919320221121022649.0090228e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441691932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2008.10.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK200 0aX1001 aJoshi, Sudiksha10aDeterminants of private forest management decisions: A study on West Virginia NIPF landowners  ap. 118-125.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe availability of timber in the United States depends largely on forest management and investment decisions of nonindustrial private forest landowners since they hold the largest share of forest land in the nation. Since NIPF landowners are so diverse, there is a need to better understand the determinants of their decisions so that policies could be in place to motivate them. A survey was carried out in 2005 to the nonindustrial private forest landowners of West Virginia to examine the factors affecting their forest management decisions. The study looked at four categories of decisions related to forest management: timber harvest, silvicultural activities (i.e., tree planting, herbicide application, fertilization, thinning, grapevine control, and timber stand improvement), property management activities (i.e., road construction, road maintenance, surveying/boundary maintenance, and access control), and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities. Four models were developed to examine factors affecting each category of forest management activity. The results showed that landowner, ownership, and management characteristics of NIPF landowners are associated with their forest management decisions. Specifically, age, education, profession, income, ownership size, period of forestland acquisition, distance of the forestland to the place of residence, whether the forestland was purchased or acquired through inheritance or as a gift, primary objective of forestland ownership, and presence of a written forest management plan were found to be significant determinants for at least one of the categories of forest management activities. The models explained 25%, 27%, 31%, and 24% of the variation in timber harvesting, silvicultural activities, property management activities, and wildlife habitat management and recreation improvement activities, respectively. Understanding the underlying factors influencing forest management decisions of this diverse group of forest landowners could form the basis for developing, modifying and targeting policy instruments to motivate NIPF landowners in forest management. 3asociodemographic characteristics 3aforest recreation 3alandowners 3adecision making 3afertilizer application 3aforest stands 3awildlife habitats 3aforest thinning 3anonindustrial private forests 3aforest surveys 3aforest ownership 3alogging 3apesticide application 3ainvestment planning 3atimber production 3aWest Virginia 0asilvicultural practices 0atimber management 0aland ownership 0aforest management 0aprivate forestry1 aArano, Kathryn G.0 tForest policy and economics.g2009 Mar., v. 11, no. 2 p.118-125dElsevier Sciencex1389-93417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2008.10.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20110721b20110805c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/03/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02385naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158100002200167245015000189300001600339500002400355500001500379520091500394650003001309650001701339650003001356650001601386650001701402650001201419650001901431650002101450650001601471650002001487653001701507700002401524700002301548700002201571700001901593700002201612773010201634852000901736856008901745930003301834945002501867946001101892655001201903IND4416918620221121022747.0090228e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441691862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.idairyj.2008.12.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ201 0aQ1211 aAnastasiou, Rania10aInhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 under conditions mimicking Kasseri cheese production and ripening  ap. 330-335.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree fermentations in skim milk were used to study the effectiveness of the bacteriocin-producing Streptococcus macedonicus ACA-DC 198 strain to inhibit Clostridium tyrobutyricum LMG 1285T spore outgrowth under conditions prevailing during Kasseri cheese production and ripening.

The resulting lyso-PLs are more hydrophilic and therefore show improved emulsifying activity in o/w-emulsions. However, so far no systematic study deals with the changes of egg yolk's functionality due to enzymatic treatment. Little is known about the emulsion properties particularly in different environmental conditions. Egg yolk's functional behaviour is highly dependent on pH and salt concentration used. Therefore, this study investigated four different environmental conditions. At pH 4 the pH of commercial dressings is simulated and pH 6.5 represents the pH of untreated egg yolk in its natural form. Two salt concentrations are used, where granules are in their native and their disrupted form, i.e. 0.15 and 0.52M NaCl, respectively. Results suggest that significant differences in the emulsifying properties of untreated and modified egg yolk not primarily derive from the existence of lyso-phospholipids but from structural changes in egg yolk granules and LDL micelles. 3aemulsions 3aegg yolk 3agranules 3aenzymatic treatment 3aphospholipase A2 3aemulsifying properties 3aphospholipids 3apH 3asodium chloride 3achemical concentration 0alyso-phospholipids 0aoil-in-water emulsions1 aKulozik, Ulrich0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 July, v. 23, no. 5 p.1366-1373dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.10.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/04/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02667naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002000158245010200178300001800280500002400298500001500322520132700337650002701664650001101691650001001702650001601712650001901728650003101747650001401778650001301792650001101805650002401816650001901840653002701859653001801886700002101904700002101925773009601946852000902042856008902051930003302140945002502173946001102198655001202209IND4416899320221120231640.0090228e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441689932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.09.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ5001 aSarkar, Anwesha10aColloidal stability and interactions of milk-protein-stabilized emulsions in an artificial saliva  ap. 1270-1278.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOil-in-water emulsions (20 wt% soy oil) with lactoferrin or @b-lactoglobulin (@b-lg) as the interfacial layer were prepared using a two-stage valve homogenizer. At pH 6.8, lactoferrin produces a stable cationic emulsion whereas @b-lg forms an anionic emulsion. These emulsions were mixed with an artificial saliva that contained a range of mucin concentrations and salts. Negatively charged mucin was shown to interact readily with the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets to provide a mucin coverage of approximately 1mg/m^2. As expected, the negatively charged @b-lg-stabilized emulsion droplets had lower mucin coverage (0.6mg/m^2 surface load) under the same conditions. The @b-lg-stabilized emulsions were stable but showed depletion flocculation at higher mucin levels (>=1.0 wt%). In contrast, lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets showed considerable aggregation in the presence of salts but in the absence of mucin. This salt-induced aggregation was reduced in the presence of mucin, possibly because of its binding to the positively charged lactoferrin-stabilized emulsion droplets and thus a reduction in the positive charge at the lactoferrin-coated droplet surface. However, at higher mucin concentration (>=2.0 wt%), lactoferrin-stabilized emulsions also showed droplet aggregation. 3achemical concentration 3amucins 3asalts 3alactoferrin 3alactoglobulins 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aemulsions 3adroplets 3asaliva 3aoil-water interface 3ahomogenization 0adepletion flocculation 0aglycoproteins1 aGoh, Kelvin K.T.1 aSingh, Harjinder0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2009 July, v. 23, no. 5 p.1270-1278dElsevier Sciencex0268-005X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.09.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd7CTe2009/04/01  aNon-US 7aarticle02877naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001900177245008800196300001800284500002400302520128400326650000801610650001201618650002101630650002101651650001401672650001301686650002201699650001801721650002101739650002101760650001701781650001901798650001601817650001701833650002301850653001601873653001601889700001601905700001701921700002001938700001701958700001801975700002501993700001702018773009602035852000902131856009002140930003302230945002502263946001102288655001202299IND4416902420221120220916.0090228e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441690242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aT300 0aX3801 aWay, Tzong-Der10aBeneficial effects of different tea flowers against human breast cancer MCF-7 cells  ap. 1231-1236.  aIncludes references  aTea is a popular beverage with health benefits. The enriched tea polyphenols including catechins have been reported to perform anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial activity. In this study, we compared the levels of catechins and caffeine in tea flowers from six different species of Camellia japonica, Camellia tenuifolia, Camellia oleifera, 2 savoury Camellias and Camellia sinensis. C. sinensis detected a variety of catechins, while only (+)-catechin and (-)-epicatechin can be detected by the isocratic HPLC system in other tea flowers. The total catechin content was also lower in these tea flowers. In addition, the water extract of tea flowers was used to test the biological functions including anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The water extract of C. sinensis remained most active among six different species using both MTT assays and the cleavage analysis of apoptosis-related molecules, PARP and Bid. The major bioactivity of C. sinensis comes from (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate and (-)-epigallocatechin, not detected in other five species. Interestingly, we found that C. tenuifolia still had potent bioactivity. It is likely that bioactive molecules other than catechins exist in C. tenuifolia. 3atea 3aflowers 3ahuman cell lines 3abreast neoplasms 3aflavanols 3acaffeine 3aCamellia sinensis 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3aepigallocatechin 3acell culture 3aflow cytometry 3apolyphenols 3acytotoxicity 3acell proliferation 0atea flowers 0aMCF-7 cells1 aLin, Hui-Yi1 aHua, Kuo-Tai1 aLee, Jang-Chang1 aLi, Wen-Hsin1 aLee, Maw-Rong1 aShuang, Chung-Hsiang1 aLin, Jen-Kun0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 15, v. 114, no. 4 p.1231-1236dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.10.0843Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02665naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004100092040001800133072000900151072000900160072000900169072000900178100001900187245009200206300001600298500002400314520125200338650002001590650002201610650002701632650001801659650001701677650001401694650002701708650001401735650001101749650002801760650001201788650002001800650001001820700002301830700001901853700001801872773011201890852000902002856009102011930003302102945002502135946001102160655001202171IND4402010920221120221001.0080227e20080225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440201092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.10.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aF600 0aJ200 0aK0011 aShigihara, Ado10aGrowth and physiological responses of beech seedlings to long-term exposure of acid fog  ap. 124-131.  aIncludes references  aSeven-year-old beech seedlings (Fagus crenata) were exposed to simulated acid fog (SAF) at pH 3 or pH 5 (as control) prepared by adding a 2:1:1 mixture (molar ratio) of nitric acid, ammonium sulfate, and sodium chloride to ultrapure water from September 2004 to July 2006 in a mobile fog chamber. In comparison to control seedlings, seedlings from the pH 3 treatment displayed inferior plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, and dry matter production, but greater leaf area. Furthermore, exposure to SAF induced early falling of leaves with a nearly two-times-greater normalized leaf number index than control. The starch levels in the stems of seedlings of the pH 3 treatment were much lower than those of control at the harvest. The acid fog-induced reduction of the starch accumulation is considered to occur mainly because of fewer leaves during the growth phase. Results of laboratory experiments demonstrate that the amount of base cations leached from the beech leaves increased with decreasing pH of SAF; the leaching amount of calcium ion from the beech was high relative to that of conifers such as fir and cedar. These results imply that chronic acid fog exposure suppresses growth and physiological activity of beech seedlings. 3aacid deposition 3afog (meteorology) 3aenvironmental exposure 3aFagus crenata 3aforest trees 3aseedlings 3aphysiological response 3aleaf area 3astarch 3adry matter accumulation 3asoil pH 3aseedling growth 3astems1 aMatsumoto, Kiyoshi1 aSakurai, Naoki1 aIgawa, Manabu0 tScience of the total environment.g2008 Feb. 25, v. 391, no. 1 p.124-131dElsevier Sciencex0048-96977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2007.10.0533Available from publisher's Web site  a20090526b20090608c00000000  aINDdGAYe2009/05/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02356naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149100002500158245006800183300001800251500002400269520112200293650001401415650001801429650002301447650002101470650002401491650003101515650001401546650001801560650001701578650001501595650001701610700002401627700002001651773009601671852000901767856008901776930003301865945002501898946001101923655001201934IND4416901120221120221026.0090228e200907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441690112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2008.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ1061 aKosaraju, Shantha L.10aIn-vitro evaluation of hydrocolloid-based encapsulated fish oil  ap. 1413-1419.  aIncludes references  aThe release behaviour of hydrocolloid-based encapsulated fish oil was carried out to understand its applicability as a controlled release delivery system. A casein-based Maillard reaction product (MRP), [caseinate-glucose-dried glucose syrup, MRP] and its corresponding non-MRP-based encapsulant materials were used to form stable emulsions with fish oil. The emulsion particle size distribution was found to be uniform with 90% of the particles below 1.3@mm. These oil/water emulsions were spray dried to obtain free-flowing fish oil microcapsules. All casein-based microcapsules had a free fat content of 97%. A sequential in-vitro release protocol and a method for evaluation of the released oil in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (SGF/SIF) were developed and tested in this study. A comparative analysis of release behaviour between caseinate and whey protein-based MRP and non-MRP-based encapsulant materials was also obtained. The amount of released oil after subjecting to the sequential in-vitro protocol was found to be <2% and 36% for caseinate and whey protein-based MRP microcapsules respectively. 3afish oils 3ahydrocolloids 3amicroencapsulation 3ain vitro studies 3aapplication methods 3aMaillard reaction products 3aemulsions 3aparticle size 3aspray drying 3acaseinates 3awhey protein1 aWeerakkody, Rangika1 aAugustin, M.

The ζ-potential, droplet size, creaming stability, free fatty acids and glucosamine released was measured for the emulsions when they were subjected to an in vitro digestion model. The ζ-potential of the oil droplets in lecithin-chitosan stabilized emulsions changed from positive ([almost equal to]+53mV) to negative and the emulsions were unstable to droplet aggregation for all chitosan concentrations and molecular weights used after being subjected to the digestion model. The amount of free fatty acid and glucosamine released per unit amount of emulsion was higher when pancreatic lipase was included in the digestion model. These results suggest that lecithin-chitosan coated droplets can be degraded by lipase under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. Consequently, chitosan coated lipid droplets may serve as useful carriers for the delivery of bioactive lipophilic nutraceuticals. 3atuna oil 3ain vitro digestion 3afood analysis 3achitosan 3aphosphatidylcholines 3adroplet size 3atuna 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3aencapsulation 3afood composition 3aemulsions 3adigestibility 3aoil-water interface 0afish emulsions 0afish products1 aMcClements, David Julian0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 15, v. 114, no. 4 p.1308-1315dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.11.0123Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02541naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100002400177245013700201300001800338500002400356520104400380650002301424650001801447650002101465650001801486650001701504650001501521650001401536650002101550650002301571650002301594650003001617650001701647650002301664653003501687700002001722700002301742700001801765773009601783852000901879856009001888930003301978945002502011946001102036655001202047IND4416903320221120194709.0090228e20090615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441690332DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.11.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aQ506 0aQ1161 aGuillén, María D.10aHeadspace composition of cod liver oil and its evolution in storage after opening.

Nearly one hundred compounds were found, some of them identified for the first time as cod liver oil components. In both samples, the presence of the toxic 4-hydroxy-(E)-2-hexenal and of 4-oxo-(E)-2-hexenal was detected, as well as that 4,5-epoxy-2-heptenal in one of the samples; this is the first time that these toxic compounds have been described as being present in cod liver oil. In the early oxidation stages, taking place during storage, the compounds formed are mainly of low molecular weight; some of these could be adopted as oxidation markers of cod liver oil. The possibilities of using the technique to evaluate the oxidation level of cod liver oil are shown. These results suggest the need to monitor the levels of toxic oxygenated α,β-unsaturated aldehydes in cod liver oil in order to ensure its safety. 3aheadspace analysis 3afood analysis 3afood composition 3acod liver oil 3afood storage 3ashelf life 3aaldehydes 3atoxic substances 3afood contamination 3alipid peroxidation 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3aheavy metals 3avolatile compounds 0apolybrominated diphenyl ethers1 aCarton, Izaskun1 aSalmerón, Jesús.1 aCasas, Carmen0 tFood chemistry.g2009 June 15, v. 114, no. 4 p.1291-1300dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.11.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090423b20090508c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/03/30  aNon-US 7aarticle02327naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100001400164245006500178300001800243500002400261520106000285650001101345650001001356650001601366650001001382650001601392650002101408650002301429650001201452650001901464650001501483700001901498700002001517700001501537700001701552773014501569852000901714856007701723930003301800945002501833946001101858655001201869IND4401969920221120185249.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440196992DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28692doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF110 0aQ5051 aChang, X.10aFlavour and aroma of fresh basil are affected by temperature  ap. 1381-1385.  aIncludes references  aSweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) plants at the three-leaf-pair growth stage were grown in controlled environment rooms at 15 and 25 °C for 2 weeks.

The total volatile oil content in fresh leaves was enhanced by 70%. Temperature also affected the composition of volatile oils. At 25 °C there was an accumulation of eugenol, which contributes to the characteristic taste of basil. Although there was no effect on the relative contents of linalool and 1,8-cineole, the absolute contents in fresh leaves were significantly different. Sensory analysis showed that 18 out of 21 trained sensory panellists perceived different intensities of volatile oils in fresh basil leaves from the two sources of plants.

Twelve commercial Albariño wines from Galicia, Spain, were analysed. The content of varietals and fermentative volatile compounds was determined by gas chromatography. The numerous significant differences found for most of the aromatic compounds studied show the influence of the terroir. The Albariño wines from northern Galicia showed the highest total concentration of volatiles analysed. The volatile components showing the greatest differences in Albariño wines from different areas were terpenes and higher alcohols. Among the terpenes found, geraniol was markedly abundant in the north, while nerol and linalool were most abundant in the south. Among the alcohols, 2-phenyl ethanol and benzyl alcohol showed the highest concentrations in the south and in the north, respectively. Cluster analysis and principal component analysis revealed two clearly defined main groups of Albariño wines from different terroirs. Albariño wines from the south were more heterogenic than those of the north. 3avolatile compounds 3afood analysis 3aaromatic compounds 3awine quality 3ageographical variation 3afood composition 3aVitis vinifera 3awine cultivars 3alinalool 3awhite wines 3aSpain 0aterpenoids 0anerol 0aterroir1 aZamuz, S.1 aVilarino, F.1 aSieiro, C.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 May, v. 87, no. 7 p.1252-1256dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28333Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02464naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001500155245010900170300001800279500002400297520107900321650003201400650000901432650002101441650001201462650002301474650001801497650001801515650001801533650002501551650001801576650001201594650001401606650002001620650001801640650002101658700001501679773014501694852000901839856007701848930003301925945002501958946001101983655001201994IND4401966020221120185238.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440196602DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ101 0aQ5011 aHaider, T.10aPreparation of lactose-free milk by using salt-fractionated almond (Amygdalus communis) β-galactosidase  ap. 1278-1283.  aIncludes references  aβ-galactosidase was isolated from almond (Amygdalus communis) extract by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Almond proteins precipitated by using ammonium sulfate and then dialysed exhibited 5.3-fold purification of β-galactosidase, and the yield of enzyme preparation was 96.5%. The partially purified β-galactosidase exhibited pH and temperature optima at pH 5.5 and 50 °C, respectively. The enzyme was significantly stable against heat, pH, calcium and magnesium ions and D-galactose. The almond β-galactosidase preparation exhibited over 89% activity even after 2 months storage at 4 °C. Hydrolysis of lactose in milk and whey was performed in a stirred batch process by using this enzyme preparation. These observations indicated that the hydrolysis of lactose increased continuously with time. The enzyme could hydrolyse 94% of lactose in buffer solution and whey whereas 90% of lactose hydrolysis was achieved in milk. The main aim of the present study was to prepare lactose-free milk, which must be free from contamination, and the process should be inexpensive. 3alactose-free dairy products 3amilk 3aammonium sulfate 3aalmonds 3abeta-galactosidase 3aseed extracts 3afractionation 3aPrunus dulcis 3aenzymatic hydrolysis 3abatch systems 3acalcium 3amagnesium 3aprotein content 3amilk analysis 3amilk composition1 aHusain, Q.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 May, v. 87, no. 7 p.1278-1283dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28403Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02556naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146100001700155245015100172300001800323500002400341520117300365650002201538650002701560650001401587650002201601650001401623650001401637650001401651650001201665650001501677650002001692650002201712650001301734650002101747700001701768700001301785773014501798852000901943856007701952930003302029945002502062946001102087655001202098IND4401968220221120174231.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440196822DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28542doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF110 0aJ5001 aSavoie, J.M.10aHydrogen peroxide concentration measured in cultivation substrates during growth and fruiting of the mushrooms Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus spp  ap. 1337-1344.  aIncludes references  aHydrogen peroxide is suspected of being highly implicated in mushroom nutrition and in substrate bleaching during cultivation. The parameters for measuring H2O2 in compost samples were examined and the methodology was applied to samples from both compost colonized by cultivars and wild isolates of Agaricus bisporus, and wheat straw or coffee pulp colonized by Pleurotus spp. Laccase and peroxidase activities were also measured. H2O2 concentration measured after heating at 80 °C for inactivating laccases and peroxidases was probably both H2O2 pre-existing in the compost and H2O2 generated from quinones and active oxygen species. This potential H2O2 concentration increased during the vegetative growth for all the strains, in agreement with a direct relationship between H2O2 concentration and active biomass of A. bisporus or Pleurotus spp. in their cultivation substrates. Correlations were observed between H2O2 concentration and manganese peroxidase activity in cultivation substrates at the stage of primordia formation. At this stage of development, H2O2 generation via biotic or abiotic mechanisms should be an important physiological trait of mushrooms. 3ahydrogen peroxide 3achemical concentration 3amushrooms 3aAgaricus bisporus 3aPleurotus 3anutrition 3ableaching 3alaccase 3aperoxidase 3aenzyme activity 3aenzyme substrates 3acomposts 3amushroom growing1 aSalmones, D.1 aMata, G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 May, v. 87, no. 7 p.1337-1344dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28543Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02661naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119072000900137072000900146072000900155100002500164245016700189300001800356500002400374520114600398650002801544650002101572650002301593650001201616650001301628650001001641650004201651650001601693650001101709650001201720650001201732650002001744650001201764650001601776650002801792700002601820700002101846773014501867852000902012856007702021930003302098945002502131946001102156655001202167IND4401967520221120174244.0080226e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440196752DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.28512doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ104 0aQ124 0aQ5041 aJimenez-Martinez, C.10aDiminution of quinolizidine alkaloids, oligosaccharides and phenolic compounds from two species of Lupinus and soybean seeds by the effect of Rhizopus oligosporus  ap. 1315-1322.  aIncludes references  aLupinus, like Glycine max (soybean), is an ancient leguminous plant. It has been used as a food by people living around the Mediterranean Sea and in the Andean Highlands. This legume contains quinolizidine alkaloids (Qas), oligosaccharides (OGS) and phenolic compounds (PC). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the growth of Rhizopus oligosporus on the levels of Qas, OGS and PC from L. mutabilis, L. campestris and G. max through tempeh elaboration. The results showed that the soaking and cooking processes of legume seeds diminished the Qas content of L. mutabilis and L. campestris by 50%, and after 48 h of fermentation these compounds decreased by more than 90% in total. OGS diminished by more than 90% in the lupin seeds. The PC content of the three seed species subjected to these processes increased their absorbance value, probably due to the enzymatic action of a fungal tannase. These results suggested that the L. mutabilis, L. campestris and G. max fermentation with R. oligosporus is an efficient method for diminishing antinutritional factors and for obtaining a product with optimal nutritional value. 3aquinolizidine alkaloids 3aoligosaccharides 3aphenolic compounds 3aLupinus 3asoybeans 3aseeds 3aRhizopus microsporus var. oligosporus 3aGlycine max 3atempeh 3asoaking 3acooking 3aenzyme activity 3atannase 3alactic acid 3aantinutritional factors1 aHernandez-Sanchez, H.1 aDavila-Ortiz, G.0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2007 May, v. 87, no. 7 p.1315-1322dPublished for SCI by John Wiley & Sonsx0022-51427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.28513Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02866naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245009400143300001600237520145300253650002001706650002601726650001201752650000901764650005001773650002201823650000901845650003001854650000901884650001701893650002601910650002901936650005001965700001802015700001802033700001502051700001702066700001502083700001702098700001702115700001302132700001502145773014602160852000902306930003302315945001302348946001102361655001202372IND2333294820221120150037.0030702e20011205ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233329482DNAL7 a117507582pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEbara, S.10aCobalamin deficiency results in severe metabolic disorder of serine and threonine in rats  ap. 111-117.  aDietary cobalamin (vitamin B12; Cbl) deficiency caused significant increases in plasma serine, threonine, glycine, alanine, tyrosine, lysine and histidine levels in rats. In particular, the serine and threonine levels were over five and eight times, respectively, higher in the Cbl-deficient rats than those in the sufficient controls. In addition, some amino acids, including serine and threonine, were excreted into urine at significantly higher levels in the deficient rats. When Cbl was supplemented into the deficient rats for 2 weeks, in coincidence with the disappearance of the urinary excretion of methylmalonic acid (an index of Cbl deficiency), the plasma serine and threonine levels were normalized. These results indicate that Cbl deficiency results in metabolic disorder of certain amino acids, including serine and threonine. The expression level of hepatic serine dehydratase (SDH), which catalyzes the conversion of serine and threonine to pyruvate and 2-oxobutyrate, respectively, was significantly lowered by Cbl deficiency, even though Cbl does not participate directly in the enzyme reaction. The SDH activity in the deficient rats was less than 20% of that in the sufficient controls, and was normalized 2 weeks after the Cbl supplementation. It is thus suggested that the decrease of the SDH expression relates closely with the abnormalities in the plasma and urinary levels of serine and threonine in the Cbl-deficient rats. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 2aAnimals 2aDiet 2aL-Serine Dehydratasexdeficiencyxmetabolism. 2aLiverxenzymology 2aMale 2aMethylmalonic Acidxurine 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aSerinexbloodxurine. 2aThreoninexbloodxurine. 2aVitamin B 12xadministration & dosagexblood.1 aToyoshima, S.1 aMatsumura, T.1 aAdachi, S.1 aTakenaka, S.1 aYamaji, R.1 aWatanabe, F.1 aMiyatake, K.1 aInui, H.1 aNakano, Y.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2001 Dec. 5, v. 1568, no. 2 p.111-117x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02925naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245009100144300001600235500001500251520150200266650002201768650006301790650001201853650001401865650002301879650004401902650003101946650002901977650001302006650000902019650003602028650002602064650003002090650001602120650002602136650002602162653002402188700001602212700001502228773014602243852000902389930003302398945001302431946001102444655001202455IND2327952220221120134428.0020709e20020401ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232795222DNAL7 a119834302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGagnon, I.10aKinetic analysis of mouse retinal dehydrogenase type-2 (RALDH2) for retinal substrates  ap. 156-162.  a2019-12-05  aRetinal dehydrogenase (RALDH) isozymes catalyze the terminal oxidation of retinol into retinoic acid (RA) that is essential for embryogenesis and tissue differentiation. To understand the role of mouse type 2 RALDH in synthesizing the ligands (all-trans and 9-cis RA) needed to bind and activate nuclear RA receptors, we determined the detailed kinetic properties of RALDH2 for various retinal substrates. Purified recombinant RALDH2 showed a pH optimum of 9.0 for all-trans retinal oxidation. The activity of the enzyme was lower at 37 degrees C compared to 25 degrees C. The efficiency of conversion of all-trans retinal to RA was 2- and 5-fold higher than 13-cis and 9-cis retinal, respectively. The Km for all-trans and 13-cis retinal were similar (0.66 and 0.62 micromolar, respectively). However, the Km of RALDH2 for 9-cis retinal substrate (2.25 micromolar) was 3-fold higher compared to all-trans and 13-cis retinal substrates. Among several reagents tested for their ability to either inhibit or activate RALDH2, citral and para-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (p-HMB) inhibited and MgCl2 activated the reaction. Comparison of the kinetic properties of RALDH2 for retinal substrates and its activity towards various reagents with those of previously reported rat kidney RALDH1 and human liver aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 showed distinct differences. Since RALDH2 has low Km and high catalytic efficiency for all-trans retinal, it may likely be involved in the production of all-trans RA in vivo. 3aanimal physiology 2aAldehyde Oxidoreductasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aCatalysis 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aIsotretinoinxmetabolism 2aKinetics 2aMice 2aRecombinant Proteinsxchemistry 2aRetinal Dehydrogenase 2aRetinaldehydexmetabolism 2aTemperature 2aTretinoinxmetabolism 2aVitamin Axmetabolism 0aBiological Sciences1 aDuester, G.1 aBhat, P.V.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 Apr. 1, v. 1596, no. 1 p.156-162x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02141naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001300129245010700142300001400249520065400263650002100917650002300938650002400961650006900985650001801054650002301072650004901095650002401144650002801168650006301196650003001259650006401289650002301353650002701376650002501403700001601428700001801444700002101462773014601483852000901629930003301638945001301671946001101684655001201695IND2333622920221120134345.0030715e20020920ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233362292DNAL7 a122258542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrip, H.10aCloning and characterization of an aromatic amino acid and leucine permease of Penicillium chrysogenum  ap. 73-80.  aThe gene encoding the amino acid permease ArlP (Aromatic and leucine Permease) was isolated from the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum after PCR using degenerated oligonucleotides based on conserved regions of fungal amino acid permeases.

Further competition experiments indicate that ArlP recognizes neutral and aromatic amino acids with an unbranched beta-carbon atom. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Transport Systemsxbiosynthesisxchemistryxgenetics. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Complementaryxbiosynthesisxchemistry. 2aLeucinexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPenicillium chrysogenumxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhenylalaninexmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aTryptophanxmetabolism 2aTyrosinexmetabolism1 aEvers, M.E.1 aKonings, W.N.1 aDriessen, A.J.M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 Sept. 20, v. 1565, no. 1 p.73-80x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01834naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245006100142300001600203520075100219650002100970650002300991650003501014650003301049650003001082650003901112650002601151650002601177700002301203700001801226700001601244773014601260852000901406930003301415945001301448946001101461655001201472IND2061048420221120134501.0971230e19971204ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206104842DNAL7 a94081692pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuber, R.14aThe role of the trehalose transporter during germination  ap. 165-171.  aPrevious studies on the resistance of yeast cells to dehydration pointed towards the protective role of trehalose and the importance of the specific trehalose transporter in guaranteeing survival. The present report demonstrates that the trehalose transporter is essential during the germination process in order to translocate trehalose from the cytosol to the external environment. Diploids that lack the trehalose transporter germinate poorly and do not form 4 spore tetrads although they accumulate trehalose and show trehalase activity. Furthermore, addition of exogenous trehalose to the germination medium enhances germination and normal segregation. The ability to transport trehalose is dominant and seems to be related to a single gene. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aBiological Transportxgenetics 2aCarrier Proteinsxmetabolism 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aTrehalasexmetabolism 2aTrehalosexmetabolism1 aEleutherio, E.C.A.1 aPereira, M.D.1 aPanek, A.D.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1997 Dec. 4, v. 1330, no. 2 p.165-171x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02582naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011600143300001400259520125500273650002001528650002601548650001001574650002201584650002801606650004401634650002301678650003301701650002601734650001101760650001101771650002901782650001501811650003001826700001601856700001501872700001701887700002101904773014501925852000902070930003302079945001302112946001102125655001202136IND2056452220221120134412.0970410e19960329ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205645222DNAL7 a86081612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakr, S.W.10aOleic acid-rich fats increase the capacity of postprandial serum to promote cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH cells  ap. 49-55.  aCell cholesterol efflux to serum is stimulated after an oral fat load. The impact of meal fatty acid composition was explored by measure of serum promoted cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH cells after ingestion of 4 different fats: sunflower (Sf), oleic-sunflower (Ol), a mixed oil (Mx), and beef tallow (Bt). High density lipoprotein (HDL)2 and HDL3 were isolated and analyzed. Cholesterol efflux increased regularly after Ol (P < 0.05 at 4 h and P < 0.02 at 8 h), and 8 h after Mx (P < 0.02) or Bt (P < 0.05), but not after Sf. Percent HDL3 phospholipids increased after Ol (P < 0.05 at 6 h and P < 0.01 at 8 h) and 8 h after Mx (P < 0.01). After Ol, variations in efflux and percent phospholipids in HDL3 (but not HDL2) were positively correlated (r = 0.929; P = 0.007 at 6 h). Using HDL3, efflux increased 6 h after Ol (P <0.05) but not after Sf, and efflux was correlated with HDL3 phospholipid concentration in medium (r=0.913; P=0.011). Thus postprandial increase in cholesterol efflux is influenced by ingested fats in relation to increased phospholipid availability on HDL3. The protective effect of monounsaturated fat acids against atherogenesis might be partly mediated by an enhanced ability of postprandial serum to accept cell cholesterol. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 2aAdult 2aBloodxmetabolism 2aCholesterolxsecretion. 2aDietary Fats, Unsaturatedxpharmacology 2aEatingxphysiology 2aFats, Unsaturatedxchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxanalysis 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLipoproteins, HDLxblood 2aOleic Acid 2aOleic Acidsxpharmacology1 aSenault, C.1 aVacher, D.1 aFournier, N.1 aGirard-Globa, A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1996 Mar. 29, v. 1300, no. 1 p.49-55x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03115naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245017300144300001400317520142700331650002101758650002301779650003801802650002401840650003401864650003601898650002301934650007201957650002902029650002102058650002802079650006002107650003302167650003202200650002202232700001202254700001502266700001502281700001902296700001502315700001702330700001302347700001402360700001302374773014402387852000902531930003302540945001302573946001102586655001202597IND2056404620221120123945.0970409e19960607ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205640462DNAL7 a86796752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFrebort, I.10aTwo amine oxidases from aspergillus niger AKU 3302 contain topa quinone as the cofactor: unusual cofactor link to the glutamyl residue occurs only at one of the enzymes  ap. 59-72.  aAmine oxidases (EC 1.4.3.6) from Aspergillus niger, AO-I (2 X 75 kDa) and AO-II (80 kDa), were examined to determine the cofactor structure. Inactivated with p-nitrophenylhydrazine, they showed absorption and fluorescence spectra similar to those published for other copper amine oxidases and to topa hydantoin p-nitrophenylhydrazone. After digestion by thermolysin and pronase, cofactor peptides were purified by HPLC and sequenced. For thermolytic peptides, a typical topa consensus sequence, Asn-X-Glu-Tyr, was obtained for AO-II, although in case of AO-I it overlapped with Val-Val-Ile-Glu-Pro-Tyr-Gly. For pronase peptides of AO-I, only the latter sequence was obtained. NMR and mass spectroscopy confirmed the residue X as topa p-nitrophenylhydrazone in AO-II and revealed the presence of a residue Z attached to the Glu in the peptide Val-Val-Ile-Glu(Z)-Pro of AO-I. This residue was separated from the peptide by hydrolysis and identified as a product derived from topa quinone. The data, together with amino-acid sequence of AO-I, confer strong evidence for topa quinone as the cofactor, bound in the typical consensus sequence. Raman spectra of the p-nitrophenylhydrazone derivative of AO-I and its pronase peptide showed essentially the same peaks matching to a model compound for topa p-nitrophenylhydrazone. However, there may exist an unusual ester link between the topa-404 and Glu-145 in the native enzyme. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAmine Oxidase (Copper-Containing) 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAspergillus nigerxenzymology 2aCoenzymesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDihydroxyphenylalaninexanalogs & derivativesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aGlutamic Acidxchemistry 2aModels, Chemical 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donorsxchemistry 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistry 2aPhenylhydrazinesxchemistry 2aSequence Analysis1 aPec, P.1 aLuhova, L.1 aToyama, H.1 aMatsushita, K.1 aHirota, S.1 aKitagawa, T.1 aUeno, T.1 aAsano, Y.1 aKato, Y.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1996 June 7, v. 1295, no. 1 p.59-72x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01247naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012300126300001600249520036900265650002100634650002300655700001700678700001500695700001600710700001700726773014800743852000900891930003300900945001300933946001100946655001200957IND2324330320221120123913.0011204e20010528ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232433032DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajaram, H.10aCloning and characterization of the major groESL operon from a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain L-31  ap. 143-146.  aThe major heat-shock-responsive operon groESL has been cloned from the cyanobacterial diazotroph Anabaena.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that hOAT4 protein was localized to the apical side of the proximal tubule. S2 hOAT4 expressed hOAT4 protein in the apical side as well as basolateral side and the cells were cultured on the plastic dish for experiments. S2 hOAT4 exhibited a time- and concentration-dependent, and a saturable increase in OTA uptake, with an apparent K(m) value of 22.9 +/- 2.44 micromolar. The OTA uptakes were inhibited by several substrates for the OATs. Probenecid, piroxicam, octanoate and citrinin inhibited OTA uptake by hOAT4 in a competitive manner (K(i) = 44.4 - 336.4 micromolar), with the following order of potency: probenecid>piroxicam>octanoate>citrinin. The efflux of OTA by S2 hOAT4 was higher than that by mock. Addition of OTA resulted in slight decrease in viability of S2 hOAT4 compared with mock. These results indicate that hOAT4 mediates the high-affinity transport of OTA on the apical side of the proximal tubule, whereas the transport characteristics of OTA are distinct from those by basolateral OATs. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3afood contamination1 aTakeda, M.1 aNarikawa, S.1 aKobayashi, Y.1 aEnomoto, A.1 aTojo, A.1 aCha, S.H.1 aSekine, T.1 aSakthisekaran, D.1 aEndou, H.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 June 12, v. 1590, no. 1/3 p.64-75x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle01547naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245005100129300001400180520088600194650002401080773014701104852000901251930003301260945001301293946001101306655001201317IND2327872320221120124104.0020705e20020325ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232787232DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNorthrop, D.B.10aEffects of high pressure on enzymatic activity  ap. 71-79.  aEffects of high pressure on enzymatic reactions are poised to revolutionize enzyme kinetics. The reason for this is that experimental designs are at hand to separate effects on equilibria between reactant states from effects on catalytic transition states and both yield new information. The first of the former runs contrary to Pauling's hypothesis that substrates are bound more tightly in the transition state, while the latter penetrates the 'black box' of catalysis, the stabilized transition state itself, and returns a precise measure of a physical parameter, deltaV. This in turn opens the door to new forms of structure-activity relationships. The first of these has been described, the effect of pressure on isotope effects, with the surprising finding that the entire isotope effect comes from a transition state phenomenon such as quantum mechanical hydrogen tunneling. 3aBiological Sciences0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 Mar. 25, v. 1595, no. 1/2 p.71-79x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03890naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001200129245015400141300001300295520179600308650002102104650002302125650006902148650006602217650001202283650002202295650006002317650003002377650004902407650005302456650002002509650006402529650003002593650005802623650007402681650005202755650003502807650000902842650002902851650000902880650002502889650003102914650004802945650002602993700001903019700001803038700001603056700001503072700001503087773014403102852000903246930003303255945001303288946001103301655001203312IND2333607720221120124105.0030715e20011130ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233360772DNAL7 a117508822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIde, T.10aSesamin, a sesame lignan, decreases fatty acid synthesis in rat liver accompanying the down-regulation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1  ap. 1-13.  aThe effect of sesamin, one of the most abundant lignans in sesame seed, on hepatic fatty acid synthesis was examined in rats. Rats were fed experimental diets containing varying amounts (0, 0.1 and 0.2% for Exp. 1 and 0, 0.2 and 0.4% for Exp. 2, respectively) of sesamin for 15 days. The activity and gene expression of enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis including acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, ATP-citrate lyase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase decreased as the dietary level of sesamin increased in Exp. 1 and in rats fed the 0.2% sesamin diet they were approximately one-half those in animals fed a sesamin-free diet. In Exp. 2, the 0.2% sesamin diet lowered these parameters to one-half the level for a sesamin-free diet, but no further reduction was seen in animals fed the 0.4% sesamin diet. Dietary sesamin dose-dependently decreased the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) mRNA level, and the value in rats fed a 0.4% sesamin diet was approximately one-half that in those fed a sesamin-free diet. The protein content of the membrane-bound precursor form of SREBP-1 decreased as dietary sesamin increased and was 37% lower in rats fed the 0.4% sesamin diet than in those fed a sesamin-free diet. Dietary sesamin exerted a more marked influence on the protein content of the mature nuclear form of SREBP-1. Diets containing 0.2 and 0.4% sesamin lowered the amount of mature SREBP-1 protein to less than one-fifth of that in the animals fed a sesamin-free diet. It was suggested that the dietary sesamin-dependent decrease in lipogenic enzyme gene expression is due to the suppression of the gene expression of SREBP-1 as well as the proteolysis of the membrane-bound precursor form of this transcriptional factor to generate the mature form. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aATP Citrate (pro-S)-Lyasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aAcetyl-CoA Carboxylasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCholesterolxbiosynthesis 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aDioxolesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDown-Regulation 2aFatty Acid Synthasesxantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aFatty Acidsxbiosynthesis 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologicxdrug effects 2aGlucosephosphate Dehydrogenasexantagonists & inhibitorsxmetabolism. 2aLignansxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLiverxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReceptors, LDLxmetabolism 2aSterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein 1 2aTranscription Factors1 aAshakumary, L.1 aTakahashi, Y.1 aKushiro, M.1 aFukuda, N.1 aSugano, M.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2001 Nov. 30, v. 1534, no. 1 p.1-13x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20031001b20031010c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02317naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001900128245011500147300001600262520096400278650002101242650002301263650001501286650001801301650002601319650002401345650002201369650003501391650003301426650002901459650002501488650003301513650004101546650002301587650003001610700001801640700001301658773014601671852000901817930003301826945001301859946001101872655001201883IND2056242720221120123943.0970331e19951005ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205624272DNAL7 a75481972pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinelle, M.10aOn the interfacial activation of Candida antarctica lipase A and B as compared with Humicola lanuginosa lipase  ap. 272-276.  aThe interfacial activation of Candida antarctica lipase A (CALA) and B (CALB) has been investigated and compared with that of Humicola lanuginosa lipase (HLL). CALB displayed no interfacial activation towards p-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB) when exceeding the solubility limit of the substrate. No activation was observed towards p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) at the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) nor in the presence of a solid polystyrene surface. The catalytic action of CALB was very different from that of Humicola lanuginosa lipase, which showed a pronounced interfacial activation with the same substrates. The basis for the anomalous behaviour of CALB is proposed to be due to the absence of a lid that regulates the access to the active site. In contrast to CALB, CALA expressed interfacial activation, but the activation was not as prominent as for Humicola lanuginosa lipase (HLL). The structural basis for the activation of CALA is unknown. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAdsorption 2aBinding Sites 2aButyratesxmetabolism 2aCandidaxenzymology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aLipasexchemistryxmetabolism. 2aMitosporic Fungixenzymology 2aNitrophenolsxmetabolism 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Structure, Secondary 2aSodium Dodecyl Sulfatexpharmacology 2aSurface Properties 2aTriglyceridesxmetabolism1 aHolmquist, M.1 aHult, K.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1995 Oct. 5, v. 1258, no. 3 p.272-276x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19970501b19970508c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02742naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245011600143300001600259520129100275650002101566650002301587650004201610650003901652650003001691650003001721650002401751650002701775650003201802650003701834650004101871650003801912650002301950650003901973650003802012700001902050700002602069773014702095852000902242930003302251945001302284946001102297655001202308IND2059827020221120124040.0970923e19970904ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205982702DNAL7 a93156182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBenito, B.10aOverexpression of the sodium ATPase of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: conditions for phosphorylation from ATP and Pi  ap. 214-225.  aThe ENA1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a putative ATPase necessary for Na+ efflux. Plasma membranes and intracellular membranes of a yeast strain overexpressing the ENA1 gene contain significant amounts of ENA1 protein. Consequences of the overexpression with reference to the wild-type strain are: (1) a 5-fold higher content of the ENA1-protein in plasma membranes; (2) lower Na+ and Li+ effluxes; (3) slightly higher Na+ tolerance; and (4) much higher Li+ tolerance. The ENA1-specific ATPase activity in plasma membrane preparations of the overexpressing strain was low, but an ENA1 phosphoprotein was clearly detected when the plasma membranes were exposed to ATP in the presence of Na+ or to Pi in the absence of Na+. The characteristics of this phosphoprotein, which correspond to the acyl phosphate intermediaries of P-type ATPases, the absolute requirement of Na+ or other alkali cations for phosphorylation, and the Na+ and pH dependence of phosphorylation from ATP and Pi suggest that the product of the ENA1 gene may be a Na,H-ATPase, which can also pump other alkali cations. The role of the intracellular membranes structures produced with the overexpression of ENA1 in Na+ and Li+ tolerances and the existence of a beta-subunit of the ENA1 ATPase are discussed. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAdenosine Triphosphatasesxmetabolism 2aAdenosine Triphosphatexmetabolism 2aCation Transport Proteins 2aCell Membranexenzymology 2aLithiumxmetabolism 2aPhosphatesxmetabolism 2aPhosphoproteinsxmetabolism 2aRecombinant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSodiumxmetabolism 2aSodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase 2aSubcellular Fractionsxenzymology1 aQuintero, F.J.1 aRodriguez-Navarro, A.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g1997 Sept. 4, v. 1328, no. 2 p.214-225x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a19971102b19971106c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle03229naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245007100143300001400214520164000228650002001868650002601888650001201914650001701926650002801943650003601971650003302007650001102040650004002051650002702091650000902118650001302127650002702140650003902167650002602206650000902232650002502241650003402266650001302300700001702313700001502330700001502345700001902360700001502379700001302394700001502407700001602422700001502438773014402453852000902597930003302606945001302639946001102652655001202663IND2329440120221120123936.0021022e20020510ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232944012DNAL7 a120312882pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIkeda, I.10aCholesterol esterase accelerates intestinal cholesterol absorption  ap. 34-44.  aMechanisms of acceleration of cholesterol absorption by cholesterol esterase were investigated in various experimental conditions. Lymphatic recovery of cholesterol intubated as a micellar solution containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) into the duodenum was enhanced by the co-administration of cholesterol esterase in rats drained of bile and pancreatic juice. However, no accelerated incorporation was observed when cholesterol was solubilized in PC-depleted micelles. Cholesterol esterase dose-dependently accelerated the incorporation of cholesterol into differentiated Caco-2 cells, only when cholesterol was solubilized in PC-containing micelles. The accelerated incorporation of cholesterol into Caco-2 cells by cholesterol esterase disappeared when the enzyme was preincubated with a suicide inhibitor of cholesterol esterase. Cholesterol esterase has an activity as phospholipase A2. When 10% of PC in bile salt micelles was replaced by lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC), the incorporation of cholesterol into Caco-2 cells was significantly accelerated. Cholesterol esterase enhanced the incorporation of micellar cholesterol into blush border membranes prepared from the rat jejunum. The addition of cholesterol esterase to bile salt micelles accelerated the release of micellar cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner, only when the micelles contained PC. These observations strongly suggest that cholesterol esterase hydrolyzes PC in bile salt micelles and thereby, accelerating the release of cholesterol from bile salt micelles. This may be a major cause of the acceleration of cholesterol absorption by cholesterol esterase. 3ahuman nutrition 3adiet-related diseases 2aAnimals 2aCaco-2 Cells 2aCholesterolxmetabolism 2aEnzyme Inhibitorsxpharmacology 2aEsterificationxdrug effects 2aHumans 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aIntestinesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMicelles 2aMicrovillixmetabolism 2aPhosphatidylcholinesxpharmacology 2aPyronesxpharmacology 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aSterol Esterasexpharmacology 2aTriolein1 aMatsuoka, R.1 aHamada, T.1 aMitsui, K.1 aImabayashi, S.1 aUchino, A.1 aSato, M.1 aKuwano, E.1 aItamura, T.1 aYamada, K.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 May 10, v. 1571, no. 1 p.34-44x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20030203b20030211c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02328naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245008200143300001300225520113500238650001301373650002801386650002701414650002101441650002301462650002901485650000801514650002401522650004401546650002501590650001701615650002901632650002101661700001301682700001401695773014301709852000901852930003301861945001301894946001101907655001201918IND2332776620221120104223.0030528e20011101ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233277662DNAL7 a115973472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXia, X.F.10aEffect of phospholipid on trichosanthin adsorption at the air-water interface  ap. 1-11.  aTrichosanthin (TCS) is a toxic protein with multiple pharmacological properties. It belongs to the type I ribosome inactivating protein (RIP) family and can inactivate the eukaryotic ribosome through its RNA N-glycosidase activity. The interaction between TCS and phospholipid membrane was thought to be essential for its physiological effect, for it must get across the cell membrane before it can enter the cytoplasm and exert its RIP function. In order to study the TCS-phospholipid interaction, the difference between spontaneous and phospholipid induced adsorption of TCS at the air-water interface was investigated, and the results were analyzed according to the diffusion-penetration-rearrangement adsorption model. The results showed that both negatively charged 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DPPG) and neutral 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine can accelerate the adsorption rate, while there exists a possible membrane induced conformational change of TCS which is specific for the negatively charged DPPG. We also proposed a revised model for the diffusion controlled initial adsorption period. 3amedicine 3ahuman health and safety 3anonfood plant products 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aAdsorptionxdrug effects 2aAir 2aModels, Theoretical 2aPhospholipidsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aProtein Conformation 2aTime Factors 2aTrichosanthinxchemistry 2aWaterxchemistry1 aWang, F.1 aSui, S.F.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2001 Nov. 1, v. 1515, no. 1 p.1-11x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20030903b20030905c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02263naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245013000144300001400274520096700288650002101255650002301276650002501299650001501324650001301339650001601352650002101368650003601389650003401425650006801459650001701527700001601544700001501560700001801575700001901593700001901612773014401631852000901775930003301784945001301817946001101830655001201841IND2327952020221120104340.0020709e20020401ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232795202DNAL7 a119834242pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBonnin, E.10aHydrolysis of pectins with different degrees and patterns of methylation by the endopolygalacturonase of Fusarium moniliforme  ap. 83-94.  aThe mode of action of the endopolygalacturonase from Fusarium moniliforme was studied towards a series of pectins with different amounts and distribution patterns of methyl-ester groups. The enzyme hydrolysed the linkages between two galacturonic acid residues according to a multi-chain attack mechanism, at least at the early stage of the reaction. The final percentage of hydrolysis decreased with increasing the degree of methylation. The distribution pattern of the methyl groups affected the rate of hydrolysis as well as the final percentage of hydrolysis, a blockwise distribution being more favourable than a random one. The final products, as analysed by mass spectrometry, included methyl-esterified oligogalacturonates. The detailed analysis of the structure of the oligomers showed that the enzyme was able to accommodate methylated galacturonic acid in its active site, but that methyl-esterification negatively affected the affinity of the enzyme. 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 2aFusariumxenzymology 2aHydrolysis 2aKinetics 2aMethylation 2aMolecular Weight 2aPectinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aPolygalacturonasexmetabolism 2aSpectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization 2aTime Factors1 aLe Goff, A.1 aKorner, R.1 aVigouroux, J.1 aRoepstorff, P.1 aThibault, J.F.0 tBiochimica et biophysica acta = International journal of biochemistry and biophysics.g2002 Apr. 1, v. 1596, no. 1 p.83-94x0006-30027nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdLP1  aNon-US 7aarticle02953naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100003100145245012600176300001600302520163800318650001601956650002101972653003201993653002902025653002002054700001802074700002902092700002102121700002102142700002402163700002002187700002202207700002202229700001902251700001802270773011702288852000902405856008502414930003302499946001102532655001202543IND4447677520221120045011.0110121e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444767752DNAL7 a10.1007/s10549-010-0911-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEffenberger, Katharina E. 10aDetection and clinical relevance of early disseminated breast cancer cells depend on their cytokeratin expression pattern  ap. 729-738.  aThe factors determining the clinical relevance of disseminated tumor cells (DTC) in breast cancer patients are largely unknown. Here we compared the specificity and clinical performance of two antibodies frequently used for DTC detection. Reactivities of antibodies A45-B/B3 (A45) and AE1/AE3 (AE) for selected cytokeratins (CK) were assessed by 2-DE Western Blot analysis. Using these antibodies bone marrow aspirates from 391 breast cancer patients (M₀, pT1-3, pN0-3) were screened for the presence of DTC. To obtain prognostic information, patients were followed up over a median of 83 months for time to relapse and 99 months for time to death. Among the analyzed CK, AE detected CK5, CK7, CK8, and CK19, whereas A45 recognized CK7 and CK18. In total, 24 of 391 patients (6.1%) were DTC-positive for A45, and 41 (10.5%) for AE. Although concordance between the two antibodies was 84.4%, overlap among positive cases was only 3.2%. DTC-positivity with AE and A45 was more frequent in patients of higher nodal status (P = 0.019 and P = 0.036, respectively). Nearly all patients with A45-positive DTC had hormone receptor-positive tumors (23/24), while detection of AE-positive DTC was more frequent among hormone receptor negative patients (P = 0.006). Survival analyses of all patients revealed shorter distant disease-free survival (P = 0.039) for patients with A45-positive DTC, whereas the prognostic relevance of AE-positive DTC was restricted to node-positive patients. The clinical utility of immunocytochemical (ICC) DTC detection depends on the anti-CK antibody used, which may reflect the complex CK composition of DTC. 3abone marrow 3abreast neoplasms 0aAnti-cytokeratin antibodies 0aDisseminated tumor cells 0aMicrometastasis1 aBorgen, Elin 1 aEulenburg, Christine zu 1 aBartkowiak, Kai 1 aGrosser, Andrea 1 aSynnestvedt, Marit 1 aKaaresen, Rolf 1 aBrandt, Burkhard 1 aNesland, Jahn M. 1 aPantel, Klaus 1 aNaume, Bjorn 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2011 Feb., v. 125, no. 3 p.729-738dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-010-0911-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20110121b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02640naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006500167300001200232520148100244650001201725650001501737650001501752650001701767650002101784650001701805650001101822650001901833650001301852650002201865650001301887653002201900653002101922653001601943653002101959773011201980852000902092856008502101930003302186946001102219655001202230IND4447675320221120044919.0110121e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444767532DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-010-9605-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGantt, Elisabeth 10aOxygenic photosynthesis and the distribution of chloroplasts  ap. 1-6.  aThe integrated functioning of two photosystems (I and II) whether in cyanobacteria or in chloroplasts is the outstanding sign of a common ancestral origin. Many variations on the basic theme are currently evident in oxygenic photosynthetic organisms whether they are prokaryotes, unicellular, or multicellular. By conservative estimates, oxygenic photosynthesis has been around for at least ca. 2.2-2.7 billions years, consistent with cyanobacteria-type microfossils, biomarkers, and an atmospheric rise in oxygen to less than 1.0% of the present concentration. The presumptions of chloroplast formation by the cyanobacterial uptake into a eukaryote prior to 1.6 BYa ago are confounded by assumptions of host type(s) and potential tolerance of oxygen toxicity. The attempted dating and interrelationships of particular chloroplasts in various plant or animal lineages has relied heavily on phylogenomic analysis and evaluations that have been difficult to confirm separately. Many variations occur in algal groups, involving the type and number of accessory pigments, and the number(s) of membranes (2-4) enclosing a chloroplast, which can both help and complicate inferences made about early or late origins of chloroplasts. Integration of updated phylogenomics with physiological and cytological observations remains a special challenge, but could lead to more accurate assumptions of initial and extant endosymbiotic event(s) leading toward stable chloroplast associations. 3aanimals 3aautotrophs 3abiomarkers 3achloroplasts 3aeukaryotic cells 3amicrofossils 3aoxygen 3aphotosynthesis 3apigments 3aprokaryotic cells 3atoxicity 0aChloroplast types 0aEukaryotic algae 0aNucleomorph 0aReaction centers0 tPhotosynthesis research.g2011 Jan., v. 107, no. 1 p.1-6dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0166-85957nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11120-010-9605-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20110121b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02428naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245011400167300001400281520134000295650001901635653001801654653003301672653003901705653002401744700002101768700002001789700001801809773013701827852000901964856008501973930003302058946001102091655001202102IND4447672620221120044958.0110121e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444767262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11517-010-0694-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Dingchang 10aEstimation of mean arterial pressure from the oscillometric cuff pressure: comparison of different techniques  ap. 33-39.  aMean arterial pressure (MAP) is determined in most automated oscillometric blood pressure devices, but its derivation has been little studied. In this research, different techniques were studied and compared with the auscultatory technique. Auscultatory systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were obtained in 55 healthy subjects by two trained observers, and auscultatory MAP was estimated. Automated MAP was determined by six techniques from oscillometric cuff pressures recorded digitally and simultaneously during manual measurement. MAPs were derived from the peak and foot of the largest oscillometric pulse, and from time domain curves fitted to the sequence of oscillometric pulse amplitudes (4th order and three versions of the 6th order polynomial curve). The agreement between automated and auscultatory MAPs was assessed. Compared with the auscultatory MAP, the automated MAP from the baseline cuff pressure at the peak of the 6th order polynomial curve had the smallest mean paired difference (−1.0 mmHg), and smallest standard deviation of paired differences (3.7 mmHg). These values from the peak of the largest oscillometric pulse were −1.3 and 6.2 mmHg, respectively. Determining MAP from a model of the oscillometric pulse waveform had the smallest differences from the manual auscultatory technique. 3ablood pressure 0aCuff pressure 0aMean arterial pressure (MAP) 0aNon-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) 0aOscillometric pulse1 aAmoore, John N. 1 aMieke, Stephan 1 aMurray, Alan 0 tMedical & biological engineering & computing.g2011 Jan., v. 49, no. 1 p.33-39dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0140-01187nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-010-0694-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110121b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03146naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245024800164300001600412520173300428653003402161653002902195653002202224653003502246653002002281653002102301700002302322700002102345700002402366700001602390700001902406700001802425700002202443700002802465773011702493852000902610856008502619939003302704946001102737655001202748IND4447677920221120035707.0110121e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444767792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10549-010-1251-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoché, Henri 10aIxabepilone plus capecitabine in metastatic breast cancer patients with reduced performance status previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes: a pooled analysis by performance status of efficacy and safety data from 2 phase III studies  ap. 755-765.  aPatients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes often have decreased performance status secondary to extensive tumor involvement. Here, we report the pooled analysis of efficacy and safety data from two similarly designed phase III studies to provide a more precise estimate of benefit of ixabepilone plus capecitabine in MBC patients with Karnofsky's performance status (KPS) 70-80. Across the studies, anthracycline/taxane-pretreated MBC patients were randomized to receive ixabepilone plus capecitabine or capecitabine alone. Individual patient data for KPS 70-80 subset (n = 606) or KPS 90-100 subset (n = 1349) from the two studies were pooled by treatment. Analysis included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), and safety. In patients with reduced performance status (KPS 70-80), ixabepilone plus capecitabine was associated with improvements in OS (median: 12.3 vs. 9.5 months; HR, 0.75; P = 0.0015), PFS (median: 4.6 vs. 3.1 months; HR, 0.76; P = 0.0021) and ORR (35 vs. 19%) over capecitabine alone. Corresponding results in patients with high performance status (KPS 90-100) were median OS of 16.7 versus 16.2 months (HR, 0.98; P = 0.8111), median PFS of 6.0 versus 4.4 months (HR, 0.58; P = 0.0009), and ORR of 45 versus 28%. The safety profile of combination therapy was similar between the subgroups. Ixabepilone plus capecitabine appeared to show superior efficacy compared to capecitabine alone in MBC patients previously treated with anthracyclines and taxanes, regardless of performance status, with a possible OS benefit favoring KPS 70-80 patients (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00080301 and NCT00082433). 0aIxabepilone plus capecitabine 0aMetastatic breast cancer 0aTaxane resistance 0aKarnofsky's performance status 0aSubset analysis 0aOverall survival1 aConte, Pierfranco 1 aPerez, Edith A. 1 aSparano, Joseph A. 1 aXu, Binghe 1 aJassem, Jacek 1 aPeck, Ronald 1 aKelleher, Thomas 1 aHortobagyi, Gabriel N. 0 tBreast cancer research and treatment.g2011 Feb., v. 125, no. 3 p.755-765dBoston : Springer USx0167-68067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10549-010-1251-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111107  aNon-US 7aarticle03524naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013500169300001600304500001900320520134600339536062401685592002802309596007002337596003602407596001002443650002302453650002502476650001102501650002202512650001002534650001502544650002502559650001402584651001002598653001302608653001902621653003002640653002302670653001902693700001902712700001702731700001702748700001302765700001302778773013202791856008602923852000903009655001203018IND60733484420221117234612.0210422e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348442DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2020.18685842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Xianghan10aIntegrated monitoring of lakes’ turbidity in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 epidemic using multi-sensor satellite observations  ap. 443-463.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aDuring the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, a series of measures were implemented by the government to prevent the spread of disease, including the lockdown policy and construction of emergency hospitals. To estimate the impact of these measures on aquatic environments, turbidity of lakes in Wuhan was dynamically monitored by integrating multi-sensor satellite observations. Calibrated against field measurements, empirical turbidity models were developed with high accuracy (R ² = 0.77, RMSE = 3.13 NTU). Time series of lake turbidity during COVID-19 were then retrieved, and possible factors for the turbidity change were discussed, including meteorological conditions and human activities. Results demonstrated that (1) the mean turbidity showed a 24.9% decline from 33.4 NTU to 25.1 NTU after the lockdown in Wuhan, which dropped 16.0% compared to that in the previous year. This decline might be related to the sharp reduction in human activities after the lockdown; (2) no obvious turbidity disturbance was observed in the lakes around emergency hospitals during their construction, and the lakes remained stable after the operation of hospitals. The method of integrating multi-sensor satellite observations used in this study shows great performance in term of temporal resolution for dynamic monitoring of inland water.  aThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China [grant numbers 2018YFB0504900, 2018YFB0504904 and 2016YFC0200900, 2016YFC1400906], and the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 42071325, 41701379 and 41571344], Wuhan University Luojia Talented Young Scholar project, Dragon 4 proposal ID 32442 (entitled ‘New Earth Observations tools for Water resource and quality monitoring in Yangtze wetlands and lakes (EOWAQYWET)’), LIESMARS Special Research Funding, the ‘985 Project’ of Wuhan University, and Special funds of State Key Laboratory for equipment.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFB0504900, 2018YFB0504904 and 2016YFC0200900, 2016YFC1400906  a42071325, 41701379 and 41571344  a32442 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adisease transmission 3ahumans 3aissues and policy 3alakes 3asatellites 3atime series analysis 3aturbidity 3aChina 0aCOVID-19 0alake turbidity 0amulti-sensor observations 0adynamic monitoring 0aremote sensing1 aLiu, Jianqiang1 aWang, Jianru1 aTian, Liqiao1 aZhou, Qu1 aLi, Jian0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2021 Apr. 03, v. 14, no. 4 p.443-463dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2020.18685843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02956naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001700143245008700160300001600247500001500263520146600278592002801744650002201772650003901794650001801833650002201851650002701873650001101900650001601911650002401927650001301951650000801964650000901972650002301981650001302004650001602017650002302033650001302056650001602069650001002085650001002095653001002105700002002115700002202135700002002157700001902177700002002196700002102216773009102237856007702328852000902405655001202414IND60438755520221121115109.0151023e199902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043875552DNAL7 a10.1007/s0033599009582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeeb, Tosso 10aMolecular characterization and chromosomal assignment of the canine protein C gene  ap. 134-139.  a2019-12-06  aProtein C is a precursor to a serine protease present in the plasma that plays an important physiological role in the regulation of blood coagulation. Mutations in the human protein C gene have been linked to some cases of Morbus Perthes disease, a thrombophilic condition that results in aseptic necrosis of the femur head and neck. We have cloned the canine protein C gene to investigate whether Morbus Perthes disease in dogs is also caused by mutations within this gene. A genomic λFIXII clone was isolated, and 11,420 bp of DNA sequence were determined containing the complete protein C gene (Acc No. AJ001979). As in humans, the gene consists of nine exons with the translation start codon located in the second exon. The 1.7-kb mRNA contains a 1368-bp open reading frame coding for 456 amino acids. With the genomic protein C clone as a probe in a FISH experiment, the canine protein C gene was assigned to Chromosome (Chr) 19q21-q22. To search for possible mutations, we amplified genomic DNA from one healthy and 15 clinically and pathohistologically confirmed Morbus Perthes patients. Sequence analysis did not reveal any amino acid differences between the affected dogs and the normal control. Several nucleotide polymorphisms were detected, which however, did not result in an amino acid exchange. From these data we conclude that in contrast to human, canine Morbus Perthes disease is most likely not caused by mutations within the protein C gene.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood coagulation 3afluorescence in situ hybridization 3amessenger RNA 3asequence analysis 3atranslation (genetics) 3ahumans 3achromosomes 3aopen reading frames 3anecrosis 3aDNA 3adogs 3aserine proteinases 3amutation 3aamino acids 3achromosome mapping 3apatients 3astart codon 3aexons 3afemur 0agenes1 aKopp, Thorsten 1 aDeppe, Alexandra 1 aBreen, Matthew 1 aMatis, Ulrike 1 aBrunnberg, Leo 1 aBrenig, Bertram 0 tMammalian genome.g1999 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.134-139dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0033599009583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01539naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245009000168300001500258520059700273592002800870650001700898650002000915650002300935651001200958651001000970700002500980700002201005700001901027773008501046856008501131852000901216655001201225IND60084484320221123021740.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008448432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.11.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBusch, Malte10aPotentials of quantitative and qualitative approaches to assessing ecosystem services  ap. 89-103.  aQuantitative and qualitative approaches to assessing and valuing ecosystem services have been compared using case studies from Italy and Germany.

Suggestions are offered on how to integrate both methodologies in order to improve the implementation of an ecosystem service approach in decision-making processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aecosystem services 3aGermany 3aItaly1 aLa Notte, Alessandra1 aLaPorte, Valerie,1 aErhard, Markus0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Oct., v. 21 p.89-103dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2011.11.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01310naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245009200169300001400261520025000275592002800525650001100553650001200564653000800576653000800584653000800592653002000600653002100620653002100641653002500662653003200687700002000719700001900739773009600758856008500854852000900939655001200948IND60609990220221122234446.0180824e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060999022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.04.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShin, Su Hyun10aMeasurement of diversification between asset classes in the Survey of Consumer Finances  ap. 22-26.  aUsing the 2010 and 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, we propose two new measures of asset class diversification that account for two main dimensions; the number of asset classes held and the degree of concentration of wealth in each asset class.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3asurveys 0aD12 0aD14 0aG11 0aDiversification 0aAsset allocation 0aPortfolio choice 0aInvestment decisions 0aSurvey of Consumer Finances1 aSeay, Martin C.1 aKim, Kyong Tae0 tEconomics letters.g2017 July, v. 156 p.22-26dElsevier B.V.wJournal:3059x0165-17657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econlet.2017.04.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245015800167300001600325500001900341520137300360536026101733592002801994596008702022596005902109596004702168650002302215650002002238650001102258650001102269650002502280653001302305653001302318653002102331653001802352653001302370700001702383700001702400700001502417700001902432700001802451700001702469773013202486856008602618852000902704655001202713IND60733484520221117234526.0210422e20210403xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348452DNAL7 a10.1080/17538947.2021.18863582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xiao14aThe characteristics of multi-source mobility datasets and how they reveal the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic  ap. 424-442.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis study reveals the human mobility from various sources and the luxury nature of social distancing in the U.S during the COVID-19 pandemic by highlighting the disparities in mobility dynamics from lower-income and upper-income counties. We collect, process, and compute mobility data from four different sources. We further design a Responsive Index () based on the time series of mobility change percentages to quantify the general degree of mobility-based responsiveness to COVID-19 at the U.S. county level. We find statistically significant positive correlations in the between either two data sources, revealing their general similarity, albeit with varying Pearson’s coefficients. Despite the similarity, however, mobility from each source presents unique and even contrasting characteristics, in part demonstrating the multifaceted nature of human mobility. The results suggest that counties with higher income tend to react more aggressively in terms of reducing more mobility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most states present a positive difference in between their upper-income and lower-income counties, where diverging patterns in time series of mobility changes percentages can be found. The findings shed light on not only the characteristics of multi-source mobility data but also the mobility patterns in tandem with the economic disparity.  aThis work was supported by University of South Carolina COVID-19 Internal Funding Initiative [Grant Number 135400-20-54176]; National Institutes of Health (NIH) [Grant Number 3R01AI127203-04S1]; and National Science Foundation (NSF) [Grant Number 2028791].  aPublisher supplied data  a135400-20-54176cUniversity of South Carolina COVID-19 Internal Funding Initiative  a3R01AI127203-04S1cNational Institutes of Health (NIH)  a2028791cNational Science Foundation (NSF) 3aCOVID-19 infection 3adata collection 3ahumans 3aincome 3atime series analysis 0aCOVID-19 0amobility 0aresponsive index 0avisualization 0abig data1 aLi, Zhenlong1 aJiang, Yuqin1 aYe, Xinyue1 aDeng, Chengbin1 aZhang, Jiajia1 aLi, Xiaoming0 tInternational journal of digital earth.g2021 Apr. 03, v. 14, no. 4 p.424-442dTaylor & FranciswJournal:12290x1753-89557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17538947.2021.18863583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02129naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245006900171300001800240520094200258592002801200650000801228650001301236650001901249650001201268650002901280650003101309650002601340650001901366650001601385650001601401653001401417653001301431653002601444653001801470653001301488700001901501773010501520856008501625852000901710655001201719IND60125825520221118044310.0150428e20150703xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012582552DNAL7 a10.1080/09593330.2015.10062622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBilgin, Melayib10aBiodrying for municipal solid waste: volume and weight reduction  ap. 1691-1697.  aBiodrying is a variation of aerobic decomposition used for the mechanical–biological treatment organic substances to dry and partially stabilize residual municipal waste. This study focuses on the volume and weight reduction biodegradation of the biodrying process using municipal solid waste and the appearance of a stable, final product. The materials were placed in a reactor with invariant airflow rates of 50 L/h and initial moisture contents of 48.49–50.00%. The laboratory-scale experiments were implemented using a 36-L biodrying reactor equipped with an air supply system, a biomass temperature sensor and air sensors. To determine the effect of temperature on biodrying, the process was repeated at various temperatures between 30 °C and 50 °C. The results obtained indicated that after 13 days, biodrying reduced the volume content of waste by 32% and the final product had a high calorific value (4680 kcal/kg).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair flow 3abiodegradation 3abiomass 3aenvironmental technology 3alaboratory experimentation 3amunicipal solid waste 3aorganic matter 3atemperature 3aweight loss 0abiodrying 0abiowaste 0amunicipal solid waste 0awater content 0adisposal1 aTulun, Şevket0 tEnvironmental technology.g2015 July 3, v. 36, no. 13 p.1691-1697dTaylor & Francisx1479-487X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09593330.2015.10062623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03540naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024002600112040001800138100002400156245011300180300001600293500001500309520155300324592002801877650002201905650002201927650002701949650002301976650002201999650002502021650002402046650002602070650002802096650003002124650002402154650002202178650002302200650001702223650001302240650000902253650001202262650001502274651001302289651001302302653002202315653002302337653002202360653002202382653002602404653001402430653002302444653001702467700002202484700002202506700001802528700002602546773010902572856011102681856007402792961001502866852000902881655001202890IND4396123120221120181910.0151127e200705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439612312DNAL7 a10113/69212hdl7 a10.2193/2006-3662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFELIX, ALEXANDRA B.10aApplying Landscape-Scale Habitat-Potential Models to Understand Deer Spatial Structure and Movement Patterns  ap. 804-810.  a2019-12-06  aEcologically based management must incorporate components that consider how individuals associate temporally and spatially to environments that provide specific habitat requirements. Recent research has assessed how environments could be classified based on potential to provide deer (Odocoileus virginianus) habitat components. If habitat potential (HP; i.e., capability of habitat types to provide annual life requisites) classifications can be correlated to deer spatial structure and seasonal movement patterns, managers could better understand how spatial distribution of habitat components influences deer distribution. We analyzed home-range distribution and seasonal movement patterns from 45 adult (≥≥2 yr old) female deer radiocollared between 1999––2002, and deer habitat characteristics in northeastern Lower Peninsula, Michigan, USA, to investigate whether we can predict deer seasonal movement patterns based on the distribution of HP. We constructed logistic regression models that calculated the probability of deer migration given specific HP within seasonal home ranges of migratory and nonmigratory deer. Our results suggested that the probability of seasonal deer migrations relates to the juxtaposition (arrangement) of different habitat types that collectively provide all annual life requisites. We demonstrated that use of habitat-type classifications and HP models can track and predict deer movement patterns, which can facilitate establishment of management units and ecologically based deer management practices.  aPublisher supplied data 3asimulation models 3aforest succession 3aOdocoileus virginianus 3amigratory behavior 3aagricultural land 3aspatial distribution 3awildlife management 3abotanical composition 3apopulation distribution 3aforest-wildlife relations 3aregression analysis 3awildlife habitats 3aseasonal variation 3awild animals 3aforaging 3adeer 3afemales 3aprediction 3aMichigan 0aMichigan 0ahabitat potential 0atemporal variation 0aspatial structure 0awhite-tailed deer 0adeer management units 0amigration 0aseasonal migration 0ahabitat type1 aWalsh, Daniel P.,1 aHUGHEY, BRANDI D.1 aCampa, Henry,1 aWINTERSTEIN, SCOTT R.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2007 May, v. 71, no. 3 p.804-810dThe Wildlife Societyx0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/69213Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2193%2F2006-3663Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/APHIS  aDNAL 7aarticle03293naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245011000165300001600275520181700291592002802108650001902136650001802155650001302173650001302186650001302199650002002212650001402232650001402246650002402260650001102284650002002295650001902315651001002334653002902344653001002373653003002383653002602413653001202439700001702451700001802468700002002486700001702506700001402523700001702537700002002554773010702574856008502681852000902766655001202775IND60635130720221120212554.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063513072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Ying10aImproved estimation of air pollutant emissions from landing and takeoff cycles of civil aircraft in China  ap. 463-471.  aCivil aircraft emissions during landing and takeoff (LTO) are important air pollutant sources, but have been given insufficient attention in China. Accurate estimation of these emissions is limited by a lack of important parameters, such as detailed flight information and the dynamic time in climb and approach modes during LTO that are dependent on mixing layer height (MLH). We developed a flight-time/flight-height relationship using real-time height information in Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay data, and then calculated the actual time for each flight in those two modes based on the actual MLH from meteorological observation. Hourly emissions of civil aircraft were then estimated based on the database of each flight. Total emissions of NOx, CO, SO2, HC and PM from LTO cycles of domestic flights in China during 2015 were 37.78 Gg, 30.25 Gg, 12.00 Gg, 2.38 Gg and 0.75 Gg, respectively. Substantial monthly, daily and hourly variations of emissions due to the flight schedule as well as MLH were calculated. Large differences were found between the new estimation and emissions calculated based on traditional method. Compared with the emissions estimated based on default parameter obtained from International Civil Aviation Organization, the average difference of annual emission among airports with new estimation for various pollutants was approximately 30.3% in climb mode and 81.4% in approach mode; compared with the emissions estimated based on the method proposed by China National Guide, the average difference of annual emission among airports were 37.4% (NOx), 8.4% (CO), 73.1% (HC) and 58.1% (PM) during LTO process. The monthly airport-specific emissions per LTO were also proposed. These can provide necessary and meaningful support for the revision of the values in National Guide.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair pollutants 3aair pollution 3aaircraft 3aairports 3aaviation 3acarbon monoxide 3adatabases 3aemissions 3ameteorological data 3amixing 3anitrogen oxides 3asulfur dioxide 3aChina 0aCivil aircraft emissions 0aAMDAR 0aLanding and takeoff cycle 0aAdjusted time in mode 0aAirport1 aJiao, Yufang1 aLang, Jianlei1 aChen, Dongsheng1 aHuang, Cheng1 aWei, Peng1 aLi, Shengyue1 aCheng, Shuiyuan0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.463-471dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03113naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245019300170300001600363520137700379592002801756650002601784650001901810650002401829650000901853650002401862650001101886650002601897650002001923650001101943650002001954650001601974650001901990650001902009650001202028650001902040650001002059650002402069651001102093653001602104653002602120653001302146653001002159653004802169653001902217700002402236700003002260700002202290700002202312773013202334856008402466852000902550655001202559IND60539630720221116184619.0190318e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053963072DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jembe.2014.05.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSkinner, Marc A.10aExperimental determination of the effects of light limitation from suspended bag oyster (Crassostrea virginica) aquaculture on the structure and photosynthesis of eelgrass (Zostera marina)  ap. 169-180.  aRecent studies have hypothesized reduced eelgrass distribution in areas exposed to suspended bag oyster aquaculture of Crassostrea virginica in Eastern Canada is related to shading from aquaculture stock and equipment. The results of a 359-day manipulative field experiment support this hypothesis. Reductions in underwater light, at levels comparable to those found at suspended oyster operations, caused reduced eelgrass structure, morphometrics, and photosynthesis. Increased organic matter deposition under suspended bags neither led to biologically relevant declines in eelgrass metrics, nor mitigated the effects of light limitation. Shoot density, above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, canopy height, leaf area index, leaf width, and photosynthetic capacity were all significantly reduced. These variables declined along a gradient of increased shading, with significant responses detected in as few as 67days after exposure to 26% subsurface irradiance. Subsequent sampling 253days after the removal of experimental treatments documented the potential for recovery in the form of seedling recruitment to the plots of heaviest impact. However, eelgrass response variables remained significantly reduced relative to controls, indicating previous assumptions of a rapid recovery potential for eelgrass exposed to suspended bag oyster aquaculture were incorrect.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCrassostrea virginica 3aZostera marina 3aaboveground biomass 3abags 3abelowground biomass 3acanopy 3afield experimentation 3aleaf area index 3aleaves 3alight intensity 3amorphometry 3aorganic matter 3aoyster culture 3aoysters 3aphotosynthesis 3ashade 3aspecies recruitment 3aCanada 0aAquaculture 0aCrassostrea virginica 0aEelgrass 0aLight 0aPulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorometry 0aZostera marina1 aCourtenay, Simon C.1 aMcKindsey, Christopher W.1 aCarver, Claire E.1 aMallet, André L.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Oct., v. 459 p.169-180dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.05.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02873naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002800143245010600171300001600277500001500293520144100308592002801749650002801777650001201805650000901817650002201826650001101848650003001859650002801889650001801917650000901935650002301944650001201967650004801979650001202027650002402039650001002063653001002073700002402083700001802107700002002125700001802145700002002163700001902183773009102202856007702293852000902370655001202379IND60438755720221122053241.0151023e199902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043875572DNAL7 a10.1007/s0033599009602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLahbib-Mansais, Yvette 12aA successful strategy for comparative mapping with human ESTs: 65 new regional assignments in the pig  ap. 145-153.  a2019-12-06  aLarge-scale sequencing of cDNAs from numerous tissues is currently being performed within the framework of the Human Genome Project. These expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are then mapped on a radiation hybrid panel to produce a high-resolution map of human genes. In this report, we estimate the efficiency of mapping these ESTs in the pig. A total of 344 human ESTs from Généthon were selected for amplification in other species by Zoo-PCR: 186 of these could be reproducibly amplified by use of pig DNA and the corresponding human primer pairs. One-hundred seven of these were tested on a porcine–rodent somatic cell hybrid panel, permitting regional localizations of 65 ESTs with agarose or single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis gels. The corresponding pig PCR products were sequenced: 60 ESTs matched significantly with the expected human sequences. Fifty-one of these localizations in the pig are in agreement with the comparative mapping data between humans and pigs based on heterologous chromosome painting. Seven ESTs that were localized in an unexpected region may indicate new chromosomal correspondences. This work significantly increases the number of genes mapped on the pig genome and demonstrates that this approach can be successfully applied to improve the gene density of mammalian genomic maps in chromosomal regions of interest, such as those in which QTL (Quantative Trait Loci) have been identified.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquantitative trait loci 3ahybrids 3aloci 3acomplementary DNA 3ahumans 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aexpressed sequence tags 3asomatic cells 3agels 3achromosome mapping 3aagarose 3asingle-stranded conformational polymorphism 3atissues 3achromosome painting 3aswine 0agenes1 aDalias, Géraldine 1 aMilan, Denis 1 aYerle, Martine 1 aRobic, Annie 1 aGyapay, Gábor,1 aGellin, Joël 0 tMammalian genome.g1999 Feb., v. 10, no. 2 p.145-153dSpringer-Verlagx0938-89907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s0033599009603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01471naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245004900161300001800210520048500228592002800713650001500741650002500756650002300781650002300804650001400827650002200841650001900863700001800882700001900900700002500919773010500944856007501049852000901124655001201133IND60578655120221118221548.0170813e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865512DNAL7 a10.1021/ol400190f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalwal, Satish

Studies have demonstrated the ability of dietary flavanols to reduce the severity of metabolic derangements due to high-fat (HF) feeding. The degree of polymerization of the flavanols appears to play a role in determining the extent of these protective effects. This study evaluated the preventative effects of grape seed and pine bark flavanol supplementation, with significantly different flavanol degree of polymerization, in the context of an HF diet. For 13 weeks, mice were given 35 mg/kg body weight per day grape seed or pine bark as part of an HF diet and compared to mice fed a low-fat diet and control HF diet. All flavanol-supplemented groups and the HF control incurred significantly higher weight gain compared to the lean control, and the grape seed group gained significantly more weight than the HF control. Increased weight gain of treatment groups was likely caused by hyperphagia. Despite lack of improvements to weight gain and glycemic control, it was observed that all flavanol treatment groups were able to significantly reduce interleukin-6 compared to HF control. The grape seed group, which gained the most weight overall, also exhibited the lowest levels of interleukin-6 compared to other groups. Overall, low-dose flavanol extract supplementation, regardless of mean degrees of polymerization, blunted cytokine production despite increased weight gain. This obesity-independent effect suggests flavanols may be used as complementary interventions to ameliorate increased inflammatory tone in the contexts of obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, flavanol-induced hyperphagia may have use for attenuation of cachexia.  aPublisher supplied data  cCenter for Applied Plant Sciences Ohio State Universitydhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100015708  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPinus 3abark 3acachexia 3adiabetes 3aflavanols 3aglycemic control 3agrape seeds 3ahigh fat diet 3ainterleukin-6 3alow fat diet 3amice 3aobesity 3aovereating 3apolymerization 3aprotective effect 3aweight gain 0aMean degree of polymerization (mDP) 0aFlavanols 0aProcyanidins (PCs) 0aGlucose intolerance 0aCytokines 0aANOVA 0aAUC 0aC 0aCmax 0aDIO 0aDMAC 0aDP 0aFC 0aGSE 0aHF 0aHPLC 0aIL-6 0aipGTT 0aITT 0aLSD 0aMDA 0amDP 0aPBE 0aPCs 0aOGTT 0aTNF-α1 aFausnacht, Dane W.1 aTuzo, Jessica L.1 aAddington, Adele K.1 aRacine, Kathryn C.1 aZhang, Haiyan1 aHughes, Michael D.1 aEngland, Kathryn M.1 aBruno, Richard S.1 aO'Keefe, Sean F.1 aNeilson, Andrew P.1 aStewart, Amanda C.0 tNutrition research.g2019 June, v. 66 p.32-47dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl32600x0271-53177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nutres.2019.03.0113Available from publisher's site  aAccepted Manuscript  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100001500190245011000205300001800315506007600333520163400409592002802043506003702071650002602108650001802134650002102152650002002173650001302193650003202206650001202238650002302250650001902273650001402292650001402306650002202320700002102342700002002363700006002383773011802443856008302561852000902644655001202653IND60608880220221207070504.0180814e20180705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060888022DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005242doi7 aPMC61105232pmcid7 a299755162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jiaye10aIdentification of a Water-Coordinating HER2 Inhibitor by Virtual Screening Using Similarity-Based Scoring  ap. 4934-4951.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a validated breast cancer drug target for small molecule inhibitors that target the ATP-binding pocket of the kinase domain. In this work, a large-scale virtual screen was performed to a novel homology model of HER2, in a hypothesized “fully active” state, that considered water-mediated interactions during the prioritization of compounds for experimental testing. This screen led to the identification of a new inhibitor with micro molar affinity and potency (Kd = 7.0 μM, IC₅₀ = 4.6 μM). Accompanying molecular dynamics simulations showed that inhibitor binding likely involves water coordination through an important water-mediated network previously identified in our laboratory. The predicted binding geometry also showed a remarkable overlap with the crystallographic poses for two previously reported inhibitors of the related Chk1 kinase. Concurrent with the HER2 studies, we developed formalized computational protocols that leverage solvated footprints (per-residue interaction maps that include bridging waters) to identify ligands that can “coordinate” or “displace” key binding site waters. Proof-of-concept screens targeting HIVPR and PARP1 demonstrate that molecules with high footprint overlap can be effectively identified in terms of their coordination or displacement patterns relative to a known reference. Overall, the procedures developed as a result of this study should be useful for researchers targeting HER2 and, more generally, for any protein in which the identification of compounds that exploit binding site waters is desirable.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aantineoplastic agents 3abinding sites 3abreast neoplasms 3aerbB-2 receptor 3ageometry 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3aligands 3amolecular dynamics 3aprioritization 3aprotocols 3ascreening 3asimulation models1 aCollins, Stephen1 aMiller, W.

TPDT, an alternative to sodium borohydride, was used to prepare 15 different core–shell metal nanostructures. The direct colloidal synthesis and stabilization of silver octahedra nanoparticles is still a challenging task. The proposed methodology is an alternative synthetic route for Ag or Au nanoshell coated onto the AuOh core. UV–vis absorption spectroscopy, high-resolution electron transmission microscopy analyses with selected area electron diffraction, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and X-ray diffraction techniques were used to characterize the prepared core–shell octahedra nanostructures. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy–energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images and scanning electron microscopy coupled with lines scan EDS were recorded to understand the alloy layer shell and bilayer shell in the core–shell Oh nanostructures. Catalytic reduction of toxic nitroaromatic compounds was chosen to investigate the catalytic activity of the core–shell octahedra nanostructures. The results reveal that the bimetal (AgAu) alloy shell layer coated over AuOh showed best catalytic activity, among the core–shell catalysts investigated for the reduction of nitroaromatics.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agold 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3anitroaromatic compounds 3aphysical chemistry 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asilver 3asodium borohydride 3atoxicity 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aShanmugam, Sivakumar1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4087-76861 aRamaraj, Ramasamy1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2242-54830 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 Aug. 05, v. 123, no. 34 p.21066-21075dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b062983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02061naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001600152245014000168300001600308520108300324592002801407650001401435650001501449650001101464650002401475650002101499650001401520700001701534700002101551773008001572856008601652852000901738655001201747IND60084995420221118085005.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008499542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSuárez, I.10aAnalysis of potential energy, economic and environmental savings in residential buildings: Solar collectors combined with microturbines  ap. 128-136.  aThis paper presents an analysis of a combined solar-cogeneration installation for providing energy services in a set of four residential buildings. Different configurations as regards the number of collectors and their orientation, the number of buildings grouped together, the type of microturbines used in the cogeneration system and their daily and annual operating period are studied from the legal, economic and environmental perspectives. The installation that fulfils the minimum requirements of the solar system coverage and the cogeneration system efficiency currently in force, and simultaneously leads to the highest energy, economic and environmental savings is the one that integrates both technologies and centralises the installation for the four buildings together. A payback period lower than 8years is obtained that makes this investment recommendable, but it is also concluded that maintaining the existing subsidies for these technologies and lowering the costs of the equipment, are essential factors to ensure the feasibility of this type of installations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abuildings 3acollectors 3aenergy 3aresidential housing 3asolar collectors 3asubsidies1 aPrieto, M.M.1 aFernández, F.J.0 tApplied energy.g2013 Apr., v. 104 p.128-136dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0703Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02682naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094024002200131024001900153040001800172100002600190245014200216300001800358506007600376520140500452592002801857506003701885650002501922650001701947650001201964650001301976650001101989700006302000700005902063773011802122856008302240852000902323655001202332IND60608880320221207045810.0180814e20180702xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060888032DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005372doi7 aPMC60943492pmcid7 a299657472pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKincannon, William M.12aA Radical Clock Probe Uncouples H Atom Abstraction from Thioether Cross-Link Formation by the Radical S-Adenosyl-l-methionine Enzyme SkfB  ap. 4816-4823.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aSporulation killing factor (SKF) is a ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) produced by Bacillus. SKF contains a thioether cross-link between the α-carbon at position 40 and the thiol of Cys32, introduced by a member of the radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) superfamily, SkfB. Radical SAM enzymes employ a 4Fe–4S cluster to bind and reductively cleave SAM to generate a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical. SkfB utilizes this radical intermediate to abstract the α-H atom at Met40 to initiate cross-linking. In addition to the cluster that binds SAM, SkfB also has an auxiliary cluster, the function of which is not known. We demonstrate that a substrate analogue with a cyclopropylglycine (CPG) moiety replacing the wild-type Met40 side chain forgoes thioether cross-linking for an alternative radical ring opening of the CPG side chain. The ring opening reaction also takes place with a catalytically inactive SkfB variant in which the auxiliary Fe–S cluster is absent. Therefore, the CPG-containing peptide uncouples H atom abstraction from thioether bond formation, limiting the role of the auxiliary cluster to promoting thioether cross-link formation. CPG proves to be a valuable tool for uncoupling H atom abstraction from peptide modification in RiPP maturases and demonstrates potential to leverage RS enzyme reactivity to create noncanonical amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aS-adenosylmethionine 3acrosslinking 3aenzymes 3amoieties 3athiols1 aBruender, Nathan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6129-88971 aBandarian, Vahe1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2302-02770 tBiochemistry.g2018 July 02, v. 57, no. 32 p.4816-4823dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b005373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01102naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100002200169245008400191300001600275520017800291592002800469653001600497653001300513653001100526653001200537653001300549653001400562773011000576856011700686852000900803655001200812IND60127303120221120214012.0151110e200409  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012730312DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2004)087[0365:TNZSFS]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanborn, Allen F.10aTwo new zammara species from south america (hemiptera: cicadomorpha: cicadidae)  ap. 365-371.  aTwo new members of the widespread Neotropical genus Zammara Amyot & Serville, Zammara olivacea n.sp. from Columbia and Zammara medialinea n.sp. from Venezuela are described.  aPublisher supplied data 0anew species 0ataxonomy 0acicada 0aZammara 0aColumbia 0aVenezuela0 tFlorida entomologist.g2004 Sept., v. 87, no. 3 p.365-371dFlorida Entomological Societyx0015-40407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1653%2F0015-4040%282004%29087%5B0365%3ATNZSFS%5D2.0.CO%3B23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02476naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245013700159300002000296520127300316592002801589650001101617650001401628650001301642650001601655650002701671650001701698650002001715650002301735650001101758650001601769650001801785651001201803700002001815700003101835773014101866856007402007852000902081655001202090IND60651753420221119232004.0190712e20151204xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065175342DNAL7 a10.3390/su712158112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlumberg, Timo10aDesign and Assessment of an IGCC Concept with CO<sub>2</sub> Capture for the Co-Generation of Electricity and Substitute Natural Gas  ap. 16213-16225.  aThe focus of this work is on the modeling and the thermodynamic evaluation of an integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) for the co-production of electricity and substitute natural gas (SNG). At first, an IGCC with CO<inf>2</inf> capture for electricity generation is analyzed. Coal-derived syngas is conditioned in a water gas shift unit (WGS), and cleaned in an acid gas removal system including carbon capture. Eventually, the conditioned syngas is fed to a combined cycle. A second case refers to a complete conversion of syngas to SNG in an integrated commercial methanation unit (TREMP™ process, Haldor Topsøe, Kgs. Lyngby, Denmark). Due to the exothermic reaction, a gas recycling and intercooling stages are necessary to avoid catalyst damage. Based on a state-of-the-art IGCC plant, an optimal integration of the synthetic process considering off-design behavior was determined. The raw syngas production remains constant in both cases, while one shift reactor in combination with a bypass is used to provide an adequate H<inf>2</inf>/CO-ratio for the methanation unit. Electricity has to be purchased from the grid in order to cover the internal consumption when producing SNG. The resulting heat and power distributions of both cases are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acleaning 3aelectricity 3aelectricity generation 3agasification 3aheat production 3amethane production 3amodels 3anatural gas 3asynthesis gas 3aDenmark1 aSorgenfrei, Max1 aTsatsaronis, G.q(George),0 tSustainability.g2015 Dec. 04, v. 7, no. 12 p.16213-16225dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su712158113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01583naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245013000160300001800290520054500308592002800853650002000881650002200901650001600923700001600939700001700955700001300972700002100985700001701006700001601023773013401039856007501173852000901248655001201257IND60775734220221116193450.0220427e20220426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077573422DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc07012f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMajewska, M.

Habitat mapping is a key step to monitor the spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation and detect on-going changes. However, it is still a challenge to produce reliable vegetation maps at the regional scale. This study aims to evaluate the potential of new Landsat-8 imageries (acquired in September and December 2013) for mapping fine-grained plant communities in coastal marshlands. Field-based vegetation maps were collected for 270 km of marshlands along the French Atlantic coast. In order to be identifiable on the satellite image, fine-grained vegetation units were aggregated into fewer plant community combinations. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparison with field-based vegetation data and compared between the supervised methods used, including Minimum Distance, Mahalanobis, Maximum Likelihood, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine. The best result was obtained with the Maximum Likelihood classifier and by combining the two Landsat-8 images (85.9 % accuracy overall). Three main habitat types dominated the coastal Atlantic marshlands: croplands, Trifolio maritimae-Oenantheto silaifoliae geosigmetum and Puccinellio maritimae-Arthrocnemeto fruticosi geosigmetum. The reliability of the vegetation map produced will provide a good basis for monitoring the conservation status of the various habitats.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3acoasts 3aconservation status 3acropland 3aecosystem services 3ahabitats 3amonitoring 3aplant communities 3aremote sensing 3asupport vector machines 3avegetation1 aBouzillé, Jan-Bernard1 aOszwald, Johan1 aBonis, Anne0 tWetlands.g2015 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1043-1054dSpringer Netherlandsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-015-0693-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03672naa a2200661 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245010100210300001300311500001500324506007600339520165700415592002802072506003702100650002002137650002302157650001202180650001202192650002502204650002002229650001302249650001602262650001302278650001402291650002002305653001602325700002702341700001802368700002002386700002002406700002602426700002202452700002002474700002302494700002302517700001702540700002402557700001802581700002002599700002102619700002302640700002002663700002402683700001902707700002302726700002402749700002802773773010702801856008102908852000902989655001202998IND50070250620221207101104.0150427e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007025062DNAL7 a240634302pmid7 aPMC40148042pmcid7 a10.1186/gb-2013-14-9-r1052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNordlund, Jessica10aGenome-wide signatures of differential DNA methylation in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ap. 3160.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Although aberrant DNA methylation has been observed previously in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the patterns of differential methylation have not been comprehensively determined in all subtypes of ALL on a genome-wide scale. The relationship between DNA methylation, cytogenetic background, drug resistance and relapse in ALL is poorly understood. RESULTS: We surveyed the DNA methylation levels of 435,941 CpG sites in samples from 764 children at diagnosis of ALL and from 27 children at relapse. This survey uncovered four characteristic methylation signatures. First, compared with control blood cells, the methylomes of ALL cells shared 9,406 predominantly hypermethylated CpG sites, independent of cytogenetic background. Second, each cytogenetic subtype of ALL displayed a unique set of hyper- and hypomethylated CpG sites. The CpG sites that constituted these two signatures differed in their functional genomic enrichment to regions with marks of active or repressed chromatin. Third, we identified subtype-specific differential methylation in promoter and enhancer regions that were strongly correlated with gene expression. Fourth, a set of 6,612 CpG sites was predominantly hypermethylated in ALL cells at relapse, compared with matched samples at diagnosis. Analysis of relapse-free survival identified CpG sites with subtype-specific differential methylation that divided the patients into different risk groups, depending on their methylation status. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest an important biological role for DNA methylation in the differences between ALL subtypes and in their clinical outcome after treatment.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA methylation 3aat-risk population 3arelapse 3asurveys 3alymphocytic leukemia 3agene expression 3achildren 3ablood cells 3apatients 3achromatin 3adrug resistance 0arisk groups1 aBäcklin, Christofer L1 aWahlberg, Per1 aBusche, Stephan1 aBerglund, Eva C1 aEloranta, Maija-Leena1 aFlægstad, Trond,1 aForestier, Erik1 aFrost, Britt-Marie1 aHarila-Saari, Arja1 aHeyman, Mats1 aJónsson, Ólafur G1 aLarsson, Rolf1 aPalle, Josefine1 aRönnblom, Lars,1 aSchmiegelow, Kjeld1 aSinnett, Daniel1 aSöderhäll, Stefan1 aPastinen, Tomi1 aGustafsson, Mats G1 aLönnerholm, Gudmar1 aSyvänen, Ann-Christine0 tGenome biology.g2013 Sept., v. 14, no. 9 p.3160-3160dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:19127x1474-760X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/gb-2013-14-9-r1053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03526naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001600137245013100153300001600284520185900300592002802159650001302187650002202200650001602222650001802238650001502256650001802271650002702289650001002316650001302326650002002339650002802359650002802387650001302415650001402428650001902442650001902461650002202480650002302502650001702525650001802542650002502560653001402585653001802599653001702617653002002634700001602654700001102670700001402681700001602695700001502711700001602726773011402742856007102856852000902927655001202936IND60631574320221120132639.0190311s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063157432DNAL7 a10.1071/AN171132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQiao, G. H.10aEffect of diet synchrony on rumen fermentation, production performance, immunity status and endocrine in Chinese Holstein cows  ap. 664-672.  aIn order to maximise utilisation of nutrients for ruminants, researchers directed the supply of nitrogen and organic matter synchronously to the rumen. In the current research, two experiments were conducted, one using the in situ nylon bag technique and the other using in vivo study. In Experiment 1, dynamic degradation rates of organic matter (OM) and nitrogen of each feedstuff were determined using the in situ nylon bag technique. Accordingly, three diets were formulated with the same chemical components, but differing in synchrony index (0.74, 0.85 and 0.97). Experiment 2 was subsequently carried out in vivo to evaluate the influence of diet synchrony on rumen fermentation, productive performance, immunity status and endocrine in Chinese Holstein cows. Rumen degradability of OM and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) and total tract digestibility of OM were linearly increased with the increase of synchrony index, respectively (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids concentration of rumen fluid was increased linearly with the increase of synchrony index (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, rumen ammonia nitrogen concentration and blood urea nitrogen concentration were decreased in cows with the increase of synchrony index, (P < 0.05). Microbial crude protein production, the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis, and milk protein percentage, were linearly increased with the increase of synchrony index (P < 0.05). Serum concentrations of prostaglandin E2 and immunoreactive fibronectin-γ were linearly decreased with the increase of diet synchrony index (P < 0.05). The aforementioned results implicate that an increase of diet synchrony index could improve diet’s nitrogen utilisation, apparent digestibility of OM, and NDF. Additionally, it could promote rumen fermentation capacity, productive performance and immunity status in dairy cows.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aammonium nitrogen 3ablood serum 3acrude protein 3adairy cows 3adigestibility 3afatty acid composition 3afeeds 3aimmunity 3ain vivo studies 3amilk protein percentage 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aorganic matter 3aprostaglandins 3aprotein synthesis 3arumen fermentation 3arumen fluids 3aurea nitrogen 3avolatile fatty acids 0acytokines 0adigestibility 0amilk protein 0asynchrony index1 aXiao, Z.

This feature article focuses on complex-variable techniques such as complex scaling and complex absorbing potentials that afford a treatment of electronic resonances in terms of discrete square-integrable eigenstates of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex energy. Fundamental aspects of these techniques as well as their integration into molecular electronic-structure theory are discussed and an overview of some recent developments is given: analytic gradient theory for electronic resonances, the application of rank-reduction techniques and quantum embedding to them, as well as approaches for evaluating partial decay widths.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical communication 3achemistry 3aelectrons 3aenergy 3aenvironment 3awidth0 tChemical communications.g2022 Apr. 26, v. 58, no. 34 p.5205-5224dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1cc07090h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03423naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245013900156300001600295520195500311592002802266650002302294650002302317650002302340650001602363650001102379650002202390650002402412650000902436650001202445650002002457650001002477650001302487650001402500650001702514650002002531651000902551653003302560653003002593653001402623700001702637700001802654700001902672700001602691700001602707773011402723856007102837852000902908655001202917IND60631574420221120132742.0190311s2019    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063157442DNAL7 a10.1071/AN172552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWindsor, P.

We report a pilot study examining the potential for triclabendazole provided in medicated molasses blocks offered to control Fasciola gigantica in smallholder cattle production. This study involved 241 cattle allocated into three groups: (1) triclabendazole (as Fasinex®, Novartis Animal Health Australia, Pty Ltd) medicated molasses blocks (MMB) with each tonne of MMB containing 0.5 kg triclabendazole; (2) unmedicated molasses blocks; and (3) a Control group. Data and faecal samples were obtained at Weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12 for faecal egg counts (FEC) determination. Reductions in FEC in the MMB group of 90.48% and a mean FEC of 4 ± 17 eggs per gram of faeces at 12 weeks post-treatment was observed, with liveweight increasing from 174.60 (±3.35) kg to 191.50 (±3.69) kg in Weeks 1 and 12, respectively (P = 001) and an average daily weight gain of 201 g/day. Reduction in FEC in the unmedicated molasses blocks group was also observed, by 28.78% and 18.96%, with liveweight increasing from 179.50 (±3.35) kg to 189.90 (±6.05) kg in Weeks 1 and 12 respectively (P = 0.3), with an average daily gain of 124 g/day. This study suggests that productivity was enhanced when triclabendazole was added to the blocks, delivering parasite suppression or potentially therapeutic doses on ad libitum feeding of the MMB. Although further work is required to establish the therapeutic potential of MMB, the use of MMB may offer a parasite management and nutritional supplementation strategy for smallholder farmers, particularly in Laos and other countries where unmanaged Fasciola spp. infestations reduce ruminant productivity and facilities for animal restraint to enable delivery of oral anthelmintics, are largely non-existent.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFasciola gigantica 3aad libitum feeding 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acattle 3acattle production 3adietary supplements 3aeggs 3afarmers 3afecal egg count 3afeces 3amolasses 3aparasites 3atherapeutics 3atriclabendazole 3aLaos 0acattle health and production 0amedicated molasses blocks 0aparasites1 aNampanya, S.1 aKinnavong, B.1 aPhommasone, P.1 aBush, R.

However, burning residues, which leads to GHG and black carbon (BC) emissions, has been used to facilitate manual harvest. BC emissions have a net warming effect and cause health problems. Mechanized harvest without burning is gradually replacing manually harvested burned sugarcane. Global warming potential (GWP) and human health indicators of sugarcane ethanol production in Brazil, in the pre-mechanization (100% burned), current (∼50% burned) and future (100% without burning) scenarios, were calculated. In the past, the GWP of ethanol production was 1.1kgCO₂eqL⁻¹ and BC emissions were 32.6kgCO₂eqL⁻¹. The human health impact in disability adjusted life years (DALY) was 3.16E−05DALYL⁻¹ ethanol. The current ethanol production process has a GWP 46% smaller, while BC emissions are seven times smaller than before mechanization started. The human health impact is currently 7.72E−06DALYL⁻¹. In the future, with complete mechanization and the integration of first and second generation ethanol, the expected GWP emissions will be 70% smaller, and BC emissions will be 216 times smaller than when all sugarcane was harvested with burning. These results show that ethanol production in Brazil is improving in terms of global warming and human health aspects. Other upstream aspects of ethanol production such as direct and indirect land use change, and downstream impacts such as the emissions of acetaldehydes were not considered in this study, which focused on a major technological shift in residue management in the agricultural phase of sugarcane ethanol production. A broader assessment of the sustainability of ethanol must account for those issues, as well as economic and social aspects. Sugarcane-derived ethanol produced in Brazil has been considered one of the most sustainable biofuels options, but it is essential to identify and promote practices and policies that further improve its production, such as the phase out of pre-harvest sugarcane burning and the increase in ethanol yield per unit of area.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural management 3abiofuels 3aburning 3acarbon 3adisability-adjusted life year 3aemissions 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3ahuman health 3aissues and policy 3aland use change 3amanual harvesting 3amechanical harvesting 3amechanization 3asugarcane 3aBrazil1 aCavalett, Otávio,1 aSeabra, Joaquim E.A.1 aNogueira, Luiz Augusto Horta1 aBonomi, Antonio0 tApplied energy.g2013 Apr., v. 104 p.576-582dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.11.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001400149245008800163300001800251520166400269592002801933650001601961650002501977650001802002650002102020650001302041650000902054650001202063650001102075650001202086650000902098650001202107650001202119650001302131650001302144650001202157650000902169650002302178650001302201650001502214700002302229700002502252700001802277700001602295700002602311700006102337773011802398856008302516852000902599655001202608IND60608880720221122043740.0180814e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060888072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b006262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Bin10aUnderstanding the Species Selectivity of Myeloid Cell Leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) Inhibitors  ap. 4952-4958.  aTo test for on target toxicity of a new chemical entity, it is important to have comparable binding affinities of the compound in the target proteins from humans and the test species. To evaluate our myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) inhibitors, we tested them against rodent Mcl-1 and found a significant loss of binding affinity when compared to that seen with human Mcl-1. To understand the affinity loss, we used sequence alignments and structures of human Mcl-1/inhibitor complexes to identify the important differences in the amino acid sequences. One difference is human L246 (F226 in rat, F227 in mouse) in the ligand binding pocket. Mutating rat F226 to a Leu restores affinity, but the mouse F227L mutant still has a ligand affinity that is lower than that of human Mcl-1. Another mutation of mouse F267, located ∼12 Å from the ligand pocket, to the human/rat cysteine, F267C, improved the affinity and combined with F227L resulted in a mutant mouse protein with a binding affinity similar to that of human Mcl-1. To help understand the structural components of the affinity loss, we obtained an X-ray structure of a mouse Mcl-1/inhibitor complex and identified how the residue changes reduced compound complementarity. Finally, we tested Mcl-1 of other preclinical animal models (canine, monkey, rabbit, and ferret) that are identical to humans in terms of these two residues and found that their Mcl-1 bound our compounds with affinities comparable to that of human Mcl-1. These results have implications for understanding ligand selectivity for similar proteins and for the interpretation of preclinical toxicology studies with Mcl-1 inhibitors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aamino acid sequences 3aanimal models 3abinding capacity 3acysteine 3adogs 3aferrets 3ahumans 3aligands 3amice 3amonkeys 3amutants 3amutation 3aproteins 3arabbits 3arats 3asequence alignment 3atoxicity 3atoxicology1 aArnold, Allison L.1 aCoronel, Marcelle A.1 aLee, Joyce H.1 aLee, Taekyu1 aOlejniczak, Edward T.1 aFesik, Stephen W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5957-61920 tBiochemistry.g2018 July 16, v. 57, no. 32 p.4952-4958dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b006263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02267naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245012200185300001600307520095600323592002801279650000801307650001501315650002301330650001101353650003701364650001601401653000801417653001601425653002201441653001501463653001301478700002701491700002201518700002301540700002401563700002901587700002101616773010501637856008201742852000901824655001201833IND60517671920221121034523.0190801e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051767192DNAL7 a223009682pmid7 a10.1017/S09671994110006942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhoueiry, Rita10aAbnormal methylation of KCNQ1OT1 and differential methylation of H19 imprinting control regions in human ICSI embryos  ap. 129-138.  aTo evaluate the integrity of genomic imprinting in embryos that failed to develop normally following intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), we analysed the methylation profile of H19 and KCNQ1OT1 imprinting control regions, H19DMR and KvDMR1 respectively, in high-grade blastocysts and in embryos that exhibited developmental anomalies. Significant hypomethylation of KvDMR1 was specifically observed in 5/5 atypical blastocysts graded BC, which probably reflected the vulnerability of the imprint in the inner cell mass during the methylation remodelling phase in the early embryo. In addition, KvDMR1 was hypermethylated in 2/5 CC graded atypical blastocysts and in 2/8 embryos that exhibited developmental delay. H19DMR appeared differentially methylated in all groups of embryos. DNA methyltransfersase 1 (DNMT1) expression was similar in most of the tested embryos and could not account for the abnormal methylation patterns of KvDMR1 observed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3ablastocyst 3agenomic imprinting 3ahumans 3aintracytoplasmic sperm injection 3amethylation 0aART 0aDevelopment 0aHuman blastocysts 0aImprinting 0aKCNQ1OT11 aIbala-Romdhane, Samira1 aAl-Khtib, Mohamed1 aBlachère, Thierry1 aLornage, Jacqueline1 aGuérin, Jean-.François1 aLefèvre, Annick0 tZygote.g2013 May, v. 21, no. 2 p.129-138dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994110006943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01339naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245014300161300001800304520037300322592002800695650002300723650002100746650001300767650000900780700002100789700002100810773013400831856007500965852000901040655001201049IND60775734520221116193405.0220427e20220426xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077573452DNAL7 a10.1039/d1cc07265j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOsawa, Shigehito10aControlled polymerization of metal complex monomers – fabricating random copolymers comprising different metal species and nano-colloids  ap. 5273-5276.  aAcrylate monomers with metal complexes were designed to build polymer metal complexes.

We provide an in situ study on variability of daytime CH₄ emissions and net ecosystem CO₂ exchange (NEE) from a permanently submerged, Carex rostrata dominated Swiss alpine fen over the snow-free period (June–October). Flux chamber measurements were combined with analyses of above-ground biomass and physico-chemical pore water properties. The fen was a net daytime CH₄ source throughout the snow-free period, and emissions varied significantly between the sampling dates, ranging from 3.1 ± 0.9 mg CH₄ m⁻² h⁻¹ in October to 8.0 ± 2.9 mg CH₄ m⁻² h⁻¹ in August. The fen was generally a daytime sink for CO₂, and net CO₂ emission was only observed in late October. Variations in NEE were more pronounced than variations in CH₄ emissions, but both fluxes correlated with changes in green C. rostrata biomass and subsurface temperatures. Methane and CO₂ pore water concentrations also varied significantly over the snow-free period, decreasing and increasing, respectively. These variations were linked to the development of biomass, but CH₄ emissions and NEE were not correlated with the respective pore water concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarex utriculata 3aaboveground biomass 3acarbon cycle 3acarbon dioxide 3aecosystems 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3amethane 3anet ecosystem exchange 3atemperature 3awetlands 3aAlps region 3aSwitzerland1 aCheema, Simrita1 aFranchini, Alessandro G.1 aZumsteg, Anita1 aZeyer, Josef0 tWetlands.g2015 Dec., v. 35, no. 6 p.1149-1163dSpringer Netherlandsx0277-52127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13157-015-0702-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009400173300001600267520132500283592002801608650002401636650003101660650001701691650001801708650001201726650001301738650001301751650001201764650001401776650001301790650002101803650002201824650003101846650001901877650001301896650000901909650001301918650001001931650000901941650001601950650001501966650001201981653001401993653001702007653001602024653002502040653002702065700001802092700002402110700002202134700003402156773013002190856008402320852000902404655001202413IND60121721720221119185513.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172172DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.6041422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHonfo, Fernande G.10aNutritional Composition of Shea Products and Chemical Properties of Shea Butter: A Review  ap. 673-686.  aIncreasing demand of shea products (kernels and butter) has led to the assessment of the state-of-the-art of these products. In this review, attention has been focused on macronutrients and micronutrients of pulp, kernels, and butter of shea tree and also the physicochemical properties of shea butter. Surveying the literature revealed that the pulp is rich in vitamin C (196.1 mg/100 g); consumption of 50 g covers 332% and 98% of the recommended daily intake (RDI) of children (4–8 years old) and pregnant women, respectively. The kernels contain a high level of fat (17.4–59.1 g/100 g dry weight). Fat extraction is mainly done by traditional methods that involve roasting and pressing of the kernels, churning the obtained liquid with water, boiling, sieving, and cooling. The fat (butter) is used in food preparation and medicinal and cosmetics industries. Its biochemical properties indicate some antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Large variations are observed in the reported values for the composition of shea products. Recommendations for future research are presented to improve the quality and the shelf-life of the butter. In addition, more attention should be given to the accuracy and precision in experimental analyses to obtain more reliable information about biological variation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVitellaria paradoxa 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aboiling 3achildren 3achurning 3acooling 3acosmetics 3aindustry 3anutrient content 3anutrition science 3aphysicochemical properties 3apregnant women 3apressing 3apulp 3aroasting 3aseeds 3ashea 3ashea butter 3ashelf life 3asieving 0aShea pulp 0ashea kernels 0ashea butter 0anutrient composition 0aantioxidant properties1 aAkissoe, Noel1 aLinnemann, Anita R.1 aSoumanou, Mohamed1 aVan Boekel, Martinus A.

Because of the distinct prominence of buffalo as a dairy animal, the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize GDF9 cDNA using orthologous primers based on the bovine GDF9 sequence. GDF9 transcripts were found to be expressed in oocytes irrespective of their follicular origin, and shared a single transcription start site (TSS) at –57 base pairs (bp) upstream of ATG. Assignment of the TSS is consistent with the presence of a TATA element at –23 of the TSS mapped in this study. Localization of a buffalo-specific minimal promoter within 320 bp upstream of ATG was consolidated by identification of an E-box element at –113bp. Presence of putative transcription factor binding sites and other cis regulatory elements were analyzed at ~5 kb upstream of TSS. Various germ cell-specific cis-acting regulatory elements (BNCF, BRNF, NR2F, SORY, Foxh1, OCT1, LHXF etc.) have been identified in the 5′ flanking region of the buffalo GDF9 gene, including NOBOX DNA binding elements and consensuses E-boxes (CANNTG). Presence of two conserved E-boxes found on buffalo sequence at –520 and –718 positions deserves attention in view of its sequence deviation from other species. Two NOBOX binding elements (NBE) were detected at the –3471 and –203 positions. The fall of the NBE within the putative minimal promoter territory of buffalo GDF9 and its unique non-core binding sequence could have a possible role in the control of the core promoter activity.  aPublisher supplied data 3abinding sites 3abuffaloes 3acattle 3acomplementary DNA 3adairy animals 3agenes 3aoocytes 3aregulatory sequences 3atranscription factors 0aBuffalo 0aGDF9 0aOocytes 0aTranscription factors 0aTSS1 aRajput, S.1 aRaghav, S.1 aKumar, P.1 aVerma, A.1 aJain, A.1 aJain, T.1 aSingh, D.1 aDe, S.1 aGoswami, S.L.1 aDatta, T.K.0 tZygote.g2013 May, v. 21, no. 2 p.115-124dCambridge University PresswJournal:6292x1469-87307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S09671994110007123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03170naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245012800165300001600293520192000309592002802229650001302257650001302270650000802283650001802291650001202309650001902321650002502340651001502365653002802380653002202408653001602430653002202446653002302468653002602491653001702517653001102534700001702545773009602562856008102658852000902739655001202748IND60545054220221119195341.0160901e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054505422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, Hyangsun10aTide-corrected flow velocity and mass balance of Campbell Glacier Tongue, East Antarctica, derived from interferometric SAR  ap. 180-192.  aAccurate measurement of ice-flow velocity of floating glaciers is required to estimate ice mass balance from volume flux thinning/thickening, basal melting/freezing, and surface accumulation/ablation. We derived a tide-corrected ice velocity map and mass budget of Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in East Antarctica by using 14 COSMO-SkyMed one-day tandem differential interferometric SAR (DInSAR) pairs obtained from January to November 2011. The vertical tidal deflection of CGT was estimated and removed from the DInSAR images by using a tide deflection ratio map generated by double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) method. We then generated averaged ice-flow velocity (v map) and its standard deviation (σv map). Ice-flow velocity increased from the upper part of the grounding line (~0.20md−1) to the seaward edge of CGT (~0.67md−1) with σv less than ~0.04md−1 in the main stream of CGT. The eastern part of CGT flows slower than the western part because it is grounded along the flow line and thus experiences severe basal drag. Flux mass balance (FMB), i.e., ice thickness change by volume flux divergence, of CGT was obtained by combining the v map and an ice thickness value of 340±18m estimated by the ICESat GLAS data. We used mass conservation assumption in which total mass balance (TMB, −6.29±1.37ma−1 observed by ICESat GLAS data) is attributed to FMB, basal mass balance (BMB) and surface mass balance (SMB, 0.24±0.02ma−1). Mass loss in the freely floating zone of CGT is mainly caused by basal melting (BMB=−144.5±39.9Mta−1) while thinning by volume flux (FMB=−67.2±8.9Mta−1) is relatively small. In the hinge zone of CGT, mass change is contributed to FMB of −147.3±25.2Mta−1 and BMB of 15.3±39.8Mta−1. However, basal freezing derived for the hinge zone may be erroneous as a result of the constant ice thickness assumption extrapolated from the freely floating zone.  aPublisher supplied data 3afreezing 3aglaciers 3aice 3amass transfer 3amelting 3aremote sensing 3astatistical analysis 3aAntarctica 0aCampbell Glacier Tongue 0aIce-flow velocity 0aMass budget 0aFlux mass balance 0aBasal mass balance 0aTide deflection ratio 0aCOSMO-SkyMed 0aDInSAR1 aLee, Hoonyol0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Apr., v. 160 p.180-192dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03185naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245013100162300002000293500001900313520150800332592002801840650001501868650002201883650001301905650001101918650001301929650001401942650002301956650002101979650002202000650001102022650002602033650002902059650001302088650001402101650001902115650001302134650001302147700001402160700001602174700001902190700001702209700001902226700001402245700001502259700001502274700005602289700005602345773014202401856007902543852000902622655001202631IND60710995220221117203058.0200915e20200804xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099522DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.est.0c008862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMei, Xiaojie10aEfficient SO₂ Removal and Highly Synergistic H₂O₂ Production Based on a Novel Dual-Function Photoelectrocatalytic System  ap. 11515-11525.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe direct conversion of SO₂ to SO₃ is rather difficult for flue gas desulfurization due to its inert dynamic with high reaction activation energy, and the absorption by wet limestone-gypsum also needs the forced oxidation of O₂ to oxidize sulfite to sulfate, which is necessary for additional aeration. Here, we propose a method to remove SO₂ with highly synergistic H₂O₂ production based on a novel dual-function photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) system in which the jointed spontaneous reaction of desulfurization and H₂O₂ production was integrated instead of nonspontaneous reaction of O₂ to H₂O₂. SO₂ was absorbed by alkali liquor then oxidized quickly into SO₄²– by a nanorod α-Fe₂O₃ photoanode, which possessed high alkali corrosion resistance and electron transport properties. H₂O₂ was produced simultaneously in the cathode chamber on a gas diffusion electrode and was remarkably boosted by the conversion reaction of SO₃²– to SO₄²– in the anode chamber in which the released chemical energy was effectively used to increase H₂O₂. The photocurrent density increased by 40% up to 1.2 mA·cm–², and the H₂O₂ evolution rate achieved 58.8 μmol·L–¹·h–¹·cm–² with the synergistic treatment of SO₂, which is about five times than that without SO₂. This proposed PEC cell system offers a cost-effective and environmental-benign approach for dual purpose of flue gas desulfurization and simultaneous high-valued H₂O₂ production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aactivation energy 3aaeration 3aanodes 3acathodes 3acorrosion 3acost effectiveness 3aelectric current 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy 3aenvironmental science 3aflue gas desulfurization 3ananorods 3aoxidation 3aphotocatalysis 3asulfates 3asulfites1 aBai, Jing1 aChen, Shuai1 aZhou, Mengyang1 aJiang, Panyu1 aZhou, Changhui1 aFang, Fei1 aZhang, Yan1 aLi, Jinhua1 aLong, Mingce1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5168-83301 aZhou, Baoxue1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9691-31190 tEnvironmental science & technology.g2020 Aug. 04, v. 54, no. 18 p.11515-11525dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23339x1520-58517nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c008863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245010700167300001600274520117200290592002801462650002401490650001301514650001501527650001501542650002301557650001801580650001901598650002801617650002201645650001401667650001801681650001601699650002001715650001401735653003601749653002401785653002001809653003001829653003201859653002301891700001901914773013001933856008402063852000902147655001202156IND60121721920221119185453.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172192DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.6052312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFu, Ling-Lin10aMicrobial Source Tracking: A Tool for Identifying Sources of Microbial Contamination in the Food Chain  ap. 699-707.  aThe ability to trace fecal indicators and food-borne pathogens to the point of origin has major ramifications for food industry, food regulatory agencies, and public health. Such information would enable food producers and processors to better understand sources of contamination and thereby take corrective actions to prevent transmission. Microbial source tracking (MST), which currently is largely focused on determining sources of fecal contamination in waterways, is also providing the scientific community tools for tracking both fecal bacteria and food-borne pathogens contamination in the food chain. Approaches to MST are commonly classified as library-dependent methods (LDMs) or library-independent methods (LIMs). These tools will have widespread applications, including the use for regulatory compliance, pollution remediation, and risk assessment. These tools will reduce the incidence of illness associated with food and water. Our aim in this review is to highlight the use of molecular MST methods in application to understanding the source and transmission of food-borne pathogens. Moreover, the future directions of MST research are also discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapplication methods 3abacteria 3acompliance 3afood chain 3afood contamination 3afood industry 3afood pathogens 3amicrobial contamination 3anutrition science 3apollution 3apublic health 3aremediation 3arisk assessment 3awaterways 0aMicrobial source tracking (MST) 0afood-borne pathogen 0afecal pollution 0alibrary-dependent methods 0alibrary-independent methods 0aindicator bacteria1 aLi, Jian Rong,0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 6 p.699-707dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.6052313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014900170300001800319520169400337592002802031650001602059650001702075650001302092650002502105650001702130650002302147650001102170650002202181650001502203650001502218650002402233650001402257650001502271650001302286650002102299650002402320650001502344650001302359700006102372700002202433700006202455700005802517700005902575773011802634856008302752852000902835655001202844IND60608881020221122033309.0180814e20180716xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060888102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.biochem.8b006902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSatō, Shūsuke,10aBiochemical and Structural Analysis of FomD That Catalyzes the Hydrolysis of Cytidylyl (S)-2-Hydroxypropylphosphonate in Fosfomycin Biosynthesis  ap. 4858-4866.  aIn fosfomycin biosynthesis, the hydrolysis of cytidylyl (S)-2-hydroxypropylphosphonate [(S)-HPP-CMP] to afford (S)-HPP is the only uncharacterized step. Because FomD is an uncharacterized protein with a DUF402 domain that is encoded in the fosfomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, FomD was hypothesized to be responsible for this reaction. In this study, FomD was found to hydrolyze (S)-HPP-CMP to give (S)-HPP and CMP efficiently in the presence of Mn²⁺ or Co²⁺. FomD also hydrolyzed cytidylyl 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (HEP-CMP), which is a biosynthetic intermediate before C-methylation. The kcₐₜ/KM value of FomD with (S)-HPP-CMP was 10-fold greater than that with HEP-CMP, suggesting that FomD hydrolyzes (S)-HPP-CMP rather than HEP-CMP in bacteria. The crystal structure of FomD showed that this protein adopts a barrel-like fold, which consists of a large twisted antiparallel β-sheet. This is a key structural feature of the DUF402 domain-containing proteins. Two metal cations are located between the FomD barrel and the two α-helices at the C-terminus and serve to presumably activate the phosphonate group of substrates for hydrolysis. Docking simulations with (S)-HPP-CMP suggested that the methyl group at the C2 position of the HPP moiety is recognized by a hydrophobic interaction with Trp68. Further mutational analysis suggested that a conserved Tyr107 among the DUF402 domain family of proteins activates a water molecule to promote nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom of the phosphonate moiety. These findings provide mechanistic insights into the FomD reaction and lead to a complete understanding of the fosfomycin biosynthetic pathway in Streptomyces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLewis bases 3aStreptomyces 3abacteria 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acobalt 3acrystal structure 3afosfomycin 3ahydrolysis 3ahydrophobic bonding 3amanganese 3ametal ions 3amoieties 3amultigene family 3amutational analysis 3aphosphorus 3aproteins1 aMiyanaga, Akimasa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2219-60511 aKim, Seung-young,1 aKuzuyama, Tomohisa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7221-58581 aKudo, Fumitaka1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4788-00631 aEguchi, Tadashi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7830-71040 tBiochemistry.g2018 July 16, v. 57, no. 32 p.4858-4866dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19162x1520-49957nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.biochem.8b006903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02875naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001700155245012000172300001400292520138900306592002801695650002801723650001601751650001901767650002201786650002301808650001401831650002101845650001101866650002901877650001201906650001301918650000901931650001301940650001401953653002801967653001101995653001802006653003402024653002002058700002102078700001702099700001902116700001902135773012802154856009002282852000902372655001202381IND60541129020221122004305.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.07.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJun, Jin Woo10aEating oysters without risk of vibriosis: Application of a bacteriophage against Vibrio parahaemolyticus in oysters  ap. 31-35.  aVibrio parahaemolyticus is a major cause of foodborne illness and related with the consumption of raw contaminated seafood, especially oysters. To evaluate the effectiveness of various applications of a bacteriophage (phage), pVp-1, against a multiple-antibiotic-resistant V. parahaemolyticus pandemic strain (CRS 09-17), we designed artificial contamination models that are most likely to be encountered during oyster processing. When live oysters were treated with bath immersion with pVp-1 after CRS 09-17 challenge, the growth of bacterial strain was significantly reduced. After 72h of phage application with bath immersion, bacterial growth reduction was observed to be 8.9×106CFU/ml (control group) to 1.4×10CFU/ml (treatment group). When pVp-1 was surface-applied on the flesh of oysters after CRS 09-17 inoculation, bacterial growth was properly inhibited. After 12h of phage application on the surface of oysters, bacterial growth inhibition was revealed to be 1.44×106CFU/ml (control group) to 1.94CFU/ml (treatment group). This is the first report, to the best of our knowledge, of oyster surface-application of a phage against a multiple-antibiotic-resistant V. parahaemolyticus pandemic strain, and our successful phage application to various situations emphasizes the potential use of the phage to avoid V. parahaemolyticus infection from aquaculture to consumption.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio parahaemolyticus 3aaquaculture 3abacteriophages 3afoodborne illness 3agrowth retardation 3aingestion 3amicrobial growth 3amodels 3amultiple drug resistance 3aoysters 3apandemic 3arisk 3aseafoods 3avibriosis 0aVibrio parahaemolyticus 0aOyster 0aBacteriophage 0aMultiple-antibiotic-resistant 0aPandemic strain1 aKim, Hyoun Joong1 aYun, Sae Kil1 aChai, Ji Young1 aPark, Se Chang0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 188 p.31-35dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245015800160300001800318520074600336592002801082650002301110650002701133650001601160650001501176650002001191650002501211650002001236650002101256650002601277650002201303650001501325650001401340650001301354700002101367700001501388700002101403700002001424700002501444700002401469700002301493773012501516856007401641852000901715655001201724IND60644805920221120091228.0190522e20190520xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064480592DNAL7 a10.1039/c9gc00428a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShafiee, Behnaz10aMetal-free and benign approach for the synthesis of dihydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[c]chromene-8,4′-oxazole]-5′,6(7H)-dione scaffolds as masked amino acids  ap. 2656-2661.  aAn eco-friendly, straightforward, and three-component condensation/cascade reaction of 4-hydroxycoumarins and (Z)-azlactones to construct diversified dihydro-5′H-spiro[benzo[c]chromene-8,4′-oxazole]-5′,6(7H)-diones as new masked amino acid derivatives has been developed with high to excellent yields and regio- and diastereoselectivity.

This study included 131 barren and 11 fertile (control) ewes and 94 barren and 9 fertile (control) goats. Animals were examined gynecologically for reproductive soundness. The animals were bled, and their serum was harvested and assayed for manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), estrogen (E2), and progesterone (P4) levels. The results showed that genital affections were associated with significant changes in serum Se (P=0.001), Fe (P=0.008), and Zn (P=0.01) levels in ewes, as well as Mn (P=0.01) levels in goats. Ewes and goats with cystic ovaries had higher serum Se, Fe, and Zn levels (P=0.0001) than ewes with uterine affections, ovarian inactivity, and controls. Ovarian inactivity was linked to low Se levels in ewes and low Se and Zn levels in goats (P=0.05). Ewes and goats with estrogen-dominant reproductive disorders had higher Se (P=0.01), Fe (P=0.03), and Zn (P=0.01) compared with the control group. Se (P=0.02) and Zn (P=0.05) were lower in ewes and goats affected with P4-dominant genital disorders compared with the control group. It can be concluded that the reproductive disorders are associated with changes in the level of trace elements in blood of ewes and goats. There is a reciprocal relationship between the levels of estrogen and progesterone with those of the trace elements in serum of ewes and goats.  aPublisher supplied data  aQ 1-1-2019 cavm 9871cQassim University 3ablood serum 3aestrogens 3airon 3amanganese 3aprogesterone 3aselenium 3aveterinary medicine 3azinc1 aAli, Ahmed1 aAlmundarij, Tariq1 aAbd-Elmoniem, Essam1 aAlhassun, Tamim1 aZeitoun, Moustafa0 tVeterinary medicine international.g2022 Mar. 16, v. 2022dHindawiwJournal:21537x2042-00487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/85250893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03037naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003100140245016200171300001400333500002000347520138800367592002801755596005201783596009401835650001401929650002801943650002001971650001501991650001602006650002402022650003002046650002402076650001502100650002702115650001602142650001202158650001102170650001002181650001502191650000902206650001802215700003002233700003002263700002202293700002702315773010502342856007502447852000902522655001202531IND60787219020221118144134.0220808e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078721902DNAL7 a10.1002/lipd.123272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Nieuwenhove, Carina P.10aJacaranda oil administration improves serum biomarkers and bioavailability of bioactive conjugated fatty acids, and alters fatty acid profile of mice tissues  ap. 33-44.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aJacaric acid, a conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA) present in jacaranda oil (JO), is considered a potent anticarcinogenic agent. Several studies have focused on its biological effects, but the metabolism once consumed is not clear yet. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of two different daily doses of JO on serum parameters and fatty acid (FA) profile of mice tissues after 4 weeks of feeding. No significant changes on body weight gain, food intake, or tissue weight were determined after 0.7 or 2 ml/kg of JO supplementation compared to control animals. Significantly lower blood low‐density lipoproteins‐cholesterol (20 mg/dl) and glucose (~147–148 mg/dl) levels were detected in both oil‐treated groups compared to control (31.2 and 165 mg/dl, respectively). Moreover, jacaric acid was partially converted into cis9, trans11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and thus further incorporated into tissues. Liver evidenced the highest total conjugated fatty acid content (1.1%–2.2%), followed by epididymal (0.7%–1.9%) and mesenteric (1.4%–1.8%) fat. Lower saturated and higher unsaturated fatty acid content was detected in both oil‐treated groups compared to control. Our results support the safety of JO and its potential application with a functional or nutraceutical propose, by increasing human CLNA consumption and further availability of CLA.  aPublisher supplied data  aPIUNT 26/G634cUniversidad Nacional de Tucumán  aPRÉSTAMO BID PICT 2019‐1697cAgencia Nacional de Promoción Científica y Tecnológica 3aJacaranda 3aanticarcinogenic agents 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3ablood serum 3abody weight changes 3aconjugated linolenic acid 3adietary supplements 3aepididymis 3afatty acid composition 3afood intake 3aglucose 3ahumans 3aliver 3ametabolism 3aoils 3atissue weight1 adel Huerto Moyano, Andrea1 aVan Nieuwenhove, Guido A.1 aMolina, Verónica1 aLuna Pizarro, Patricia0 tLipids.g2022 Jan., v. 57, no. 1 p.33-44dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl46279x0024-42017nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/lipd.123273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02458naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245009200164300001800256520105800274592002801332596006501360596006201425596005901487650002501546650002301571650001601594650002001610650001201630650002001642650002201662650001501684650001301699700001701712700001401729700001701743700001801760700001801778773014801796856008301944852000902027655001202036IND60783245320221121054739.0220719e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078324532DNAL7 a10.1007/s00216-022-04149-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuxin, Xing10aMetal-doped carbon dots as peroxidase mimic for hydrogen peroxide and glucose detection  ap. 5857-5867.  aCarbon dots (CDs) have several superior characteristics including sufficient carbon sources, easy preparation, no toxicity, and high catalytic efficiency as a new kind of nanozyme. Herein, Ce-doped carbon dots (Ce-CDs), Cr-doped carbon dots (Cr-CDs), Cu-doped carbon dots (Cu-CDs), Fe-doped carbon dots (Fe-CDs), Mn-doped carbon dots (Mn-CDs), and non-metal-doped carbon dots (0-CDs) were synthesized to explore the detection of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and glucose as peroxidase mimic. The prepared CDs could efficiently oxidize the colorless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) into blue oxTMB in the presence of H₂O₂. After adding glucose oxidase (GOD) to the CDs/TMB system, a colorimetric method for glucose detection was developed. The results show that Fe-CDs possess the highest catalytic activity. When using Fe-CDs as peroxidase mimetics, the detection limit of this assay for glucose was 0.029 mmol L⁻¹. This successfully provides a sensitive and selective colorimetric method for hydrogen peroxide and glucose determination.  aPublisher supplied data  aZR2020BM063cNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province  ats201511027cTaishan Scholar Program of Shandong Province  a21804075cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aanalytical chemistry 3acatalytic activity 3acolorimetry 3adetection limit 3aglucose 3aglucose oxidase 3ahydrogen peroxide 3aperoxidase 3atoxicity1 aLaipeng, Sun1 aKang, Liu1 aHaipeng, Shi1 aZonghua, Wang1 aWenjing, Wang0 tAnalytical and bioanalytical chemistry.g2022 Aug., v. 414, no. 19 p.5857-5867dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl3870029x1618-26427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-04149-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03600naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245018900167300001600356520155900372592002801931650001601959650001501975650001601990650001702006650001602023650002602039650002002065650001302085650001602098650001602114650001402130650002302144650001302167650001902180650001802199650001902217650001402236650001802250650001902268650001102287650000902298650003902307650003302346650001502379650003302394650001502427650001602442650001802458650001402476650001002490650001702500653001702517653002902534653002602563653001402589653003602603653004802639700001402687700001702701773010102718856008602819852000902905655001202914IND60611917620221118074304.0200509e201902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061191762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.08.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Wenmeng10aEffects of wheat gluten modified by deamidation-heating with three different acids on the microstructure of model oil-in-water emulsion and rheological–physical property of ice cream  ap. 679-690.  aA by-product of wheat wet processing, wheat gluten (WG) exhibits low solubility, which restricts its application as an emulsifier and a stabilizer in oil-in-water emulsions. WG modified by acetic acid, tartaric acid, and citric acid deamidation combined with heat treatment, can improve the solubility, surface hydrophobicity, as well as the emulsifying and foaming properties of the modified WGs (MWGs). The principal component analysis suggested the emulsifying and foaming properties of the citric acid-deamidation-heating WG (CDWG) were the highest. High-molecular-weight proteins and crosslinking of proteins were observed in the MWGs by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that the granules of the MWGs were more regular than those of WG. Model oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by MWGs could prevent oil droplets from coalescence, and the emulsion stabilized by CDWG was more stable and homogenous than the other emulsions. Positive correlations were observed between the substitution ratio of skim milk powder with MWGs and viscosity, as well as the G′ and G″ values of the ice cream mixes. All the mixes exhibited the non-Newtonian shear thinning flow behavior. Partial least squares discriminant analysis of the physicochemical and rheological properties of the ice cream samples indicated that C2 possessed the appropriate rheological properties and physical characteristics that could be used by a prototype for the further development of ice cream prepared using CDWG.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetic acid 3abyproducts 3acitric acid 3acrosslinking 3adeamidation 3adiscriminant analysis 3adried skim milk 3adroplets 3aemulsifiers 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3afoaming properties 3agranules 3aheat treatment 3ahydrocolloids 3ahydrophobicity 3aice cream 3aleast squares 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aoils 3apolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 3aprincipal component analysis 3aprototypes 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asolubility 3astabilizers 3atartaric acid 3aviscosity 3awheat 3awheat gluten 0aWheat gluten 0aAcid-deamidation-heating 0aOil-in-water emulsion 0aIce cream 0aRheological-physical properties 0aPartial least squares discriminant analysis1 aZhao, Wei1 aYang, Ruijin0 tFood hydrocolloids.g2019 Feb., v. 87 p.679-690dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46643x0268-005X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodhyd.2018.08.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02069naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100005300149245008100202300001600283520092400299592002801223650000901251650001901260650000901279650000901288650001301297650001801310650001501328650001501343650001101358650003701369650001501406700001801421700002001439773014401459856008301603852000901686655001201695IND60608881220221122043811.0180814e20180608xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060888122DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.8b002592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Lan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7348-465710aVisualization of Silver Nanoparticle Formation on Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron  ap. 520-525.  aInstant reactions of Ag(I) on nanoscale zero-valent iron (nZVI) were visualized with spherical-aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM) integrated with X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. In particular, the rapid growth of pure silver nanoparticles on nZVI was captured with high-resolution STEM imaging. Dissolved silver ions are attracted to the negatively charged iron nanoparticles and quickly reduced to metallic silver on the defective and electron-rich iron surface. Small (∼1–2 nm) and highly reactive silver nanoparticles are formed along the long chains of nZVI. Results reinforce the applications of nZVI for rapid enrichment, complete separation, and recovery of precious metals such as Au and Ag from trace-level sources such as wastewater and demonstrate the potential of analytical electron microscopy for mapping pollutant reactions on the surface of nanoparticles.  aPublisher supplied data 3agold 3aimage analysis 3aions 3airon 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3ananosilver 3apollutants 3asilver 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awastewater1 aTang, Chenliu1 aZhang, Wei-xian0 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2018 June 08, v. 5, no. 8 p.520-525dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b002593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01707naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245006600176300001600242520059200258592002800850650002500878650001700903650002200920650002800942650001400970650001000984650001000994653001801004653000901022653002401031653000901055700002201064700002401086773013001110856008401240852000901324655001201333IND60121722220221119185847.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172222DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.6069292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCygankiewicz, Adam I.10aMolecular Basis of Taste Sense: Involvement of GPCR Receptors  ap. 771-780.  aTaste perception is one of the senses crucial for many organisms.

This poorly understood variability poses a challenge to accurately determining the BrC climate effect. Here, we present a framework to explain the variability in BrC k. We hypothesize that a fraction of BrC is composed of black-carbon (BC) precursors whose transformation to BC is not complete, and that there is a continuum of light-absorption properties along which BC and BrC lie. To test this hypothesis, we performed controlled-combustion experiments using benzene and toluene. By systematically varying the combustion conditions, we isolated BrC components along the brown–black continuum progressing from light (k = 0.004 at 550 nm) to dark (k = 0.25 at 550 nm). Using laser-desorption-ionization mass spectrometry and thermodenuder measurements, we show that the BrC progression from light to dark is associated with an increase in molecular size and decrease in volatility. The darkest BrC has molecular sizes of several 1000 Da, is refractory, and is optically more similar to BC than the lighter BrC, blurring the lines between the optical properties of BrC and BC.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerosols 3abenzene 3acarbon 3aclimate 3acombustion 3amass spectrometry 3amolecular weight 3arefractive index 3atoluene1 aCheng, Zezhen1 aAtwi, Khairallah0 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2018 July 02, v. 5, no. 8 p.508-513dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b003053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245012100176300001600297520103800313592002801351650002501379650003101404650002001435650002001455650001701475650001701492650001501509650001101524650002201535650001401557653002501571653001701596653002701613653001701640653001801657653001401675653002101689653002001710700001901730773013001749856008401879852000901963655001201972IND60121722320221119185657.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172232DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.6075192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHammer, Kimberly D.P.10aEvidence for Contributions of Interactions of Constituents to the Anti-Inflammatory Activity of Hypericum Perforatum  ap. 781-789.  aHypericum perforatum (Hp) extracts contain many different classes of constituents including flavonoids and biflavonoids, phloroglucinols, naphthodianthrones, caffeic acid derivatives, and unknown and/or unidentified compounds. Many constituents may be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity of Hp including quercetin and derivatives, hyperforin, pseudohypericin, and amentoflavone. In line with antidepressant data, it appears that the interactions of constituents may be important for the anti-inflammatory activity of Hp. Interactions of constituents, tested in bioavailability models, may explain why synergistic mechanisms have been found to be important for antidepressant and antiproliferative bioactivities. This review highlights the relationship among individual constituents and the anti-inflammatory activity of Hp extracts and proposes that interactions of constituents may be important for the anti-inflammatory activity of botanical extracts, although the exact mechanisms of the interactions are still unclear.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHypericum perforatum 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantidepressants 3abioavailability 3acaffeic acid 3afood science 3ahyperforin 3amodels 3anutrition science 3aquercetin 0aHypericum perforatum 0ainteractions 0abioactive constituents 0ainflammation 0aamentoflavone 0aquercetin 0achlorogenic acid 0apseudohypericin1 aBirt, Diane F.0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 6 p.781-789dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.6075193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04180naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002900155245013500184300001400319520257800333592002802911650002702939650001702966650001902983650001003002650001303012650002603025650001803051650002503069650002403094650002103118650001003139650000703149650002303156650001503179650002003194650001603214650002103230650001603251653003103267653002603298653001903324653002703343700005903370700001803429773012803447856009003575852000903665655001203674IND60541129520221122025138.0190318e20141001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054112952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.07.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aØstergaard, Nina Bjerre10aModelling the effect of lactic acid bacteria from starter- and aroma culture on growth of Listeria monocytogenes in cottage cheese  ap. 15-25.  aFour mathematical models were developed and validated for simultaneous growth of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria from added cultures and Listeria monocytogenes, during chilled storage of cottage cheese with fresh- or cultured cream dressing. The mathematical models include the effect of temperature, pH, NaCl, lactic- and sorbic acid and the interaction between these environmental factors. Growth models were developed by combining new and existing cardinal parameter values. Subsequently, the reference growth rate parameters (μref at 25°C) were fitted to a total of 52 growth rates from cottage cheese to improve model performance. The inhibiting effect of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria from added cultures on growth of L. monocytogenes was efficiently modelled using the Jameson approach. The new models appropriately predicted the maximum population density of L. monocytogenes in cottage cheese. The developed models were successfully validated by using 25 growth rates for L. monocytogenes, 17 growth rates for lactic acid bacteria and a total of 26 growth curves for simultaneous growth of L. monocytogenes and lactic acid bacteria in cottage cheese. These data were used in combination with bias- and accuracy factors and with the concept of acceptable simulation zone. Evaluation of predicted growth rates of L. monocytogenes in cottage cheese with fresh- or cultured cream dressing resulted in bias-factors (Bf) of 1.07–1.10 with corresponding accuracy factor (Af) values of 1.11 to 1.22. Lactic acid bacteria from added starter culture were on average predicted to grow 16% faster than observed (Bf of 1.16 and Af of 1.32) and growth of the diacetyl producing aroma culture was on average predicted 9% slower than observed (Bf of 0.91 and Af of 1.17). The acceptable simulation zone method showed the new models to successfully predict maximum population density of L. monocytogenes when growing together with lactic acid bacteria in cottage cheese. 11 of 13 simulations of L. monocytogenes growth were within the acceptable simulation zone, which demonstrated good performance of the empirical inter-bacterial interaction model. The new set of models can be used to predict simultaneous growth of mesophilic lactic acid bacteria and L. monocytogenes in cottage cheese during chilled storage at constant and dynamic temperatures. The applied methodology is likely to be applicable for safety prediction of other types of fermented and unripened dairy products where inhibition by lactic acid bacteria is important for growth of pathogenic microorganisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aListeria monocytogenes 3acold storage 3acottage cheese 3acream 3adiacetyl 3aenvironmental factors 3agrowth models 3alactic acid bacteria 3amathematical models 3amodel validation 3aodors 3apH 3apopulation density 3aprediction 3asodium chloride 3asorbic acid 3astarter cultures 3atemperature 0aFermented unripened cheese 0aMicrobial interaction 0aJameson effect 0aFood safety prediction1 aEklöw, Annelie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5570-26381 aDalgaard, Paw0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Oct. 01, v. 188 p.15-25dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.07.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03999naa a2200733 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002400150245004500174300001600219520204700235592002802282650001702310650001702327650001502344650001202359650001502371650002502386650001802411650001202429650001002441650002002451650001002471650002102481650001102502650001302513650001602526650000902542650001402551650001202565650001302577650001402590650002202604650001302626650001302639650000902652650001402661650001002675650001602685650001702701650001102718651001402729651001802743651001602761651001302777651002002790653001402810653002502824653001802849653001802867653003102885653002402916653001902940700002302959700002602982700002203008773013003030856008403160852000903244655001203253IND60121722520221119185557.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012172252DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.6085862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharif, Mian Kamran10aRice Bran: A Novel Functional Ingredient  ap. 807-816.  aRice (Oryza sativa) is the most important staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in East and South Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and the West Indies. It provides more than one fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by the human. It is the second leading cereal crop and staple food of half of the world's population. It is grown in at least 114 countries with global production of 645 million tons; share of Asian farmers is about 90% of the total produce. Rice bran, brown outer layer of rice kernel, is mainly composed of pericarp, aleurone, subaleurone layer, and germ. It contains appreciable quantities of nutrients like protein, fat, and dietary fiber. Furthermore, it contains substantial amount of minerals like K, Ca, Mg, and Fe. Presence of antioxidants like tocopherols, tocotrienols, and γ-oryzanol also brighten prospects of rice bran utilization for humans as functional ingredient to mitigate the life-threatening disorders. Moreover, in the developing countries, budding dilemma of food crisis, arising due to lower crop yields and escalating population, needs to utilize each pent of available resources. To provide enough food to all people, there is the holistic approach of using the by-products generated during food processing and preparations. Rice is being processed in well-established industry, but the major apprehension is the utilization of its by-products; rice bran (5–8%) and polishing (2–3%) that are going as waste. Rice processing or milling produces several streams of materials including milled rice, bran, and husk. In developing countries, rice bran is considered as a by-product of the milling process and commonly used in animal feed or discarded as a waste. The potential of producing rice bran at the global level is 29.3 million tons annually, whereas the share of Pakistan is worked out to be 0.5 million tons. In present paper, attempt has been made to highlight the significance of these valuable but neglected ingredients under various headings.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3aantioxidants 3abyproducts 3acalcium 3acrop yield 3adeveloping countries 3adietary fiber 3afarmers 3afeeds 3afood processing 3ahulls 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aindustry 3aingredients 3airon 3amagnesium 3amilling 3aminerals 3anutrients 3anutrition science 3aoryzanol 3apericarp 3arice 3arice bran 3aseeds 3atocopherols 3atocotrienols 3awastes 3aCaribbean 3aLatin America 3aMiddle East 3aPakistan 3aSouth East Asia 0aRice bran 0ahypercholesterolemia 0ahyperglycemia 0adietary fiber 0arice bran protein isolates 0arice bran oil (RBO) 0abaked products1 aButt, Masood Sadiq1 aAnjum, Faqir Muhammad1 aKhan, Saima Hafiz0 tCritical reviews in food science and nutrition.g2014 Jan. 1, v. 54, no. 6 p.807-816dTaylor & Francis Groupx1549-78527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2011.6085863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02385naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245007900166300001600245520108000261592002801341650000801369650001501377650003601392650002001428650002001448650001301468650000901481650001901490650001701509650001801526650001201544650001701556650002401573650001101597700001601608700001901624700005601643700001601699773014401715856008301859852000901942655001201951IND60608881720221122043702.0180814e20180718xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060888172DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.estlett.8b003212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiuxiu10aCircular Dichroism-Active Interactions between Fipronil and Neuronal Cells  ap. 500-507.  aChemicals exert harmful effects on target species and cause DNA damage after their exposure. Here, Au–Ag heterodimers have been fabricated with conjugated molecules such as DNA, cell-penetrating peptide, and thiolated polyethylene glycol to investigate the intracellular interactions between fipronil and neuron cells. The hybridized heterodimer nanoparticles show a strong plasmonic circular dichroism signal and were used for the intracellular detection of fipronil-induced 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and the limit of detection for 8-OHdG was as low as 0.1 nM. More importantly, 8-OHdG could be visualized in cells with in situ cell imaging based on luminescence quenching via energy transfer. This method has been applied to measure the oxidative DNA damage caused by nonylphenol and alternariol in cells. All our results suggest that our chiroplasmonic platform is a promising and applicable method not only for detecting the 8-OHdG induced by fipronil in cells but also for assessing the capacity of chemicals to induce intracellular oxidative DNA damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA damage 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3adetection limit 3aenergy transfer 3afipronil 3agold 3aimage analysis 3aluminescence 3ananoparticles 3aneurons 3anonylphenols 3apolyethylene glycol 3asilver1 aXu, Liguang1 aHao, Changlong1 aXu, Chuanlai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5639-71021 aGuang, Hua,0 tEnvironmental science & technology letters.g2018 July 18, v. 5, no. 8 p.500-507dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23341x2328-89307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.estlett.8b003213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02155naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245013400173300001600307520113800323592002801461650001701489650001601506650002901522650002201551650001201573651001501585651001201600700002001612700002201632773008001654856008601734852000901820655001201829IND60084997020221118075951.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008499702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDallinger, David10aIntegration of intermittent renewable power supply using grid-connected vehicles – A 2030 case study for California and Germany  ap. 666-682.  aThis paper describes a method to characterize the fluctuating electricity generation of renewable energy sources (RESs) in a power system and compares the different parameters for California and Germany. Based on this method describing the fluctuation and residual load, the potential contribution of grid-connected vehicles to balancing generation from renewable energy sources is analyzed for a 2030 scenario using the agent-based simulation model PowerACE. The analysis reveals that integrating fluctuating RES is possible with less effort in California because of a higher correlation between RES generation and the load curve here. In addition, RES capacity factors are higher for California and therefore the ratio of installed capacity to peak load is lower. Germany, on the other hand, faces extreme residual load changes between periods with and without supply from RES. In both power system scenarios, grid-connected vehicles play an important role in reducing residual load fluctuation if smart charging is used. Uncontrolled charging or static time-of-use tariffs do not significantly improve the grid integration of RES.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aelectricity 3arenewable energy sources 3asimulation models 3atariffs 3aCalifornia 3aGermany1 aGerda, Schubert1 aWietschel, Martin0 tApplied energy.g2013 Apr., v. 104 p.666-682dElsevier Ltdx0306-26197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02432naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245013100212300001600343500001900359520114900378592002801527650002601555650001301581650001901594653001001613653002101623653003601644653000901680653000701689653000901696653001001705700002001715700001801735700002101753700002201774773014601796856008301942852000902025655001202034IND60672126220221118052704.0191214e20191210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067212622DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamamoto, Shinichiro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5888-474810aShort TRPM2 prevents the targeting of full-length TRPM2 to the surface transmembrane by hijacking to ER associated degradation  ap. 520-525.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMembrane proteins are targeted to the surface transmembrane after folding and assembling in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Misfolded- and unassembled-proteins are degraded by proteasomes following ubiquitination, termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) is an oxidative stress-sensitive channel. One of the TRPM2 splicing variants, short TRPM2 (TRPM2-S) having only the N-terminus and first two transmembrane domains, was reported to prevent full-length TRPM2 (TRPM2-L) activation. Although TRPM2-S interacts with TRPM2-L, the inhibitory mechanisms of TRPM2-S are unclear. We found that TRPM2-S prevents transmembrane expression of TRPM2-L by targeting ERAD. TRPM2-S expression was lower than that of TRPM2-L, and was increased by an ERAD inhibitor. TRPM2-S was not expressed at the transmembrane. This suggests that TRPM2-S is a substrate for ERAD. Upon the simultaneous expression of TRPM2-S, the transmembrane expression of TRPM2-L was attenuated and the poly-ubiquitination of TRPM2-L was facilitated. Our study may clarify why TRPM2-S inhibits oxidative stress-induced TRPM2-L activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aresearch 3aubiquitination 0aTRPM2 0aSplicing variant 0aProtein quality control systems 0aERAD 0aER 0aERAD 0aTRPM21 aIshii, Takahiro1 aMikami, Ryota1 aNumata, Tomohiro1 aShimizu, Shunichi0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2019 Dec. 10, v. 520, no. 3 p.520-525dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl46848x0006-291X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2019.10.0653Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03148naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006600151245012200217300001600339520158100355592002801936650001501964650001901979650002101998650001102019650002602030650001702056650002502073650001502098650001302113650001202126650001302138650001402151650002302165650001502188650002002203653001402223653001202237653002202249653002502271653002002296700002102316700001902337700002402356700002402380700002102404773011002425856008602535852000902621655001202630IND60569026120221119170716.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056902612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Annibale, Alessandra1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9841-867X10aDoes introduction of clover in an agricultural grassland affect the food base and functional diversity of Collembola?  ap. 165-176.  aIntroduction of legumes (i.e. white clover) in agricultural grasslands is a common practice to improve yields, but how this affects soil fauna populations, particularly mesofauna, is still poorly understood. We investigated taxonomical and functional differences of Collembola communities between plots with either perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), white clover (Trifolium repens L.) or a mixture of both in a Danish agricultural grassland 6 and 14 months after establishing the leys (September and May, respectively). Diet preferences were investigated via stable isotope analyses (SIA) of carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N). Collembolan abundance data were used to analyse morphological and ecological traits of the collected taxa and calculate functional diversity indices. Our stable isotope results show that root-derived resources made larger contributions to epedaphic and hemiedaphic species in the white clover than ryegrass plots. Changes in taxa specific density and traits distribution as a response to the C:N ratio of plant material, suggest that plant material quality was the main factor affecting the collembolan community, especially when comparing the two sampling occasions. Functional richness decreased under conditions of low quality material. In contrast to our hypothesis, population densities did not increase under mixture treatment and functional richness decreased. Our results suggest that habitat changes, via different plant composition, can affect some functional groups, having in turn effects on the functional diversity of the community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCollembola 3aLolium perenne 3aTrifolium repens 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3afood choices 3afunctional diversity 3agrasslands 3ahabitats 3alegumes 3anitrogen 3aorganisms 3apopulation density 3asoil fauna 3astable isotopes 0aMesofauna 0aLegumes 0aFunctional traits 0aFunctional diversity 0aStable isotopes1 aSechi, Valentina1 aLarsen, Thomas1 aChristensen, Søren1 aKrogh, Paul Henning1 aEriksen, Jørgen0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2017 Sept., v. 112 p.165-176dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.05.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03570naa a2200649 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245011800166300001600284520170500300592002802005650000802033650001302041650001202054650000902066650001202075650001302087650002102100650001102121650002702132650001202159650001102171650002602182650002102208650001402229650001402243650001502257650002602272650001102298650001402309650002202323650002302345650001402368650000802382650001202390650001602402650001302418650000902431653002102440653002102461653002302482653001802505653001902523700001702542700001402559700002102573700005602594700005702650773010702707856008502814852000902899655001202908IND60635128320221116220023.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063512832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCapozzi, F.10aIndoor vs. outdoor airborne element array: A novel approach using moss bags to explore possible pollution sources  ap. 566-572.  aThis study investigated by the moss-bag approach the pattern of air dispersed elements in 12 coupled indoor/outdoor exposure sites, all located in urban and rural residential areas. The aims were to discriminate indoor vs. outdoor element composition in coupled exposure sites and find possible relation between moss elemental profile and specific characteristics of each exposure site.Elements were considered enriched when in 60% of the sites, post-exposure concentration exceeded pre-exposure concentration plus two folds the standard deviation. Of the 53 analyzed elements, 15 (As, B, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, V, Zn) were enriched in moss exposed outdoor, whereas a subset of 7 elements (As, B, Cr, Mo, Ni, Se, V) were enriched also in indoor moss samples. The cluster analysis of the sites based on all elements, clearly separated samples in two groups corresponding to mosses exposed indoor and outdoor, with the latter generally exceeding the first. Among outdoor sites, urban were most impacted than rural; whereas other factors (e.g., heating and cooking systems, building material, residence time and family life style) could affect element profile of indoor environments. Based on the indoor/outdoor ratio, As derived from outdoor and indoor sources, B, Mo and Se were enriched mostly in outdoor sites; Ni, Cr and V were specifically enriched in most indoor samples, supporting the presence of indoor emitting sources for these elements. A PCA of all indoor sites based on enriched elements and site characteristics showed that traffic affected indoor pollution in urban areas. The moss bag approach provided useful information for a global assessment of human exposure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abags 3acalcium 3achromium 3acluster analysis 3acobalt 3aconstruction materials 3acooking 3acopper 3aelemental composition 3afamily relations 3alifestyle 3amanganese 3amolybdenum 3amosses and liverworts 3anickel 3apollution 3aresidential areas 3astandard deviation 3astrontium 3atin 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3avanadium 3azinc 0aMoss transplants 0aElement profiles 0aIndoor air quality 0aAir pollution 0aHuman exposure1 aDi Palma, A.1 aAdamo, P.1 aSorrentino, M.C.1 aGiordano, S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0705-85501 aSpagnuolo, V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5021-68170 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.566-572dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03344naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100005500138245010900193300001800302500002000320520144700340592002801787596006401815596006801879650002301947650001801970650001501988650001202003650001102015650001702026650002102043650001602064650001702080650002202097650000902119650001102128650001902139650003002158650001902188650002002207650001702227650000902244651001002253700005802263700007702321700005902398700006402457700006702521773013302588856007202721852000902793655001202802IND60616594520221122203210.0181018e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061659452DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.30942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGil, Carlos1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9903-130310aAssessing soil contamination and temporal trends of heavy metal contents in greenhouses on semiarid land  ap. 3344-3354.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aInformation about the behavior and temporal evolution of heavy metals in agricultural soils is limited, particularly about greenhouse soils on semiarid lands, indeed it nonexistent. Western Almería (Southern Spain) is a semiarid land where some 30,000 ha are occupied by greenhouses with high productivity. As these greenhouses are fundamental to the socioeconomic development of this area, they should be maintained and well conserved. However, there are indications that long‐term intensive agriculture with considerable agrochemicals use can deteriorate soil quality, which in turn, would reduce productivity and food quality. This study was conducted to investigate soil contamination and the temporal trends of heavy metal concentrations in greenhouse soils of western Almería. Contamination level, availability, and sources of metals were evaluated by the extractable fraction percentage, by indices zinc equivalent, geoaccumulation, enrichment factor and pollution load, and by a correlation analysis between soil properties and metal contents. The results showed that the total contents of Cd, Cu, Ni, and Pb, and the available concentration of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, were significantly higher than background levels. Temporal patterns indicated that these elements accumulate in greenhouse soils. After more than 20 years of intensive agriculture, the available concentration of elements, and contamination, had clearly increased.  aPublisher supplied data  aAGL2011‐29382cSpanish Ministry of Science and Innovation  aCGL2013‐43675‐PcSpanish Ministry of Science and Innovation 3aagricultural soils 3aagrochemicals 3aarid lands 3acadmium 3acopper 3afood quality 3agreenhouse soils 3agreenhouses 3aheavy metals 3aintensive farming 3alead 3anickel 3apollution load 3asocioeconomic development 3asoil pollution 3asoil properties 3asoil quality 3azinc 3aSpain1 aBoluda, Rafael1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7682-758X1 aRodríguez Martín, José Antonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9158-95641 aGuzmán, Miguel1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5648-75541 aMoral, Fernando del,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8323-08501 aRamos‐Miras, Joaquín1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6194-71910 tLand degradation & development.g2018 Oct., v. 29, no. 10 p.3344-3354dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl54628x1085-32787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.30943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02926naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002900150245008900179300001600268520138600284592002801670650001801698650002501716650001301741650002301754650001401777650001001791650002701801650002801828650002801856650001801884650001501902650001301917653002801930653003301958653003301991653002102024653003502045653002002080700002402100700003302124700009802157773010702255856008502362852000902447655001202456IND60635128420221116220017.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063512842DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartín-de-Lucía, Idoia10aHyperbranched polymeric nanomaterials impair the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna  ap. 581-588.  aHyperbranched polymers are nanomaterials belonging to the class of dendritic architectures with increasing applications in many diverse fields. We studied the toxicity of two hyperbranched polymers to the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. A hyperbranched hydroxyl-terminated polyester and a commercial hyperbranched polyamidoamine, Helux-3316 were tested for the acute immobilization of daphnids, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione S-transferase. The effect for D. magna immobilization was higher for the hyperbranched polyamidoamine Helux-3316, which was attributed to the presence of primary amino groups on its surface. Following exposure to both hyperbranched polymers, a clear overproduction of reactive oxygen species took place accompanied by concentration-dependent enzymatic antioxidant response. Our results showed that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species activated antioxidant defence mechanisms and was responsible for the immobilization of daphnids exposed to both hyperbranched polymers. We showed evidence of the uptake of fluorescently labelled Helux-3316 that accumulated into the gastrointestinal tract of D. magna, and its removal via excretion within fecal pellets. This is the first work reporting the internalization of hyperbranched polymers in aquatic organisms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aantioxidant activity 3acatalase 3adefense mechanisms 3aexcretion 3afeces 3afreshwater crustaceans 3agastrointestinal system 3aglutathione transferase 3ananomaterials 3apolyesters 3atoxicity 0aHyperbranched polyester 0aHyperbranched polyamidoamine 0aDaphnia magna immobilization 0aOxidative stress 0aEnzymatic antioxidant activity 0aInternalization1 aLeganés, Francisco1 aFernández-Piñas, Francisca1 aRossal S., J.

One such common environmental modification is a change in pH. Conventional wisdom holds that symbionts facilitate the survival and production of their hosts in the wild, but this notion lacks empirical evidence. Here, we report that symbiotic bacteria in the genus Enterococcus attenuate the oviposition avoidance of alkaline environments in Drosophila. We studied the effects of alkalinity on oviposition preference for the first time, and found that flies are robustly disinclined to oviposit on alkali‐containing substrates. This innate repulsion to alkaline environments is explained, in part, by the fact that alkalinity compromises the health and lifespan of both offspring and parent Drosophila. Enterococcus dramatically diminished or even completely reversed the ovipositional avoidance of alkalinity in Drosophila. Mechanistically, Enterococcus generate abundant lactate during fermentation, which neutralizes the residual alkali in an egg‐laying substrate. In conclusion, Enterococcus protects Drosophila from alkali stress by acidifying the ovipositional substrate, and ultimately improves the fitness of the Drosophila population. Our results demonstrate that symbionts are profound factors in the Drosophila ovipositional decision, and extend our understanding of the intimate interactions between Drosophila and their symbionts.  aPublisher supplied data  a31501175cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  cGrants of Shanxi Medical University Fenyang College  cShanxi Undergraduate Training Program for Innovation and Entrepreneurship 3aDrosophila 3aEnterococcus 3aacidification 3aalkalinity 3afermentation 3ainsects 3alactic acid 3alongevity 3ametabolites 3aoviposition 3aoviposition preference 3apH 3aprogeny1 aWang, Jie1 aZhang, Hong‐Yu1 aYang, Ying‐Chun1 aKang, Ru‐Xue1 aBai, Peng1 aFu, Hui1 aChen, Li‐Rong1 aGao, Yan‐Ping1 aTan, Eng King0 tInsect science.g2021 Apr., v. 28, no. 2 p.403-414dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3869360x1672-96097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1744-7917.128573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03871naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245008300165300001800248500002000266520208500286592002802371596003502399596002702434596005002461596003702511596003802548596001402586596004202600596003502642650002602677650002402703650001802727650002402745650002902769650001502798650001202813650001502825650001502840650002302855650001702878650001802895650001002913650001002923650001602933650001102949650002402960651003002984651001803014700002403032700002103056773013203077856007503209852000903284655001203293IND60787156420221122062040.0220807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715642DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCoates, Stephanie E.10aLong‐billed curlew nest site selection and success in the Intermountain West  ap. 1197-1213.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aGrassland birds have experienced steeper population declines between 1966 and 2015 than any other bird group on the North American continent, and migratory grassland birds may face threats in all stages of their annual cycle. The grassland‐associated long‐billed curlew (Numenius americanus) is experiencing population declines in regional and local portions of their North American breeding range. The nesting period is an important portion of the annual cycle when curlews may face demographic rate limitations from a suite of threats including predators and anthropogenic disturbance. We compared nest sites to random sites within breeding territories to examine nest site selection, and modeled correlates of nesting success for 128 curlew nests at 5 Intermountain West sites. Nest sites were 6 times more likely than random sites to be situated adjacent to existing cowpies. Additionally, curlews selected nest sites with shorter vegetation, and less bare ground, grass, and shrub cover than at random sites within their territories. Nest success varied widely among sites and ranged from 12% to 40% in a season with a mean of 27% for all nests during the 2015 and 2016 seasons. Higher nest success probability was associated with higher curlew densities in the area, greater percent cover of conspicuous objects (cowpies, rocks) near the nest, and higher densities of black‐billed magpies (Pica hudsonia) and American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) at the site. We also found increased probability of nesting success with increased distance from a nest to the nearest potential perch in that territory. Given the central role of working lands to curlews in much of the Intermountain West, understanding limitations to nesting success in these diverse landscapes is necessary to guide adaptive management strategies in increasingly human‐modified habitats. We suggest some grazing and irrigation practices already provide suitable nesting conditions for curlews, and others may require only minor temporal shifts to improve compatibility. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  cThe Nature Conservancy  cWyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition  cWyoming Game and Fish Department  cMeg and Bert Raynes Wildlife Fund  cMPG Ranch  cDan Montgomery Graduate Student Award  cU.S. Bureau of Land Management 3aCorvus brachyrhynchos 3aNumenius americanus 3aPica hudsonia 3aadaptive management 3aanthropogenic activities 3acow manure 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3airrigation 3amigratory behavior 3anest success 3anesting sites 3anests 3aperch 3aprobability 3ashrubs 3awildlife management 3aIntermountain West region 3aNorth America1 aWright, Benjamin W.1 aCarlisle, Jay D.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 July, v. 83, no. 5 p.1197-1213dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.216613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245009000160300001800250500001900268520039600287592002800683650001800711650001800729650001600747650002400763650001700787653001600804653001500820653001500835653000800850700003000858700002300888700002100911700001900932700001900951700001500970700001600985700001901001700001901020700002201039700002201061700001801083700002001101773018601121856007401307852000901381655001201390IND60692196620221122064137.0200502e20120923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069219662DNAL7 a10.1271/bbb.1203872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShibata, Akira,10aPhysiological Effects and Tissue Distribution from Large Doses of Tocotrienol in Rats  ap. 1805-1808.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSupplementation to an AIN93G-based diet of tocotrienol (T3) for 13 weeks administered to Fischer 344/slc rats showed a safety profile with no side effects.

Y.10aEvaluating detection and occupancy probabilities of eastern spotted skunks  ap. 1244-1253.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe eastern spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) is a poorly understood mesocarnivore species that suffered a range‐wide decline in the mid‐1900s. Little is known about its current distribution or habitat needs, and in the southern Appalachians, where the Carolinas and Georgia converge, eastern spotted skunks were only recently discovered to persist. From January–April in 2016 and 2017, we used camera trap surveys to monitor eastern spotted skunks and used occupancy modeling to evaluate factors we hypothesized would influence the probability of spotted skunk detection and occurrence at the landscape scale. We detected spotted skunks at 55.6% of our sites and on 18.5% of sampling occasions. Our results suggest that detection probability was influenced by predation risk, camera setup, and the type of scent‐based attractant used. Eastern spotted skunk occupancy probability had a negative relationship with elevation, such that the probability of occupancy on average increased 7% for every 100‐m decrease in elevation. These results differ from previous findings from the northern Appalachian region, and suggest spotted skunks in the southern Appalachians may be more widely distributed than previously thought. To inform management, there remains a critical need for finer‐scale investigations into resource selection and demographic trends. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data  cthe South Carolina Department of Natural Resources 3acameras 3acarnivores 3adecline 3ahabitats 3alandscapes 3apredation 3arisk 3askunks 3awildlife management 3aAppalachian region 3aGeorgia1 aJachowski, David S.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 July, v. 83, no. 5 p.1244-1253dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.216843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02366naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002300149245013300172300001600305520124700321592002801568650002001596650002601616650001201642650001901654650001101673650001201684650001001696650001401706650001401720651001101734700002301745700002101768700002001789773009101809856008301900852000901983655001201992IND60083039820221119121218.0141101e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008303982DNAL7 a10.1016/j.yqres.2013.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIlyashuk, Elena A.10aHolocene climate variability on the Kola Peninsula, Russian Subarctic, based on aquatic invertebrate records from lake sediments  ap. 350-361.  aSedimentary records of invertebrate assemblages were obtained from a small lake in the Khibiny Mountains, Kola Peninsula. Together with a quantitative chironomid-based reconstruction of mean July air temperature, these data provide evidence of Holocene climate variability in the western sector of the Russian Subarctic. The results suggest that the amplitude of climate change was more pronounced in the interior mountain area than near the White Sea coast. A chironomid-based temperature reconstruction reflects a warming trend in the early Holocene, interrupted by a transient cooling at ca. 8500–8000calyrBP with a maximum drop in temperature (ca. 1°C) around 8200calyrBP. The regional Holocene Thermal Maximum, characterized by maximum warmth and dryness occurred at ca. 7900–5400calyrBP. During this period, July temperatures were at least 1°C higher than at present. The relatively warm and dry climate persisted until ca. 4000calyrBP, when a pronounced neoglacial cooling was initiated. Minimum temperatures, ca. 1–2°C lower than at present, were inferred at ca. 3200–3000calyrBP. Faunal shifts in the stratigraphic profile imply also that the late-Holocene cooling was followed by a general increase in effective moisture.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaquatic invertebrates 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acoasts 3acooling 3alakes 3amountains 3asediments 3aRussia1 aIlyashuk, Boris P.1 aKolka, Vasily V.1 aHammarlund, Dan0 tQuaternary research.g2013 May, v. 79, no. 3 p.350-361dElsevier Inc.x0033-58947nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yqres.2013.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01340naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002000139245011100159300001800270520032900288592002800617650001200645650001200657650001400669650002800683650001300711650001400724650002100738650001200759700001800771700002400789773010500813856007500918852000900993655001201002IND60578652620221118221706.0170813e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865262DNAL7 a10.1021/ol303510k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakai, Kazunori10aRhodium-Catalyzed Intermolecular [2 + 2] Cycloaddition of Terminal Alkynes with Electron-Deficient Alkenes  ap. 1024-1027.  aThe first catalytic intermolecular [2 + 2] cycloaddition of terminal alkynes with electron-deficient alkenes is reported.

To account for the effect of lipid content on the δ13C signatures, a study-specific lipid correction model based on C:N ratios was developed and applied to the bulk δ13C data. For the majority of species in the study, we found no significant difference in δ13C values between gill and muscle tissue after correction, but several species showed a small (0.3–1.4‰) depletion of 13C in white muscle compared to gill tissue. The average species difference in δ15N between muscle and gill tissue ranged from −0.2 to 1.6‰ for the different fish species with muscle tissue generally more enriched in 15N. The δ13C values of muscle and gill were strongly linearly correlated (R2=0.85) over a large isotopic range (13‰), suggesting that both tissues can be used to determine long-term feeding or migratory habits of fish. Muscle and gill tissue bulk δ15N values were also strongly positively correlated (R2=0.76) but with a small difference between muscle and gill tissue. This difference indicates that the bulk δ15N of the two tissue types may be influenced by different isotopic turnover rates or a different composition of amino acids.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid composition 3acarbon 3acarbon nitrogen ratio 3acorrelation 3aecology 3afish 3afish feeding 3agills 3alipid content 3alipids 3amigratory behavior 3amodels 3amuscle tissues 3amuscles 3anitrogen 3astable isotopes 0aδ13C 0aδ15N 0aFish gills 0aFish muscle 0aLipid correction 0aStable isotopes1 aFreitas, Vânia,1 aSchouten, Stefan1 aMiddelburg, Jack J.1 avan der Veer, Henk W.1 aSinninghe Damsté, Jaap S.0 tJournal of experimental marine biology and ecology.g2014 Aug., v. 457 p.173-179dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11705x0022-09817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2014.04.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245014300171300001600314520072900330592002801059650002201087650001601109650002001125650001201145650001801157650001301175651002201188700002101210700002101231700002001252700001701272700002001289700001901309773008701328856008501415852000901500655001201509IND60084481120221122130230.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008448112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDimitriou, P.D.10aMeta-analysis of a large data set with Water Framework Directive indicators and calibration of a Benthic Quality Index at the family level  ap. 101-107.  aA large data set of marine benthic samples from the Eastern Mediterranean was used to develop Benthic Quality Index (BQI)-family, a new indicator based on the BQI index, which was calibrated by maximizing the consensus with other existing indicators namely BQI, Shannon diversity H’, AZTI Marine Biotic Index (AMBI) and BENTIX.

The degree of cooking (DC) and the hardness of cooked beans were estimated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and texture analysis, respectively. The total protein of bean seeds varied between 19.7 and 23.6%. However, the fractions of albumin, glutelin, and globulin showed significant differences among varieties. The amylose content varied from 18.4 to 36.0%. The first endothermic peak was associated with inactivated enzymatic activity, denaturation of low-protein fractions, and starch gelatinization, while the second endothermic peak was associated with the denaturation of heat-resistant protein fractions. The high values of minerals and chemical composition among bean varieties affected thermal behavior and was associated with greater hardness and a lower degree of cooking.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aalbumins 3aamylose 3abeans 3acooking 3acooking quality 3adenaturation 3adifferential scanning calorimetry 3aenzyme activity 3agelatinization 3aglutelins 3ahardness 3aminerals 3aprotein content 3aseeds 3atexture 3athermal properties 0aPhaseolus vulgaris 0achemical composition 0adenaturation temperature 0aamylose content 0adegree of cooking 0atexture1 aUrías-Silvas, J.E.1 aEspinosa-Andrews, H.1 aGarcía-Márquez, E.0 tCyTA: journal of food.g2015 July 3, v. 13, no. 3 p.385-391dTaylor & Francisx1947-63457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19476337.2014.9881823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01419naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245007000173300001600243520036700259592002800626650001400654650001100668653000800679653000800687653000800695653002300703653001900726653002000745653002800765653002600793653002300819700002300842773009800865856008500963852000901048655001201057IND60609987620221123033842.0180824e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060998762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.03.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Palma, André10aIdentities for maximum, minimum, and maxmin random utility models  ap. 135-139.  aWe generalize Roy’s identity for discrete choice models, focusing on the worst choices.

They are grown primarily for their fruit, which generally have a sweet aromatic flavor, with great diversity and size (50 g to 15 kg), flesh color (orange, green, white, and pink), rind color (green, yellow, white, orange, red, and gray), form (round, flat, and elongated), and dimension (4 to 200 cm). C. melo can be broken down into seven distinct types based on the previously discussed variations in the species. The melon fruits can be either climacteric or nonclimacteric, and as such, fruit can adhere to the stem or have an abscission layer where they will fall from the plant naturally at maturity. Traditional plant breeding of melons has been done for 100 years wherein plants were primarily developed as open-pollinated cultivars. More recently, in the past 30 years, melon improvement has been done by more traditional hybridization techniques. An improvement in germplasm is relatively slow and is limited by a restricted gene pool. Strong sexual incompatibility at the interspecific and intergeneric levels has restricted rapid development of new cultivars with high levels of disease resistance, insect resistance, flavor, and sweetness. In order to increase the rate and diversity of new traits in melon it would be advantageous to introduce new genes needed to enhance both melon productivity and melon fruit quality. This requires plant tissue and plant transformation techniques to introduce new or foreign genes into C. melo germplasm. In order to achieve a successful commercial application from biotechnology, a competent plant regeneration system of in vitro cultures for melon is required. More than 40 in vitro melon regeneration programs have been reported; however, regeneration of the various melon types has been highly variable and in some cases impossible. The reasons for this are still unknown, but this plays a heavy negative role on trying to use plant transformation technology to improve melon germplasm. In vitro manipulation of melon is difficult; genotypic responses to the culture method (i.e., organogenesis, somatic embryogenesis, etc.) as well as conditions for environmental and hormonal requirements for plant growth and regeneration continue to be poorly understood for developing simple in vitro procedures to culture and transform all C. melo genotypes. In many cases, this has to be done on an individual line basis. The present paper describes the various research findings related to successful approaches to plant regeneration and transgenic transformation of C. melo. It also describes potential improvement of melon to improve fruit quality characteristics and postharvest handling. Despite more than 140 transgenic melon field trials in the United States in 1996, there are still no commercial transgenic melon cultivars on the market. This may be a combination of technical or performance factors, intellectual property rights concerns, and, most likely, a lack of public acceptance. Regardless, the future for improvement of melon germplasm is bright when considering the knowledge base for both techniques and gene pools potentially useable for melon improvement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis melo 3aabscission 3abiotechnology 3aclimacteric fruits 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3afield experimentation 3afruit quality 3agene pool 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ain vitro culture 3ainsect resistance 3aintellectual property rights 3amarkets 3amelons 3aopen pollination 3aorganogenesis 3aplant breeding 3aplant growth 3aplant tissues 3apostharvest treatment 3asomatic embryogenesis 3asweetness 3atransgenic plants 3aUnited States 0acucurbits 0aplant tissue culture 0aripening1 aGomez-Lim, Miguel1 aOchoa-Alejo, Neftalí,1 aGrumet, Rebecca1 aLester, Gene1 aCantliffe, Daniel J.0 tCritical reviews in biotechnology.g2008 Jan. 1, v. 28, no. 1 p.13-55dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2047x1549-78017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/073885508018911113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001900140245006500159300001800224500002000242520108600262592002801348650001701376650002001393650001201413650001501425650001001440650001501450650001401465650002401479651002701503651001701530700002601547700002201573773013201595856007501727852000901802655001201811IND60787156820221120050720.0220807e201907  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715682DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.216822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aToay, Bruce W.10aBreeding site fidelity of blue‐winged teal in South Dakota  ap. 1143-1150.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAssumptions about breeding site fidelity (i.e., fidelity) in blue‐winged teal (Spatula discors) are based on limited recapture data and analytic techniques. We banded female blue‐winged teal (n = 12,543) from 2003 to 2014 in a 3,800‐ha sample area in north‐central South Dakota, USA, and used a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach combining live recapture and dead recovery data to predict probabilities of fidelity, survival, recapture, and reporting. We explored sources of variation including time, annual wet area on the landscape, age, and nest survival, and compared our results to other dabbling ducks that nest in the Prairie Pothole Region, a critically important breeding area for waterfowl in central North America. We found annual estimates of fidelity ranging from 0.20 to 0.91, with mean values of 0.62 and 0.67 for hatch year birds and after hatch year birds, respectively. Our findings indicate that environmental factors may cause blue‐winged teal to return to breeding sites more frequently than previously assumed. © The Wildlife Society, 2019  aPublisher supplied data 3aAnas discors 3aBayesian theory 3afemales 3alandscapes 3anests 3aphilopatry 3awaterfowl 3awildlife management 3aPrairie Pothole region 3aSouth Dakota1 aMeidinger, Randell R.1 aKemink, Kaylan M.0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 July, v. 83, no. 5 p.1143-1150dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.216823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01999naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245014100169300001500310520081200325592002801137650001701165650001801182650001301200650001601213650000901229650001701238650001801255650002101273653003301294653002201327653001901349653001801368700001301386700001401399700001701413773007701430856008501507852000901592655001201601IND60569026620221119172419.0170709e20170901xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056902662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2017.05.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Liping12aA near-infrared luminescent Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb,Tm/Fe3+ upconversion nanoparticles redox reaction system for the detection of GSH/Cys/AA  ap. 95-101.  aAn upconversion luminescence method was developed for the determination of glutathione (GSH), L-cysteine (Cys) or L-ascorbic acid (AA) based on redox reaction. We synthesized poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-modified Mn2+-doped NaYF4:Yb,Tm upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), and the luminescence of these UCNPs was effectively quenched due to their carboxyl groups coordinating with Fe3+ to form a UCNPs/Fe3+ system. GSH, Cys or AA reduced Fe3+ to Fe2+, which induced the luminescence recovery of the UCNPs. Under the optimized conditions, wide linear concentration ranges from 0.25-300μM for GSH, 0.5–875μM for Cys and 0.5–350μM for AA were found, and the detection limits (3S/K) were 0.2μM, 0.5μM and 0.2μM, respectively.

Here, we estimated the temperature sensitivities (using activation energies, E) of autotrophic and heterotrophic microbial plankton net growth rates over an annual cycle in NE Atlantic coastal waters. Phytoplankton grew in winter and late autumn (0.41 ± 0.16 SE d⁻¹) and decayed in the remaining months (−0.42 ± 0.10 d⁻¹). Heterotrophic microbes shared a similar seasonality, with positive net growth for bacteria (0.14–1.48 d⁻¹), while nanoflagellates had higher values (> 0.4 d⁻¹) in winter and spring relative to the rest of the year (−0.46 to 0.29 d⁻¹). Net growth rates activation energies showed similar dynamics in the three groups (−1.07 to 1.51 eV), characterized by maxima in winter, minima in summer and resumed increases in autumn. Microbial plankton E values were significantly correlated with nitrate concentrations as a proxy for nutrient availability. Nutrient‐sufficiency (i.e., > 1 μmol l⁻¹ nitrate) resulted in significantly higher activation energies of phytoplankton and heterotrophic nanoflagellates relative to nutrient‐limited conditions. We suggest that only within spatio‐temporal windows of both moderate bottom‐up and top‐down controls will temperature have a major enhancing effect on microbial growth.  aPublisher supplied data  cSpanish Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad through the COMITE 3aactivation energy 3aautumn 3abacteria 3acoastal water 3amicrobial growth 3anitrates 3anutrient availability 3aphytoplankton 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrophic levels 3awinter1 aCalvo‐Díaz, Alejandra1 aArandia‐Gorostidi, Nestor1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9370-20651 aHuete‐Stauffer, Tamara Megan1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7331-83410 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2018 Oct., v. 20, no. 10 p.3798-3810dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.143933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010700170300001600277520164400293592002801937650001301965650001101978650001001989650001201999650002402011650001802035650002302053650001702076650001902093650001402112650000902126650001602135650001902151651001002170653001802180653002302198653002602221653002202247653003002269700001702299700005802316700001602374700001902390700005502409700001402464773010702478856008502585852000902670655001202679IND60635128920221116220408.0190523e201906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063512892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, David10aMicroplastics undergo accelerated vertical migration in sand soil due to small size and wet-dry cycles  ap. 527-534.  aMicroplastics (MPs) are an emerging concern and potential risk to marine and terrestrial environments. Surface soils are reported to act as a sink. However, MP vertical mobility in the subsurface remains uncertain due to a lack of scientific data. This study focused on MP penetration in sand soil column experiments. Here we report the mobility of five different MPs, which consisted of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) particles of various sizes and densities. We observed that the smallest sized PE MPs (21 μm) had the greatest movement potential. Moreover, it was found that when these MPs were subjected to greater numbers of wet-dry cycles, the penetration depth significantly increased, with an apparent linear relationship between depth and wet-dry cycle number (r2 = 0.817). In comparison, increasing the volume of infiltration liquid or the surface MP concentration had only negligible or weak effects on migration depth (r2 = 0.169 and 0.312, respectively). Based on the observed wet-dry cycle trend, we forecast 100-year penetration depths using weather data for 347 cities across China. The average penetration depth was calculated as 5.24 m (95% CI = 2.78–7.70 m), with Beijing Municipality and Hebei, Henan and Hubei provinces being the most vulnerable to MP vertical dispersion. Our results suggest that soils may not only represent a sink for MPs, but also a feasible entryway to subsurface receptors, such as subterranean fauna or aquifers. Finally, research gaps are identified and suggested research directions are put forward to garner a better understanding MP vertical migration in soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3acities 3afauna 3aliquids 3ameteorological data 3amicroplastics 3amigratory behavior 3apolyethylene 3apolypropylenes 3areceptors 3arisk 3asandy soils 3awet-dry cycles 3aChina 0aMicroplastics 0aSoil contamination 0aContaminant transport 0aPlastic pollution 0aGroundwater contamination1 aPan, Shizhen1 aShen, Zhengtao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4841-710X1 aSong, Yinan1 aJin, Yuanliang1 aWu, Weimin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5244-06551 aHou, Deyi0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.527-534dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0923Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03556naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245015600164300002000320520225700340592002802597650001502625650002402640650001702664650004202681650001802723650002102741650002202762650003702784650001602821700002302837700002002860700001802880700005702898773013802955856008003093852000903173655001203182IND60606179920221120041334.0180724e20180430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060617992DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b038592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoy, Subhasis10aStriking Similarities in the Fluorescence Behavior between Carbon Dots and Ionic Liquids: Toward Understanding the Fluorescence Behavior of Carbon Dots  ap. 12384-12394.  aDespite several studies, convincing explanation for the fluorescence of carbon dots (CDs) and its excitation wavelength dependence behavior has not yet emerged. It may be noted that direct structure–property correlation can be misleading based on solely transmission electron microscopy micrographs as it does not fully reveal the possibility of heterogeneous nature of the samples in a sense that it does not fully reveal the possibility of having both carbonaceous nanoparticles as well as small organic molecular-based systems. The present work is undertaken specifically to address this issue. A detailed spectroscopic investigation comprising steady-state absorption, emission, time-resolved fluorescence, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies has been carried out on CDs, synthesized from two different sources. Similar investigations have also been carried out on the systems such as aromatic and aliphatic ionic liquids (ILs), which are known to be fluorescent in their neat conditions. Interestingly, the fluorescence behavior of CDs is observed to be very similar to that of neat ILs. Recent studies by Kim and co-workers have categorically demonstrated that fluorescence from neat ILs can originate from associated structures of ILs. In the present work, the excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence measurements, emission wavelength-dependent radiative recombination and FCS studies on CDs and other systems including ILs have established that the presence of energetically different associated structures (in the ground state) in CD solution is primarily responsible for the fluorescence behavior of CDs. Dynamic light scattering measurements and dilution studies through FCS have also provided evidence in favor of associated structures in CD solution. Excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence behavior of CDs can also be explained on the basis of energetically different associated structures that are formed in CD solution during its synthesis. Essentially the present investigations have revealed that carbon dots are not inherently fluorescent, rather fluorescence from CD solution arises due to the presence of associated/networked structures similar to what has been observed in systems such as neat ILs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acarbon quantum dots 3afluorescence 3afluorescence correlation spectroscopy 3aionic liquids 3alight scattering 3aspectral analysis 3atransmission electron microscopy 3awavelengths1 aPreeyanka, Naupada1 aMajhi, Debashis1 aSeth, Sudipta1 aSarkar, Moloy1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8426-51150 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2018 Apr. 30, v. 122, no. 23 p.12384-12394dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b038593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01425naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001400139245010700153300001600260520043300276592002800709650002200737650001200759650001900771650002300790650002300813650002200836700001800858700001800876700001800894773010300912856007501015852000901090655001201099IND60578653020221118221808.0170813e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865302DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40001972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Suhua10aCarbometalation–Carboxylation of 2,3-Allenols with Carbon Dioxide: A Dramatic Effect of Halide Anion  ap. 977-979.  aThe cyclic organometallic intermediates formed via CuCl-mediated highly regio- and stereoselective carbomagnesiation of 2,3-allenols with Grignard reagents may smoothly react with carbon dioxide to afford 2(5H)-furanones.

To capture these ground rotations more realistically, the present study makes a novel attempt to model the Earth medium as a horizontally layered reduced micropolar half‐space. Layers in this medium are characterized by five material constants: Lame's constant (λ), Eringen's shear modulus (μ), density (ρ), rotational moment of inertia (j), and an additional material constant (κ). Cylindrical coordinate system is used to analytically derive the Green's functions and obtain the response of the layered Earth medium subjected to a point earthquake force. The analytically obtained surface translations and rotations involve integrations over the wavenumber and frequency parameters and hence, are evaluated numerically. These solutions converge to corresponding classical elastic medium when the micropolar medium parameters obey the relations κ≪μ and 2κρj≫ω2, where ω is the maximum frequency considered in the simulation. Thereafter, ground motions are simulated for several combinations of earthquake magnitudes and epicenter distances by modeling the Earth medium as an eight layered reduced micropolar half‐space. Further, ground motions for the 2012 Wutai earthquake were simulated using the proposed model and compared with the response of classical elastic medium. The comparisons indicate that the surface rotations are significantly higher in the case of reduced micropolar medium. The proposed formulation can be extended to simulate ground motions for finite‐fault seismic sources.  aPublisher supplied data 3aearthquakes 3ageophysics 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3aresearch1 aSingla, Varun K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1039-04311 aSTG, Raghukanth1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8344-797X0 tJournal of geophysical research.g2021 Nov., v. 126, no. 11 p.e2020JB020931-dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:27943x2169-93137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2020JB0209313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04413naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245010200168300001600270520274300286592002803029650001703057650001303074650001703087650002303104650002003127650001703147650001603164650001303180650001503193650001503208650001703223650000903240650002203249650002703271650002003298650001203318650001303330650001003343651001203353651001103365651002803376700002103404700001803425700002003443700001903463700002603482700002003508700001803528700002403546700001803570700001903588700002303607773008703630856008503717852000903802655001203811IND60084481820221122222226.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008448182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.02.0332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSebek, Pavel12aA test for assessment of saproxylic beetle biodiversity using subsets of “monitoring species”  ap. 304-315.  aIn European forests, large scale biodiversity monitoring networks need to be implemented – networks which include components such as taxonomical groups that are at risk and that depend directly on forest stand structure. In this context, monitoring the species-rich group of saproxylic beetles is challenging. In the absence of sufficient resources to comprehensively survey a particular group, surrogates of species richness can be meaningful tools in biodiversity evaluations. In search of restricted subsets of species to use as surrogates of saproxylic beetle richness, we led a case study in Western Europe. Beetle data were compiled from 67 biodiversity surveys and ecological studies carried out from 1999 to 2010 with standardised trapping methods in France and Belgium. This large-scale dataset contains 642 forest plots, 1521 traps and 856 species. Twenty-two simplified species subsets were identified as potential surrogates, as well as the number of genera, a higher taxonomic level, taking into account, for each surrogate, the effort required for species identification, the practical monitoring experience necessary, the species conservation potential or the frequency of species occurrence. The performance of each surrogate was analyzed based on the following parameters: overall surrogacy (correlation between subset richness and total species richness), surrogacy vs. identification cost balance, surrogacy variation over a wide range of ecological conditions (forest type, altitude, latitude and bio-geographical area) and consistency with spatial scale. Ecological representativeness and ability to monitor rare species were supplementary criteria used to assess surrogate performance. The subsets consisting of the identifiable (or only easy-to-identify species) could easily be applied in practice and appear to be the best performing subsets, from a global point of view. The number of genera showed good prediction at the trap level and its surrogacy did not vary across wide environmental gradients. However, the subset of easy-to-identify species and the genus number were highly sensitive to spatial scale, which limits their use in large-scale studies. The number of rare species or the species richness of single beetle families (even the best single-family subset, the Cerambycidae) was very weak surrogates for total species richness. Conversely, the German list of monitoring species had high surrogacy, low identification costs and was not strongly influenced by the main geographical parameters, even with our French and Belgian data. In European-wide monitoring networks, such internationally validated subsets could be very useful with regard to the timing and cost-efficiency of field inventories.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCerambycidae 3aaltitude 3acase studies 3acost effectiveness 3adata collection 3aforest types 3ainventories 3alatitude 3amonitoring 3aprediction 3arare species 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3aspecies identification 3astand structure 3asurveys 3atrapping 3atraps 3aBelgium 3aFrance 3aWestern European region1 aBarnouin, Thomas1 aBrin, Antoine1 aBrustel, Hervé1 aDufrêne, Marc1 aGosselin, Frédéric,1 aMeriguet, Bruno1 aMicas, Lilian1 aNoblecourt, Thierry1 aRose, Olivier1 aVelle, Laurent1 aBouget, Christophe0 tEcological indicators.g2012 Sept., v. 20 p.304-315dElsevier Ltdx1470-160X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.02.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03568naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001600151245016200167300001800329520155100347536020701898592002802105596002602133596001302159596001802172650003402190650001302224650001802237650001602255650001602271650001602287650002502303650002002328650001202348650001002360650001402370650002502384650002202409650002002431650001902451650001902470650001702489650002102506650001002527653001802537653002602555653002402581653001102605700001702616700001802633700001502651700001802666700001202684700001702696700001802713773011602731856008602847852000902933655001202942IND60733482620221117234501.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348262DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18442422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xuemei10aEffects of HuoxueJiangtang decoction alone or in combination with metformin on renal function and renal cortical mRNA expression in diabetic nephropathy rats  ap. 1132-1139.  aHuoxueJiangtang decoction (ZY) is a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of diabetes. The protective effect of ZY on renal injury in diabetic nephropathy rats was investigated in this study. Fifty 4-week-old SPF Wistar male rats were selected to construct diabetic nephropathy model rats (DN) group by continuous high-fat feeding for 4 weeks, followed by a tail vein injection of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin for 1 week. The experimental rats were divided into six groups of 10 rats: normal (control), DN, DN + ZY, DN + metformin, DN + metformin + ZY, and DN + metformin + captopril (positive control) groups. Among the groups, 6.25 g/kg ZY, 250 mg/kg metformin, and 17.5 mg/kg captopril were given to the rats by gavage once a day for 16 weeks. Blood glucose, dietary behaviour, biochemical indicators, and gene expression changes were measured in each group. Metformin + ZY treatment significantly lowered blood glucose, water intake, urine total protein, urine albumin, urine volume, serum triglyceride, and serum cholesterol levels in the DN group. The pathological changes of kidney tissue showed that the DN + metformin + ZY group had a protective effect on kidney tissue damage. And ZY and metformin + ZY treatments repaired the expression of genes in the DN group. The ZY and metformin combined treatment showed a clear therapeutic effect on kidney damage in DN. This study provides a potential mechanism for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy with ZY combined with metformin.  aThis work was supported by Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81704002), Shenzhen Scientific Research Fund (No. JCYJ20160428180924481), and Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen (SZSM201512043).  aPublisher supplied data  aJCYJ20160428180924481  a81704002  aSZSM201512043 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalbumins 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3acaudal vein 3acholesterol 3adiabetic nephropathy 3agene expression 3akidneys 3amales 3ametformin 3anutritional behavior 3aprotective effect 3aprotein content 3arenal function 3astreptozotocin 3atherapeutics 3atriacylglycerols 3aurine 0aBlood glucose 0abiochemical indicator 0apathological change 0akidney1 aLiu, Deliang1 aShuai, Youyou1 aLi, Huilin1 aZhao, Hengxia1 aQu, Xin1 aChu, Shufang1 aZhang, Xuewen0 tPharmaceutical biology.g2020 Jan. 1, v. 58, no. 1 p.1132-1139dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2153x1744-51167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2020.18442423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01390naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245008700155300001800242520035600260592002800616650002300644650002300667650001600690650002400706650002100730700001400751700001600765700001100781700002100792700001900813700001900832773010500851856007500956852000901031655001201040IND60578653120221118221647.0170813e20130301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057865312DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40003132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guokai10aSelective O-Difluoromethylation of 1,3-Diones by Bromodifluoromethylating Reagents  ap. 1044-1047.  aThe regioselective O-difluoromethylation of 1,3-diones was achieved via in situ generation of difluorocarbene from bromodifluoromethylating reagents in the presence of an organic base.

However, exposure routes and toxic effects to humans are still widely unknown. Our objectives were to evaluate potential correlations between concentrations of PFASs in maternal plasma and infant cord blood with home characteristics and developmental effects, including wheezing. The concentrations of 17 PFASs were measured in plasma from prenatal women (n = 414), postnatal women (n = 247), and cord blood (n = 50) from a subset of participants in a population-based birth cohort in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, using online solid phase extraction (SPE) with liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Multiple linear regression and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to evaluate possible associations with PFAS concentrations. Surveys were used to collect information regarding maternal characteristics (e.g. age, parity, duration of breastfeeding), infant characteristics (e.g. birth weight, birth length, head circumference, gestational age, and incidence of recurrent wheezing), and home characteristics (e.g. home age,carpet coverage in the most used room, presence of new furniture, or recent home renovations). PFASs in plasma were associated with maternal characteristics but not home characteristics or early childhood wheezing. PFASs were not associated with developmental effects, with the exception that perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA) was negatively associated with birth weight. Further studies investigating the potential influences of PFUA on birth weight are warranted.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirth weight 3ablood 3abreast feeding 3achildhood 3aexposure pathways 3afurniture 3agestational age 3ahead circumference 3aliquid chromatography 3aperfluorocarbons 3aprincipal component analysis 3aregression analysis 3asolid phase extraction 3asurveys 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atoxicity 3awomen 3aManitoba 0aPerfluoroalkyl substances 0aBlood 0aDevelopmental effects 0aLiquid chromatography1 aBecker, Allan B.1 aAzad, Meghan B.1 aMoraes, Theo J.1 aMandhane, Piush J.1 aTurvey, Stuart E.1 aSubbarao, Padmaja1 aBrook, Jeffrey R.1 aSears, Malcolm R.1 aWong, Charles S.0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2019 June, v. 249 p.758-766dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2019.03.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03085naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012000171300001800291520165800309592002801967650001901995650001502014650001802029650001602047650003602063650001502099650001002114650001002124650002102134650001602155650001702171650001402188650001202202650001802214650001102232650001702243650002502260651000902285653001202294653002402306653003402330700002802364773011602392856008602508852000902594655001202603IND60733482920221117234519.0220827e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073348292DNAL7 a10.1080/13880209.2020.18447622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKianmehr, Majid10aPossible therapeutic effects of Crocus sativus stigma and its petal flavonoid, kaempferol, on respiratory disorders  ap. 1149-1158.  aCrocus sativus L. (Iridaceae), or saffron, has been used as food additives and spices. In the traditional medicine of Iran, C. sativus has been used for the treatment of liver disorders, coughs, and as an anti-inflammatory agent for eyes. The current study reviewed the possible therapeutic effects of C. sativus stigma and its petal flavonoid (kaempferol) on respiratory disorders with several mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory, and smooth muscle relaxant effects. This review article searched databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect, up to November 2019. The keywords including; ‘Crocus sativus’, ‘saffron’, ‘kaempferol’, ‘airway inflammation’, and ‘smooth muscle relaxant’ were searched. C. sativus reduced nitric oxide (NO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) levels and inflammatory cytokines in the lung tissue. Saffron and kaempferol reduced white blood cells (WBCs) and the percentage of neutrophils and eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, saffron reduced tracheal responsiveness to methacholine and ovalbumin on tracheal smooth muscles. In addition, kaempferol reduced the total leukocyte and eosinophil counts similar to the effect of dexamethasone and also showed relaxant effects on smooth muscle. Crocus sativus and its petal flavonoid, kaempferol, showed relatively potent therapeutic effects on respiratory disorders by relaxation of tracheal smooth muscles via stimulatory or blocking effects on β-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptors, respectively.

Circulation of RABV in Brazilian bats has been extensively demonstrated; however, the observation of such infections in unvaccinated terrestrial mammals is restricted to some regions of the Brazilian territory. The occurrence of rabies infection in unvaccinated animals has been identified by the detection of RABV antigens in brain tissues of dead animals or anti‐rabies antibodies in live animals. Such strategies allow the surveillance of rabies and the assessment of spillover risks from infected animals to humans. Our aim included the identification of species of wild mammals that are involved in the sylvatic cycle of rabies virus in Southern Brazil and to assess the risk of rabies infection in patients bitten by wild animals in the state. To assess the anti‐rabies seropositivity, sera were submitted to the Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test (RFFIT). Among the 100 mammals tested, five animals were seropositive (5%) including three (one primate and two wild canids) with rabies virus neutralizing antibodies titres >0.5 IU/ml. Our results highlight the exposure to RABV of both primates and wild canids in Southern Brazil and suggest the occurrence of RABV exposure without the development of further symptoms. Further research should clarify the dynamics of rabies in wild canids and whether primates are accidental hosts or reservoirs for RABV at this region.  aPublisher supplied data  cSecretaria Estadual de Saúde do Rio Grande do Sul  aIP 04/17cInstituto Pasteur /CCD/Secretaria de Estado da Saúde de São Paulo 3aCanidae 3aChiroptera 3aPrimates 3aRabies lyssavirus 3aantigens 3abrain 3adead animals 3aemerging diseases 3ahosts 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3aneutralization 3aneutralizing antibodies 3apatients 3arabies 3arisk 3aserological surveys 3aseroprevalence 3atissues 3awild animals 3aBrazil1 ados Santos, Raíssa Nunes1 aBenavides, Julio A.1 ade Carvalho Ruthner Batista, Helena Beatriz1 aFinoketti, Fernando1 aWagner, Paulo Guilherme Carniel1 aZafalon‐Silva, Bruna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3439-47601 aAlievi, Marcelo1 ada Silva, Fabio Branco1 aWitt, André1 aTartarotti, Ana1 ade Cassia Rodrigues da Silva, Andrea1 aFerreira, Karin Correa Sheffer1 aFrazzon, Ana Paula Guedes1 aRoehe, Paulo Michel1 aFranco, Ana Cláudia0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2020 Mar., v. 67, no. 2 p.906-913dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl58702x1865-16747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tbed.134153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245013100178520145400309592002801763650001501791650002201806650001401828650002301842650001101865650001901876650001301895650001201908650001301920650004401933650001301977650001401990650002002004650001902024651001102043653001402054653002302068653001602091653002302107653001502130700002402145700002702169700002702196700002502223700002102248773010802269856008502377852000902462655001202471IND60672127320221118052725.0191231e20191201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067212732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carres.2019.1078312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiwińska, Małgorzata,10aStructural and serological characterization of the O82 antigen of a Proteus mirabilis strain isolated from a patient in Poland  aP. mirabilis strains Kro 45 and Kwy 46 were isolated from the pus and the muscular fluid, respectively, of a hospitalized 61-year-old female in Łódź, Poland. Both strains demonstrated a good swarming ability on a solid medium, and the Dienes test for differentiation of swarming strains indicated their identity. The strains were serologically identical and did not belong to any of the known Proteus O1-O81 serogroups. In this work, we studied the O-specific polysaccharide (O antigen) of P. mirabilis Kwy46, which defines the immunospecificity of the strain. The O-polysaccharide was obtained by mild acid degradation of the lipopolysaccharide, and the following structure of its oligosaccharide repeat (O-unit) was established by sugar analysis along with 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy: [Display omitted]where (S)-lac indicates an (S)-1-carboxyethyl group [an (S)-lactic acid residue], which forms an ether with a GlcNAc residue (so called glycolactilic acid). This structure is unique among Proteus O-polysaccharides but shares a trisaccharide fragment with that of P. mirabilis O5. Studies of the cross-reactivity between P. mirabilis Kwy 46 O antiserum/lipopolysaccharide and Proteus O1-O81 lipopolysaccharides/O antisera allowed identification of a putative Kwy 46 O-antigen epitope. Based on the data obtained, it is proposed to create a new O82 serogroup within the genus Proteus represented by the studied P. mirabilis isolates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aO-antigens 3aProteus mirabilis 3aantiserum 3abacterial motility 3acarbon 3across reaction 3aepitopes 3afemales 3amoieties 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3apatients 3aserotypes 3astable isotopes 3atrisaccharides 3aPoland 0aO antigen 0aLipopolysaccharide 0aLactic acid 0aGlycolactilic acid 0aSerotyping1 aLevina, Evgeniya A.1 aShashkov, Alexander S.1 aKalinchuk, Nadezhda A.1 aDrzewiecka, Dominika1 aKnirel, Yuriy A.0 tCarbohydrate research.g2019 Dec. 01, v. 486 p.107831-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45609x0008-62157nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carres.2019.1078313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03523naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245008500160300001800245500002000263520218700283592002802470650001902498650002802517650002002545650001502565650001802580650001902598650000902617650002502626650001202651650001202663650001702675650001002692650001602702650002602718650002302744650001302767650002402780700002102804700002402825773013202849856007502981852000903056655001203065IND60787157620221120080932.0220808e201908  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078715762DNAL7 a10.1002/jwmg.217172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Megan E.10aFactors affecting captive whooping crane egg fertility: A retrospective analysis  ap. 1377-1386.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe whooping crane (Grus americana) has been managed in captivity since the 1960s following a substantial genetic bottleneck in the wild population. Through major ex situ conservation efforts, there are 158 whooping cranes managed in North American institutions and chicks are released annually into the wild. Current reintroduction goals for the whooping crane however, are impeded by poor reproduction within the ex situ population, in part because of low egg fertility. Development of improved management techniques to overcome low egg fertility requires a better understanding of factors that influence egg fertility. We collected data for eggs laid at Patuxent Wildlife Research Center from 2005–2014 (n = 438 eggs; n = 23 pairs). We constructed 5 sets of generalized linear mixed‐models, with a Bernoulli‐distributed response variable (fertile or infertile), to address the effects of egg‐specific variables (month laid, sequence, and clutch order of the egg), life‐history events of the male and female (age, rearing method, wing condition, age at first pairing, age at current pairing, and female age at first laying), pair‐specific characteristics (kinship, years paired, chick‐rearing experience, and previous pairings), and captive management decisions (inclusion in the artificial insemination program and pair experience chick‐rearing) on the probability of egg fertility. Our results indicate that female‐specific factors (especially age, age at current pairing, and wing status) and pair‐specific factors of kinship, chick‐rearing experience, copulation, and inclusion in the artificial insemination program influenced fertile egg production. Specifically, the younger a female is when paired with her current social mate, the higher probability that her eggs will be fertile. Furthermore, high kinship reduced fertility, whereas chick‐rearing experience and artificial insemination of females with a donor male other than her social mate increased fertility. Further research on mate selection and reproductive mechanisms is needed to better understand egg laying and egg fertility in the whooping crane. © 2019 The Wildlife Society.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGrus americana 3aartificial insemination 3acaptive animals 3acopulation 3aegg fertility 3aegg production 3aeggs 3aex situ conservation 3afemales 3akinship 3alife history 3amales 3aprobability 3aretrospective studies 3astatistical models 3awildlife 3awildlife management1 aKeefer, Carol L.1 aSongsasen, Nucharin0 tjournal of wildlife management.g2019 Aug., v. 83, no. 6 p.1377-1386dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46144x0022-541X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jwmg.217173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01280naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001900151245007500170300001600245520026600261592002800527650001400555650001100569653000800580653000800588653004500596653002100641653001800662653002000680653002700700700002300727773009800750856008500848852000900933655001200942IND60609988620221123034019.0180824e201706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060998862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.econlet.2017.03.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRealdon, Marco10aLinear–quadratic term structure models for negative euro area yields  ap. 149-153.  aFour factor linear–quadratic models (LQTSM) fit negative Euro yields well, as short yields can be negative, but not the longest yields.

Among the different routes to alkyl amines, the catalytic hydroamination of alkenes with amines is of high interest mainly because it occurs in a 100% atom-economical fashion. To circumvent thermodynamic limitations, activated alkenes or activated amines are essentially employed in such reactions. To date, the catalytic hydroamination of cheap and abundant non-activated (linear) alkenes with ammonia, the simplest amine, remains an unsolved reaction by catalysis. This tutorial review covers the advances reported so far in the intermolecular hydroamination of non-activated linear alkenes with simple alkyl amines, with special interest in ammonia. Focusing on thermodynamics, catalysis and emerging technologies, we aim at providing new perspectives to look at this challenging reaction from a different point of view. In particular, we highlight that the generation of amino radicals from NH₃ using “physics activation” is a potential source of inspiration to (i) reduce energy barriers and (ii) reverse the regioselectivity to complete anti-Markovnikov addition.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkenes 3aammonia 3acatalytic activity 3aenergy 3aregioselectivity 3athermodynamics1 aJérôme, François0 tChemical Society reviews.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 50, no. 3 p.1512-1521dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:20471x1460-47447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c9cs00873j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245014600199300001400345500002000359520141600379592002801795596003101823596003901854596005401893596005501947596005902002596005902061650001102120650001302131650001002144650001102154650001302165700002002178700006102198700001802259700005902277700002102336700005902357700006002416773013802476856007402614852000902688655001202697IND60759847220221120214720.0211214e202201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075984722DNAL7 a10.1111/jbg.126432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilmot, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1075-088X10aDevelopment of a genomic tool for breed assignment by comparison of different classification models: Application to three local cattle breeds  ap. 40-61.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAssignment of individual cattle to a specific breed can often not rely on pedigree information. This is especially the case for local breeds for which the development of genomic assignment tools is required to allow individuals of unknown origin to be included to their herd books. A breed assignment model can be based on two specific stages: (a) the selection of breed‐informative markers and (b) the assignment of individuals to a breed with a classification method. However, the performance of combination of methods used in these two stages has been rarely studied until now. In this study, the combination of 16 different SNP panels with four classification methods was developed on 562 reference genotypes from 12 cattle breeds. Based on their performances, best models were validated on three local breeds of interest. In cross‐validation, 14 models had a global cross‐validation accuracy higher than 90%, with a maximum of 98.22%. In validation, best models used 7,153 or 2,005 SNPs, based on a partial least squares‐discriminant analysis (PLS‐DA) and assigned individuals to breeds based on nearest shrunken centroids. The average validation sensitivity of the first two best models for the three local breeds of interest were 98.33% and 97.5%. Moreover, results reported in this study suggest that further studies should consider the PLS‐DA method when selecting breed‐informative SNPs.  aPublisher supplied data  cService Public de Wallonie  cTerra Teaching and Research Centre  cAdministration of Technical Agricultural Services  a2.3.284cINTERREG V France‐Wallonie‐Vlaanderen  aT.0095.19cFonds De La Recherche Scientifique ‐ FNRS  aJ.0174.18cFonds De La Recherche Scientifique ‐ FNRS 3acattle 3agenomics 3aherds 3amodels 3apedigree1 aBormann, Jeanne1 aSoyeurt, Hélène1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9883-90471 aHubin, Xavier1 aGlorieux, Géry1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0380-28371 aMayeres, Patrick1 aBertozzi, Carlo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4602-38681 aGengler, Nicolas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5981-55090 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2022 Jan., v. 139, no. 1 p.40-61dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl57793x0931-26687nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jbg.126433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245007600184300001400260520110800274592002801382650001501410650001401425650001201439650001201451650001701463650001301480650001601493650001701509650001301526650001601539650001601555650003101571650002401602650001201626650003501638650002701673650001301700650002201713650006901735650002001804650002501824650002201849650004701871650007401918650001601992650004302008700002402051700002602075700001902101700002402120773011102144856004802255852000902303655001202312IND50071509520221118022431.0140101e201401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007150952DNAL7 a242650302pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-013-5383-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelosi, Paolo10aStructure and biotechnological applications of odorant-binding proteins  ap. 61-70.  aOdorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are small soluble polypeptides found in sensory organs of vertebrates and insects as well as in secretory glands and are dedicated to detection and release of chemical stimuli. OBPs of vertebrates belong to the family of lipocalin proteins, while those of insects are folded into α-helical domains. Both types of architectures are extremely stable to temperature, organic solvents and proteolytic digestion. These characteristics make OBPs suitable elements for fabricating biosensors to be used in the environment, as well as for other biotechnological applications. The affinity of OBPs for small volatile organic compounds is in the micromolar range, and they have broad specificity to a range of ligands. For biotechnological applications, OBPs can be expressed in bacterial systems at low cost and are easily purified. The large amount of information available on their structures and affinities to different molecules should allow the design of specific mutants with desired characteristics and represent a solid base for tailoring OBPs for different applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiosensors 3adigestion 3ainsects 3amutants 3apolypeptides 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3asense organs 3asolvents 3atemperature 3avertebrates 3avolatile organic compounds 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBiosensing Techniquesxmethods 2aBiotechnologyxmethods 2aInsecta. 2aModels, Molecular 2aMutant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Conformation 2aProtein Stability 2aReceptors, Odorantxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aVertebrates 2aVolatile Organic Compoundsxmetabolism1 aMastrogiacomo, Rosa1 aIovinella, Immacolata1 aTuccori, Elena1 aPersaud, Krishna C.0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2014 Jan., v. 98, no. 1 p.61-70dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-013-5383-y  aDNAL 7aarticle01872naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005700094040001800151100001800169245010600187300001600293520087100309592002801180653001501208653002301223653001501246653001401261653001701275700002001292700002301312773010901335856011701444852000901561655001201570IND60127300920221120234830.0151110e200406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012730092DNAL7 a10.1653/0015-4040(2004)087[0130:SDOGAG]2.0.CO;22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGraaf, J. de,10aSeasonal development of gryllotalpa africana(orthoptera: gryllotalpidae) on turfgrass in south africa  ap. 130-135.  aThe population dynamics (in terms of seasonal development) of Gryllotalpa africana Palisot de Beauvois was documented for the first time in South Africa. An irritant drench (soapy water solution) was used to quantify life stage occurrence on turfgrass over a one-year period. Oviposition took place from early October (spring), with eggs incubating for approximately three weeks. Nymphs reached the adult stage from March (late summer) and most individuals overwintered in this stage. Adult numbers peaked in early September (early spring), declining through spring. G. africana was therefore univoltine in the study area. The adult population was female biased in spring. The smallest nymphs and adults (in relation to mean length) were collected in December (early summer), while the smallest nymphs (in relation to mean length) occurred in November (late spring).  aPublisher supplied data 0aUnivoltine 0aspring oviposition 0alife stage 0aturfgrass 0amole cricket1 aSchoeman, A.

The Co₃O₄ having direct and indirect band gap energies of ca. 2.20 eV and ca. 1.35 eV can absorb visible light, generating photogenerated carriers and photoelectrons via the photoelectric effect. Upon exposure to visible light, the Co₃O₄ electrode exhibits ca. 30% higher current density than that under dark conditions and provides around 10–20% lower OER and ORR overpotentials than those under the dark conditions.

The peanut-soy milk (PSM11PSM—peanut-soy milk.) was inoculated with six different lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including probiotic strains and yeasts and fermentation was accomplished for 24h at 37°C and afterwards, another 24h at ±4°C. The Pediococcus acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1), Lactococcus lactis (CCT 0360), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LR 32) probiotic LAB, and the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (LB 340) yogurt starter culture reached cell concentrations of about 8.3logCFU/mL during fermentation. However, these strains were not able to acidify the substrate when inoculated as pure culture. The Lactobacillus acidophilus (LACA 4) probiotic produced significant amounts of lactic acid (3.35g/L) and rapidly lowered the pH (4.6). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (UFLA YFFBM 18.03) did not completely consume the available sugars in PSM and consequently produced low amounts of ethanol (0.24g/L). In pure culture, S. cerevisiae (UFLA YFFBM 18.03), L. rhamnosus (LR 32), L. acidophilus (LACA 4), and P. acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1) promoted the increase of total amino acids (48.02%, 47.32%, 46.21% and, 44.07%, respectively). However, when in co-cultured, the strains consumed the free amino acids favoring their growth, and reaching the population of 8logCFU/mL in PSM. Lactic acid production increased, and 12h was required to reach a pH value of 4.3. In general, the strains were more efficient in the use of available carbohydrates and release of metabolites in co-cultured than in single culture fermentations. An average of 58% and 78% of available carbohydrates was consumed when single and co-cultures were evaluated, respectively. Higher lactic acid contents were found in a binary culture of P. acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1) and L. acidophilus (LACA 4), and by co-culture of P. acidilactici (UFLA BFFCX 27.1), L. acidophilus (LACA 4) and S. cerevisiae (UFLA YFFBM 18.03) (9.03 and 8.51g/L, respectively). The final content of ethanol was 0.03% (v/v) or less, which classified the final beverage as non-alcoholic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 3aLactobacillus rhamnosus 3aLactococcus lactis 3aPediococcus acidilactici 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acids 3abeverages 3acoculture 3acultured milk starters 3aethanol 3afermentation 3afree amino acids 3alactic acid 3alactic acid bacteria 3ametabolites 3amilk 3apH 3aprobiotics 3asugars 3ayeasts 0aVegetable fermentation 0aLactic acid bacteria 0aYeasts 0aFunctional beverage 0aSoymilk 0aPeanut milk1 aLibeck, Bárbara da Silva1 aSchwan, Rosane Freitas0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2014 Sept. 01, v. 186 p.32-41dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl35565x0168-16057nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2014.06.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02496naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245009900165300002000264500001900284520134500303592002801648650002501676650001901701650002501720650001601745650001201761650002201773650001401795650001301809700001701822700001501839700005601854773013101910856008402041852000902125655001202134IND60710992820221117203056.0200915e20200812xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099282DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c027692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Cai10aMultichannel Stimulus-Responsive Nanoprobes for H₂O₂ Sensing in Diverse Biological Milieus  ap. 12639-12646.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aHydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is widely involved in various physiological or pathological processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, tumorigenesis, and immune responses. The accurate detection of H₂O₂ is highly required in many situations ranging from chemical sensing to biomedical diagnosis. However, it is exceedingly challenging to develop a single sensor that can respond to H₂O₂ in different conditions. Herein, a three-in-one stimulus-responsive nanoplatform (Au@MnO₂@Raman reporter) was designed for colorimetry/SERS/MR tri-channel H₂O₂ detection which satisfied different applications. The MnO₂ shell acted as a distance mediator between the gold nanoparticle (Au NP) core and the Raman reporter layer. In the presence of H₂O₂, the MnO₂ shell is degraded, thus releasing the Mn²⁺ and Au NP core, which act as magnetic resonance (MR) and colorimetry signals, respectively. Simultaneously, the Raman reporters adsorb on the exposed Au NPs, resulting in the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect. The Au NP-based colorimetric assay was employed as H₂O₂ sensors for glucose detection while the turn-on signals of SERS and MR were used for H₂O₂ sensing and imaging in live cells and tumors, showing great versatility and flexibility of the multichannel probes in diverse situations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3acarcinogenesis 3acell differentiation 3acolorimetry 3aglucose 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amagnetism 3ananogold1 aLiu, Xinzhuo1 aXu, Zhiwen1 aLiu, Dingbin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4153-98220 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 12, v. 92, no. 18 p.12639-12646dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c027693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03222naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100005500146245018700201300001600388520154300404592002801947650001401975650002601989650002202015650001702037650003102054650001802085650002202103650001502125650002402140650001402164650002002178650002202198650002202220650001402242650002402256650003602280653000902316653003202325653001102357700001902368700001802387700001402405700001602419700001602435700001902451773014502470856008002615852000902695655001202704IND60680933020221122142402.0200110e20191211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068093302DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b062942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBian, Yifei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8923-374810aProtective Effect of Kaempferol on LPS-Induced Inflammation and Barrier Dysfunction in a Coculture Model of Intestinal Epithelial Cells and Intestinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells  ap. 160-167.  aInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of intestinal mucosa and submucosa, characterized by the disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, increased production of inflammatory mediators, and excessive tissue injury. Intestinal epithelial cells, as well as microvascular endothelial cells, play important roles in IBD. To study the potential effects of kaempferol in IBD progress, we established a novel epithelial–endothelial cells coculture model to investigate the intestinal inflammation and barrier function. Data demonstrated an obvious increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) (1222 ± 60.40 Ω cm² vs 1371 ± 38.77 Ω cm²), decreased flux of FITC (180.8 ± 20.06 μg/mL vs 136.7 ± 14.78 μg/mL), and up-regulated occludin and claudin-2 expression in Caco-2 that was specifically cocultured with endothelial cells. Meanwhile, 80 μM kaempferol alleviated the drop of TEER, the increase of FITC flux, and the overexpression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) induced by 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Additionally, kaempferol also ameliorated the LPS-induced decrease of protein expression of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, and claudin-2, together with the inhibited protein expressions of the phosphorylation level of NF-κB and I-κB induced by LPS. Our results suggest that kaempferol alleviates the IL-8 secretion and barrier dysfunction of the Caco-2 monolayer in the LPS-induced epithelial–endothelial coculture model via inhibiting the NF-κB signaling pathway activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoculture 3aelectrical resistance 3aendothelial cells 3ainflammation 3ainflammatory bowel disease 3ainterleukin-8 3aintestinal mucosa 3akaempferol 3alipopolysaccharides 3aoccludins 3aphosphorylation 3aprotective effect 3aprotein synthesis 3asecretion 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 0aIL-8 0aintestinal barrier function 0aNF-κB1 aDong, Yuanyang1 aSun, Jingjing1 aSun, Meng1 aHou, Qihang1 aLai, Yujiao1 aZhang, Bingkun0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2019 Dec. 11, v. 68, no. 1 p.160-167dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:12177x1520-51187nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.9b062943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02185naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002500146245008100171300002000252520087700272592002801149650003701177650001401214650001301228650001301241650002601254650002201280650001101302650002301313650001601336650001101352650001501363700002301378700002701401700003101428700002701459700006201486773013801548856008001686852000901766655001201775IND60661471020221122232158.0190829e20190731xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066147102DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b057622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTaibarei, Nikolai O.10aCreation of Acceptor Centers in ZnO Single Crystals by Annealing in Sb Vapor  ap. 20769-20773.  aWe have investigated the influence of Sb on the carrier concentration of ZnO single crystals. ZnO single crystal substrates were doped in a sealed ampule by annealing in the Sb vapor at temperatures from 700 to 900 °C to create acceptor centers in ZnO. The dopant concentration profiles were determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry. A significant distinction in dopant concentrations as well as depth of penetration was observed for different temperatures of annealing. Electrical properties of the samples were studied by the Hall Effect and resistivity measurements. Valence states of Sb in the samples were investigated by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy method to prove the incorporation of the latter in the matrix of ZnO before and after oxygen annealing. The evolution of the carrier concentration of ZnO along with the valence state of Sb is explained.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aannealing 3aantimony 3acrystals 3aelectrical properties 3amass spectrometry 3aoxygen 3aphysical chemistry 3atemperature 3avapors 3azinc oxide1 aKytin, Vladimir G.1 aKupriyanov, Eugenii E.1 aKulbachinskii, Vladimir A.1 aMakhiboroda, Maksim A.1 aBaranov, Andrei N.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4469-63050 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2019 July 31, v. 123, no. 34 p.20769-20773dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.9b057623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01499naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001900152245016000171300001600331520061800347592002800965650001100993650003101004650001101035650001201046773008001058856008601138852000901224655001201233IND60084993520221118085043.0141101e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008499352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apenergy.2012.10.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmyth, Russell10aAre fluctuations in energy variables permanent or transitory?

In the proposed method, 3-picoline is simultaneously used as a complexing agent and an extraction solvent. Initially to 25 mL of the aqueous sample containing the analytes, 3-picoline is added to complex the studied cations. Then sodium chloride is added to this homogeneous solution. After manual shaking, the tube is placed in a water bath. Due to the decrease of 3-picoline solubility in water at high temperatures, a cloudy solution is formed. The fine droplets of 3-picoline containing cation–picoline complexes are collected on the top of the aqueous phase by centrifuging. The enriched analytes in the upper phase are determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry. Several variables possibly affecting the extraction efficiency were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum conditions the calibration curves were linear in the ranges of 10–150 and 5–125 ng L⁻¹ for cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii), respectively. The detection limits were obtained to be 3.8 and 2.2 ng L⁻¹ for cobalt(ii) and nickel(ii), respectively. Finally, the proposed method has been successfully applied for simultaneous analysis of the analytes in different environmental aqueous samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatomic absorption spectrometry 3acations 3achemical species 3acobalt 3adetection limit 3adroplets 3aliquid-phase microextraction 3anickel 3asodium chloride 3asolubility 3asolvents 3atemperature1 aFarajzadeh, Mir Ali1 aNasiri, Hanieh0 tAnalytical methods.g2019 Mar. 7, v. 11, no. 10 p.1379-1386dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8ay02767f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245010500159300001600264520107400280592002801354650002101382650002301403650001701426650001601443650001301459650001801472650002601490650001101516650002101527650001101548650002601559653003001585653002701615653001501642653003301657700001501690700001301705700005401718773014501772856008001917852000901997655001202006IND60680933120221122121535.0200110e20191211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068093312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jafc.9b063302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Han10aEnhancement of Sulfur Conversion Rate in the Production of l-Cysteine by Engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 250-257.  aCysteine is a commercially important sulfur-containing amino acid widely used as a supplement in the agricultural and food industries. It is extremely desirable to achieve a high sulfur conversion rate in the fermentation-based cysteine production. Here, the metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli was performed to enhance the sulfur conversion rate in cysteine biosynthesis. Accordingly, the reduction of sulfur loss by the regulator decR and its yhaOM operons were deleted. serACB was integrated into chromosome with constitutive promoter to coordinately increase sulfur utilization. The sulfur assimilation pathways and sulfur transcriptional regulator cysB were overexpressed to regulate sulfur metabolism and enhance sulfur conversion significantly. After the process optimization in fed-batch fermentation, LH16 [SLH02 ΔyhaM Ptrc1-serACB-cysM-nrdH-(pLH03, pTrc99a-cysB)] produced 7.5 g/L of cysteine with a sulfur conversion rate of 90.11%.

However, compared with smart phones and tablet PCs, which are huge successes in the market, smart TV has grown more slowly than the market expected and has not really changed the TV market. In this study, we investigate reasons for the failure of smart TV from consumer perspectives. We use conjoint analysis to collect stated preference data from consumers. Our analysis consists of two parts: analyzing consumer preferences for six attributes of smart TVs and examining the effects of socio-demographic and behavioral information on purchase intention for a smart TV. Based on the estimation results from the first part, we find that consumers set a higher value on the traditional characteristics of TV than on the functions of smart TV. Thus, smart TV does not have key functions to encourage its adoption over traditional TV. From the second part of our analysis, we identify which factor is most important to increase purchase intention for a smart TV. Based on our results, we can suggest the direction of market strategies about how to cross the chasm of smart TV.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer software 3aconsumer preferences 3amarkets 3amobile telephones 3atelevision1 aPark, Yuri1 aLee, Daeho0 tSustainability.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 7, no. 12 p.15955-15966dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su712157973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245006200177300001600239520100500255592002801260650001701288650001001305650001901315650000901334650000901343650002801352650002201380650002401402650001601426650002701442650001101469650001601480653001801496653001901514653001901533653002101552700002101573700002001594773013001614856008401744852000901828655001201837IND60121719820221117171402.0150324e20140101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012171982DNAL7 a10.1080/10408398.2011.5870372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVallons, Katleen J.

The effect of high pressure on starch has been explored by many researchers using a wide range of techniques. In general, heat and pressure have similar effects: if sufficiently high, they both induce gelatinization of starch in excess water, resulting in a transition of the native granular structure to a starch paste or gel. However, there are significant differences in the structural and rheological properties between heated and pressurized starches. These differences offer benefits with respect to new product development. However, in order to implement high-pressure technology to starch and starch-containing products, a good understanding of the mechanism of pressure-induced gelatinization is necessary. Studies that are published in this area are reviewed, and the similarities and differences between starches gelatinized by pressure and by temperature are summarized.  aPublisher supplied data 3afood science 3afoods 3agelatinization 3agels 3aheat 3ahigh pressure treatment 3anutrition science 3aproduct development 3aresearchers 3arheological properties 3astarch 3atemperature 0aHigh pressure 0aretrogradation 0aphase diagrams 0aglass transition1 aRyan, Liam A.

Inoculated (AMF+) and non-inoculated (AMF−) tomato plants were subjected to three levels of NaCl salinity (0, 50, and 100 mM·NaCl). Seven days after transplanting, plants were analyzed for dry matter and RGR of whole plants and root systems. Leaf tissue was analyzed for mineral concentration before and after transplanting; leaf nutrient content and relative uptake rates (RUR) were calculated. AMF inoculation did not affect plant dry matter or RGR under fresh water-irrigation. The growth rate of AMF−plants did significantly decline under both moderate (77%) and severe (61%) salt stress compared to the fresh water-irrigated controls, while the decline was much less (88% and 75%,respectively)and statistically non-significant in salt-stressed AMF+ plants. Interestingly, root system dry matter of AMF+ plants (0.098 g plant–1) remained significantly greater under severe soil salinity compared to non-inoculated seedlings (0.082 g plant–1). The relative uptake rates of N, P, Mg, Ca, Mn, and Fe were enhanced in inoculated tomato seedlings and remained higher under (moderate) salt stress compared to AMF− plants This study suggests that inoculation with commercial AMF during nursery establishment contributes to alleviation of salt stress by maintaining a favorable nutrient profile. Therefore, nursery inoculation seems to be a viable solution to attenuate the effects of increasing soil salinity levels, especially in greenhouses with low natural abundance of AMF spores.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlomus 3acalcium 3agreenhouses 3airon 3aleaves 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3amineral content 3anutrient content 3anutrient uptake 3aroot systems 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3aseedlings 3asodium chloride 3asoil salinity 3aspores 3atomatoes1 aSallaku, Glenda1 aRewald, Boris0 tSustainability.g2015 Dec. 02, v. 7, no. 12 p.15967-15981dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su712157993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03056naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245015200168300001400320520164500334592002801979650002002007650001302027650001902040650001202059650001302071650000802084650001202092650001102104650001502115650001602130650001902146650000902165653002802174653001002202653002102212653001202233653001102245653002802256653000902284700002102293700002002314700001802334700002602352773009402378856008102472852000902553655001202562IND60545052420221119194943.0160901e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054505242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoerg, Philip C.10aComputation of a distributed glacier surface albedo proxy using airborne laser scanning intensity data and in-situ spectro-radiometric measurements  ap. 31-42.  aIn recent years, multi-temporal topographic measurements from airborne laser scanning (ALS) have been increasingly used as a source of spatially explicit and accurate information to calculate geodetic glacier mass balances. Simultaneous to collecting topographic data, most ALS instruments record the backscattered intensity for each laser emission and therefore provide additional information on the reflectance characteristics of the surveyed surface. Along with air temperature, the surface albedo of snow and ice was identified as a major driving factor of glacier melt. Consequently, better knowledge on the spatial distribution of the glacier albedo could substantially improve energy balance based glacier melt modeling. In this study, we collected on-glacier spectro-radiometric and albedometer measurements to serve as a ground reference to radiometrically calibrate high resolution ALS intensity data into a distributed albedo proxy map. This method resulted in an albedo proxy with values between 0.6 on the glacier tongue and 0.9 on fresh snow in high altitudes. 99.6% of all values fell within the albedo boundary conditions, i.e. values between 0 and 1. Corrected near-infrared ALS intensity data provided a distributed product that allows simulating albedo in glacier energy and mass balance models more realistically. Remaining challenges are (i) a different surface albedo response in the visual part of the electro-magnetic spectrum, (ii) the low radiometric resolution of the ALS system for higher intensity values, and (iii) an insufficient correction of the snow bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF).  aPublisher supplied data 3aair temperature 3aaltitude 3aenergy balance 3ageodesy 3aglaciers 3aice 3amelting 3amodels 3aradiometry 3areflectance 3aremote sensing 3asnow 0aAirborne laser scanning 0aLiDAR 0aSignal intensity 0aGlacier 0aAlbedo 0aRadiometric calibration 0aBRDF1 aWeyermann, Jörg1 aMorsdorf, Felix1 aZemp, Michael1 aSchaepman, Michael E.0 tRemote sensing of environment.g2015 Apr., v. 160 p.31-42dElsevier Inc.x0034-42577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rse.2014.12.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245008900165300002000254500001900274520159600293592002801889650000801917650001501925650001601940650001201956650002501968650001601993650002302009650001302032650001002045650001102055650001302066650002102079650002202100650001202122700001802134700001702152700001802169700001502187700002202202700005902224773013102283856008402414852000902498655001202507IND60710993220221117203134.0200915e20200825xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071099322DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.analchem.0c028952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jie10aColorable Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks for Colorimetric Detection of Biomolecules  ap. 12670-12677.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe report a series of colorable zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-based nanomaterials prepared by encapsulating starches (amylopectin, dextrin, or amylose) or tannic acid in the frameworks of ZIFs and first applied them in colorimetric assay of microRNA/DNA by adding I₂/KI or FeCl₃ solutions as chromogenic reagents. We found that iodine molecules can lead to rapid degradation of the ZIF-8 framework, while ZIF-90 remains stable. Therefore, ZIF-90 was selected for encapsulating the starches or tannic acid, and then assembled with polyethylenimine (PEI) and aptamers of microRNA/DNA. After interacting with the target microRNA/DNA, the aptamers (Ap) move away from the surface of the prepared Ap–starch@ZIF-90 or Ap–tan@ZIF-90, and the I₂/KI or FeCl₃ solution is added into the system to interact the starches (amylopectin, dextrin, or amylose) or tannic acid to generate different colors. According to the absorbance spectra, good linear correlations between the logarithm of absorbance intensity and the concentration of microRNA (1–180 nM) can be observed, and the naked eye can distinguish the change from ∼60 to ∼180 nM with a concentration gradient of 20 nM. A similar colorimetric assay ability for pathogenic bacteria can also be realized by detecting the gene fragments IS200 and eaeA. The detection limits can be potentially optimized by changing the amount of adsorbed PEI and aptamers on the surface of Ap–starch@ZIF-90 (or Ap–tan@ZIF-90) nanoparticles. This method could be a promising alternative for simple and cost-effective assay of microRNA/DNA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aabsorbance 3aamylopectin 3aamylose 3aanalytical chemistry 3acolorimetry 3acost effectiveness 3adextrins 3agenes 3aiodine 3amicroRNA 3aoligonucleotides 3apolyethyleneimine 3atannins1 aWang, Xing-Yu1 aWang, Yi-Hui1 aWang, Dan-Dan1 aSong, Zhen1 aZhang, Chang-Dong1 aWang, Huai-Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7892-018X0 tAnalytical chemistry.g2020 Aug. 25, v. 92, no. 18 p.12670-12677dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:jnl70375x1520-68827nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c028953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01738naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131245007400149300001600223520067800239650002200917650000900939650001800948650001900966650002800985650002301013650001501036650001601051650001101067651001701078700002101095700002101116700002001137773017201157856005001329852000901379655001201388IND60585017820221122141909.0171031e198812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058501782DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-51.12.9762doi  aAGLbengcAGL14aThe Shelf Life of Pasteurized Fresh Milk Manufactured in Saudi Arabia  ap. 976-978.  aThe keeping quality of pasteurized fresh milk was investigated.

The three species were inoculated singly or as a mixture, incubated for up to 7 d, and analyzed for viable counts, pH values and the amounts of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) produced. Incubation temperatures were 5, 15 and 25°C. When each species was separately inoculated, C. lipolytica showed slower growth than that of the two bacterial species, but TVB-N production in the homogenates increased to level that indicated spoilage. The TVB-N exceeded the concentration corresponding to the threshold value of spoilage on d 4 at 15°C or on d 2 at 25°C. The TVB-N values in the C. lipolytica inoculated homogenates reached 112 and 215 mg per 100 g of homogenate on d 7 at 15 and 25°C, respectively. On these occasions the respective pH values were 7.9 and 8.1, and the homogenates inoculated with the yeast showed spoilage emitting an ammoniacal odor. In general, TVB-N production by C. lipolytica was slightly less than that by P. fluorescens, but much more than that by S. epidermidis. The TVB-N curves obtained from the mixed cultures containing the three species were very similar to those obtained from the single cultures of P. fluorescens. Viable counts of the individual strains in the mixed cultures showed that the yeast strain grew independently without being suppressed by the growth of the two bacterial strains, and even 3 weeks after incubation the survival counts of the yeast strain were higher than those of the bacterial strain at 15 and 25°C, respectively. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3aStaphylococcus epidermidis 3aYarrowia lipolytica 3abacteria 3amixed culture 3aodors 3apH 3aplate count 3aspoilage 3asquid 3atemperature 3atotal volatile basic nitrogen 3ayeasts1 aTonogai, Yasuhide1 aIto, Yoshio0 tJournal of food protection.g1988 Dec., v. 51, no. 12 p.971-975dInternational Association of Milk, Food, and Environmental Sanitarians.wJournal:2024x0362-028X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4315/0362-028X-51.12.971  aDNAL 7aarticle04014naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245012500174300001600299500002400315520239700339650001802736650001602754650001502770650001602785650002002801650002002821650001902841650001602860650002002876650001302896650002002909650002202929650001202951651001802963653001802981653002202999653002203021653002203043653001603065653002603081653003803107653001903145653002603164653001903190700002503209700002303234700002103257700001603278773010203294852000903396856005503405655001203460IND4392441420221122141852.0070617e200707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439244142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2007.01236.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFridley, Jason D.10aCo-occurrence based assessment of habitat generalists and specialists: a new approach for the measurement of niche width  ap. 707-722.  aIncludes references  a1 Much ecological theory is based on the characterization of ecological habits of species as 'generalist' or 'specialist', but standard measures for placing species along a generalist-specialist gradient do not exist. 2 We introduce a method for quantifying habitat specialization (i.e. relative niche widths) using species co-occurrence data. Generalists should co-occur with many species, whereas specialists should co-occur with relatively few species, given equal plot occurrences. We quantify this concept using a generalist-specialist metric (θ) derived from a beta diversity statistic. 3 We evaluate the ability of our generalist-specialist metric to correctly rank species according to simulated (known) niche widths. Our technique is generally robust to a wide variety of niche distribution structures and sampling designs, but surveys strongly biased toward certain habitats can undermine the ability of θ to accurately describe niche widths for underrepresented species. 4 We apply our technique to three spatially nested surveys of the large woody flora (> 1 cm d.b.h.) of the south-eastern USA. For each dataset we rank the generalist-specialist tendencies of all species of non-trivial occurrences, including 113 species across the Southeast, 71 species of southern Appalachian forests, and 44 species of the 6800-ha Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness Area (NC and TN, USA). 5 Rankings of species'θ-values were generally consistent among datasets of different spatial extent. Generalist species (e.g. Ilex opaca, Ulmus rubra, Morus rubra, Prunus serotina, Acer rubrum) were often those with large geographical ranges, particularly for θ-values from the largest dataset, and overall were more likely to be bird-dispersed, deciduous, and shade tolerant. South-eastern specialist species (e.g. Taxodium spp., Abies fraseri, Quercus laevis, Pinus pungens, Pinus palustris) were those associated with stressful or unusual conditions, such as a long duration of flooding, high fire frequency, or extreme cold or dry climates. 6 Our study demonstrates that increasingly available, large-survey datasets can contribute niche-related species information in the absence of detailed environmental or habitat measurements. Applications include new assessments of relationships between species traits, ecological and environmental tolerances, and species packing in different assemblages. 3aAbies fraseri 3aAcer rubrum 3aIlex opaca 3aMorus rubra 3aPinus palustris 3aPrunus serotina 3aQuercus laevis 3aUlmus rubra 3adata collection 3ahabitats 3ashade tolerance 3aspecies diversity 3asurveys 3aUnited States 0aniche breadth 0ahabitat selection 0ahabitat diversity 0asouth-east U.S.A. 0awoody flora 0asouthern Appalachians 0aJoyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness 0abeta diversity 0aadditive partitioning 0aecoinformatics1 aVANDERMAST, DAVID B.1 aKUPPINGER, DANE M.1 aMANTHEY, MICHAEL1 aPeet, R.

Lam., 'Beniazuma'] plantlets were grown photoautotrophically (without sugar) for 12 days in an improved forced ventilation system designed with air distribution pipes for uniform spatial distributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. Enriched CO2 conditions and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) were provided at 1500 micromol(.)mol-1 and 150 micromol(.)m-2(.)s-1, respectively. The forced (F) ventilation treatments were designated high (FH), medium (FM), and low (FL), corresponding to ventilation rates of 23 mL(.)s-1 (1.40 inch3/s), 17 mL(.)s-1 (1.04 inch3/s), and 10 mL(.)s-1 (0.61 inch3/s), respectively, on day 12. The natural (N) ventilation treatment was extremely low (NE) at 0.4 mL(.)s-1 (0.02 inch3/s), relative to the forced ventilation treatments. Total soluble sugar (TSS) and starch content were determined on day 12. Total soluble sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose) of FH plantlets were lowest in leaf tissue and highest in stem tissue as compared to other ventilation treatments. Starch concentration was higher in leaf tissue of FH or FM plantlets as compared to that of FL or NE plantlets. Plantlets subjected to FH or FM treatments exhibited significantly higher net photosynthetic rates (NPR) than those of the other treatments; and on day 12, NPR was almost five times higher in the FH or FM treatment than the FL or NE treatments. Carbohydrate concentration of plantlets was also influenced by the position of the plantlets in the vessel. Within the forced ventilation vessels, leaf TSS of FH and FM plantlets was similar regardless of whether plantlets were located near the inlet or outlet of CO2 enriched air. However, under FH of FM conditions, leaf starch concentration was higher in plantlets located closest to the CO2 inlet as compared to the outlet. 3aventilation systems 3aIpomoea batatas 3amicropropagation 3acarbon dioxide 3aregrowth 3alight intensity 3aequipment 3aair flow 3asucrose 3aglucose 3afructose 3astarch 3aleaves 3astems 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant physiology 3aculture media 3adesign 3aplant cuttings 3achemical constituents of plants 0agrowth 0aplanting stock1 aHeo, J.1 aKubota, C.1 aKozai, Toyoki,d1943-0 tHortTechnology.g2001 , v. 11, no. 1 p.95-99wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02300naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245004000126300001600166500013400182500001500316520122600331650001001557650001901567650001701586650002401603650002601627650002501653650001101678650002001689650001001709653001101719653001601730700001801746773008201764852000901846930003301855945001301888946001301901655001201914IND2324473920221122045719.0011214e200110  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232447392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiles, C.A.10aPromoting and marketing Asian crops  ap. 517-519.  aPaper presented at the "Workshop on Asian Horticultural Crops in North America" held July 23-26, 2000, Lake Buena Vista, Florida.  a2019-12-05  aAsian crops can provide growers with a means to diversify crop production and marketing options. However, before expanding into Asian crops, growers should determine consumer expectations regarding a new crop. Existing market criteria for each crop (i.e., maturity, color, size, shape) must be considered for all markets including traditional Asian use as well as for the general North American market. If growers decide to target general consumers in North America, then consumer awareness and acceptance must be addressed in a marketing and promotion program. Extension publications, popular magazines, and newspapers are useful tools in a marketing and promotion program. Crop production information must be available to enable growers to successfully produce Asian crops. Yet, most growers are unlikely to invest heavily in new production equipment and systems until a market has been established for the crop. It is a challenge for university scientists and extension agents to concurrently create supply and demand for new Asian crops. To accomplish this, multidisciplinary teams that include university and community experts should initiate a diversified program of Asian crop production, promotion, and marketing. 3afoods 3afood marketing 3apublications 3aextension education 3aeducational materials 3aconsumer preferences 3asupply 3amarket analysis 3acrops 0ademand 0aperiodicals1 aAlleman, D.G.0 tHortTechnology.g2001 , v. 11, no. 4 p.517-519wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02155naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008800126300001600214500001500230520118600245650001801431650001401449650002301463650001101486650002601497650001501523650002601538650001101564650001101575653001001586700002101596700001401617773008201631852000901713930003301722945001301755946001301768655001201781IND2324475420221122045723.0011214e200110  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232447542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaust, J.E.10aEffects of paclobutrazol drench application date on poinsettia height and flowering  ap. 557-560.  a2019-12-05  aExperiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of paclobutrazol drenches on poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) 'Freedom Red' height and flowering. In 1997 and 1998, paclobutrazol drenches [(a.i.) 0.118 mg/container; (28,350 mg = 1.0 oz)] were applied to poinsettias grown under natural photoperiods on four dates from 1 Oct. to 2 Nov. On plants receiving the paclobutrazol drench application during the second week in October, bract area was reduced by 15% and 12% compared with that of the control in 1997 and 1998, respectively; however, the bract area reduction was commercially acceptable. Anthesis date was not significantly affected during either year. Plant height and internode length measurements indicate that paclobutrazol drench applications had both a rapid and a long-term impact on poinsettia stem elongation. Paclobutrazol drenches applied in late October or early November are an effective tool for controlling late-season stem elongation of 'Freedom Red' poinsettias grown under natural photoperiods. These late-season applications have the least risk for negatively affecting bract size while still reducing stem elongation in the last few weeks of the crop. 3apaclobutrazol 3aflowering 3aapplication timing 3abracts 3aEuphorbia pulcherrima 3ainternodes 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3alength 0astems1 aKorczynski, P.C.1 aKlein, R.0 tHortTechnology.g2001 , v. 11, no. 4 p.557-560wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02826naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245012200131300001600253520185300269650001202122650002402134650002602158650001502184650001602199650002402215650001702239650001502256650002702271653001002298700001802308773008202326852000902408930003302417945001302450946001302463655001202476IND2207229520221122041105.0001012e200007  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220722952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLineberger, S.E.10aSchool gardens: can a hands-on teaching tool affect students' attitudes and behaviors regarding fruit and vegetables?  ap. 593-597.  aNutrition in the Garden is a garden program designed to help teachers integrate nutrition education into their classroom using a hands-on tool, the garden. The objectives of this research project were to 1) develop a garden activity guide to help teachers integrate nutrition education, specifically as it relates to fruit and vegetables, into their curricula, 2) evaluate whether students developed more positive attitudes towards fruit and vegetables by participating in the garden program, and 3) evaluate whether students developed better nutritional behavior by eating more fruit and vegetables after participating in the garden program. Students' nutritional attitudes regarding fruit and vegetables were measured with a fruit and vegetable preference questionnaire divided into three sections targeting vegetables, fruit, and fruit and vegetable snacks. Students' nutritional behaviors regarding fruit and vegetables were evaluated through 24-hour recall journals. After gardening, students' attitudes towards vegetables became significantly more positive. In contrast, no differences were detected in attitudes towards fruit. Students also had more positive attitudes towards fruit and vegetable snacks after gardening, with female students and younger students having the greatest improvement in snack attitude scores. Even though school gardening improved students' attitudes towards vegetables, fruit and vegetable consumption of students did not significantly improve due to gardening. Overall, the average daily fruit and vegetable consumption of the students participating in the Nutrition in the Garden study was 2.0 servings per day. This falls short of the estimated national average for daily fruit and vegetable consumption for this age group (3.4 servings) and extremely short of the nationally recommended 5.0 servings per day. 3agardens 3anutrition education 3anutrition information 3avegetables 3afood intake 3aeducational methods 3afood choices 3acurriculum 3aattitudes and opinions 0afruit1 aZajicek, J.M.0 tHortTechnology.g2000 , v. 10, no. 3 p.593-597wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02932naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006000125300001600185500011800201500001500319520181100334650001302145650001402158650001402172650001302186650002002199650001202219650001202231650001602243650002402259650001302283650002002296650002202316651001802338653001602356773008202372852000902454930003302463945001302496946001302509655001202522IND2206390020221121093258.0000812e200001  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220639002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWood, B.W.10aPollination characteristics of pecan trees and orchards  ap. 120-126.  aProceedings of the Workshop on Pollination of nut crops: Practices and problems, July 11-16, 1998, Charlotte, NC.  a2019-12-05  aThere is increasing evidence of substantial pollination related crop losses by pecan [Carya illinoensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch] orchards. These most likely occur in block-type orchards consisting of only one or two cultivars, but can also occur at locations with a great number of different genotypes nearby. Main crop cultivars should generally be within about two rows of pollinizers to ensure cross-pollination. Thus, block widths exceeding about four rows between pollinizers are especially likely to exhibit serious pollination problems. Scattered trees of off-type genotypes are potentially of major importance as backup orchard pollinizers. Tree age/size and spring temperatures influence the characteristics of flower maturity windows and are probably primary factors contributing to pollination-related fruit-set losses in many block-type orchards. Flower maturity tends to be earlier in older/larger trees while warmer springs accelerate catkin development relative to that of pistillate flowers. Because of substantial variability in relative differences associated with initiation and duration of flower maturity windows within either protandrous or protogynous flowering types (i.e., Type I or II), selection of complementary pollinizers should be based on the relatively high resolution 30-class flowering classification system rather than the traditional low resolution 2-class system. Other factors sometime causing pollination related crop losses are either abnormally wet weather or strong dry winds during the pollination period or abnormally warm or cool springs. Pollination problems can be visually detected by noting premature non insect related post pollination fruit drop or diminishing fruit set with increasing distance from pollinator trees or off-type genotypes within the orchard. 3aorchards 3acultivars 3aflowering 3atree age 3aair temperature 3aflowers 3aweather 3acrop losses 3aCarya illinoinensis 3agenotype 3acrop management 3across pollination 3aUnited States 0apollination0 tHortTechnology.g2000 , v. 10, no. 1 p.120-126wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02018naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011500128300001600243500001500259520087700274650001701151650001301168650001701181650002001198650002001218650001801238650001701256650002201273650001501295650001001310650001601320650002101336650001001357651001701367653001501384653002201399653001301421773008201434852000901516930003301525945001301558946001301571655001201584IND2206390820221121064945.0000812e200001  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220639082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaterer, D.R.10aEffect of soil mulches and herbicides on production economics of warm season vegetable crops in a cool climate  ap. 154-159.  a2019-12-05  aThe efficacy and cost efficiency of using various plastic soil mulches in the production of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), corn (Zea mays L.) and muskmelon (Cucumis melo L.) were examined over four growing seasons in Saskatchewan, Canada. Clear mulch with or without preemergent herbicides was compared with black or wavelength selective mulches. In all three crops, mulches enhanced yields relative to bare ground in most site-year combinations. Clear mulch usually produced the highest yields. Herbicides applied under the clear plastic provided effective weed control with no observable changes in product efficacy or toxicity to the crop. The weed control provided by the herbicides had no effect on yields in the clear mulch treatments. Consequently, clear mulch without added herbicide usually represented the most cost-effective production option for all three crops. 3aplastic film 3aZea mays 3aweed control 3asolar radiation 3aCapsicum annuum 3aphytotoxicity 3aCucumis melo 3acosts and returns 3acrop yield 3aweeds 3awavelengths 3aclimatic factors 3alight 3aSaskatchewan 0aevaluation 0aeconomic analysis 0aefficacy0 tHortTechnology.g2000 , v. 10, no. 1 p.154-159wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03037naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008200126300001600208500001500224520164600239650002801885650002001913650001301933650001701946650002001963650001001983650001601993650003602009650001902045650001602064650002702080653002402107653001802131653002402149653002202173653002502195653002502220653002002245653001002265700001602275700001702291773017902308852000902487930003302496945001302529946001302542655001202555IND2332136220221121064924.0030422e200211  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233213622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlsen, R.T.10aPhotosynthetic responses of container-grown Illicium L. taxa to sun and shade  ap. 919-924.  a2019-12-05  aIlliciums, or star-anises, have increased in popularity in the nursery and landscape industries. However, confusion exists as to which taxa are tolerant of high light intensities during production and subsequent establishment in the landscape. We investigated the effect of two light intensity treatments, 45% and 100% full sunlight, on gas-exchange parameters of five Illicium taxa: Illicium anisatum L., I. floridanum Ellis. 'Pebblebrook', I. henryi Diels., I. lanceolatum A.C. Sm., and I. parviflorum Michx. Ex. Vent. 'Forest Green'. Light-response curves were determined for individual leaves, and mean response parameters calculated. Chlorophyll and total carotenoids were analyzed after extraction in acetone, with total chlorophyll also estimated with a SPAD chlorophyll meter. In general, highest rates of CO2 assimilation (A(max)) and lowest rates of dark respiration (R(d)) were found in the 45% light treatment for all taxa. Both Illicium anisatum and I. floridanum 'Pebblebrook' had substantial reductions in A(max) in 100% light, 94% and 81% respectively, compared to plants grown in the 45% light treatment. Illicium henryi failed to survive the 100% light treatment. Illicium lanceolatum and I. parviflorum 'Forest Green' were least affected by the 100% light treatment. Severe photooxidative bleaching was noted and confirmed by SPAD and pigment data, although SPAD readings were a poor predictor of total chlorophyll. For taxa of Illicium in our study, photosynthetic gas-exchange parameters and foliage pigment characteristics were improved in the low light treatment, suggesting optimal growth occurs in shaded conditions. 3ainterspecific variation 3asolar radiation 3aIllicium 3agas exchange 3alight intensity 3ashade 3acarotenoids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aphotosynthesis 3achlorophyll 3acontainer-grown plants 0aspecies differences 0aestablishment 0aillicium floridanum 0aillicium anisatum 0aillicium lanceolatum 0aillicium parviflorum 0aillicium henryi 0alight1 aRuter, J.M.1 aRieger, M.W.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2002 Nov., v. 127, no. 6 p.919-924aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02675naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245016800134300001600302520146500318650001901783650002101802650002801823650001101851650001001862650002001872650003001892650003701922650001901959700002001978700002001998700001702018700001902035773017902054852000902233930003302242945001302275946001302288655001202301IND2332136120221121064853.0030422e200211  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233213612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVanden Heuvel, J.E.10aTranslocation and partitioning patterns of 14C photoassimilate from light- and shade-adapted shoots in greenhouse-grown 'Chardonnay' grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.)  ap. 912-918.  aPotted 'Chardonnay' grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) with either two or three shoots were grown in a greenhouse for one month and then transferred to a phytotron room, where either one or two shoots were shaded. Twenty-four days after transfer, leaves at the fifth node of either the light-adapted or shade-adapted shoot were exposed to a 2-hour pulse of 14CO2. Both light environment and number of shade shoots on the vine had a significant effect on photosynthate partitioning within the plant following a 22-hour chase. Leaves fed with 14CO2 on a light-adapted shoot translocated 26.1% and 12.7% more radioactivity to the roots and trunk, respectively, than leaves from shade-adapted shoots. Photosynthates were exported from light-adapted leaves to shade-adapted shoots (1.3% of total 14C in plant). The number of shaded shoots and the light environment of the fed leaf had a large effect on partitioning of photosynthates among ethanol-insoluble, water-soluble, and chloroform-soluble fractions within the leaf. Recovered 14C in the water-soluble fraction of the fed leaf appeared to be affected more by number of shoots than by light environment of the fed leaf. The data suggest that there is a sink effect on initial carbon partitioning patterns in grapevine leaves. Sink strength may have a greater role than light environment. A large proportion of interior leaves versus exterior leaves may be costly with respect to the carbohydrate budget of a vine. 3aVitis vinifera 3aisotope labeling 3adry matter partitioning 3ashoots 3ashade 3astable isotopes 3asource-sink relationships 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aphotosynthates1 aLeonardos, E.D.1 aProctor, J.T.A.1 aFisher, K.H.1 aSullivan, J.A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2002 Nov., v. 127, no. 6 p.912-918aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20030627b20030708c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03194naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006500125300001600190500008300206520197900289650001602268650001502284650002302299650001302322650001902335650001902354650002602373650001802399650002102417650002402438650001502462650001802477650002202495650001602517651000902533653001402542653001302556653002902569773008202598852000902680930003302689945001302722946001302735655001202748IND2330765220221121064910.0030211e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233076522DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDelate, K.10aUsing an agroecological approach to farming systems research  ap. 345-354.  aPaper presented at ASHS-2000 held July 23-26, 2000, Lake Buena Vista, Florida.  aSales of organic products reached $8 billion in the U.S. in 2000, continuing the nearly decade-long trend of 20% annual growth. In Iowa alone, organic production for all crops was 5265 ha (13,000 acres) in 1995 but 60,750 ha (150,000 acres) in 1999. Despite the growth in organic agriculture, our knowledge of organic farming systems remains limited. We have adopted a systems theory approach in our current research program at Iowa State University (ISU) to help address this gap in understanding. Systems theory holds that biological systems, such as agroecosystems, consist of integrated units of people, plants, animals, soil, insects and microorganisms, and each subsystem provides feedback to the other. In order to obtain input on research questions and experimental design, the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture and ISU held six focus groups across Iowa in 1998 before long-term site establishment. Producers and agricultural professionals at the focus groups supported the need for long-term agroecological research (LTAR) sites in four distinct agroecological zones in Iowa. The goal of each LTAR is to examine the short- and long-term physical, biological, and socioeconomic effects of organic and conventional farming systems. By establishing long-term experiments, we are testing the hypothesis that longer crop rotations, typical of organic farms, provide yield stability, improve plant protection, and enhance soil health and economic benefits compared to conventional systems with shorter rotations and greater off-farm inputs. Examples of research results from two LTAR experiments in Iowa include similar pepper (Capsicum annuum) and soybean (Glycine max) yields in the conventional and organic systems. Organic systems used mechanical weed control and locally produced compost in place of synthetic fertilizers. Feedback from the local farm associations that are responsible for farm stewardship and farm finances is inherent in the LTAR process. 3aagriculture 3aecosystems 3aorganic production 3acomposts 3asoil fertility 3asoil chemistry 3along term experiments 3aorganic foods 3asystems analysis 3aexperimental design 3acrop yield 3acrop rotation 3aeconomic analysis 3afarm inputs 3aIowa 0astability 0afeedback 0afarming systems research0 tHortTechnology.g2002 , v. 12, no. 3 p.345-354wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02640naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002500179245010600204300001800310506007600328520121500404506003701619650003201656650002101688650002501709650002801734650002101762650002001783650002201803650001801825650002601843650001101869650002101880650002901901650002701930773008301957852000902040856007802049930003302127946001102160990002302171655001202194IND4408736620221207114233.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440873662DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn4062doi7 aPMC25042962pmcid7 a186119512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstévez, Antonio M.14aThe RNA-binding protein TbDRBD3 regulates the stability of a specific subset of mRNAs in trypanosomes  ap. 4573-4586.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn trypanosomes, the apparent lack of regulation of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription initiation poses a challenge to understand how these eukaryotes adjust gene expression to adapt to the contrasting environments they find during their life cycles. Evidence so far indicates that mRNA turnover and translation are the major control points in which regulation is exerted in trypanosomes. However, very little is known about which proteins are involved, and how do they regulate the abundance and translation of different mRNAs in different life stages. In this work, an RNA-binding protein, TbDRBD3, has been identified by affinity chromatography, and its function addressed using RNA interference, microarray analysis and immunoprecipitation of mRNA-protein complexes. The results obtained indicate that TbDRBD3 binds to a subset of developmentally regulated mRNAs encoding membrane proteins, and that this association promotes the stabilization of the target transcripts. These observations raise the possibility that TbDRBD3-mRNA complexes act as a post-transcriptional operon, and provide a framework to interpret how trypanosomes regulate gene expression in the absence of transcriptional control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3aRNA interference 3aRNA-binding proteins 3aaffinity chromatography 3aeukaryotic cells 3agene expression 3amembrane proteins 3amessenger RNA 3amicroarray technology 3aoperon 3aprecipitin tests 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranslation (genetics)0 tNucleic acids research.g2008 Aug., v. 36, no. 14 p.4573-4586x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkn4063Available from publisher's Web site  a20080808b20080905c00000000  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02423naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245008700127300001600214520145600230650002401686650001401710650001501724650001701739650002101756650001101777650001301788651001201801653001601813653002201829653001501851653001601866700001701882773008201899852000901981930003301990945001302023946001302036655001202049IND2327739020221121053759.0020626e200204  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232773902DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aConner, P.J.10aPerformance of 15 pecan cultivars and selections over 20 years in southern Georgia  ap. 274-281.  aFifteen pecan (Carya illinoinensis) genotypes were evaluated over a period of 20 years in a test orchard located near Tifton, Ga. Genotypes tested included seedling selections ('Candy', 'Maramec', 'Melrose', 'Moreland', 'Sumner', and 'Western Schley'), USDA releases ('Creek', 'Kanza', 'Kiowa', and 'Pawnee'), and USDA selections (USDA 41-19-20, USDA 53-11-139, USDA 53-9-1, USDA 57-7-22, and USDA 64-11-17). Actual yields were measured for each tree in the test throughout the test period and the alternate bearing intensity (I) of each cultivar was calculated. Average annual nut production in years 1 to 10 ranged from 19 lb (8.6 kg) in the precocious cultivar 'Candy' to 6 lb (2.7 kg) in the nonprecocious cultivar 'Melrose'. Although a wide variation was seen in the average yield of clones in years 11 to 20, differences were not significant. A subsample of nuts was taken for each tree annually and percent kernel, nuts/lb, specific gravity, and nut volume were determined. Significant differences were found between clones for each of these traits. Most clones were not acceptable for commercial use in Georgia due to small nut size, poor kernel quality, or excessive alternate bearing. Recommended clones include: 'Pawnee', which produced large nuts of excellent quality with an early harvest date, 'Sumner', which produced large nuts of moderate quality with a late harvest date, and 'Kiowa', a precocious bearer of large, good-quality nuts. 3aCarya illinoinensis 3acultivars 3acrop yield 3acrop quality 3aspecific gravity 3avolume 3agenotype 3aGeorgia 0aseed weight 0airregular bearing 0aevaluation 0aperformance1 aWorley, R.E.0 tHortTechnology.g2002 , v. 12, no. 2 p.274-281wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01457naa a2200265 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100001500161245009200176246010100268300001600369520054500385650001500930700001800945700001500963773009400978852000901072856005701081939003301138945000801171655001201179991601922540742620221121053741.0780901e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891183932DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0855272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAuld, B.A.14aThe effect of temperature changes on the expansion of individual leaves of Vicia faba L3 aEffect of temperature changes on the expansion of individual leaves of Vicia faba L [Broadbeans]  ap. 877-888.  aThe growth in area of the sixth leaf of field bean plants was investigated in growth room experiments.

There are about 853,000 acres (345,000 ha) of commercial citrus requiring about 63,975 tons (62,652 t) of N. At an average analysis of 12% N, about 533,125 tons (483,811 t) of blended nitrogenous fertilizers are applied to citrus annually. To meet this annual N demand from compost, it would be necessary to produce 3,198,750 tons (2,901,906 t) of 2% N compost. The market for high-quality compost products in Florida is far greater than the current or projected production capacity of the state. As long as the cost benefits of compost are clear to citrus growers, demand will always exceed supply. Not all composts are equal in their nutrient availability. The best composts for use as fertilizers are derived from sewage sludge or biosolids, municipal solid waste and sludge, food waste, and/or animal manure combined with a bulking agent such as sawdust or wood chips. Composts made from wood waste as their only feedstock contain large amounts of lignin and cellulose to break down within a reasonable period to directly offset chemical fertilizers. Ultimately, they will mineralize in the soil and provide all of the benefits described earlier, but their rates of availability are in years rather than months, like the other composts. 3aCitrus 3aorchards 3acomposts 3amunicipal solid waste 3asewage sludge 3aorganic wastes 3anitrogen 3anutrient requirements 3acost benefit analysis 3asupply 3awood 3alignin 3acellulose 3anutrient availability 3aapplication rate 3aFlorida1 aOzores-Hampton, M.0 tHortTechnology.g2002 , v. 12, no. 3 p.332-335wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01941naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012300127300001600250520089400266650002201160650001501182650001701197650001501214650001901229650002101248650002101269650001101290650002101301651001201322700002001334700001901354700001501373700001701388773008201405852000901487930003301496945001301529946001301542655001201555IND2330769120221121053726.0030211e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233076912DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHochmuth, G.10aPotato yield and tuber quality did not respond to phosphorus fertilization of soils testing high in phosphorus content  ap. 420-423.  aPhosphorus (P) fertilization studies were conducted on four commercial farms and at the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Hastings Research and Education Center in Hastings.

Potato tuber specific gravity averaged 1.075 and responded slightly to P fertilization only at one site. 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acrop yield 3acrop quality 3aphosphorus 3asoil fertility 3anutrient content 3aspecific gravity 3aleaves 3aapplication rate 3aFlorida1 aWeingartner, P.1 aHutchinson, C.1 aTilton, A.1 aJesseman, D.0 tHortTechnology.g2002 , v. 12, no. 3 p.420-423wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02533naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002400075024004400099040001800143100001700161245008300178246009800261300001600359520151700375650002601892650002101918650002301939650002101962650001801983700001702001773009402018852000902112856005702121939003302178945000802211655001202219991601922060742620221121053805.0780901e197807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aCAIN7891184012DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0855352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRutter, M.R.10aDNA synthesis and cell division during spore germination in Lygodium japonicum3 aDNA synthesis and cell division during spore germination in Lygodium japonicum [Pteridophyta]  ap. 957-965.  aThis paper describes the ontogenetic sequence of cell divisions and associated DNA synthetic patterns observed in sectioned spores of Lygodium japonicum (Thunb.) Sw., collected at different stages of germination. Following exposure to a saturating dose of red light, the spore undergoes an asymmetric division to form a basal cell, which retains nearly all of the storage inclusions, and an apical cell which expands and protrudes from the ruptured sporoderm. Division of the apical cell results in formation of a protonemal cell and an intermediate cell. Subsequently, the latter cell divides to form the primary rhizoid and a wedge cell adjacent to the protonemal cell. Secondary rhizoids may arise from later divisions of either the basal cell or the wedge cell. In addition, the wedge cell appears to have the capacity to form a secondary prothal-lial filament. Histochemical localization of cell constituents indicates an increasing concentration of cytoplasmic RNA and protein in the presumptive protonemal region of the spore cell prior to division. Autoradiography of 3H–thymidine incorporation has shown that synthesis of nuclear DNA precedes each cell division. Although strictly nuclear DNA synthesis occurs during early stages of germination, extra-nuclear DNA synthesis increases greatly following division of the spore cell. The results are discussed in relation to earlier studies on cell division patterns seen in whole mount preparations of germinating spores of different species of Lygodium. 3aferns and fern allies 3aplant physiology 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant morphology 3aplant anatomy1 aRaghavan, V.0 tAnnals of botany.g1978 July, v. 42, no. 180 p.957-965wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a085535  a00000000b19780901c00000000  aIND 7aarticle03814naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245008200125300001600207500001500223520266100238650001202899650002602911650001202937650001102949650002302960650002302983650001303006650001203019650002503031650002003056650002103076650001503097650002203112651001203134653001503146653002403161700001503185700001803200773008203218852000903300930003303309945001303342946001303355655001203368IND2330772620221121053830.0030211e200207  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233077262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStover, E.10aPesticide spraying in Indian River grapefruit. I. Survey of current practices  ap. 454-460.  a2019-12-05  aPesticide spray practices for citrus (Citrus spp.) in the Indian River region of Florida were surveyed in 2001 as the first step in identifying opportunities for improving efficiency and reducing potential environmental impact. The survey covered 73% of grapefruit (C. paradisi) acreage in Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin and Palm Beach counties, comprising 70% of all Indian River commercial grapefruit. Large differences in spray practices were revealed. The focus of this survey was grapefruit spraying, since grapefruit represent 59% of fresh citrus shipped from the Indian River region, and are sprayed more intensively than citrus fruit grown for processing. In commercial groves, almost all foliar sprays to grapefruit are applied using air-assisted sprayers pulled through the groves by tractors. Use of engine-driven and power-take-off-driven sprayers were reported with equal frequency and accounted for 89% of spray machines used. Low-volume Curtec sprayers comprised the remainder. Spray volume for grapefruit varied: 7.6% of acreage was sprayed at 25 to 35 gal/acre (230 to 330 L(.)ha-1) for all sprays; 4.2% was sprayed at 100 to 170 gal/acre (940 to 1600 L(.)ha-1) for all sprays; 15.3% was sprayed at 200 to 380 gal/acre (1900 to 3600 L(.)ha-1) for all sprays; 28.2% was sprayed at 450 to 750 gal/acre (4200 to 7000 L(.)ha-1) for all sprays; and 44.5% of grapefruit acreage was sprayed in a progressive manner from lower to higher volume as the season progresses. Many mid and high spray volume growers reported unacceptable results when they lowered spray volume. Although correlation was moderate (r = 0.35 to 0.45), regressions indicated that both total foliar pesticide spray material costs, and annual fungicidal copper (Cu) use increased with spray volume used for postbloom fungicides. Mean Cu use per acre was in the middle of the recommended range. All growers reported adjusting nozzling for tree height within a grove, and since Indian River groves are bedded, growers adjusted sprayer output differently for trees on bed tops versus furrows on 85% of acreage. Sprayers were shut off for missing trees on 83% of acreage, but this was done only for two or more adjacent trees on almost half of this area. Sensor-actuated sprayers were used to minimize off-target application on 14.7% of grapefruit acreage, but for an additional 21% of acreage, growers reported trying and abandoning this technology. While 88% of grove acreage was sprayed during the day, 75% of acreage sprayed using less than 100 gal/acre was sprayed at night. Growers reported no defined protocol for ceasing spray operations based on environmental conditions. 3anozzles 3aplant characteristics 3asurveys 3aheight 3afoliar application 3aseasonal variation 3asprayers 3afurrows 3aenvironmental impact 3aCitrus paradisi 3aapplication rate 3apesticides 3aintensive farming 3aFlorida 0aefficiency 0aapplication methods1 aScotto, D.1 aSalvatore, J.0 tHortTechnology.g2002 , v. 12, no. 3 p.454-460wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01978naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002700179245010200206300001200308506007600320520078300396506003701179650000801216650002701224650001301251650001601264650001501280650001901295700002001314700002301334773008101357852000901438856007801447930003301525946001101558990002301569655001201592IND4408739520221207114138.0080808e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440873952DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkn4152doi7 aPMC25043102pmcid7 a185868192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro, André Vidal10aLight activation of transcription: photocaging of nucleotides for control over RNA polymerization  ap. e90.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe describe the use of ATP caged with [7-(diethylamino)coumarin-4-yl]methyl (DEACM) for light-controlled in vitro transcription reactions.

Bulb yield and market grade were determined in field trials for 63 yellow onion cultivars and lines in 1996 and for 49 cultivars and lines in 1997. Marketable yield out of storage in January ranged from 478 to 1131 cwt/acre (54 to 127 Mg.ha-1) in 1996, and from 383 to 912 cwt/acre (43 to 102 Mg.ha-1) in 1997. Marketable yields of '9003C', 'Seville', 'El Charro', 'Sunre 1430', 'El Padre', 'Golden Security', 'Bravo', and 'X 202' were greater than 1000 cwt/acre (112 Mg.ha-1) in 1996. In 1997, marketable yields of 'Seville', 'Bravo', 'Quest', 'T-433', '9003C', 'Goldstar', 'Superstar', 'RNX-10020', 'Vision', and 'Sweet Perfection' were greater than 850 cwt/acre (95 Mg.ha-1). Of the 30 cultivars evaluated both years, the average marketable yields of 'Seville', 9003C, 'Bravo', 'Quest', and 'Sweet Perfection' were among the highest. Many others showed potential for high yields and merit further evaluation. In both years, most bulbs of all selections graded jumbo [3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10.2 cm) diameter] and colossal [>4 inch (10.2 cm) diameter], and only a few cultivars had more than 2% medium-size [2.25 to 3 inch (5.7 to 7.6 cm) diameter] bulbs. Infection by neck rot (Botrytis allii Munn.) and plate rot [Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepa (H. N. Hans.) W.C. Snyder & H.N. Hans.] during storage was more severe in 1996 than in 1997, but in general, most cultivars showed relatively low levels of these diseases in both years. Averaged across all cultivars, bolting was evident in less than 1% of bulbs in both years. 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3aAllium cepa 3aFusarium oxysporum 3afungal diseases of plants 3acrop yield 3abulbs 3agenetic variation 3aincidence 3aBotrytis allii 3aOregon 3aIdaho 0asize 0acultivars 0aevaluation1 aIshida, J.K.1 aEldredge, E.P.1 aSeddigh, M.0 tHortTechnology.g2000 , v. 10, no. 3 p.613-620wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02841naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245016700122300001400289520175200303650002402055650002002079650002102099650001902120650001302139650001802152650002002170650001402190650001102204650001902215653001102234653001902245700001702264700002602281773008002307852000902387930003302396945001302429946001302442655001202455IND2230133620221120200500.0010212e200101  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND223013362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, J.12aA forced ventilation micropropagation system for photoautotrophic production of sweetpotato plug plantlets in a scaled-up culture vessel.

Growth and uniformity  ap. 90-94.  aAn improved forced ventilation micropropagation system was designed with air distribution pipes for uniform spatial distributions of carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration and other environmental factors to enhance photoautotrophic growth and uniformity of plug plantlets. Single-node stem cuttings of sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam. 'Beniazuma'] were photoautotrophically (no sugar in the culture medium) cultured on a mixture of vermiculite and cellulose fibers with half-strength Murashige and Skoog basal salts in a scaled-up culture vessel with an inside volume of 11 L (2.9 gal). CO2 concentration of the supplied air and photosynthetic photon flux on the culture shelf were maintained at 1500 micromol(.)mol-1 and 150 micromol(.)m-2(.)s-1, respectively. Plantlets grown in forced ventilation systems were compared to plantlets grown in standard (natural ventilation rate) tissue culture vessels. The forced (F) ventilation treatments were designated high (FH), medium (FM), and low (FL), and corresponded to ventilation rates of 23 mL(.)s-1 (1.40 inch3/s), 17 mL(.)s-1 (1.04 inch3/s), and 10 mL(.)s-1 (0.61 inch3/s), respectively, on day 12. The natural (N) ventilation treatment was extremely low (NE) at 0.4 mL(.)s-1 (0.02 inch3/s), relative to the forced ventilation treatments. On day 12, the photoautotrophic growth of plantlets was nearly two times greater with the forced ventilation system than with the natural ventilation system. Plantlet growth did not significantly differ among the forced ventilation rates tested. The uniformity of the plantlet growth in the scaled-up culture vessel was enhanced by use of air distribution pipes that decreased the difference in CO2 concentration between the air inlets and the air outlet. 3aventilation systems 3aIpomoea batatas 3amicropropagation 3acarbon dioxide 3aregrowth 3aculture media 3alight intensity 3aequipment 3adesign 3aplant cuttings 0agrowth 0aplanting stock1 aWilson, S.B.1 aKozai, Toyoki,d1943-0 tHortTechnology.g2001 , v. 11, no. 1 p.90-94wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02456naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245004200129300001400171500001500185520143300200650002201633650001001655650001101665650002201676650001301698650001101711650001501722650002201737650002101759650002101780650001401801650001101815653001501826653001401841653001601855653001501871773008001886852000901966930003301975945001302008946001302021655001202034IND2230133320221120200443.0010212e200101  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND223013332DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlista, A.D.10aUCC-C4243 dessication of potato vines  ap. 86-89.  a2019-12-05  aChemical vine desiccation of potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) is widely used in the USA. Diquat is the major vine desiccant but has some drawbacks such as incomplete stem desiccation allowing regrowth. A new herbicide, UCC-C4243, was evaluated as a replacement for diquat. The potato cultivar 'Atlantic' was treated with UCC-C4243 (a.i.) at 0.25 to 2.5 oz/acre (17.5 to 175 g(.)ha-1), and leaf and stem desiccation efficiency was compared to diquat (a.i.) at 4 oz/acre (280 g(.)ha-1). Split applications of UCC-C4243 were compared to double applications of diquat. Subjective evaluations were made on regrowth and tuber skinning, and objective measurements on specific gravity and yield. Trials were conducted from 1991 to 1995 at Scottsbluff, NE. UCC-C4243 at 1.5 oz/acre (105 g(.)ha-1) and higher significantly increased leaf and stem desiccation compared to diquat. There was no difference between single and split applications of UCC-C4243. UCC-C4243 suppressed regrowth at 1 oz/acre (70 g(.)ha-1) and prevented it at 2.5 oz/acre at 3 weeks after treatment while diquat did not. Skin set of tubers was promoted equally by all desiccants. Specific gravity was not lowered by UCC-C4243 but was by diquat. Yields were not affected by either UCC-C4243 at 1.5 oz/acre or diquat at 4 oz/acre. UCC-C4243 was more effective than diquat as a vine desiccant without the regrowth and tuber specific gravity effects associated with diquat. 3auracil herbicides 3astems 3adiquat 3aSolanum tuberosum 3aregrowth 3atubers 3acrop yield 3asplit application 3aspecific gravity 3aapplication rate 3amortality 3aleaves 0aevaluation 0aepidermis 0adesiccation 0aherbicides0 tHortTechnology.g2001 , v. 11, no. 1 p.86-89wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20010402b20010411c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01676naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006500127300001600192520073100208650002700939650002200966650001500988650001701003650001101020650001301031650002001044650001501064650001501079653000901094653001401103653001601117653001901133773008201152852000901234930003301243945001301276946001301289655001201302IND2230145520221120185020.0010213e200101  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND223014552DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchuch, U.K.13aAn exercise to study the American Standard for Nursery Stock  ap. 128-129.  aA two-part exercise was developed as part of the horticulture curriculum at Iowa State University to familiarize students with the American Standard for Nursery Stock (ASNS), and to allow them to practice and apply the ASNS with a variety of categories and types of ornamental plants.

MCP inhibited loss of fruit firmness and titratable acidity when fruit were held in storage at 0 degrees C up to 6 months and when fruit were held at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 60 days. For all cultivars except 'Fuji', differences in firmness between treated and nontreated fruit exceeded 10 N after 6 months storage. These beneficial effects were seen in both preclimacteric and climacteric fruit. Ethylene production and respiration were reduced substantially by MCP treatment. MCP-treated fruit had soluble solids equal to or greater than those in nontreated fruit. Storage and shelf life were extended for all cultivars tested. 3abrix 3acultivars 3aethylene 3ashelf life 3aapples 3aethylene production 3afirmness 3aduration 3aripening 3acold storage 0ainhibitors 0arespiration 0astorage 0ainhibition1 aBlankenship, S.M.1 aMattheis, J.P.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1999 Nov., v. 124, no. 6 p.690-695aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02875naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011800126300001600244500001500260520153500275650001101810650001901821650001401840650001401854650002601868650001101894650001401905650001601919650002301935650002001958650001301978650002801991650002102019650002702040653002202067653001502089653001402104653001202118653001102130700001702141773017902158852000902337930003302346945001302379946001302392655001202405IND2205676720221120174424.0000711e199911  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220567672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aClemens, J.10aOptimizing mineral nutrition for flower production in Heliconia 'Golden Torch' using response surface methodology  ap. 713-718.  a2019-12-05  aContainerized plants of Heliconia psittacorum L.f. x H. spathocircinata Aristeguieta 'Golden Torch' were grown in a greenhouse for 8 months from early summer to winter under selected combinations of N, P, and K. Fertilizer rates ranged from zero to rates that exceeded those reported in the literature by 50% to 100%. Biomass variables (vegetative and inflorescence dry weight, and leaf area) were predicted to be maximized at high N and high N to P, and N to K ratios corresponding to N-P-K application rates of 1.2, 0.5, and 0.6 kg(.)m(-3), respectively (approximately equal to 2:1:1). However, the number of shoots and flowers produced per rhizome were maximal at lower N to K ratios (1:1). Flower yield could therefore be optimized with appropriate fertilization, provided attention was paid to the N to K ratio so that the size of plants and their flowers was not compromised by efforts to increase shoot and flower number. The heavier the rhizome planted, the shorter the time for shoot emergence and flowering to occur, and the greater the number of flowers harvested. However, rhizome weight had no effect on number of shoots to emerge. The probability of shoots flowering declined markedly with order of shoot emergence, although this could be increased with appropriate mineral nutrition. The maximum number of leaves subtending the inflorescence (seven) was obtained at high N and P rates. Flower production was probably limited by declining solar radiation in autumn, and by within-plant competition for rooting space. 3aweight 3ainflorescences 3aflowering 3aHeliconia 3anutrient availability 3ashoots 3aleaf area 3acut flowers 3abiomass production 3aNPK fertilizers 3arhizomes 3adry matter partitioning 3aapplication rate 3acontainer-grown plants 0amineral nutrition 0adry matter 0aemergence 0abiomass 0aratios1 aMorton, R.H.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1999 Nov., v. 124, no. 6 p.713-718aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02672naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245011800124300001800242520156100260650001401821650002001835650002001855650001001875650001501885650001401900650001801914650001401932650002601946650001101972650001601983653000901999653001002008700001902018773018102037852000902218930003302227945001302260946001302273655001202286IND2061879920221120155241.0980217e199611  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206187992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, W.C.10aLight intensity and spectral quality affect fruit growth and shelf life of greenhouse-grown long English cucumber  ap. 1168-1173.  aThe importance of light intensity and spectral quality on fruit color and shelf life of long English cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) was studied in four greenhouse experiments. The intensity of cucumber greenness was measured nondestructively by video imaging, and shelf life was measured by visual observation of incipient yellowing. In the summer, filters were used to cover individual fruit to reduce light intensity reaching the fruit surface. The lower the light intensity incident on a cucumber, the shorter its shelf life. The average shelf life was 8, 5, or 1 days for cucumbers receiving 100%, 66%, or 31% of natural daylight, respectively. The fruit that were covered with a filter transmitting red (R) light were greener (low grey level via video imaging) than those with a far-red (FR) filter. In the fall, fruit receiving spectral R lighting from fluorescence tubes were greener and had a longer shelf life than those receiving FR lighting from incandescent bulbs. In the winter, high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting was necessary to supplement natural daylight for crop growth and production. Under HPS, R and FR lighting produced the same fruit greenness and shelf life. In the spring, R-lighted fruit had longer shelf life than FR-lighted ones, although fruit color at harvest was similar. In these four experiments, postharvest shelf life of long English cucumber was generally related to fruit greenness upon harvest. The data suggest the importance of an open canopy in improving fruit greenness and shelf life of greenhouse-grown cucumber. 3acucumbers 3aCucumis sativus 3alight intensity 3acolor 3ashelf life 3ared light 3afar-red light 3aphenology 3agreenhouse production 3aweight 3awavelengths 0asize 0afruit1 aJolliffe, P.A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1996 Nov., v. 121, no. 6 p.1168-1173aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19980401b19980408c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02098naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006000124300001600184500001500200520108500215650001401300650000901314650002101323650001201344650003701356650001801393650001401411650002301425650001101448653001501459653001501474773017901489852000901668930003301677945001301710946001301723655001201736IND2062695320221120144207.0980324e199711  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206269532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHan, S.S.10aPreventing postproduction leaf yellowing in Easter lily  ap. 869-872.  a2019-12-05  aPostproduction leaf yellowing of Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) can be prevented by using growth regulators. Solutions containing benzyladenine (BA) reduced the percentage of yellow leaves in cold-stored plants, but solutions containing gibberellic acid (GA3) were not effective. Treatment with commercial products containing GA4+7 (Provide) or GA4+7 and BA (Promalin) nearly completely prevented the development of leaf yellowing. Concentrations as low as 25 mg.L-1 were effective. Leaf yellowing was prevented by growth regulators only on leaves that had been treated, indicating that the growth regulators were not mobilized in the plants. Growth regulator solutions halted further development of leaf yellowing when applied to plants that already had some chlorotic basal leaves. This result suggests that growth regulators need not be applied preventively. Treatment can be delayed until chlorotic lower leaves are first seen on plants. The striking effects of growth regulators in preventing leaf yellowing did not affect the development and opening of flower buds. 3aflowering 3abuds 3agibberellic acid 3aflowers 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3abenzyladenine 3achlorosis 3aLilium longiflorum 3aleaves 0asenescence 0apot plants0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1997 Nov., v. 122, no. 6 p.869-872aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19980502b19980508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle01992naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012600125300001600251500001500267520074500282650001401027650001901041650001701060650001101077650001801088650002301106650002701129650002001156650001901176650001101195651001301206653001101219653001501230653001901245653001301264700001601277700001801293773017901311852000901490930003301499945001301532946001301545655001201558IND2062693920221120144013.0980324e199711  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206269392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStopar, M.14aThe effect of NAA and BA on carbon dioxide assimilation by shoot leaves of spur-type 'Delicious' and 'Empire' apple trees  ap. 837-840.  a2019-12-05  aThe effects of NAA, BA, or Accel on CO2 assimilation of shoot leaves of mature bearing Redchief 'Delicious' and 'Empire' apple (Malus X domestica Borkh.) trees were evaluated over two seasons.

'Best Gold' aff. Z. pentlandii (Wats.) Wittm. (syn. Richardia pentlandii Wats.) were quantified under a range of temperature and photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) regimes using plant growth analysis. The relative rate of dry matter accumulation [relative growth rate (RGR(M)), g.g-1.d-1] was highly correlated with the partitioning of the daily increment of dry matter into leaf tissue [leaf matter partitioning (LMP), g.d-1 per g.d-1. In contrast, a poor correlation existed between RGR(M) and net assimilation rate (NAR, g.m-2.d-1). Maximum values of RGR(M) increased linearly with increasing temperature (from 13 to 28 degree C), with a base temperature of 2.1 +/- 2.7 degree C. The optimum temperature for growth was PPF dependent with maximum total plant dry mass occurring under high PPF (694 micromole.m-2.s-1) at 25 degree C. However, as the plant responded to PPF by altering LMP, find total plant dry mass was actually greater under the low PPF regime (348 micromole.m-2.s-1) at temperatures < 22 degree C. The optimum temperature for dry matter accumulation was close to the average daily air temperature during the growing season for the natural habitat of the parent species. Similarly, the greater dry matter accumulation under the combination of either low PPF and cooler temperatures or high PPF and warmer temperatures was paralleled by the diversity of PPF habitats in the natural open grassland and forest margin the parent species occupies. It is therefore suggested that Zantedeschia 'Best Gold' is well adapted to optimize growth under these environmental conditions. 3aair temperature 3anet assimilation rate 3alight intensity 3aZantedeschia 3aleaf area 3amass 3adry matter partitioning 3ahabitats 3aleaves 0agrowth period 0adry matter accumulation 0agrowth rate 0agrowth1 aHewett, E.W.1 aWarrington, I.J.1 aPlummer, J.A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1998 Nov., v. 123, no. 6 p.973-979aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03521naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245014600123300001800269520227700287650001302564650001002577650002302587650002502610650001702635650002602652650001302678650001302691650001302704650000902717653002602726653001302752700001802765700001802783700001802801700001602819700001502835773018102850852000903031930003303040945001303073946001303086655001203099IND2198544420221122234842.0990505e199811  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219854442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaul, F.10aAroma volatile profiles from ripe tomatoes are influenced by physiological maturity at harvest: an application for electronic nose technology  ap. 1094-1101.  aThe effect of physiological maturity at harvest on ripe tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) volatile profiles was studied using ripening response time (in days) to 100 micro L.L-1 exogenous ethylene treatment as a tool to separate immature-green from mature-green fruit. Electronic nose (EN) sensor array and gas chromatography (GC) analyses were used to document volatile profile changes in tomatoes that required a 1-, 3-, or 5-day ethylene treatment to reach the breaker stage. EN output analysis using multivariate discriminant and canonical analyses classified intact tomato and whole tomato homogenate samples that required 3 or 5 days of ethylene treatment as significantly different (P < 0.01) from those that require only 1 day. The GC aroma profiles from whole tomato homogenate showed that 1-day fruit had significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) of 1-penten-3-one, cis-3-hexenal, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one,2-isobutylthiazole, and geranylacetone when compared to 5-day fruit. Analysis of excised tomato tissues showed that pericarp (including columnella) produced an average 219% greater concentration of the 16 aroma volatiles quantified by GC when compared to locular gel (442 and 203 micro L.L-1, respectively). EN analysis concurred with GC by showing greater average Mahalanobis distance between pericarp tissue groupings when compared to locular gel groupings (78.25 and 12.33 units, respectively). Pericarp tissue from the 5-day ethylene treatment showed significantly lower levels of 1-penten-3-one, trans-2-heptenal, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 2-isobutylthiazole, geranylacetone, and beta-ionone compared to the 1- and 3-day treatments. Similarly, locular gel from the 3- and 5-day ethylene treatments had significantly lower levels of 1-penten-3-one,2-isobutylthiazole, and 1-nitro-2-phenylethane compared to 1-day samples. cis-3-Hexenol in locular gel was the only volatile compound that showed significantly higher levels with increasing ethylene treatment. EN analysis showed greater Mahalanobis distances between 1- and 3-day ethylene samples than between 3- and 5-day ethylene samples (32.09 and 12.90, 24.14 and 6.52, 116.31 and 65.04, and 15.74 and 13.28 units, for intact tomato, whole tomato, pericarp, and locular gel homogenate, respectively). 3atomatoes 3aodors 3avolatile compounds 3achemical composition 3aharvest date 3aquantitative analysis 3aripening 3aethylene 3apericarp 3agels 0aelectronic separation 0amaturity1 aSargent, S.A.1 aBalaban, M.O.1 aBaldwin, E.A.1 aHuber, D.J.1 aSims, C.A.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1998 Nov., v. 123, no. 6 p.1094-1101aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02096naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245017300129300001800302500001500320520096300335650001301298650000901311650001301320650002001333650002701353650001701380650001501397653002501412700001501437700001801452700001501470773018101485852000901666930003301675945001301708946001301721655001201734IND2198544120221122234900.0990505e199811  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219854412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeiris, K.H.S.10aNear-infrared (NIR) spectrometric technique for nondestructive determination of soluble solids content in processing tomatoes.

A diode array fiber optic spectrometer was used to measure NIR transmittance. Each fruit was scanned at two locations on opposite sides midway along the proximal-distal axis. After scanning, each fruit was processed and pureed, and SSC was determined using a refractometer. Multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares (PLS) regression, and neural network (NN) calibration models were developed using the second derivatives of averaged spectra from 780 to 980 nm. The validation results showed that NN calibration was better than MLR or PLS calibrations. The NN calibration could estimate the processed SSC of individual unprocessed tomatoes with a standard error of prediction of 0.52% and could classify >72% of fruit in an independent population within +/- 0.5% of SSC. 3atomatoes 3abrix 3acrushing 3afood processing 3anondestructive methods 3aspectroscopy 3aprediction 0achemical composition1 aDull, G.G.1 aLeffler, R.G.1 aKays, S.J.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1998 Nov., v. 123, no. 6 p.1089-1093aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02571naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245005200132300001600184500001500200520121300215650001401428650001501442650000901457650001801466650002101484650001201505650001201517650001401529650001301543650001401556650001601570650001801586650002801604650002001632650001301652650001601665650001901681650001401700653001301714653002601727700001801753700001901771700002801790773017901818852000901997930003302006945001302039946001302052655001202065IND2205669420221122223854.0000711e199911  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220566942DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeufferheld, M.J.10aCryopreservation of cold-tender apple germplasm  ap. 612-618.  a2019-12-05  aUnlike cold-hardy apple germplasm, dormant vegetative buds from cold-tender accessions require stabilization of meristematic tissue to protect against injury during desiccation and cryopreservation. Dormant buds of six apple cultivars [Malus sylvestris (L.) Mill. var. domestica (Borkh.) Mansf. 'Cox's Orange Pippin', 'Einshemer', 'Golden Delicious', 'Jonagold', 'K-14', and 'Mutsu'] collected at specific intervals in 1993, 1994, and 1995 at Geneva, N.Y., were stabilized by encapsulation in 5% alginate, treated with step-wise imbibition of 0.5 to 1.0 M sucrose and 0.2 M raffinose solution, and desiccated with forced air at 0 degrees C. Sugar-alginate stabilization reduced injury during desiccation, increased cold-hardiness of the six cold-tender cultivars frozen to -30 degrees C, and improved recovery following cryopreservation of buds collected before optimal cold acclimation was attained. Sucrose tissue levels did not increase following stabilization treatment, but levels of glucose and fructose, and of an unknown disaccharide increased. This procedure used nontoxic cryoprotectants, and has potential to expand the scope of dormant bud cryopreservation to include cold-tender apple germplasm. 3agermplasm 3aimbibition 3abuds 3afreeze drying 3acryopreservation 3aglucose 3asucrose 3ameristems 3afructose 3araffinose 3aacclimation 3aencapsulation 3aplant genetic resources 3aMalus domestica 3adormancy 3atemperature 3acold tolerance 3amortality 0ainjuries 0abiological resistance1 aStushnoff, C.1 aForsline, P.L.1 aTerrazas Gonzalez, G.H.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1999 Nov., v. 124, no. 6 p.612-618aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle03514naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245014600126300001600272500001500288520227900303650002202582650004402604650001802648650000902666650001502675650001002690650002202700650001102722650001302733650001302746650001602759650001102775653001802786653001502804653001102819700001502830773017902845852000903024930003303033945001303066946001303079655001203092IND2324777920221122210444.0020111e200111  vau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232477792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFennell, A.10aIdentifying differential tissue responding in grape (Vitis riparia) during induction of endodormancy using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging  ap. 681-688.  a2019-12-05  aPhysiological and biophysical changes were monitored during shoot maturation and bud endodormancy induction in grape (Vitis riparia Michx.) under controlled environments. Growth, dry weight (DW), periderm development, bud endodormancy, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2 relaxation times were monitored at 2, 4, or 6 weeks of long-photoperiod [long day (LD), 15 h, endodormancy inhibition] or short-photoperiod [short day (SD), 8 h, endodormancy induction] treatments at 15/9 h day/night thermoperiod of 25/20 +/- 3 degrees C. Shoots on LD plants grew throughout the entire study period, although the rate of growth decreased slightly during the 6th week. Shoot growth slowed significantly after 2 weeks of SD, was minimal by the 4th week of SD and most of the shoot tip meristems had abscised after 6 weeks of SD. Endodormancy was induced after 4 weeks of SD. DW of the stem and buds increased with increasing duration of LD and SD. While bud DW increased more under SD than LD, stem DW increased more under LD than SD. T2 relaxation times were calculated from images of transverse sections of the grape node. There was a slight decrease in the T2 times in the node tissues with increased duration of LD treatment, whereas SD induced a significant decrease in T2 times during endodormancy induction. T2 values for the node decreased after 4 weeks of SD, coinciding with endodormancy induction. Separation of node tissues into bud, leaf gap, and the remainder of the stem and analysis of the proportion of short and long T2 times within those tissues indicated differential tissue response. A greater proportion of short T2 times were observed in the 2-week SD leaf gap tissue than in the LD and the proportion of short T2 times continued to increase with subsequent SD treatment. Bud and all other stem tissues had a greater proportion of short T2 times after 4 weeks of SD, coinciding with bud endodormancy induction. The proportion of short and long T2 times in a tissue was a better indicator of endodormancy than the averaged T2 time for the tissue. Thus, MRI allows nondestructive identification of differential tissue response to photoperiod treatments and makes it possible to separate normal vegetative maturation responses from endodormancy induction. 3aplant development 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aVitis riparia 3abuds 3aabscission 3astems 3adormancy breaking 3aleaves 3aperiderm 3adormancy 3aphotoperiod 3ashoots 0aplant tissues 0adry matter 0agrowth1 aLine, M.J.0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g2001 Nov., v. 126, no. 6 p.681-688aAmerican Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a20020301b20020307c00000000  aINDdCTR  aOther US 7aarticle02512naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013000127300001600257520144200273650002001715650001301735650001601748650001101764650001101775650001901786650003001805653000901835653001701844653001001861653001201871653001001883653001201893653004401905773013401949852000902083939003302092946001302125655001202138IND9000654420221122051009.0900212e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900065442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerree, D.C.10aInfluence of orchard management systems on spur quality, light, and fruit within the canopy of 'Golden Delicious' apple trees  ap. 869-875.  aTrees of G̀olden Delicious' apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) were established in 1973 in the following orchard management systems: slender spindle (SS), trellis (TR), interstem hedgerow (IH), and pyramid hedgerow (PH). Spur quality and percent photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) transmission declined from the top to the bottom of the canopy of all systems. The three conical central leader type trees (SS, IH, PH) produced a quarter of their fruit on or close to the central leader, while the palmette-shaped TR produced 60% in the center sections along the wire trellis. There was no difference between vertical fruit distribution in trees in the more intensive systems (SS, TR), but the larger trees (IH, PH) produced twice as much fruit in the top half of the canopy as in the bottom half. Trees in the SS had a lower percentage or PPF transmission values within the canopy than trees in the TR systems. Trees in IH generally had higher PPF transmission values within the canopy than the larger PH trees. The number of leaves per spur and specific leaf weight of spur leaves generally followed the light distribution pattern, and trees in the TR and IH systems had higher-quality spurs than the SS and PH systems. The SS and TR systems appeared more responsive to the orientation of the sun, having higher light transmission values on the east side of the canopy in the morning and west side in the afternoon, than the IH or PH systems. 3aMalus domestica 3aorchards 3afruit trees 3acanopy 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3aadministrative management 0asize 0adistribution 0afruit 0aquality 0aspurs 0asystems 0aphotosynthetic photon flux transmission0 tJournal of the American Society for Horticultural Science.g1989 Nov., v. 114, no. 6 p.869-875wJournal:jnl27747x0003-10627nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02321naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009000127300001600217520131000233650003501543650003401578650001301612650001101625650001901636650002001655650002701675653001501702700001801717700001301735700001801748700001601766773013401782852000901916939003301925946001301958655001201971IND9000656120221122051044.0900212e198911  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND900065612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMakhlouf, J.10aRegulation of ethylene biosynthesis in broccoli flower buds in controlled atmospheres  ap. 955-958.  aThe effect of controlled atmospheres on the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis during the senescence of broccoli flower buds (Brassica oleracea, L. Italica group cv. Green Valiant) was assessed. The broccoli buds were stored in the dark at 25C under a continuous stream of nitrogen containing the following percentages of CO2-O2: 0-20 (air), 0-2.5, 6-20, and 10-20. Generally, respiration, ethylene production, and ethylene-forming enzyme (EFE) activity followed a climacteric like pattern in all atmospheres. The ACC content changed little during the "climacteric", but increased dramatically during the "post-climacteric" period, when ethylene production and EFE activity decreased. Under high CO2, respiration was reduced, but ethylene production and EFE activity were temporarily stimulated early during treatment. Under low O2, respiration, ethylene production, EFE activity, and ACC content were reduced, and the "climacteric" and chlorophyll losses were delayed to a greater extent than under high CO2. Whatever the treatment, ACC level was not the limiting factor in ethylene biosynthesis in broccoli; the reduction in ethylene production during senescence resulted from the degradation of the system that converts ACC to ethylene.

Despite high standardization of field protocols, uncertain detection probability remains an important source of variability and bias in point-count data. This effect is of main importance in low-responsive species as the Red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), but it can be counterbalanced, increasing detection probability. In this 2-year study, we sampled using traditional point-count methods, followed by playback sessions for each repetition. We measured detection probability and the efficiency of playback for detectability in the context of a feasibility study on long-term point-count surveys for a harvested game bird, the Red-legged partridge. The results for both study years show a distinct increase in detection probability (23% and 45%, respectively) when using playback vs. the traditional point-count method. We also tested our results for heterogeneity, trap dependence, and time dependence, and no effect was detected. Thus, we suggest that the future design of long-term surveys on Red-legged partridges should consider abundance indices using playback sessions. 3aAlectoris rufa 3agame birds 3apartridges 3aprobability 3asurveys 0aRed-legged partridge 0aCMR models 0aPlayback 0aPoint counts1 aPonce-Boutin, Françoise 1 aBesnard, Aurélien 1 aEraud, Cyril 0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2010 Dec., v. 56, no. 6 p.907-913dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0388-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20101119b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03156naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002400186245016000210300001800370506007600388520117300464506003701637650002801674650002901702650004001731650003001771650002601801650001601827650000901843650002001852650002201872650002001894650001801914650002801932650002001960650001501980650001801995650002202013650001002035650003402045653004602079653002202125653002702147700002102174700001702195700002102212700001602233700001702249700001902266773013102285852000902416856008502425930003302510946001102543655001202554IND4444326120221207113936.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444432612DNAL7 a10.1007/s11250-010-9648-52doi7 aPMC70893422pmcid7 a206231872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aV.

Based on activity, the strains Probio-38 and Probio-37 were selected as potential probiotics and identified as Lactobacillus plantarum Probio-38 and Lactobacillus salivarius Probio-37 respectively by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Supernatants of these strains inhibited TGE coronavirus in vitro in ST cells, without any cytopathic effect even after 72 h of incubation. Both the strains exhibited high survival in synthetic gastric juice. The strains were resistant to 5% porcine bile and exhibited antimicrobial activity against all the 13 enteric bacterial pathogens tested. These strains also exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics analyzed. The inhibition of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus and enteric bacterial pathogens as well as the bile tolerance, high survival in gastric juice, and the antibiotic resistance indicate that the two isolated bacterial strains are ideal probiotic candidates for animal application after proper in vivo experiments.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLactobacillus plantarum 3aLactobacillus salivarius 3aTransmissible gastroenteritis virus 3aanti-infective properties 3aantibiotic resistance 3aantibiotics 3abile 3abile resistance 3acytopathogenicity 3aenteropathogens 3agastric juice 3agastrointestinal system 3ain vivo studies 3aprobiotics 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3atransmissible gastroenteritis 0aTransmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus 0aEnteric pathogens 0aAntibiotic sensitivity1 aSeo, Byeong Joo 1 aMun, Mi Ran 1 aKim, Chul-Joong 1 aLee, Insun 1 aKim, Hongik 1 aPark, Yong-Ha 0 tTropical animal health and production.g2010 Dec., v. 42, no. 8 p.1855-1860dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-010-9648-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101029b20101108c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01775naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245006700165300001600232520084800248650001301096653003401109653001501143653001301158700002001171700001801191700001701209773009701226852000901323856008501332930003301417946001101450655001201461IND4445553520221121191406.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444555352DNAL7 a10.1007/s11249-010-9661-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Jinglin 10aEffects of Altitude on Thermal Flying-Height Control Actuation  ap. 295-299.  aThermal flying-height control (TFC) is now a key technology used in hard-disk drives (HDD) as an effective way to push the magnetic spacing to sub-5 nm. Precise control of the TFC sliders' actuated flying-height (FH) is a major consideration in improving the read/write capability as well as reducing the reliability problem. In this paper, we investigate the response of TFC sliders to altitude changes with a focus on the variation of actuated FH. Numerical and experimental results both indicate an increase in the actuated FH at higher altitudes. Simulations show that the increased TFC protrusion and less air bearing pushback on sliders at higher altitudes contribute to this increase. This study is of practical importance for improving heater and air bearing surface design to reduce the TFC sliders' sensitivities to altitude changes. 3aaltitude 0aThermal flying-height control 0aProtrusion 0aPushback1 aBogy, David B. 1 aZhang, Shuyu 1 aYan, Wentao 0 tTribology letters.g2010 Dec., v. 40, no. 3 p.295-299dBoston : Springer USx1023-88837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11249-010-9661-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101126b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03419naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100002200186245010000208300001600308506007600324520170100400506003702101650002102138650001502159650001002174650001202184650001202196650001202208650001002220650002202230650001202252650001302264650001302277650002002290650002202310650002002332650001002352653001102362653001102373653002702384653003402411653005202445653003102497700002002528700002502548700002502573700002102598700002202619773009502641852000902736856008502745946001102830655001202841IND4447274820221207113949.0110107e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444727482DNAL7 a10.1007/s00726-010-0629-92doi7 aPMC31393602pmcid7 a205059622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Fiona A. 10aDifferential effects of long-term leucine infusion on tissue protein synthesis in neonatal pigs  ap. 157-165.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLeucine is unique among the amino acids in its ability to promote protein synthesis by activating translation initiation via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Previously, we showed that leucine infusion acutely stimulates protein synthesis in fast-twitch glycolytic muscle of neonatal pigs but this response cannot be maintained unless the leucine-induced fall in amino acids is prevented. To determine whether leucine can stimulate protein synthesis in muscles of different fiber types and in visceral tissues of the neonate in the long-term if baseline amino acid concentrations are maintained, overnight fasted neonatal pigs were infused for 24 h with saline, leucine (400 μmol kg⁻¹ h⁻¹), or leucine with replacement amino acids to prevent the leucine-induced hypoaminoacidemia. Changes in the fractional rate of protein synthesis and activation of mTOR, as determined by eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein (4E-BP1) and S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation, in the gastrocnemius and masseter muscles, heart, liver, jejunum, kidney, and pancreas were measured. Leucine increased mTOR activation in the gastrocnemius and masseter muscles, liver, and pancreas, in both the absence and presence of amino acid replacement. However, protein synthesis in these tissues was increased only when amino acids were infused to maintain baseline levels. There were no changes in mTOR signaling or protein synthesis in the other tissues we examined. Thus, long-term infusion of leucine stimulates mTOR signaling in skeletal muscle and some visceral tissues but the leucine-induced stimulation of protein synthesis in these tissues requires sustained amino acid availability.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abinding proteins 3aglycolysis 3aheart 3ajejunum 3akidneys 3aleucine 3aliver 3along term effects 3amuscles 3aneonates 3apancreas 3aphosphorylation 3aprotein synthesis 3askeletal muscle 3aswine 0aGrowth 0aMuscle 0aTranslation initiation 0aMammalian target of rapamycin 0aEukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 0aRibosome protein S6 kinase1 aSuryawan, Agus 1 aOrellana, Renán A. 1 aGazzaneo, María C. 1 aNguyen, Hanh V. 1 aDavis, Teresa A. 0 tAmino acids.g2011 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.157-165dVienna : Springer Viennax0939-44517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00726-010-0629-93Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02868naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245019100169300001400360500002400374500001500398520168600413650000902099650001702108650001002125650001802135650001202153650002202165650001302187650002302200650001102223650002102234650001202255653001602267700001602283700002202299773009202321852000902413856004802422655001202470IND4434641620221121191357.0100326e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443464162DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-010-0161-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBorgström, Reidar.14aThe brown trout (Salmo trutta) in the lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn: long-term changes in population dynamics due to exploitation and the invasive species, European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus)  ap. 81-91.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStudies of the brown trout (Salmo trutta) population in the Norwegian subalpine lake, Øvre Heimdalsvatn, over a 50-year period have revealed major changes in population dynamics. In 1958, the population density was high, with individuals stagnating in growth at lengths below 30 cm. After heavy exploitation during the years 1958-1969, the number of older fish declined substantially, and growth rates increased significantly. Since 1969, the European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) have been observed in the lake, with increasing densities from 1977-1978 to 1999-2000. The age structure of the brown trout population has changed markedly from the 1960s to the period 1993-2006. Annual recruitment significantly declined, from an average number of 3746 individuals in age-class 4 during the period 1958-1966 to an average of 1668 during the period 1993-2006. However, due to lower exploitation rates, the number of old fish was significantly higher in the latter period. The summer diet of brown trout has changed substantially from a dominance of the large crustaceans Lepidurus arcticus and Gammarus lacustris to a high occurrence of European minnows, while L. arcticus has become practically absent from the diet. There was a negative relationship between brown trout biomass and annual length increment. However, despite a brown trout biomass at the same level during the years 1993-2006 as in the 1960s, annual individual growth rates have significantly declined. The reduced recruitment and reduced annual growth rates of the brown trout, as well as changes in the diet, are most likely related to the introduction and establishment of the invasive species, the European minnow. 3adiet 3aSalmo trutta 3alakes 3aage structure 3aminnows 3aPhoxinus phoxinus 3aGammarus 3apopulation density 3asummer 3ainvasive species 3abiomass 0arecruitment1 aMuseth, Jon1 aBrittain, John E.0 tHydrobiologia.g2010 Mar., v. 642, no. 1 p.81-91dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-010-0161-7 7aarticle02778naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010000181300001800281500002400299520121800323650002001541650001401561650001501575650001201590650002201602650000901624650001701633650001501650650001501665650002201680650002101702650001801723650001201741650003501753650002201788650003801810650005801848650003301906650001301939650002801952650004101980700001802021700001602039700001802055773013002073852000902203856004802212655001202260IND4436308520221121154711.0100430e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443630852DNAL7 a199673922pmid7 a10.1007/s00244-009-9434-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEissa, B.

We investigated the impact of exposure to sublethal waterborne cadmium on locomotory parameters of three freshwater teleosts: Cyprinus carpio as reference species, and Australoheros facetum (sin. Cichlasoma facetum) and Astyanax fasciatus, native to Pampean ecosystems in Argentina, using a noninvasive bioassay under laboratory conditions. Fish were successively transferred to media containing freshwater (control period), Cd²⁺ solutions (exposure period), and freshwater (recovery period). The behavioral biomarkers evaluated were swimming activity and swimming speed of fish. The metal provoked different responses of both parameters after 4-7 days of exposure; the reversibility of changes was also assessed. It was concluded that: (a) locomotion parameters are sensitive endpoints and useful biomarkers in behavioral studies of freshwater toxicity, (b) the applied bioassay could be a valuable tool in water quality monitoring, and (c) the studied species differed in their susceptibility to the toxicant as well as in their capacity to return to basal values. 3aCyprinus carpio 3abioassays 3abiomarkers 3acadmium 3aexposure duration 3afish 3aheavy metals 3alocomotion 3amonitoring 3asublethal effects 3atoxicity testing 3awater quality 2aAnimals 2aBehavior, Animalxdrug effects 2aCadmiumxtoxicity 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aFishesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aMotor Activityxdrug effects 2aSwimming 2aToxicity Testsxmethods 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxtoxicity1 aOssana, N.

On the whole, this study proposes a new way of segmenting Portuguese fashion consumers and demonstrates that the four constructs employed can be used in different cultural contexts. 3acluster analysis 3amarkets 3ayoung adults 0aFashion 0aconsumer profiles 0ainnovativeness 0ainvolvement 0aself-expression 0aimpulsiveness1 aCosta, Helda Sofia1 aNovais, Liliana Andreia0 tInternational journal of consumer studies.g2010 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.638-647dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1470-64237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1470-6431.2010.00891.x 7aarticle03455naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245009100186300001600277500002400293520201000317650001802327650001802345650001602363650002602379650000902405650003002414650001802444650001402462650002602476650002502502650001402527650001402541650001402555650003102569650001202600650001302612650002502625650001402650650002802664650002402692650002302716651001402739700002002753700002302773773008402796852000902880856004802889655001202937IND4404724720221121154759.0080421e200805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440472472DNAL7 a183059662pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-008-0985-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFigueira, Will F.10aSelective mortality of a coral reef damselfish: role of predator-competitor synergisms  ap. 215-226.  aIncludes references  aPhenotypic variability within cohorts of juvenile organisms can serve as the basis for selective mortality. Previous studies have demonstrated the important role that predators play in this process but not the impact of competitors on selective predation. We use a combination of lab and field studies to evaluate the effect of the presence of adult competitor damselfish (Dascyllus aruanus and Pomacentrus moluccensis; family Pomacentridae) on the selective mortality of newly-arrived (settled) lemon damselfish (P. moluccensis) by resident predator fishes (Pseudochromis fuscus Pseudochromidae and Cheilodipterus quinquelineatus Apogonidae). Lab trials consisted of mesocosm experiments in which the behaviour, mortality, and physiological condition (measured as lipid content) of surviving P. moluccensis settlers from each of three treatments: (1) predators absent, (2) predators present, and (3) predators and competitors present, were compared. The field study involved stocking newly settled P. moluccensis on natural bommies (patch reefs) which had either been subject to a partial removal of resident fish (predators and competitors) or left alone. Results indicated there was very strong condition-based selective mortality in both the lab and field trials. In both cases there was a strong positive relationship between mortality and the lipid content of surviving fish; implying low-condition fish were selectively removed. The mesocosm trials indicated that the strength of mortality as well as condition selectivity was higher when competitors were present than when they were absent. Behavioural observations in the mesocosm study suggest that attention by juvenile P. moluccensis to the movements and occasional chases of the competitors (especially D. aruanus) reduced their vigilance to the predators. These results suggest the important and interactive roles which condition of newly settled reef fish and interspecific competition can play in the outcomes of post-settlement predation. 3aPomacentridae 3aPseudochromis 3acoral reefs 3afield experimentation 3afish 3ainterspecific competition 3alipid content 3amortality 3aobservational studies 3aphenotypic variation 3apredation 3apredators 3asynergism 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimals 2aAnthozoa 2aCompetitive Behavior 2aMortality 2aPerciformesxphysiology 2aPopulation Dynamics 2aPredatory Behavior 0aAustralia1 aBooth, David J.1 aGregson, Marcus A.0 tOecologia.g2008 May, v. 156, no. 1 p.215-226dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-0985-2 7aarticle02686naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245016900181300001600350500002400366520134700390650001601737650001101753650002101764650002601785650001401811650000901825650001301834650001801847650002001865650001301885650001301898650001701911650001501928650001501943650001301958650001401971650001601985651001302001700002002014700001602034773011402050852000902164856005502173655001202228IND4402794220080404000000.0080314e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440279422DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.01039.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGutiérrez-Estrada, J.C.10aEstimating fish community diversity from environmental features in the Tagus estuary (Portugal): Multiple Linear Regression and Artificial Neural Network approaches  ap. 150-162.  aIncludes references  aRelationships between environmental variables and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) of the fish communities in the Tagus estuary and adjacent coastal areas were analyzed. The focus was on the linearity or nonlinearity of these abiotic/biotic characteristics, with the aim to obtain an accurate short-medium term time-scale diversity prediction from habitat variables alone. Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR) were used for the linear approach and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for the nonlinear approach. MLR results in the external validation phase indicated a lack of model accuracy (R² = 0.0710; %SEP = 47.5868; E = -0.0217; ARV = 1.0217; N = 43). Results of the best of the Artificial Neural Networks used in this study (12-15-15-1 architecture) in the external validation phase (ANN: R² = 0.9736; %SEP = 7.8499; E = 0.9722; ARV = 0.0278; N = 43) were more accurate than those obtained with MLR. This indicates a clear nonlinear relationship between variables. In the best ANN model, nitrate concentration, depth, dissolved oxygen and temperature were the most important predictors of fish diversity in the Tagus estuary. The sensibility analysis indicated that the remaining variables (silicate, nitrite, transparency, salinity, slope, phosphate, water particulate organic matter, and chlorophyll a) played lesser roles in the model. 3achlorophyll 3acoasts 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3afish 3ahabitats 3alinear models 3aneural networks 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aparticulates 3aphosphates 3aprediction 3asalinity 3asilicates 3atemperature 3aPortugal1 aVasconcelos, R.1 aCosta, M.J.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2008 Apr., v. 24, no. 2 p.150-162dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2007.01039.x 7aarticle02856naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009700167300001800264500002400282520173800306650001702044650002502061650001302086650001502099650001502114650001902129700001902148700001702167700001902184700002302203700002002226700001802246700002002264700001702284773011202301852000902413856004802422655001202470IND4412957920221121032631.0081121e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441295792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10531-008-9359-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLengyel, Szabolcs12aA review and a framework for the integration of biodiversity monitoring at the habitat level  ap. 3341-3356.  aIncludes references  aThe monitoring of biodiversity at the level of habitats is becoming widespread in Europe and elsewhere as countries establish national habitat monitoring systems and various organisations initiate regional and local schemes. Parallel to this growth, it is increasingly important to address biodiversity changes on large spatial (e.g. continental) and temporal (e.g. decade-long) scales, which requires the integration of currently ongoing monitoring efforts. Here we review habitat monitoring and develop a framework for integrating data or activities across habitat monitoring schemes. We first identify three basic properties of monitoring activities: spatial aspect (explicitly spatial vs. non-spatial), documentation of spatial variation (field mapping vs. remote sensing) and coverage of habitats (all habitats or specific habitats in an area), and six classes of monitoring schemes based on these properties. Then we explore tasks essential for integrating schemes both within and across the major classes. Finally, we evaluate the need and potential for integration of currently existing schemes by drawing on data collected on European habitat monitoring in the EuMon project. Our results suggest a dire need for integration if we are to measure biodiversity changes across large spatial and temporal scales regarding the 2010 target and beyond. We also make recommendations for an integrated pan-European habitat monitoring scheme. Such a scheme should be based on remote sensing to record changes in land cover and habitat types over large scales, with complementary field mapping using unified methodology to provide ground truthing and to monitor small-scale changes, at least in habitat types of conservation importance. 3abiodiversity 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aland cover 3amonitoring 3aremote sensing1 aKobler, Andrej1 aKutnar, Lado1 aFramstad, Erik1 aHenry, Pierre-Yves1 aBabij, Valerija1 aGruber, Bernd1 aSchmeller, Dirk1 aHenle, Klaus0 tBiodiversity and conservation.g2008 Dec., v. 17, no. 14 p.3341-3356dSpringer Netherlandsx0960-31157nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-008-9359-7 7aarticle03408naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100002100156245019200177300001400369500001500383520126300398650001101661650002501672650002101697650002401718650001601742650002901758650002501787650002701812650001201839650002801851650002001879650002401899650001801923650002501941650002301966650002301989650002302012650001602035650001802051650003302069650002002102650002102122650002802143650002102171650001302192650005202205650004502257650002802302653001402330653002202344653002302366653001902389653002802408653002502436700001902461773006302480852000902543856007802552930003302630945001302663946001102676990002302687655001202710IND2054271120221120230806.0961202e19960115gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205427112DNAL7 a85696892pmid7 a10.1007/BF021918262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAltmann-Johl, R.10aAgTHR4, a new selection marker for transformation of the filamentous fungus Ashbya gossypii, maps in a four-gene cluster that is conserved between A. gossypii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 69-80.  a2019-12-04  aSingle-read sequence analysis of the termini of eight randomly picked clones of Ashbya gossypii genomic DNA revealed seven sequences with homology to Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes (15% to 69% on the amino acid level). One of these sequences appeared to code for the carboxy-terminus of threonine synthase, the product of the S. cerevisiae THR4 gene (52.4% identity over 82 amino acids). We cloned and sequenced the complete putative AgTHR4 gene of A. gossypii. It comprises 512 codons, two less than the S. cerevisiae THR4 gene. Overall identity at the amino acid sequence level is 67.4%. A continuous stretch of 32 amino acids displaying complete identity between these two fungal threonine syntheses presumably contains the pyridoxal phosphate attachment site. Disruption of the A. gossypii gene led to threonine auxotrophy, which could be complemented by transformation with replicating plasmids carrying the AgTHR4 gene and various S. cerevisiae ARS elements. Using these plasmids only very weak complementation of a S. cerevisiae thr4 mutation was observed. Investigation of sequences adjacent to the AgTHR4 gene identified three additional ORFs. Surprisingly, the order and orientation of these four ORFs is conserved in A. gossypii and S. cerevisiae. 3alyases 3aregulatory sequences 3astructural genes 3aopen reading frames 3amutagenesis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3amutants 3agenetic complementation 3agenetic markers 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aCarbon-Oxygen Lyases 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aDNA, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenetic Markers 2aLyasesxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aMutation 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSaccharomycetalesxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aTransformation, Genetic 0athr4 gene 0aSaccharomycetales 0athreonine synthase 0agenbank/x91046 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences1 aPhilippsen, P.0 tMGG.g1996 Jan. 15, v. 250, no. 1 p.69-80x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF021918263Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03524naa a2200733 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024002800110040001800138100001500156245007700171300001400248520133600262650002801598650002601626650002101652650003201673650002001705650002301725650002001748650001801768650000901786650002601795650002701821650002101848650001701869650002101886650002901907650001701936650002401953650002301977650001802000650002302018650002302041650002902064650002102093650004202114650002002156650002102176650001502197650002802212650003002240650005102270650003602321650002702357650003102384650002702415653002302442653001402465653001702479700001902496700001802515700001502533773006302548852000902611856007802620930003302698945001302731946001102744990002302755655001202778IND2054270920221120230834.0961202e19960115gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205427092DNAL7 a85696872pmid7 a10.1007/BF021918242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSexton, R.10aTranscriptional regulation of the iron-responsive sigma factor gene pbrA  ap. 50-58.  aIn response to the intracellular iron concentration Pseudomonas fluorescence M114 coordinately regulates the production of pseudobactin M114, its cognate receptor PbuA, and a casein protease. Transcriptional initiation of the coordinate iron-stress response requires the sigma factor PbrA. PbrA is a member of the ECF (Extracytoplasmic function) subgroup of the sigma 70 family of eubacterial RNA polymerase sigma factors. Regulatory studies of the pbrA gene utilising promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusions demonstrate that expression of pbrA dictates the cellular response to iron. pbrA is transcribed in all phases of iron-limited growth but maximally at late-logarithmic to stationary phase. pbrA expression is independent of autoregulatory control but is strictly repressed in iron-rich conditions in a Fur-dependent fashion. Constitutive expression of pbrA from an inducible tac promoter permits the induction of PbrA-dependent transcription and pseudobactin M114 biosynthesis in high-iron conditions. A PbrA consensus sequence was derived from significant DNA sequence homologies observed within the "-25 bp" and "-16 bp" regions conserved among all PbrA-dependent promoters. The predicted PbrA target promoter consensus is homologous for the promoter recognition sites for other environmentally responsive ECF sigma factors. 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3atranscription factors 3abinding proteins 3aDNA-directed RNA polymerase 3arecombinant DNA 3abeta-galactosidase 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3airon 3anutrient availability 3agenetic transformation 3aEscherichia coli 3abiosynthesis 3apromoter regions 3atranscription (genetics) 3asiderophores 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBacterial Proteins 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConsensus Sequence 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aEscherichia coli 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Reporter 2aIronxmetabolism 2aLac Operon 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSigma Factorxgenetics 2aTrans-Activatorsxgenetics 2aTranscription, Genetic 0agenetic regulation 0apbra gene 0apseudobactin1 aGill, P.R.

The PDA1 gene encodes a cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase which detoxifies pisatin. Regulatory elements controlling transcription from the PDA1 promoter were identified using a homologous Nectria in vitro transcription system through analysis of 5' deletions, specific oligonucleotide competition, and fusion of upstream segments to a heterologous promoter. A promoter-distal element which provided transcriptional activation was localized to a 35-bp region positioned -514 to -483 upstream of the transcriptional start site. This 35-bp region binds a previously characterized pisatin-responsive DNA-binding factor (PRF) and thus may provide pisatin-responsive control of transcription. A second promoter-proximal positive-acting region was found to be necessary for promoter transcription in both homologous and heterologous extracts, and so is likely to bind less gene-specific transcription activator(s). A negative-acting element located between these two positive regions may act to make the positive-acting elements interdependent. The identification of an activator responding to pisatin provides a model for the control of a number of genes and processes controlled by host-specific signals, particularly the flavonoids. 3atranscription factors 3aunspecific monooxygenase 3amessenger RNA 3arecombinant DNA 3apisatin 3aAgrobacterium radiobacter 3atranscription (genetics) 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aFusarium eumartii 3apromoter regions 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mapping 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgenetics 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aFusariumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aOxidoreductases, O-Demethylatingxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aNectria haematococca 0ain vitro 0apisatin demethylase 0atc7 promoter 0apisatin response element 0adeletions 0aAgrobacterium tumefaciens 0apisatin responsive factor1 aStraney, D.C.0 tMGG.g1996 Jan. 15, v. 250, no. 1 p.29-38x0026-89257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF021918223Available from publisher's Web site  a19970106b19970110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03261naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245010100132300001600233500001500249520211800264650001902382650001502401650002102416650002402437650001302461650002102474650001502495650001802510650001802528650001602546650001602562653001402578653002502592653002302617653001702640700001502657700001802672773007102690852000902761930003302770945001302803946001102816655001202827IND2045285620221120230701.0950328s1994    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204528562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPrendergast, J.B.12aA model for conjunctive use of groundwater and surface waters for control of irrigation salinity  ap. 167-175.  a2019-12-05  aChanges in the hydrologic balance in many irrigation areas, including those in the Murray Basin, Australia, have resulted in high watertables and salinity problems. However, where suitable aquifers exist, groundwater pumping and subsequent irrigation application after mixing with surface waters (referred to as conjunctive water use) can control salinity and watertable depth and improve productivity of degraded land. In order to assess where conjunctive water use will successfully control salinity, it is necessary to estimate the effects of pumped groundwater salinity on rootzone salinity. A simple steady rate model is derived for this purpose from mass conservation of salt and water. The model enables an estimate to be made of rootzone salinity for any particular salinity level of the groundwater being used in conjunction with surface water; this enables calculation of the required crop salt tolerance to prevent yield reductions. The most important input parameters for the model are groundwater salinity, the annual depth of class 'A' pan evaporation, the annual depth of rainfall, the salinity of irrigation water, and a leaching parameter. For model parameters nominated in this paper, where groundwater salinity reaches 5 dS/m a crop threshold salt tolerance greater than 1.6 dS/m is required to avoid yield reductions. Where groundwater salinity approaches 10 dS/m, a crop threshold tolerance of 3 dS/m is required. Whilst the model derived indicates that rootzone salinity is sensitive to groundwater salinity, rootzone salinity is insensitive to leaching for leaching fractions commonly encountered (0.1 to 0.4). The insensitivity to leaching means that it could be expected that similar yields could be attained on heavy or light textured soils. This insensitivity also implies that there is no yield penalty from increasing the mass of pumped salt by pumping to achieve maximum watertable control in addition to leaching. The model developed is also used to estimate yield reductions expected under conjunctive use, for any particular levels of groundwater salinity and crop salt tolerance. 3asalt tolerance 3aestimation 3airrigation water 3amathematical models 3asalinity 3awater management 3asoil depth 3asoil salinity 3asurface water 3agroundwater 3awater table 0awater use 0agroundwater salinity 0aroot zone salinity 0ayield losses1 aRose, C.W.1 aHogarth, W.L.0 tIrrigation science.g1994, v. 14, no. 4 p.167-175x0342-71887nnas  aDNAL  a19950404b19950410c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02239naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245008200129300001500211500015200226520126400378650001901642650002501661650001501686650002201701700002401723700002501747700001701772773007001789852000901859930003301868945001301901946001101914655001201925IND2039588020221120221639.0940518s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203958802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichards, R.A.10aImproving the efficiency of water use by plant breeding and molecular biology  ap. 93-104.  aPaper presented at the First Volcani International Symposium on The Limits of Water Use Efficiency in Agriculture, October 1992, Bet Dagan, Israel.  aPlant breeding over the last century has indirectly increased water use efficiency of the major grain crops because yield has increased with no additional water use. These increases have been substantial in all major food crops. Improved varieties have come from conventional breeding programs where selection has been for yield. Although these increases are likely to continue, they may not occur at the same rate as before. Most of the increases have been due to improvements in harvest index which must now be approaching its theoretical limit in many of our major crops. There has been little increase in water use efficiency for biomass and this must be increased if improvements in water-use efficiency are to continue. Possibilities are numerous. They will depend on the crop and the environment in which it is grown. Modification of phenology to better suit the environment, which has been responsible for many of the increases in the past, will continue to be important in most crops. Genetic increases in water-use efficiency should also come from the manipulation of the crop canopy to reduce wasteful evaporation of water from the soil surface and from an improvement in transpiration efficiency. The most likely avenues for success are discussed. 3aplant breeding 3awater use efficiency 3acrop yield 3amolecular biology1 aLopez-Castaneda, C.1 aGomez-Macpherson, H.1 aCondon, A.G.0 tIrrigation science.g1993, v. 14, no. 2 p.93-104x0342-71887nnas  aDNAL  a19940603b19940609c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01472naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245008100123300001600204520066000220650001500880650002500895650002100920653001300941653001300954653001200967653003000979700001201009773007101021852000901092930003301101945001301134946001101147655001201158IND2036026720221120221537.0931201s1993    gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203602672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmir, I.10aLateral and longitudinal wetting patterns of very low energy moving emitters  ap. 183-187.  aA set of experiments was conducted to investigate the wetting contours obtained under very low pressure (10-15 kPa) moving emitters. Nine different instantaneous application rates (IAR) were applied by three types of emitters: open-end pipe, short (5 m) and long (10 m) perforated pipes and for three water amounts. Results show that high IAR increase the uniformity of the wetting pattern and its width, and decrease the depth. On the other hand, high IAR increase water ponding on soil surface and, consequently, water runoff. The results of wetting patterns under moving emitters are in a good agreement with those for source-point stationary emitters. 3asoil water 3aspatial distribution 3aapplication rate 0aemitters 0apatterns 0awetting 0amobile irrigation systems1 aDag, J.0 tIrrigation science.g1993, v. 13, no. 4 p.183-187x0342-71887nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdCMS  aNon-US 7aarticle02351naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007100130300001600201520130600217650001501523650001201538650001101550650001401561650001401575650001401589650001601603650001501619650002201634650000901656650001001665650001601675650001201691653001601703653002901719653002301748700001701771773007501788852000901863930003301872945001301905946001101918655001201929IND2061227620221120211745.0980112e199705  gw |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND206122762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoghazi, H.E.M.12aA study of losses from field channels under arid region conditions  ap. 105-110.  aIn arid regions, water losses from unlined small field channels are usually high due to seepage and evaporation from open surfaces. These losses are often neglected by many project planners and engineers. A theoretical analysis has been developed to modify the equation usually used to determine the water losses based on the ponding method, where the channel longitudinal slope was considered in the analysis. A field investigation has been carried out in sandy soil to determine and evaluate the water losses for three different types of channels. They are: earthen-uncompacted channel, compacted channel bed and channel lined by jute mats coated with bitumen emulsion on both faces. The last two cases are relatively low-cost, need less skillful labour than lining by cement and are more suitable for temporary field channels. Manning's coefficient was determined for each case. The results show that the process of compacting the channel bed reduced the rate of seepage by a considerable value and that lining of field channels by prefabricated bitumen jute mats caused a significant reduction in the seepage rate. The results also show that the evaporation from open surfaces caused a considerable loss and should be considered when studying water losses from irrigation channels in arid regions. 3aarid zones 3abitumen 3acement 3aemulsions 3aengineers 3aequations 3aevaporation 3airrigation 3airrigation canals 3ajute 3alabor 3asandy soils 3aseepage 0acomparisons 0achannel lining materials 0achannel compaction1 aIsmail, E.S.0 tIrrigation science.g1997 May, v. 17, no. 3 p.105-110x0342-71887nnas  aDNAL  a19980201b19980206c00000000  aINDdTW1  aNon-US 7aarticle03592naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245018800190300001800378520165700396650001602053650001002069650004502079650001902124650001102143650005602154650001102210650002002221650006802241650004302309650002502352650004002377650003702417650001402454650001502468650002102483650001602504651001102520653001402531653004702545653001502592700002002607700001802627700002202645700002002667700002302687700002302710773014802733852000902881856009202890930003302982946001103015655001203026IND4442496320221120200151.0100917e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444249632DNAL7 a206670512pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3156.2010.02609.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarigye, Henry10aOperational evaluation of a service for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in rural Uganda: barriers to uptake of single-dose nevirapine and the role of birth reporting  ap. 1163-1171.  aTo determine factors associated with pregnant women being HIV positive, barriers to the uptake of single-dose nevirapine (sdNVP) for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and feasibility and effectiveness of reporting HIV-exposed infants born in facilities with no PMTCT services so as to receive NVP. From 2002 to 2007, a sdNVP PMTCT service was implemented in 53 rural villages of south-west Uganda. Twenty-five of them were HIV-surveillance study villages. The proportions of mothers testing positive and mother and newborns receiving and ingesting sdNVP and associated factors were determined. Women with incomplete primary or no education, aged 25-34 years or not living with their partners were at increased risk of being HIV infected. Seventy-seven percentage of pregnant women with HIV (PWH) received therapy. Of the 63 PWH who received therapy and had surviving live births, only 39 (62%) reported births and received newborn prophylaxis within 72 h. Women were more likely to collect and ingest NVP if they were from study villages, preferred home administration of newborn NVP or presented at a more advanced stage of pregnancy. Newborns were more likely to be reported and receive NVP if mothers were aged 25-34 years, on antiretroviral therapy (ART) or came from study villages. The uptake of PMTCT services was unacceptably low. Asking PWH with less advanced pregnancies to return to collect NVP leads to missed opportunities especially if PWH are less educated.

In order to better understanding the structure of these materials and the effects of flax pulping, X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetry analysis under air atmosphere have been used. There was a significant effect of the fibre size on the composition, crystallinity, and thermal behaviour of the flax pulps. On the other hand, data obtained from thermogravimetric analysis have been modelled on the basis of two cellulose types characterized by different crystallinity levels, using kinetics equations based on the nucleation concept. As a result of these simulations, composition of the samples, pulp crystallinity and the proportion of amorphous cellulose are calculated. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aair 3acellulose 3acrystal structure 3aequations 3aflax 3apulp 3apulping 3araw materials 3athermal properties 3athermogravimetry 0aFlax fibre 0aFlax pulp 0aNucleation kinetic1 aVila, Carlos 1 aAriza, José 1 aVidal, Teresa 0 tCellulose.g2011 Feb., v. 18, no. 1 p.17-31dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0969-02397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10570-010-9472-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20110114b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03054naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245014800164300001800312520166600330650001301996650001702009650001402026653002702040653001802067653001302085653002002098700001902118700001902137700001502156700002102171700002302192700001502215700002402230700002002254700001402274700001602288700002302304700002102327773011002348852000902458856008502467930003302552946001102585655001202596IND4445139320221120184901.0101113e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444513932DNAL7 a10.1007/s00125-010-1906-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAndersson, C. 10aMetformin treatment is associated with a low risk of mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure: a retrospective nationwide cohort study  ap. 2546-2553.  aAims/hypothesis The safety of metformin in heart failure has been questioned because of a perceived risk of life-threatening lactic acidosis, though recent studies have not supported this concern. We investigated the risk of all-cause mortality associated with individual glucose-lowering treatment regimens used in current clinical practice in Denmark. Methods All patients aged ≥30 years hospitalised for the first time for heart failure in 1997-2006 were identified and followed until the end of 2006. Patients who received treatment with metformin, a sulfonylurea and/or insulin were included and assigned to mono-, bi- or triple therapy groups. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the risk of all-cause mortality. Results A total of 10,920 patients were included. The median observational time was 844 days (interquartile range 365-1,395 days). In total, 6,187 (57%) patients died. With sulfonylurea monotherapy used as the reference, adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality associated with the different treatment groups were as follows: metformin 0.85 (95% CI 0.75-0.98, p = 0.02), metformin + sulfonylurea 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.96, p = 0.003), metformin + insulin 0.96 (95% CI 0.82-1.13, p = 0.6), metformin + insulin + sulfonylurea 0.94 (95% CI 0.77-1.15, p = 0.5), sulfonylurea + insulin 0.97 (95% CI 0.86-1.08, p = 0.5) and insulin 1.14 (95% CI 1.06-1.20, p = 0.0001). Conclusions/interpretation Treatment with metformin is associated with a low risk of mortality in diabetic patients with heart failure compared with treatment with a sulfonylurea or insulin. 3adiabetes 3aepidemiology 3ametformin 0aGlucose-lowering drugs 0aHeart failure 0aOutcomes 0aPharmacotherapy1 aOlesen, J.

To assess the effects of dietary fatty acids on hepatic lipid homeostasis, the hepatic expression and activity of PPARα, SREBP-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF-4α) were investigated in this animal model. In control and sedentary rats, diets enriched with saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) enhanced the expression of the PPARα target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 and acyl-CoA oxidase, the highest effect being exerted by ω-3. The same diets reduced SREBP-1 mRNA and target lipogenic gene expression, as indicated by the reduction in fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA content. Effects were greater in sedentary rat liver than in controls on the same diet. Only the ω-3 enriched diet decreased liver triglyceride content as well as plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels in sedentary rats. This effect may be mainly related to the enhanced mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation genes expression. On the other hand, saturated fatty acid-enriched diet induced an increase in liver triglyceride content and enhanced plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, both in control and immobilized rats. This detrimental effect may be ascribed to the induced HNF-4α binding activity on ApoCIII promoter and to the enhanced ApoCIII mRNA levels both in control and in sedentary rat livers. In conclusion, we can speculate that dietary saturated fats, acting at apolipoprotein transcriptional level, may impact on the close relationship existing among high ApoCIII plasma level, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis. 3aapolipoproteins 0aImmobilization 0aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor 0aSterol regulatory element-binding protein 11 aNocentini, Giuseppe 1 aRiccardi, Carlo 1 aAyroldi, Emira 1 aDi Nardo, Paolo 1 aRoberti, Rita 1 aBinaglia, Luciano 1 aVecchini, Alba 0 tMolecular and cellular biochemistry.g2011 Jan., v. 347, no. 1-2 p.29-39dBoston : Springer USx0300-81777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11010-010-0609-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20101224b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle04141naa a2200793 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001400171245013200185300001600317520136200333650002201695650002501717650002101742650001401763650001401777650001601791650001701807650002001824650001901844650001401863650001201877650001301889650003301902650001401935650004001949650001601989650002602005650004102031650003202072650003502104650003802139650001902177650005402196650003102250650002102281650006202302650002502364650003302389650005502422650005302477650002002530650005502550650004302605650002802648650006002676650004702736650005102783650005202834650004902886650003302935653001302968653001902981653001803000653001403018700001903032700001403051700001403065773011103079852000903190856009203199930003303291946001103324655001203335IND4441743020221120175854.0100827e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444174302DNAL7 a205612602pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04282.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBar, Maya10aBAK1 is required for the attenuation of ethylene-inducing xylanase (Eix)-induced defense responses by the decoy receptor LeEix1  ap. 791-800.  aElicitor recognition plays a key role in the reaction of plants to pathogens and the induction of plant defense responses. Furthermore, plant-microbe interactions involve numerous regulatory systems essential for plant defense against pathogens. Ethylene-inducing xylanase (Eix) is a potent elicitor of plant defense responses in specific cultivars of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The Eix receptors (LeEix1 and LeEix2) belong to a superclade of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like proteins (RLP) with a signal for receptor-mediated endocytosis, which was shown to be essential for proper induction of defense responses. Both receptors are able to bind Eix, while only LeEix2 mediates defense responses. Here we demonstrate that LeEix1 heterodimerizes with LeEix2 upon application of the Eix elicitor. We show that LeEix1 attenuates Eix-induced internalization and signaling of the LeEix2 receptor. Furthermore, we demonstrate, using yeast two-hybrid and in planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, that the brassinosteroid co-receptor, BAK1, binds LeEix1 but not LeEix2. In BAK1-silenced plants, LeEix1 was no longer able to attenuate plant responses to Eix, indicating that BAK1 is required for this attenuation. We suggest that LeEix1 functions as a decoy receptor for LeEix2, a function which requires BAK1. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSolanum lycopersicum 3abrassinosteroids 3acultivars 3aelicitors 3aendocytosis 3afluorescence 3aplant pathogens 3aplant response 3areceptors 3atobacco 3atomatoes 3atwo hybrid system techniques 3axylanases 2aEndo-1,4-beta Xylanasesxmetabolism 2aEndocytosis 2aEndosomesxmetabolism 2aEthylenesxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aFungal Proteinsxmetabolism 2aFungixmetabolismxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGene Silencing 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aImmunity, Innate 2aSolanum lycopersicumxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMicroscopy, Confocal 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Isoformsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProtein Multimerization 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aProteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReceptors, Cell Surfacexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aTwo-Hybrid System Techniques 0aelicitor 0adecoy receptor 0aplant defense 0asignaling1 aSharfman, Miya1 aRon, Mily1 aAvni, Adi0 tPlant journal.g2010 Sept., v. 63, no. 5 p.791-800dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0960-74127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04282.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100827b20100903c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02019naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245020000164300001600364520090600380650001801286650002101304653002101325653002401346653002901370700002701399700003701426773010401463852000901567856008501576930003301661946001101694655001201705IND4448531820221120175832.0110128e201102  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444853182DNAL7 a10.1007/s00604-010-0475-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHabibi, Biuck 10aElectrochemical oxidation and nanomolar detection of acetaminophen at a carbon-ceramic electrode modified by carbon nanotubes: a comparison between multi walled and single walled carbon nanotubes  ap. 147-154.  aCarbon-ceramic electrodes (CCE) modified with carbon nanotubes were prepared, and the electrochemical behavior towards acetaminophen (ACOP) was investigated using both a bare CCE and electrodes modified with either single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) or multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) in an effort to understand which of them is the better choice in terms of electrocatalyzing the oxidation of ACOP, and thus for sensing it. The SWCNT are found to be the better material in significantly enhancing the oxidation peak current and improving the reversibility of the oxidation. Under optimal conditions, linearity between the oxidation peak current and the concentration of ACOP is obtained for the concentration range from 40 nM to 85 μM, with a detection limit of 25 nM.

P675 bearings have exhibited higher land wear compared to conventional M50 bearings under contaminated test conditions. Surface modification techniques can be applied to enhance the wear resistance of bearing land surfaces. A coating has been developed to minimize abrasive wear of land surfaces. A new procedure using a 40 mm bearing test rig has been developed to effectively evaluate land wear under simulated contaminated condition. Test conditions including contamination concentration, test duration, test temperature and lubricant flow rate were optimized to obtain measureable wear on the land surfaces in a reasonable test time.

When the magnitude of selection exerted on a heritable sex trait differs between the sexes, it may prevent each sex to reach its phenotypic optimum. As a consequence, the benefit of expressing a sex trait to a given value may differ between males and females favouring sex-specific adaptations associated with different values of a sex trait. The level of metabolites regulated by genes that are under sex-dependent selection may therefore covary with the degree of ornamentation differently in the two sexes. We investigated this prediction in the barn owl, a species in which females display on average larger black spots on the plumage than males, a heritable ornament. This melanin-based colour trait is strongly selected in females and weakly counter-selected in males indicating sex-dependent selection. In nestling barn owls, we found that daily variation in baseline corticosterone levels, a key hormone that mediates life history trade-offs, covaries with spot diameter displayed by their biological parents. When their mother displayed larger spots, nestlings had lower corticosterone levels in the morning and higher levels in the evening, whereas the opposite pattern was found with the size of paternal spots. Our study suggests a link between daily regulation of glucocorticoids and sex-dependent selection exerted on sexually dimorphic melanin-based ornaments. 3aTyto alba 3acolor 3acorticosterone 3afemales 3agenes 3alife history 3amales 3ametabolites 3anestlings 3aparents 3aplumage 3aprediction 3asexual dimorphism 3atemporal variation 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCircadian Rhythm 2aCorticosteronexblood 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMelaninsxmetabolism 2aPigmentation 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSex Characteristics 2aStrigiformesxbloodxgenetics. 0adaily rhythm 0aintralocus genetic conflict 0amelanin-based coloration 0asexually antagonistic selection1 aALMASI, B.1 aJENNI, L.0 tJournal of evolutionary biology.g2010 Oct., v. 23, no. 10 p.2046-2053dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1010-061X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.02086.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20100917b20101001c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03244naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245013300127300001600260500018200276500001500458520191000473650001802383650001002401650002502411650001602436650001202452650001002464650001102474650001102485650002102496650001402517653001302531653001502544653002302559653001102582700002202593700002502615700001602640773007602656852000902732930003302741945001302774946001102787655001202798IND2321557320221120154352.0010614e200008  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232155732DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSangha, R.S.10aSurvival and growth of Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) larvae fed a single dose of live algae and artificial diets with supplements  ap. 683-689.  aIn the special issue: Live feeds and microparticulate diets / edited by J.A.

Paper presented at a conference held April 26-May 2, 1999, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.  a2019-12-05  aThe present work evaluates the effectiveness of partial or total replacement of microalgae with artificial diets [CAR Frippak, experimental Dry Immune Selco (DIS, with vitamins C, E, HUFA and immunostimulants)] administered together with a single dose of live algae (SDLA) for the protozoeal stages of the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (Boone) (expt 1). In expt 2, Artemia enriched with DIS were fed to mysis 1-postlarvae 1 to assess diet performances. The results indicate that highest survival and growth is obtained when larvae at the N6-PZ1 moult are administered DIS (2 mg L-1 day-1) + CAR (2 mg L-1 day-1) and SDLA (20 cells microliter-1 mixed algae, Chaetoceros muelleri and Isochrysis galbana, 70%:30% respectively) as a first feed, and DIS + CAR (2 mg L-1 day-1 each) thereafter until PZ3 (survival 91.2%), as opposed to live microalgae control (81.9%). A significantly better total length was achieved by larvae fed the live microalgae control (2.51 mm) or the above artificial diet regime (2.44 mm) than in all other treatments. Larvae administered this artificial diet treatment were significantly heavier (0.039 mg larvae-1) than those fed the algal control (0.023 mg larvae-1) or any other treatment. This may result from the combined effect of the artificial diet together with vitamins C, E and HUFA in the booster DIS. These results demonstrate for the first time the impact that a single first feed at the N6-PZ1 moult may have on later development, as all larval groups received the same diet from the PZ1 to PZ3 stages. The results from expt 2 indicate that the administration of Artemia enriched with DIS during mysis 1-post-larvae 1 for L. vannamei larvae results in a significant increase in survival (88.6%), total length (5.24 mm) and weight (0.155 mg larvae-1) in comparison with other enrichments, such as DIS 5V1 (without vitamins, but with HUFA) or non-enrichment. 3aphytoplankton 3afeeds 3aLitopenaeus vannamei 3abody weight 3aArtemia 3aalgae 3alength 3alarvae 3afeed supplements 3amortality 0aefficacy 0aenrichment 0aalgae and seaweeds 0agrowth1 aPuello Cruz, A.C.1 aChavez-Sanchez, M.C.1 aJones, D.A.0 tAquaculture research.g2000 , v. 31, no. 8/9 p.683-689x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03037naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245010000130300001600230500018200246500001500428520159600443650002802039650001802067650001702085650001002102650001202112650002002124650001402144650001302158650001102171650001202182650002702194650001902221650001702240653002402257653001502281653001602296700001802312700001802330700001702348700001802365700001802383773007602401852000902477930003302486945001302519946001102532655001202543IND2321552220221120150539.0010614e200008  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232155222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aD'Souza, F.M.L.10aEvaluation of centrifuged microalgae concentrates as diets for Penaeus monodon Fabricius larvae  ap. 661-670.  aIn the special issue: Live feeds and microparticulate diets / edited by J.A. Nell. Paper presented at a conference held April 26-May 2, 1999, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.  a2019-12-05  aConcentrates of nine microalgae widely used in marine hatcheries were prepared by centrifugation, stored chilled for either 9 or 14 weeks and then compared with their fresh counterpart as feeds for Penaeus monodon larvae. The nine species--Chaetoceros muelleri, C. calcitrans, Isochrysis sp. 'Tahitian' (T-ISO), Nannochloropsis oculata, Pavlova lutheri, Skeletonema costatum, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, Tetraselmis chuii and Thalassiosira pseudonana--in fresh and centrifuged forms were fed at high and low cell densities. The Larvatron, a computer-controlled apparatus for rearing planktonic animals, was used for the experiments. Fresh C. muelleri and T. pseudonana promoted the highest survival and fastest development of P. monodon to mysis 1. Although the survival rate of larvae fed concentrated C. muelleri, P. lutheri and T-ISO was comparable with those fed the fresh C. muelleri diet, the larvae fed these concentrates generally developed more slowly. The higher cell density, whether of fresh or concentrated algae, usually produced both higher survival and faster development of larvae. Nannochloropsis oculata and P. tricornutum were poor diets, regardless of their form or feeding density. Concentrating C. calcitrans and S. costatum markedly reduced their efficacy as diets. The centrifuged concentrates were unsuitable as complete replacements for fresh algae in larval culture when stored for either 9 or 14 weeks. However, the concentrates may be more successful in combination with other concentrates, fresh algae and/or artificial diets, or when stored for a shorter time. 3ainterspecific variation 3aphytoplankton 3aconcentrates 3afeeds 3arearing 3aPenaeus monodon 3abioassays 3aduration 3alarvae 3adensity 3abiological development 3acentrifugation 3acold storage 0aspecies differences 0aevaluation 0agrowth rate1 aLecossois, D.1 aHeasman, M.P.1 aDiemar, J.A.1 aJackson, C.J.1 aPendrey, R.C.0 tAquaculture research.g2000 , v. 31, no. 8/9 p.661-670x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02532naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245012400132300001600256500016200272520139800434650001701832650002401849650001701873650001801890650001701908650001601925650001601941650002101957653001601978653001101994653002102005773007802026852000902104930003302113945001302146946001102159655001202170IND2202724220221120150513.0000224e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220272422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKristiansen, H.R.10aDiscrete and multiple meal approaches applied a radiographic study of feeding hierarcy formation in junvenile salmonids  ap. 519-527.  aIn the special issue: The feeding behavior of fish in culture / edited by M. Jobling. Paper presented at the COST827 Workshop held August 1998, Umea, Sweden.  aJuvenile brown trout (BT) Salmo trutta L. and rainbow trout (RT) Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) were reared in 6-m(3) circular tanks (current speed 1.0-1.5 BLs(-1)) at low stocking density (1 kg m(-3)) and fed restricted rations for 2 months at 9 degrees C. Heterogeneity in the acquisition of marked feed was observed on all X-ray occasions (n = 5) in both species as a result of exploitive competition at the low feed delivery rate (two to eight pellets min(-1)). Feeding and growth was heterogeneous, and weight dispersion increased with time. Social interactions were strongest in brown trout, in which a group of larger individuals suppressed the others. Social interactions were characterized as a non-linear dynamic hierarchy, because no fish had a well-defined rank position, when share of a meal (SM) was used as the ranking index. When the mean share of five meals (MSM) was used as the ranking index, high-ranked fish were found to be the largest, had the least intraindividual variation in consumption and had the highest growth rates. An index based on feed accumulated in the stomach over 2-3 days (SMM: share of multiple meals) may have application as a feeding index, because SMM is a cumulative index that may serve to dampen large day-to-day variations in SM. Thus, SMM could provide information about feeding history that cannot be obtained in studies that rely solely on SM. 3aSalmo trutta 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3afish feeding 3astocking rate 3afeed rations 3abody weight 3afeed intake 3afeeding behavior 0agrowth rate 0agrowth 0afood restriction0 tAquaculture research.g1999 July, v. 30, no. 7 p.519-527x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03010naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013500126300001400261520181900275650001202094650001902106650002702125650001402152650001802166650002102184650001902205650001402224650001902238650001802257650001402275650001502289650001302304650001602317650001302333650001902346650001402365650002502379700001802404773007602422852000902498930003302507945001302540946001102553655001202564IND2199462120221120150506.0990624e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219946212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, A.B.10aSydney rock oyster, Saccostrea commercialis (Iredale & Roughley), filtration of shrimp farm effluent: the effects on water quality  ap. 51-57.  aShrimp pond effluent water can contain higher concentrations of dissolved nutrients and suspended particulates than the influent water. Consequently, there are concerns about adverse environmental impacts on coastal waters caused by eutrophication and increased turbidity. One potential method of improving effluent water quality prior to discharge or recirculation is to use bivalves to filter the effluent. In this study, we examined the effects of the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea commercialis (Iredale & Roughley), on the water quality of shrimp pond effluent. Effluent from a shrimp farm stocked with Penaeus japonicus (Bate) was pumped directly into 34-L tanks stocked with different densities of oysters. Combinations of live and dead oysters were used to test the effects of three different densities of live oysters (24, 16 and 8 live oysters per tank). The concentrations of total suspended solids, the proportion of organic and inorganic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorous, chlorophyll a and the total number of bacteria in the pond effluent water were determined before and after filtration by oysters. The oysters significantly reduced the concentration of all the parameters examined, with the highest oyster density having the greatest effect. Shrimp pond effluent contained a higher proportion of inorganic matter (72%) than organic matter (28%). The organic component appeared to be mainly detritus, with chlorophyll a comprising only a minor proportion. Filtration by the high density of oysters reduced the effluent total suspended solids to 49% of the initial level, the bacterial numbers to 58%, total nitrogen to 80% and total phosphorous to 67%. The combined effects of settlement and oyster filtration reduced the concentration of chlorophyll a to 8% of the initial effluent value. 3aoysters 3ashrimp culture 3aMarsupenaeus japonicus 3aeffluents 3awater quality 3anutrient content 3aoyster culture 3aturbidity 3aeutrophication 3astocking rate 3amortality 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen 3achlorophyll 3abacteria 3aorganic matter 3aOstreidae 3awastewater treatment1 aPreston, N.P.0 tAquaculture research.g1999 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.51-57x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02182naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011400126300001400240500001500254520105900269650002501328650001801353650001001371650002501381650002601406650001201432650001801444650001601462650001101478650001501489650001401504653001501518653001401533653001101547653001101558700002401569700001301593773007601606852000901682930003301691945001301724946001101737655001201748IND2199453420221120150529.0990624e199901  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219945342DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNarciso, L.10aHUFA content and DHA/EPA improvements of Artemia sp. with commercial oils during different enrichment periods  ap. 21-24.  a2019-12-05  aSeveral commercial oils of plant and animal origin were tested in order to improve the HUFA content and the DHA:EPA ratio of Artemia sp. metanauplii. The relationship between the n-3 and n-6 fatty acid series, and more recently, the DHA:EPA ratio seem to be indicators for better survival and growth of marine fish larvae. The tested plant oils were derived from linseed, peanut and sunflower, and the animal oils came from squid, sardine, cod liver and Selco emulsion. For each oil emulsion tested, four different enrichment periods (9, 24, 33 and 48 h) were evaluated in the same Artemia sp. strain (Artemia EG from Artemia Systems Inc., Baasrode, Belgium). The results show that oil emulsions of plant origin give very poor results in relation to either HUFA content or DHA:EPA ratio. All the oil emulsions from animal origin resulted in HUFA incorporation. Sardine oil was the poorest and squid oil the best. The HUFA content and the DHA:EPA ratio increased with enrichment periods up to 33 h, followed by a negligible variation up to the final 48 h. 3achemical composition 3asunflower oil 3afeeds 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aArtemia 3acod liver oil 3alinseed oil 3alarvae 3apeanut oil 3amortality 0aenrichment 0afish oils 0agrowth 0aratios1 aPousao-Ferreira, P.1 aLuis, O.0 tAquaculture research.g1999 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.21-24x1355-557X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990802b19990812c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01409naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245006400164300001600228520061900244653001500863653003700878653002200915773011100937852000901048856008501057946001301142655001201155IND4442940120221120150424.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444294012DNAL7 a10.1007/s11149-010-9124-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCalcott, Paul 10aMandated self-regulation: the danger of cosmetic compliance  ap. 167-179.  aRegulators would often like firms to adopt systems of internal control, such as Environmental Management Systems. This paper examines a choice for such a regulator, whether to make such internal controls mandatory. If even unenthusiastic firms are required to institute their own systems, some of them may do so in a perfunctory or cosmetic fashion. With voluntary controls, firms that do not institute systems of internal controls can be obliged to follow specification standards instead. A disadvantage of mandatory controls is highlighted; more compromises have to be made in designing the regulatory framework. 0aRegulation 0aEnvironmental management systems 0aMisrepresentation0 tJournal of regulatory economics.g2010 Oct., v. 38, no. 2 p.167-179dBoston : Springer USx0922-680X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11149-010-9124-13Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03694naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002400164245017200188300001800360520180900378650002302187650001602210650002302226650003602249650003402285650003002319650001102349650001202360650002502372650002802397650002802425650004602453650004202499650003602541650004702577653002002624653002802644653001402672700002302686700001802709700002202727700002202749700002202771700001802793700002202811700002102833773014802854852000903002856008503011930003303096946001103129655001203140IND4440073920221120133815.0100716e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444007392DNAL7 a201827092pmid7 a10.1007/s00249-010-0582-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMonti, Daria Maria 10aEffects of a lipid environment on the fibrillogenic pathway of the N-terminal polypeptide of human apolipoprotein A-I, responsible for in vivo amyloid fibril formation  ap. 1289-1299.  aIn amyloidosis associated with apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), heart amyloid deposits are mainly constituted by the 93-residue ApoA-I N-terminal region. A recombinant form of the amyloidogenic polypeptide, named [1-93]ApoA-I, shares conformational properties and aggregation propensity with its natural counterpart. The polypeptide, predominantly in a random coil state at pH 8.0, following acidification to pH 4.0 adopts a helical/molten globule transient state, which leads to formation of aggregates. Here we provide evidence that fibrillogenesis occurs also in physiologic-like conditions. At pH 6.4, [1-93]ApoA-I was found to assume predominantly an α-helical state, which undergoes aggregation at 37°C over time at a lower rate than at pH 4.0. After 7 days at pH 6.4, protofibrils were observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Using a multidisciplinary approach, including circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence, electrophoretic, and AFM analyses, we investigated the effects of a lipid environment on the conformational state and aggregation propensity of [1-93]ApoA-I. Following addition of the lipid-mimicking detergent Triton X-100, the polypeptide was found to be in a helical state at both pH 8.0 and 6.4, with no conformational transition occurring upon acidification. These helical conformers are stable and do not generate aggregated species, as observed by AFM after 21 days. Similarly, analyses of the effects of cholesterol demonstrated that this natural ApoA-I ligand induces formation of α-helix at physiological concentrations at both pH 8.0 and 6.4. Zwitterionic, positively charged, and negatively charged liposomes were found to affect [1-93]ApoA-I conformation, inducing helical species. Our data support the idea that lipids play a key role in [1-93]ApoA-I aggregation in vivo. 3aprotein aggregates 3aamyloidosis 3aapolipoprotein A-I 2aAmyloidxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aApolipoprotein A-Ixchemistry 2aCholesterolxpharmacology 2aHumans 2aLigands 2aLipidsxpharmacology 2aLiposomesxpharmacology 2aOctoxynolxpharmacology 2aPeptide Fragmentsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aProtein Multimerizationxdrug effects 2aProtein Stabilityxdrug effects 2aProtein Structure, Secondaryxdrug effects 0aFibrillogenesis 0aConformational analysis 0aLiposomes1 aGuglielmi, Fulvio 1 aMonti, Maria 1 aCozzolino, Flora 1 aTorrassa, Silvia 1 aRelini, Annalisa 1 aPucci, Piero 1 aArciello, Angela 1 aPiccoli, Renata 0 tEuropean biophysics journal with biophysics letters.g2010 Aug., v. 39, no. 9 p.1289-1299dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0175-75717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00249-010-0582-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100716b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02694naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245013000164300001600294520131900310650001701629650001201646650001201658650001401670650002201684650001201706650001301718650001401731650001101745650001501756650000901771650001201780653001001792653002901802653002501831700001901856700001801875700002001893700001601913700001401929700001601943773011501959852000902074856008502083930003302168946001102201655001202212IND4444651020221120134054.0101105e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444465102DNAL7 a10.1007/s11103-010-9703-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Yuanlin 10aMolecular cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene based on a complete-deletion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 605-615.  aIn this article, we report an independent work of positional cloning and functional characterization of OsJAG gene in rice. The merit of our work is that we used a genuine null mutant, in which the wild-type allele was completely deleted. This allowed us to identify the mutant phenotypes accurately without the interference of residual function of the target gene. OsJAG is an important gene with pleiotropy, expressing almost throughout the plant and acting in both vegetative phase and reproductive phase. But its main and crucial roles are in regulating the development of all floral organs, especially in specifying the identity of stamens. Interestingly, OsJAG does not affect the number of floral organ primordial and so of floral organs in each whorl, suggesting that OsJAG does not influence the initiation of floral organ primordia, but affect the developmental fate of all floral organs after their primordia have initiated. Loss of OsJAG function results in maldevelopment of all floral organs, such as degenerated lemma and palea, elongated lodicules and deformed and sterile pistil. The stamen appears to be more sensitive to the mutation. All the six stamens in a mutant floret were thoroughly transformed into six pistil-like organs developed at the presumptive positions of the stamens in whorl 3. 3aOryza sativa 3aalleles 3aflorets 3aflowering 3amolecular cloning 3amutants 3amutation 3aphenotype 3apistil 3apleiotropy 3arice 3astamens 0aOsJAG 0aFloral organ development 0aStamen specification1 aDiao, Zhijuan 1 aLiu, Huaqing 1 aCai, Meishuang 1 aWang, Feng 1 aLan, Tao 1 aWu, Weiren 0 tPlant molecular biology.g2010 Dec., v. 74, no. 6 p.605-615dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-44127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11103-010-9703-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20101105b20101204c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01932naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245011400172300001600286520061700302650001500919650001600934650001700950650001200967650001200979650001300991650002001004650001101024650001201035650002101047650000901068650002101077650002301098653001201121653000901133700002101142700001901163700002101182773013801203852000901341856009201350930003301442946001101475655001201486IND4443455620221120133815.0101015e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444345562DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1471-0307.2010.00628.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorales, Pilar.10aVolatile compounds in cheeses made with Micrococcus sp.

A single laparoscopic colorectal surgeon who normally treats adult patients has been part of the multidisciplinary team since its inception. Aim To analyse outcomes for those patients requiring surgical resection during the first 2 years of service. Methods In this service evaluation study, all data for patients undergoing surgery from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2010 were prospectively collected on a dedicated electronic database. Results Nineteen patients underwent surgical resection (15 laparoscopic and four open) over the 2-year period. Median patient age was 15 years (range 11-16), and 14 patients were female. Of the 15 laparoscopic resections, eight were subtotal colectomy and ileostomy and seven ileocaecal resection/right hemicolectomy. There was one (6.7%) conversion due to a pericolic abscess. There were four planned open cases, including two subtotal colectomy and ileostomy and two small bowel resections. Median operating time was 150 and 172.5 min in the open and laparoscopic groups respectively. Median length of stay was 6 days (range 3-16) in the laparoscopic group, and 8 days (range 5-13) in the open group. There were three (15.8%) post-operative complications, one (5.3%) readmission within 30 days and no mortality. Conclusion This study suggests that an adult colorectal surgeon can provide a safe and effective service for adolescents with IBD, including the provision of laparoscopic resection in this challenging patient group. 3alaparoscopy 0aInflammatory bowel diseases 0aAdolescent1 aBrennan, Mary 1 aNoble-Jamieson, Gabriele 1 aHeuschkel, Rob 1 aDavies, R.

We determined the association between diabetes and risk of PC in 2,192 cases and 5,113 controls in three large case-control studies conducted at the National Cancer Institute, the University of California San Francisco, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In multivariable analyses, diabetes was associated with a 1.8-fold risk of PC [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.5-2.1]. Risk estimates decreased with increasing years with diabetes (≤2 years OR = 2.9, 95% CI = 2.1-3.9; 3-5 years OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.6; 6-10 years OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.3; 11-15 years OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9-2.0; > 15 years OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0-2.0 (p for trend < 0.0001). Among diabetics, risk was higher in insulin ever users compared with nonusers (OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.6-3.7) and was restricted to insulin use of ≤3 years (OR = 2.4). Insulin use of >10 years was associated with a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.9; p for trend < 0.0001). Hispanic men and Asians had a higher risk of diabetes-associated PC than did whites and blacks, but the differences were not statistically significant. No significant interaction between diabetes and cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption and body mass index was observed. Although reverse causation may explain the association between diabetes diagnosed in close temporal proximity to PC, our results show that long-term diabetes, even though risk diminishes over time, remains a risk factor for PC independent of obesity and smoking. 3adiabetes 3acase-control studies 0aPancreatic cancer 0aepidemiology1 aTang, Hongwei 1 aHassan, Manal M. 1 aHolly, Elizabeth A. 1 aBracci, Paige M. 1 aSilverman, Debra T. 0 tCancer causes & control.g2011 Feb., v. 22, no. 2 p.189-197dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0957-52437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-010-9686-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20110128b20110205c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02704naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245007300170300001500243520169500258650001101953653002701964653002001991653002502011653002402036653002502060653002302085700002202108773011002130852000902240856008502249930003302334946001102367655001202378IND4447080520221120130358.0101231e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444708052DNAL7 a10.1007/s10071-010-0346-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolland, Stephen M. 10aDo humans use episodic memory to solve a What-Where-When memory task  ap. 95-102.  aWhat-Where-When (WWW) memory tasks have been used to study episodic(-like) memory in non-human animals. In this study, we investigate whether humans use episodic memory to solve such a WWW memory task. Participants are assigned to one of two treatments, in which they hide different coin types (what) in different locations (where) on two separate occasions (when). In the Active treatment, which mimics the animal situation as closely as possible, participants are instructed to memorize the WWW information; in the Passive treatment, participants are unaware of the fact that memory will be tested. In both groups, the majority of participants report using a mental time travel strategy to solve the task, and performance on a different episodic memory test significantly predicts performance on the WWW memory task. This suggests that the WWW memory task is a good test of episodic memory in humans. Participants remember locations and coins from the first hiding session better than they do those of the second hiding session, suggesting their memories may be reinforced during the second hiding session. We also investigated how well episodic memory performance predicted performance on the three aspects of the WWW memory task separately. In the Passive treatment, episodic memory performance predicts performance on all three aspects of the WWW memory task equally. However, in the Active treatment it only predicts performance on the what component. This could imply that during active encoding a different memory system is used for where and when information than during passive encoding. Encoding of what information seems to rely on episodic memory processing in both conditions. 3ahumans 0aWhat-Where-When memory 0aEpisodic memory 0aEpisodic-like memory 0aActive memorization 0aPassive memorization 0aHuman participants1 aSmulders, Tom V. 0 tAnimal cognition.g2011 Jan., v. 14, no. 1 p.95-102dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1435-94487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-010-0346-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101231b20110101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02071naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001900184245007300203300001600276506007600292520090800368506003701276650001301313650001101326650001901337650001101356650001201367700001701379700002201396700001701418773012401435852000901559856008301568939003301651946001301684655001201697IND4459545120221207113802.0110701e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445954512DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12035572doi7 aPMC32842322pmcid7 a217196812pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdelson, Micah10aFollowing the Crowd: Brain Substrates of Long-Term Memory Conformity  ap. 108-111.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHuman memory is strikingly susceptible to social influences, yet we know little about the underlying mechanisms. We examined how socially induced memory errors are generated in the brain by studying the memory of individuals exposed to recollections of others. Participants exhibited a strong tendency to conform to erroneous recollections of the group, producing both long-lasting and temporary errors, even when their initial memory was strong and accurate. Functional brain imaging revealed that social influence modified the neuronal representation of memory. Specifically, a particular brain signature of enhanced amygdala activity and enhanced amygdala-hippocampus connectivity predicted long-lasting but not temporary memory alterations. Our findings reveal how social manipulation can alter memory and extend the known functions of the amygdala to encompass socially mediated memory distortions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamygdala 3ahumans 3aimage analysis 3amemory 3aneurons1 aSharot, Tali1 aDolan, Raymond J.1 aDudai, Yadin0 tScience.g2011 July 1, v. 333, no. 6038 p.108-111dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12035573Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle01296naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245005900124300001800183520042400201650002100625650001000646650002300656650003600679650002200715650004400737650002100781700001300802700001500815773007400830852000900904930003300913945001300946946001100959655001200970IND2323139320221120130323.0010919e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232313932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Z.M.12aA steroidal saponin from the seeds of Allium tuberosum  ap. 1219-1222.  aA steroidal saponin, named tuberoside, together with seven known compounds, were isolated from the seeds of Allium tuberosum Rottl. ex Spreng.

The holes have been associated with inadvertent seeding of clouds with ice particles generated by aircraft, produced through spontaneous freezing of cloud droplets in air cooled as it flows around aircraft propeller tips or over jet aircraft wings. Model simulations indicate that the growth of the ice particles can induce vertical motions with a duration of 1 hour or more, a process that expands the holes and canals in clouds. Global effects are minimal, but regionally near major airports, additional precipitation can be induced. 3aair 3aaircraft 3aairports 3adroplets 3afreezing 3aice 3asimulation models1 aThompson, Gregory1 aMorrison, Hugh1 aBansemer, Aaron1 aRasmussen, Roy M.1 aMinnis, Patrick1 aWang, Zhien1 aZhang, Damao0 tScience.g2011 July 1, v. 333, no. 6038 p.77-81dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12028513Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle01760naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245004200150300001800192520035400210650001300564650001000577650002300587650003600610650004400646650002200690650004100712650008200753650007900835650003600914650002700950650002200977650004100999650004601040651001301086653001601099700001401115700001601129700001701145773007401162852000901236930003301245945001301278946001101291655001201302IND2323128120221120130431.0010919e200108  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232312812DNAL7 a114543442pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanchanapoom, T.10aQuassinoids from Eurycoma harmandiana  ap. 1205-1208.  aThree quassinoids, iandonosides A and B and iandonone, were isolated from the root of Eurycoma harmandiana, along with five known quassinoids, casteloside B, 13 beta, 21-dihydroeurycomanone, chaparrinone, glaucarubolone and ailanquassin B as well as the coumarin, scopoletin.

We evaluated blood samples from 61 patients with CFS from a single clinical practice, 43 of whom had previously been identified as XMRV-positive. Our analysis included polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction procedures for detection of viral nucleic acids and assays for detection of infectious virus and virus-specific antibodies. We found no evidence of XMRV or other MLVs in these blood samples. In addition, we found that these gammaretroviruses were strongly (X-MLV) or partially (XMRV) susceptible to inactivation by sera from CFS patients and healthy controls, which suggested that establishment of a successful MLV infection in humans would be unlikely. Consistent with previous reports, we detected MLV sequences in commercial laboratory reagents. Our results indicate that previous evidence linking XMRV and MLVs to CFS is likely attributable to laboratory contamination. 3aMurine leukemia virus 3aantibodies 3ablood 3ablood sampling 3ahuman diseases 3aleukemia 3amice 3anucleic acids 3apatients 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atranscription (genetics) 3aviruses1 aCarrigan, Donald1 aSimmons, Graham1 aTeque, Fernando1 aZhou, Yanchen1 aHackett, John Jr.1 aQiu, Xiaoxing1 aLuk, Ka-Cheung1 aSchochetman, Gerald1 aKnox, Allyn1 aKogelnik, Andreas M.1 aLevy, Jay A.0 tScience.g2011 July 1, v. 333, no. 6038 p.94-97dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12049633Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20110701  aOther US 7aarticle02466naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001400152245010700166300001400273500002800287520130600315650001601621650001001637653002101647653001901668700001501687700001201702700001101714700001501725700001401740700001301754700001301767700001101780773018901791852000901980856009201989946001102081655001202092IND4415337020090207010226.0090123s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441533702DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00763.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChu, M.X.10aDNA polymorphism of 5' flanking region of prolactin gene and its association with litter size in sheep  ap. 63-68.  aPublisher supplied data  aA single nucleotide polymorphism of 5' flanking region of the prolactin gene was investigated in both high prolificacy breeds (Small Tail Han and Hu sheep) and low prolificacy breeds (Dorset and Suffolk sheep) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). The results indicated that two genotypes (AA and AB) were detected in Small Tail Han sheep (n = 239), only one genotype (AA) was detected in Hu (n = 40), Dorset (n = 50) and Suffolk sheep (n = 39). The mutant homozygous genotype (BB) was not detected in four sheep breeds. In Small Tail Han sheep (n = 239), the frequency of genotypes AA and AB was 0.91 and 0.09, the frequency of the A and B alleles was 0.95 and 0.05, respectively. The fitness tests showed that the Small Tail Han sheep population was in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Sequencing revealed a mutation (G[rightward arrow]T) at the position 63 bp of the 5' flanking region of prolactin gene in AB genotype compared with AA genotype in Small Tail Han sheep. The Small Tail Han ewes with AB genotype had 0.83 (p < 0.05) lambs more than those with AA genotype. These results preliminarily showed that the prolactin locus is either a major gene that influences the high prolificacy in Small Tail Han sheep or is in close linkage with such a gene. 3alitter size 3asheep 0aDNA polymorphism 0aprolactin gene1 aWang, X.C.1 aJin, M.1 aDi, R.1 aChen, H.Q.1 aZhu, G.Q.1 aFang, L.1 aMa, Y.H.1 aLi, K.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics Zeitschrift für Tierzüchtung und Züchtungsbiologie.g2009 Feb., v. 126, no. 1 p.63-68dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2008.00763.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01540naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001800143245006300161300001400224520051000238650001300748651001600761651000900777700002000786700001700806700001900823700002000842700002000862700003000882700001800912773012200930852000901052856008301061939003301144946001301177655001201190IND4459548920221120120522.0110701e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445954892DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12050682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJohnson, Neil10aPattern in Escalations in Insurgent and Terrorist Activity  ap. 81-84.  aIn military planning, it is important to be able to estimate not only the number of fatalities but how often attacks that result in fatalities will take place.

We investigated the influence of damage-induced plant phenolic oxidases in cotton and tomato on mortality caused by two different baculoviruses in their respective hosts, Heliothis virescens (L.) and Helicoverpa zea (Boddie). For both plant species, peroxidase (POD) and phenolic levels were predictive of larval mortality caused by baculoviruses. The higher the POD activity, the lower the mortality in both hosts. Different classes of phenolics (e.g., monohydroxyphenolics vs. catecholic phenolics) in combination with POD activity had different effects on the severity of viral disease depending upon mixture, which implies that viral efficacy is predictable only if total chemical content of the plants is specified. Inhibition of baculoviral disease by plant phenolase activity has potential implications for the compatibility of baculoviruses with induced resistance in IPM programs. 3aHeliothis virescens 3aHelicoverpa zea 3apest resistance 3ainduced resistance 3aperoxidases 3acatechol oxidase 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aBaculoviridae 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3aintegrated pest management 3atritrophic interactions1 aStout, M.J.1 aAlaniz, S.A.1 aHammock, B.D.1 aDuffey, S.S.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1998 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.253-271x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02172naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011700125300001600242520098500258650002401243650001801267650002001285650002301305650002101328650002301349650001901372650001901391650002301410650003601433650002801469653001701497700001401514700001801528700001601546700001801562700001701580773008501597852000901682930003301691945001301724946001301737655001201750IND2181274020221120120623.0981124e199802  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218127402DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoover, K.10aEffects of plant identity and chemical constituents on the efficacy of a baculovirus against Heliothis virescens  ap. 221-252.  aBaculoviruses are arthropod-specific, dsDNA viruses primarily used to control lepidopteran pests. A limitation of the use of baculoviruses for pest control is that their efficacy is modifiable by host-plant chemicals. The levels of phenolic substrates and two foliar oxidative enzymes, peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PTO), were significant predictors of disease caused by a baculovirus in Heliothis virescens fed on either cotton or lettuce; POD was the more influential of the two enzymes. The higher the plant phenolase activity, the lower the percent mortality and the slower the insects died from viral infection. Whether a particular class of phenolic substrates was correlated with enhanced or attenuated baculoviral disease depended upon context, i.e., admixture. Diminution of viral efficacy by plant oxidative activity may compromise the compatibility of baculoviruses with other components of an integrated pest management system such as host plant resistance. 3aHeliothis virescens 3aBaculoviridae 3apest resistance 3aphenolic compounds 3acatechol oxidase 3aGossypium hirsutum 3aLactuca sativa 3ainsect control 3abiological control 3achemical constituents of plants 3atritrophic interactions 0ainteractions1 aYee, J.L.1 aSchultz, C.M.1 aRocke, D.M.1 aHammock, B.D.1 aDuffey, S.S.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1998 Feb., v. 24, no. 2 p.221-252x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02062naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002600110245016000136300001600296520095600312650002001268650002601288650002001314650001601334650001601350650002301366650001901389650002301408650002201431650001401453650002101467650002801488700001901516773008501535852000901620930003301629945001301662946001301675655001201688IND2181275420221120120609.0981124e199802  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218127542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFuentes-Contreras, E.10aDimboa glucoside, a wheat chemical defense, affects host acceptance and suitability of Sitobion avenae to the cereal aphid parasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi  ap. 371-381.  aThe influence of hydroxamic acids (Hx), plant secondary metabolites associated with aphid resistance in wheat, on the host acceptance and suitability of the aphid Sitobion avenae to the cereal aphid parasitoid Aphidius rhopalosiphi was evaluated. Aphids showed a reduction in mean relative growth rate and in body size in the wheat cultivar with higher Hx level. Reduction in aphid size was related to a decreased success in avoiding parasitoid oviposition. A minor increase in A. rhopalosiphi developmental time was observed in aphids feeding on the higher Hx cultivar. Experiments with different concentrations of DIMBOA glucoside, the main Hx in wheat, in artificial diets showed an increase in parasitoid developmental time at the highest concentration, with no change in other performance variables.

This organism has a number of virulence traits including production of degrading enzymes, the ability to undergo phenotypic switching, and can rapidly undergo morphogenic switch from a blastospore (yeast) phase to that of a hyphal state. Interest in C. albicans morphogenic regulation has been the focus of a large number of studies, which have characterised transcriptional modulators of these morphologies. Recently, C. albicans has been shown to regulate its morphogenic shift through changes in cell density. It was observed that C. albicans inoculated at cell densities below 10⁶ cells ml⁻¹ under conditions which favour hyphal morphogenesis (pH 7.5, 37 °C), will germinate to form hyphae. However, if cells densities are greater than 10⁶ cells ml⁻¹, little germination will occur and cells will maintain yeast morphology. The basis for this cell-density-dependent control of morphogenesis is similar to that which is seen with bacterial cells regulating their activities via quorum sensing (QS). A number of molecules have been identified which affect the ability of C. albicans to undergo the yeast-to-hyphal shift, and three compounds have been demonstrated to be quorum-sensing molecules. The scope of this review is to bring to light what is now understood about QS in C. albicans and address the roles of these molecules in relation to virulence in the host and potential roles in cross-kingdom interactions. 3aquorum sensing 3afarnesol 3amorphogenesis 2aCandida albicansxgrowth & developmentxpathogenicityxphysiology. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Fungal 2aHumans 2aHyphaexgrowth & development 2aQuorum Sensing 2aVirulence 0atyrosol0 tMycoses diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis of fungal diseases.g2009 Jan., v. 52, no. 1 p.1-10dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0933-74077nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0507.2008.01626.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02035naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245011900127300001400246520101600260650001901276650002701295650001101322650001001333650001901343650002001362650002701382650002101409650002301430650003601453700001501489700001801504773008301522852000901605930003301614945001301647946001301660655001201673IND2180984620221120104054.0981110e199801  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218098462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPotter, M.J.10aSuppressive impact of glucosinolates in Brassica vegetative tissues on root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus  ap. 67-80.  aThe potential of tissue amendments from a variety of wild and cultivated Brassica spp. to kill the root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus neglectus) in soil was assessed in laboratory experiments. Soil amended with leaf tissues was highly nematicidal, killing 56.2-95.2% of exposed nematodes. Amendment with root tissues was less effective, causing 0-48.3% mortality. Little of the suppressive impact by leaf tissues could be related to either total contents or any individual glucosinolate as determined by HPLC analysis. While the levels of total glucosinolates within root amendments had a nonsignificant relationship to nematode mortality, levels of 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate within root amendments significantly correlated with nematode suppression (P < 0.001). Amendment of soils with equimolar levels of purified 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate resulted in comparable levels of nematode mortality, suggesting that 2-phenylethyl glucosinolate has a role in the suppressive impact of Brassica spp. root tissues. 3aBrassica napus 3aPratylenchus neglectus 3aleaves 3aroots 3aglucosinolates 3aisothiocyanates 3anematicidal properties 3anematode control 3abiological control 3achemical constituents of plants1 aDavies, K.1 aRathjen, A.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1998 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.67-80x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02894naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013400167300001600301520146900317650002701786650001801813650001101831650001401842650001101856650001401867650001901881650002201900650002101922650002601943650002001969650000901989650002301998650000902021650001102030653002702041653002502068700001202093700001902105700001602124700001502140773011202155852000902267856009202276930003302368946001102401655001202412IND4417592820221120104259.0090313e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441759282DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01947.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLe May, C.10aEffect of pea plant architecture on spatiotemporal epidemic development of ascochyta blight (Mycosphaerella pinodes) in the field  ap. 332-343.  aThe effect of pea canopy structure on epidemics of Mycosphaerella pinodes was investigated in four spring pea cultivars (Bridge, Obelisque, Solara and Athos) in two field experiments. These cultivars had similar levels of susceptibility to ascochyta blight and presented different architectural features (branching, standing ability and stem height). Stem height ranged from 77 to 95 cm in 1999 and from 72 to 92 cm in 2000, while leaf area index (LAI) ranged from 3·8 to 5·1 in 1999 and from 3·8 to 4·7 in 2000. Internode lengths varied from 4·6 to 6·0 in 1999 and from 3·8 to 4·7 in 2000. Mean distance between nodes in the canopy (MDN) ranged from 12·2 to 15·3 cm in 1999 and from 11·2 to 13·9 cm in 2000. Canopies with different architecture differed in disease progression on stipules and mainly on pods. The levels of disease on stipules and pods were strongly correlated. Moreover, if disease was considered as a function of stipule height up the stem, large differences in vertical disease distribution were observed between cultivars. Three architectural features acted on disease development: cumulative LAI above the node on which disease was assessed (LAIcum) and large MDN favouring disease development, and large internode length reducing disease severity. Modifying LAI distribution and plant organization could be one way to reduce the impact of ascochyta blight, by direct or indirect effects on environmental and dispersal conditions. 3aMycosphaerella pinodes 3aPisum sativum 3ablight 3abranching 3acanopy 3acultivars 3adisease course 3adisease outbreaks 3adisease severity 3afield experimentation 3aleaf area index 3apeas 3aplant architecture 3apods 3aspring 0aplant canopy structure 0aspring pea cultivars1 aNey, B.1 aLemarchand, E.1 aSchoeny, A.1 aTivoli, B.0 tPlant pathology.g2009 Apr., v. 58, no. 2 p.332-343dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0032-08627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2008.01947.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090314b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01623naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009200126300001600218520060800234650001800842650001800860650001000878650000900888650002100897650002300918650003600941650004400977650002201021651001001043700001901053700002101072700001701093773007301110852000901183930003301192945001301225946001101238655001201249IND2203817820221120104159.0000413e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220381782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajab, M.S.10a11 beta, 12 beta-Diacetoxyharrisonin, a tetranortriterpenoid from Harrisonia abyssinica  ap. 127-133.  aA new tetranortriterpenoid, 11beta,12beta-diacetoxyharrisonin, together with the known atalantolide, obacunone, harrisonin, 12beta-acetoxyharrisonin, pedonin, cneorin R and perforaquassin A have been isolated from the root bark of Harrisonia abyssinica.

The structures of these compounds were determined from their mass spectra along with a comparison of their GC-FTIR spectra with those of all the isomers of a lower homolog. This is the first time that this combination of techniques has been applied to the study of insect pyrazines. The relative amounts and proportions of these compounds were different for gamergates and workers, with the latter containing 2-10 times more total pyrazines and having a higher proportion of 2 and 3. The possible significance of this finding is discussed. 3aFormicidae 3amandibular glands 3achemical composition 3apyrazines 3agas chromatography 3ainfrared spectroscopy 0asecretions 0aworker ants 0agamergate1 aGarraffo, H.M.1 aBlum, M.S.1 aEverett, D.M.1 aHastings, H.1 aWare, A.B.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1998 Jan., v. 24, no. 1 p.125-134x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02230naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245006300182300001600245520076700261650000801028650001401036650001601050650001001066650004201076650003601118650002701154650001101181650003401192650002001226650004401246650002801290651001201318651001101330651001701341651001201358651001601370653001701386653002501403653001801428653001901446773013301465852000901598856008501607930003301692946001101725655001201736IND4418359720221120094602.0090327e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441835972DNAL7 a185531482pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0307-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaged, A.

Here we analyse a large, long‐term data set of sightings of deep‐water cetaceans from the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans. Seasonal and geographic changes in the diversity of these genera are well predicted by a convex function of sea‐surface temperature peaking at c. 21 °C. Thus, diversity is highest at intermediate latitudes – an emerging general pattern for the pelagic ocean. When applied to a range of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change global change scenarios, the predicted response is a decline of cetacean diversity across the tropics and increases at higher latitudes. This suggests that deep‐water oceanic communities that dominate > 60% of the planet’s surface may reorganize in response to ocean warming, with low‐latitude losses of diversity and resilience.  aPublisher supplied data 3adolphins 3awhales 3aclimate change 3abiodiversity 0amarine mammals1 aMcGill, Brian1 aWorm, Boris0 tEcology letters.g2008 Nov., v. 11, no. 11 p.1198-1207dBlackwell Publishing LtdwJournal:jnl3774062x1461-023X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01234.x3Available from publisher's site 7aarticle01294naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245009200165300001600257520035400273653001300627653001900640653002400659653002500683700001900708773013900727852000900866856008500875930003300960946001100993655001201004IND4419074320141219000000.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441907432DNAL7 a10.1007/s00712-008-0046-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, X.

Specimens had a karyotype of 2n = 32 chromosomes, of which two were microchromosomes. Among macrochromosomes, the elements of the first and fourth pair were bi-armed, the others were telocentric. At least six NOR sites were detected with NOR-FISH, but only four were Ag-NOR-banding-positive. The two microchromosomes were essentially euchromatic, while all macrochromosomes exhibited clear pericentromeric C bands that were found to be AT-rich (being quinacrine- and DAPI-positive) and resistant to digestion with AluI and HaeIII. N. mirandus has the largest number of chromosomes (2n = 32) and telocentric elements (26) of all the chiton species studied to date. The karyological results of our study agree with previous molecular data indicating N. mirandus as a sister taxon of Acanthochitona crinita. The karyotypes of the two species could be related as a result of Robertsonian rearrangements. According to the more parsimonious hypothesis, the former would be the primitive karyotype, although other evolutionary events cannot be ruled out. 3aPolyplacophora 3aevolution 3aheterochromatin 3akaryotyping 2aAnimals 2aChromosomesxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aKaryotyping 2aMale 2aMetaphase 2aPhylogeny 2aPolyplacophoraxgenetics 2aSpermatogoniaxcytology 3aAntarctic region 0aAntarctica. 0achromosome evolution 0aNOR-FISH 0aRobertsonian fissions1 aAprea, Gennaro 1 aBarucca, Marco 1 aBiscotti, Maria Assunta 1 aCanapa, Adriana 1 aCapriglione, Teresa 1 aOlmo, Ettore 0 tChromosome research.g2008 Sept., v. 16, no. 6 p.899-906dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0967-38497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10577-008-1247-13Available from publisher's Web site  a20080919b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03057naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245008600169300001400255520167800269592002801947650000801975650001201983650001601995650001202011650001302023650001102036650001202047650002402059650000902083650001402092650002502106650002202131651001802153651001402171653002802185653000802213653001602221653001502237653001802252700002702270700002302297700001802320773014502338856008302483852000902566655001202575IND60535952420221119110816.0190411e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053595242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2014.11.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWirta, Helena K.10aExtensive niche overlap among the dominant arthropod predators of the High Arctic  ap. 86-92.  aIn the High Arctic, the species richness of spiders is typically low, but abundances can be very high. Thus, how the few spider species occurring in the region choose their prey, and what prey taxa they focus on, may significantly affect the community structure of arctic arthropods. Here we estimate the ecological imprint of adult spiders of three large-bodied species coexisting in Northeast Greenland: the morphologically similar crab spiders Xysticus deichmanni and X. labradorensis (Thomisidae) and the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis (Lycosidae). To describe an important part of these spiders’ diet in detail, we amplified and sequenced DNA from prey remains in their guts, selectively focusing on two of the most abundant prey orders in the area (Diptera and Lepidoptera). By comparing the resultant sequences to a reference library including most taxa encountered in the region, we assigned the prey to species. Among the spider taxa occurring in the region, the wolf spider Pardosa glacialis is dominant in terms of both biomass and density. All three spider species proved to be wide generalists, with no detectable differences in prey choice among either the two crab spiders, or among these crab spiders and the wolf spider. This lack of dietary differentiation among species may be caused by the limited prey availability in the Arctic, forcing the predators to both generalism and opportunism. Given the substantial abundance of spiders and the lack of other predatory arthropods in the region, the opportunistic prey choice observed implies that these High-Arctic spider species have the potential for inflicting a strong influence on their prey community.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDiptera 3aLepidoptera 3aPardosa 3aXysticus 3aadults 3abiomass 3acommunity structure 3adiet 3alibraries 3apredatory arthropods 3aspecies diversity 3aArctic region 3aGreenland 0aMolecular diet analysis 0aCO1 0aDNA barcode 0aDiet width 0aNiche overlap1 aWeingartner, Elisabeth1 aHambäck, Peter A.1 aRoslin, Tomas0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2015 Feb., v. 16, no. 1 p.86-92dElsevier GmbHaGesellschaft für ÖkologiewJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2014.11.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01250naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003900139245008800178300001800266520026600284592002800550650002300578650001600601650003100617650002200648700001800670700002100688700001500709700002200724773010600746856007500852852000900927655001200936IND60578598020180316000000.0170813e20131004xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057859802DNAL7 a10.1021/ol402141d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFernández de la Pradilla, Roberto10aSulfoxide-Directed Enantioselective Synthesis of Functionalized Tetrahydropyridines  ap. 4936-4939.  aThe highly selective base-promoted cyclization of enantiopure sulfinyl dienamines provides stereodefined sulfinyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines (dr up to 99:1).

The work has attempted to develop generic parameters that can be applied to other urban areas. However, in the absence of a measure of congestion at the site in Palermo (Italy), the methodological approach proposed used the simultaneous noise measurements, in units of decibels (B), to help parameterise a generic congestion indicator in terms of the traffic flow. The potential transferability of the approach was demonstrated for a site in Marylebone Road, London (UK), given the similarity of the two study sites, canyon shape, traffic characteristics and road orientation. The results showed that, within the range of data available, noise levels could be used as a proxy for flow change on the shoulders of the peak hour and hence congestion and a generic relationship with factors statistically significant at 99 % confidence allows roadside concentrations due to traffic to be estimated with a regression coefficient of R (2) = 0.73 (R = 0.85). The research demonstrates that whilst there are indeed underlying relationships that can explain the roadside concentrations based on traffic and meteorological conditions, evidence is presented that confirms the complexity of the physical and chemical processes that govern roadside concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3atraffic 3aurban areas 3awind speed 2aAir Pollutantsxanalysis 2aCarbon Monoxidexanalysis 2aCities 2aEnvironmental Monitoringxmethods 2aNitrogen Dioxidexanalysis 2aOzonexanalysis 2aVehicle Emissionsxanalysis 2aWind 3aUnited Kingdom 0aItaly 0aLondon1 aBell, Margaret C.0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4750-4765dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1428-5  aDNAL 7aarticle01845naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245011800168300002000286520058200306592002800888650002200916650001600938650002300954650001400977650001800991650001301009650002201022650001501044700002101059700001801080700002401098700001701122700001501139700002401154700002201178700002401200773012101224856008101345852000901426655001201435IND60582685020221120105239.0171006e20171006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058268502DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b018822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLuzung, Michael R.12aA Mild, Functional Group Tolerant Addition of Organozinc Nucleophiles to N-Activated Quinolines and Isoquinolines  ap. 10715-10721.  aAn addition of organozinc nucleophiles to N-acyl activated quinolines and isoquinolines is described.

We applied an extended dendrochronological approach to disentangle the functioning of drivers from the atmosphere (temperature, precipitation), the lithosphere (sedimentation rate), the hydrosphere (groundwater table, river water level fluctuation), the biosphere (tree characteristics), and the anthroposphere (dike construction). Carbon sequestration in aboveground biomass of riparian Quercus robur L. and Fraxinus excelsior L. was modeled (1) over time using boosted regression tree analysis (BRT) on cross-datable trees characterized by equal annual growth ring patterns and (2) across space using a subsequent classification and regression tree analysis (CART) on cross-datable and not cross-datable trees. While C sequestration of cross-datable Q. robur responded to precipitation and temperature, cross-datable F. excelsior also responded to a low Danube river water level. However, CART revealed that C sequestration over time is governed by tree height and parameters that vary over space (magnitude of fluctuation in the groundwater table, vertical distance to mean river water level, and longitudinal distance to upstream end of the study area). Thus, a uniform response to climatic drivers of aboveground C sequestration in Q. robur was only detectable in trees of an intermediate height class and in taller trees (>21.8m) on sites where the groundwater table fluctuated little (≤0.9m). The detection of climatic drivers and the river water level in F. excelsior depended on sites at lower altitudes above the mean river water level (≤2.7m) and along a less dynamic downstream section of the study area. Our approach indicates unexploited opportunities of understanding the interplay of different environmental drivers in aboveground C sequestration. Results may support species-specific and locally adapted forest management plans to increase carbon dioxide sequestration from the atmosphere in trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFraxinus excelsior 3aQuercus robur 3aaboveground biomass 3aaltitude 3abiosphere 3acarbon 3acarbon sequestration 3adendrochronology 3aecosystems 3aforest management 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3ariparian forests 3ariver water 3atemperature 3atrees 3awater table 3aDanube River 0aBoosted regression tree 0aCarbon sequestration 0aClassification and regression tree 0aClimate 0aDanube River 0aDendrochronology1 aKowarik, Ingo1 aCherubini, Paolo1 aCierjacks, Arne0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Jan. 01, v. 574 p.1261-1275dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.1743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02167naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245010800169300001600277520109800293592002801391650002401419650002201443650001301465650001701478650001301495650001401508700002201522700002001544700001901564700001701583700002601600773009601626856008601722852000901808655001201817IND60095639020221119180314.0141104e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009563902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.07.0572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaity, Arnab10aInteraction of a “nido”-ruthenium terpyridylamine complex with charged elongated micellar scaffolds  ap. 641-647.  aInfluence on ionic surfactants by a specially designed terpyridylamine ligand and the ruthenium(II) complex formed with it has been studied in aqueous solution. The ligand coordinates to Ru²⁺ into an octahedral geometry in such a way that the final form takes a “nido” or nest-like structure. The substitution on the pyridinyl moiety is kept at the ortho position to acquire the specified geometry. Similar complexes have been reported to have anti-tumor properties and thus the ruthenium complexes can effectively replace platinum complexes that serve the same purpose but with certain drawbacks. The “nido” geometry was chosen to minimize the cytotoxicity that creeps in when para substituents of the pyridinyl moiety are used. The latter variety forms a dendridic scaffold. In presence of both the ligand and the complex, ionic surfactants form elongated aggregates. The surface charge of those aggregates decides the nature of interaction of the ligand and the complex formed therefore. Interaction with anionic surfactant scaffold is found to be stronger than the cationic one.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanionic surfactants 3aaqueous solutions 3acolloids 3acytotoxicity 3aplatinum 3aruthenium1 aGhosha, Prasūna,1 aDas, Tarasankar1 aMandal, Soumik1 aGupta, Parna1 aPurkayastha, Pradipta0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 88, no. 2 p.641-647dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.07.0573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02486naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245003100167300001800198520147700216592002801693650001001721650001301731650001401744650002001758650001201778650002101790650001201811650002101823650001801844650000901862650001501871700002101886773009201907856008101999990002302080852000902103655001202112IND60093827520221117223705.0141104e20110308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009382752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.cub.2010.12.0352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoore, Jamie C.10aSexual selection in plants  ap. R176-R182.  aDarwin's theory of evolution by natural selection provided an immediately convincing explanation for the close fit between form and function in nature that had previously only been explicable in terms of supernatural design. Traits evolved in a way that improved their bearer's chances of survival and its success at producing offspring. But what could be said of exaggerated ornamental traits such as the long and lurid tail feathers of many male birds and the ferocious looking mandibles and horned protuberances of various male insects, which were almost certain to compromise their bearer's survival? To explain these traits, Darwin proposed the theory of sexual selection, first in ‘Origin of Species’ and then, at greater length, in ‘The Descent of Man’. In a nutshell, he argued that certain traits (secondary sex characters) will be favoured not because they improve survivorship or fecundity (i.e., by natural selection), but because they improve an individual's mating success. This basic idea has been broadly accepted by zoologists, but it has been contentious when applied to plants, not least because they are often hermaphrodites. In this Primer, we explain the application of sexual-selection ideas to both dioecious and hermaphroditic plants. We point out that, far from being irrelevant to their study, sexual selection to increase male mating success can be interpreted as a major selective force in the evolution of floral diversity (Figure 1).  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3afeathers 3afecundity 3ahermaphroditism 3ainsects 3aornamental value 3aprogeny 3asexual selection 3asurvival rate 3atail 3azoologists1 aPannell, John R.0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Mar. 8, v. 21, no. 5 p.R176-R182dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2010.12.0353Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle01940naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245012900169300002000298520078300318592002801101650001301129650001601142650002301158650002101181650001101202650002301213650002201236650002201258650002401280650002101304700001901325700002301344773012101367856008101488852000901569655001201578IND60582685120221120105132.0171006e20171006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058268512DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b018992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKawashima, Hiroyuki10aAcid-Mediated Migration of Bromide in an Antiaromatic Porphyrinoid: Preparation of Two Regioisomeric Ni(II) Bromonorcorroles  ap. 10425-10432.  aThe regioselective halogenation of porphyrinoids is critical for their selective functionalization, which enables the fine tuning of their electronic and optical properties. Here we report the synthesis of two regioisomeric Ni(II) bromonorcorroles on the basis of the acid-induced migration of the bromo substituent. Treatment of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) selectively afforded Ni(II) 3-bromonorcorrole, which was further converted into Ni(II) 2-bromonorcorrole upon treatment with hydrogen bromide. In addition, the reaction of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole with an excess amount of NBS afforded the octabrominated product. The reaction mechanism of the bromination reaction of Ni(II) dimesitylnorcorrole was investigated by theoretical calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromides 3abromination 3achemical structure 3ahydrobromic acid 3anickel 3aoptical properties 3aorganic chemistry 3aorganic compounds 3areaction mechanisms 3aregioselectivity1 aHiroto, Satoru1 aShinokubo, Hiroshi0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Oct. 06, v. 82, no. 19 p.10425-10432dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b018993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02872naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010600169300001400275520142100289592002801710650001701738650001201755650001201767650001501779650002301794650001101817650001201828650001601840650001501856650000901871650001501880650002101895650002001916650001401936650001001950650001701960650001001977653001501987653001002002653001202012653002602024653002502050700001702075700002002092700001702112700001702129773010002146856008702246852000902333655001202342IND60559648920221119234156.0161216e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055964892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.1912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Haiying14aThe effect of periphyton on seed germination and seedling growth of rice (Oryza sativa) in paddy area  ap. 74-80.  aPeriphyton is widely distributed in paddy fields and its interactions with paddy soil and rice growth have been reported rarely. In this study, model paddy ecosystems with different additional soil substrates were simulated under controlled conditions to investigate the effects of periphyton on rice seed germination and seedling growth. Results show that the selected soil substrates had significant effects on the metabolic activities and growth of periphyton in paddy fields. The addition of straw to soil enhances but the addition of biochar leads to attenuation of periphyton growth. The presence of periphyton in the paddy system, especially with straw in soil greatly increased the germination index of rice seed (by maximally 21%). However, the biochar treatment in the presence of periphyton was detrimental for the seed vitality with a decrease of 30%. As a result, the periphyton cover on paddy soil surface significantly inhibited the growth of rice seedling, including rice height, leaf width and biomass. To summarize, this study indicates that the presence of periphyton during seed germination period was detrimental for rice growth, but could be used to control the weed growth. Thus, this study provided insight into understanding the periphyton-plant relationships with different soil-substrates and also new approaches to controlling weeds in paddy fields by regulating the growth of periphyton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aOryza sativa 3abiochar 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3apaddies 3apaddy soils 3aperiphyton 3arice 3arice soils 3aseed germination 3aseedling growth 3aseedlings 3astraw 3aweed control 3aweeds 0aPeriphyton 0aStraw 0aBiochar 0aRice seed germination 0aRice seedling growth1 aLiu, Junzhuo1 aKerr, Philip G.1 aShao, Hongbo1 aWu, Yonghong0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 578 p.74-80dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.1913Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03094naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001400146245009500160300001600255520177600271592002802047650002502075650001102100650001302111650002202124650002102146650001802167650001902185650002302204650002002227650002302247650002702270650002002297650000902317650001002326650001402336700001402350700001402364700001502378700001402393700001102407773012802418856008102546852000902627655001202636IND60764788020221120200916.0220409e20190320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076478802DNAL7 a10.17221/146/2018-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aInanc, ME10aCholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin plus trehalose improves quality of frozen-thawed ram sperm  ap. 118-124.  aThe objective of this study was to determine effects of supplementing Tris-based semen extenders with either cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin (CLC) or 7-dehydrocholesterol loaded cyclodextrin (7-DCLC) plus trehalose (T) for cryopreservation of ram semen. Semen was collected with an artificial vagina from five Merino rams (2–3 years of age) during the non-breeding season. Ejaculates were pooled, divided into eight equal portions, diluted with a standard Tris-based extender containing: no additive (control); T (50 mM); or T (50 mM) + 1.5, 2.5 or 3.5 mg of either 7-DCLC or CLC. Semen was chilled from 37°C to 4°C, placed in 0.25 ml French straws, held 5 cm above liquid nitrogen for 12 minutes, then plunged into liquid nitrogen. After thawing, a computer-aided semen analyzer system (CASA) was used to assess motility, whereas plasma membrane and acrosome integrity (PMAI) and high mitochondrial membrane potential (HMMP) were assessed with flow cytometry. Sperm supplemented with 2.5 mg and 3.5 mg CLC + T had the highest (P &lt; 0.05) total and progressive motility (65.2 ± 4.7 and 19.0 ± 1.0% respectively, mean ± SEM), albeit with no significant differences from sperm with 1.5 or 3.5 mg CLC + T. Sperm with 2.5 mg CLC + T had the highest (P &lt; 0.05) PMAI (59.3%; not different from 3.5 mg CLC + T) and highest (P &lt; 0.05) HMMP (64.6%; not different from 1.5 or 3.5 mg CLC + T). The lowest ALH value, 2.8 ± 0.3 µm was in the 2.5 mg 7-DCLC + T group; otherwise, there were no significant differences among groups for any other CASA end point. In conclusion, adding CLC + T to a tris-based extender optimized quality of frozen-thawed ram semen. Therefore, extenders including CLC + T have potential to improve quality of frozen-thawed ram sperm.  aPublisher supplied data 3a7-dehydrocholesterol 3aMerino 3aacrosome 3aartificial vagina 3acryopreservation 3acyclodextrins 3aflow cytometry 3afreeze-thaw cycles 3aliquid nitrogen 3amembrane potential 3amitochondrial membrane 3aplasma membrane 3arams 3asemen 3atrehalose1 aGungor, S1 aOzturk, C1 aKorkmaz, F1 aBastan, I1 aCil, B0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 64, no. 03 p.118-124dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/146/2018-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245011400162300001400276520140000290592002801690650001901718650001901737650002401756650002201780650002301802650001101825650002301836650001501859650000901874650001101883651001101894700001601905700001601921700001401937773012101951856008202072852000902154655001202163IND60595964020221120173800.0180619e201801  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059596402DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-018-6314-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Jifeng10aSpatiotemporal variations of the surface Kuroshio east of Taiwan Island derived from satellite altimetry data  ap. 77-91.  aSpatiotemporal variation of the surface Kuroshio east of Taiwan Island is investigated by quantitatively analyzing 23-year (1993–2015) sea surface Absolute Dynamic Topography data. The annual mean state of the Kuroshio is shown, with a flow width ~136 km and surface transport ~7.75×10⁴m²/s. The corresponding standard deviations of these are 28 km and 2.14×10⁴m²/s. Results of power spectrum analysis indicate that the primary periods of Kuroshio surface transport east of Taiwan Island are 1 and 2.8 years, respectively. Spatially, the Kuroshio surface transport southeast of Taiwan Island has greater variability than that to its northeast. That transport showed strong seasonality, with a maximum 8.8×10⁴m²/s in summer and minimum 7.5×10 ⁴ m ² /s in winter, which was mainly caused by local monsoon winds. A linear long-term upward trend of Kuroshio surface transport during 1993–2015 was found, during which the mean, southeast, and northeast of the Kuroshio east of Taiwan Island increased by 0.30×10 ⁴, 0.22×10 ⁴ and 0.36×10 ⁴ m ² /s, respectively. Correlation and composite analysis show that the Philippines-Taiwan Oscillation (PTO) is important in the interannual variability of the Kuroshio. PTO-induced relative intensity of anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies is the dominant influence on the interannual variability of the Kuroshio east of Taiwan Island.  aPublisher supplied data 3amonsoon season 3aremote sensing 3asatellite altimetry 3aspatial variation 3astandard deviation 3asummer 3atemporal variation 3atopography 3awind 3awinter 3aTaiwan1 aYin, Baoshu1 aXu, Zhenhua1 aLi, Delei0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2018 Jan., v. 36, no. 1 p.77-91dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-018-6314-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01899naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100001900143245014200162300001800304520079300322592002801115650001601143650001701159650001101176653002301187653000601210653001901216653000601235653000601241653001901247653001001266700002101276700001501297773013901312856007701451852000901528655001201537IND60521629320221121024406.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052162932DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-08162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWinter, Werner10aStructure Determination of 3,5-Biscyclohexylidene-1,2,4-trithiolane / Structure Determination of 3,5-Biscyclohexylidene-1,2,4-trithiolane  ap. 1015-1018.  aFragmentation of 1,2,3-thiadiazoles (1) leads to the compounds 5 - 8 with an increasing proportion of sulphur.

The trithiolane ring has a puckered conformation and the whole molecule shows nearly perfect C₂-symmetry, which is not required crystallographically.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aspectroscopy 3asulfur 0aFragmentation of 1 0a2 0a3-Thiadiazoles 0a1 0a2 0a4-Trithiolanes 0aX-ray1 aBühl, Hanspeter1 aMeier, H.,0 tZeitschrift für Naturforschung B.g2014 June 2, v. 35, no. 8 p.1015-1018dVerlag der Zeitschrift für Naturforschungx1865-71177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1515/znb-1980-08163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03958naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245015500171300001400326520231800340592002802658650002302686650001202709650001802721650001302739650001702752650002802769650001702797650002402814650001302838650001702851650002002868650001102888650002502899650002202924650002202946650001002968651001002978653003302988653002503021653002603046653002603072653004003098700001403138700001403152700001903166700001803185700001703203773010003220856008703320852000903407655001203416IND60559649020221119153528.0161216e20170201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055964902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.2182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Houjuan10aInvestigating distribution pattern of species in a warm-temperate conifer-broadleaved-mixed forest in China for sustainably utilizing forest and soils  ap. 81-89.  aThe maintaining mechanisms and potential ecological processes of species diversity in warm temperate- conifer-broadleaved-mixed forest are far from clear understanding. In this paper, the relative neighborhood density Ω was used to analyze the spatial distribution patterns of 34 species with ≥11 individuals in a warm- temperate-conifer-broadleaved-mixed forest, northern China. Then we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and Torus-translation test (TTT) to explain the distribution of observed species. Our results show that aggregated distribution is the dominant pattern in warm-temperate natural forest and four species regular distribution at the spatial scale >30m. The aggregated percentage and intensity decline with spatial scale, abundance and size classes increasing. Rare species are aggregated more than intermediate and abundant species. These results prove sufficiently the effects existence of scale separation, self-thinning and Janzen-Connell hypothesis. In addition, functional traits (dispersal modes and shade tolerance) also have a significant influence on distribution of species. The results of CCA confirm that slope and convexity are the most important factors affecting the distribution of tree species distribution, elevation and slope of shrub species though the combination of topographic variables only explained 1% of distribution of tree species and 2% of shrub species. Most species don't have habitat preference; however 47.1% (16/34) species including absolutely dominant tree (Pinus tabulaeformis and Quercus wutaishanica) and shrub species (Rosa xanthina) and most other species with important value in the front, are strongly positively or negatively associated with at least one habitat. The valley and ridge are most distinct habitat with association of 12 species in the plot. However, high elevation slope with 257 quadrats is the most extensive habitat with only four species. Therefore, there is obvious evidence that habitat heterogeneity play an important role on shaping spatial distribution of species in warm temperate forest. Our research results provide significant evidence that dispersal limitation and habitat heterogeneity have a contribution jointly to regulating the spatial distribution pattern of species in warm-temperate-forest in China.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus tabuliformis 3aQuercus 3aRosa xanthina 3aaltitude 3abiogeography 3acorrespondence analysis 3aforest soils 3ahabitat preferences 3ahabitats 3arare species 3ashade tolerance 3ashrubs 3aspatial distribution 3aspecies diversity 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3aChina 0aSpatial distribution pattern 0aDispersal limitation 0aHabitat heterogeneity 0aWarm-temperate-forest 0aSustainable use of forest and soils1 aXu, Yudan1 aHao, Jing1 aZhao, Bingqing1 aGuo, Donggang1 aShao, Hongbo0 tScience of the total environment.g2017 Feb. 01, v. 578 p.81-89dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.2183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01968naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002200143245008200165300001400247520112700261592002801388650001701416650001101433650001201444650000901456651001101465773012701476856007801603852000901681655001201690IND60764788120221120191713.0220422e20200228xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076478812DNAL7 a10.17221/146/2019-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKormanek, Mariusz10aAnalysis of wood chipping capacity of the Bandit 990XP chipper – case study  ap. 63-69.  aAccording to the data of the Central Statistical Office, there has been an increase in forest cover in Poland from 27.8% to 29.6% over the last 25 years. This increase contributed to an increase in the possibility of wood obtaining and processing for energy purposes. The aim of the study was to analyse the efficiency of a chipping machine manufactured by the American Company Bandit Industries (Bandit 990XP chipper) based on the working day chronometer. The study was carried out in specific conditions related to the place of the chipper application because the machine was used to process the material obtained from standing trees in the framework of park maintenance. As it was shown during the analysed working day, the effective capacity W1 in the work cycle of the Bandit 990XP machine was 9.2 m<sup>3</sup>∙h<sup>–1</sup> chips. Specific working conditions made it impossible to organize the work smoothly. Ongoing obtaining of the material for chipping from standing trees resulted in low productivity during the exploitation time of the shift W08 on the level of 1.3 m<sup>3</sup>∙h<sup>–1</sup> chips.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3aenergy 3aforests 3awood 3aPoland0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 66, no. 2 p.63-69dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/146/2019-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02965naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245011100163300001600274520153800290592002801828650002601856650002701882650001901909650001101928650001501939650000901954650001001963650001501973650001101988650001401999650001702013650002202030650001702052650001702069650001502086650000902101650001802110650001602128650002002144650001702164650001502181700002002196700002302216700001602239773011102255856008402366852000902450655001202459IND60549199820221121222628.0160907e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054919982DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-13-0357-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJaraba, J.10aSoil Texture Influence on Meloidogyne incognita and Thielaviopsis basicola and Their Interaction on Cotton  ap. 336-343.  aMicroplots were used to evaluate the impact of soil texture on Meloidogyne incognita, Thielaviopsis basicola, and their interaction on cotton. A native silt loam soil (48% sand) and four different artificial soil textures produced by mixing native soil with sand (53, 70, 74, and 87% sand) were studied. Each soil texture was infested with 0, 4, or 8 M. incognita eggs and 0 or 20 T. basicola chlamydospore chains per gram of soil in a factorial treatment arrangement. Plots were watered when soil moisture fell below –10 joules/kg for the first 21 days and –30 joules/kg from 22 days to harvest. Plant growth was suppressed early in the season and midseason by T. basicola. M. incognita suppressed plant growth and delayed plant development late in the season across all soil textures. Cotton yield was lower in the presence of either T. basicola or M. incognita. An interaction between M. incognita and T. basicola, which decreased plant growth and yield, occurred in 2006 when neither pathogen caused substantial plant damage. Plant growth, development, and yield were lowest in soils with >74% sand. Root colonization by T. basicola and fungal reproduction and survival decreased in soil having 87% sand. M. incognita generally caused more galling and reproduction in soils as sand content increased. Root galling severity and M. incognita reproduction were suppressed by the presence of T. basicola in soil at sand contents lower than 87%. Soil texture had a greater impact on T. basicola than on M. incognita in this study.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMeloidogyne incognita 3aThielaviopsis basicola 3achlamydospores 3acotton 3acrop yield 3aeggs 3afungi 3aharvesting 3amixing 3apathogens 3aplant damage 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3areproduction 3aroot galls 3asand 3asand fraction 3asandy soils 3asilt loam soils 3asoil texture 3asoil water1 aRothrock, C.

However, carbon assessments over large forest areas are challenging. Difficulties are compounded by the lack of adequate field observations especially in mountainous regions. In this study, we describe the development of a two-phase sampling framework to evaluate regional aboveground carbon density (ACD) of subalpine temperate forests in northwestern China that includes integrating ground plots, airborne lidar metrics, and Landsat images. During the first phase, an accurate, lidar-derived, ACD inventory network of a representative forested zone (Dayekou Basin) was established on the basis of a modified allometric model by adding crown coverage (CC) as a supplementary variable; cross-validated R ² was 0.88 and root mean square error (RMSE) was 14.7 Mg C ha ⁻¹. The outcomes of this step enabled the extension of quasi-field plots required for the representative carbon evaluations and the amplification of the range of observed values. Further integration of lidar measures and optical Landsat data by using the partial least squares regression (PLSR) method was conducted in the subsequent phase. The final model developed for broad-scale estimates explained 76% of the variance in forest ACD and produced a mean bias error of 27.9 Mg C ha ⁻¹. Aboveground carbon stocks for the whole ecoregion averaged 77.2 Mg ha ⁻¹, which generated an uncertainty of 13%. Visual patterns revealed a systematic overestimation for low ACD values and an underestimation in those regions with high carbon density. Potential errors in our carbon estimates could be associated with the saturation of optical signals, accuracy of land-cover map, and effects of topographic conditions. Overall, the double-sampling method demonstrated promising means for carbon accounting over large areas in a spatially-explicit manner and provided a good first approximation of carbon quantities for the forests in the ecoregion. Our study illustrated the potential for the use of lidar sampling in facilitating scaling of field surveys to a larger spatial extent than ground-based practices by supplying accurate biophysical measurements (e.g. heights).  aPublisher supplied data 3aLandsat 3aaccounting 3aallometry 3abasins 3acarbon 3acarbon sinks 3aecoregions 3aecosystem services 3ainventories 3aland cover 3aleast squares 3alidar 3amarkets 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asurveys 3atemperate forests 3auncertainty 3avariance 3aChina1 aHe, Zhibin1 aChen, Longfei1 aYang, Junjun1 aZhu, Xi1 aZhao, Weijun0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Dec. 2, v. 36, no. 23 p.5767-5789dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.11016513Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01763naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100003300143245007800176300001800254520068000272592002800952650001500980650001200995650001001007650004401017650001401061650001601075653004801091653001601139653001701155653001501172773015201187856007701339852000901416655001201425IND60521629420221121024401.0160530e20140602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052162942DNAL7 a10.1515/znb-1980-08172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOkafor, Emmanuel Chukwuemeka10aStructures of 1-Phenyl-3-methyl-pyrazolone-5 and its Benzoyl Derivatives+  ap. 1019-1023.  aThe structures of 1-phenyl-3-methyl-pyrazolone-5 and its benzoyl derivatives have been investigated by means of IR, UV, NMR, and mass spectral spectroscopy. 1-Phenyl - 3-methyl-pyrazolone-5 is found to exist as a zwitter ion in the solid state, in the 5-keto form in chloroform and dioxane, and in the 5-hydroxy form in pyridine.

In New Zealand, two biovars of Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae have recently been found to cause bacterial canker on both A. chinensis and A. deliciosa, which produce the yellow and green fleshed kiwifruit, respectively (4). In November 2011, in a commercial orchard in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, A. arguta ‘Tahi’ and ‘Rua’ showed small angular necrotic leaf spots. About 50% of the vines randomly located throughout the orchard showed symptoms. Canker or shoot dieback were not detected on any of the infected plants. Four strains, labeled 13093 to 13096, were isolated onto King's B medium (KB) from leaves selected from four different plants showing symptoms. These four strains were gram-negative, induced a hypersensitive reaction when infiltrated in tobacco plants, lacked cytochrome c oxidase, arginine dehydrolase, and urease activity, and were unable to hydrolyze esculin, starch, and gelatine, and to induce ice nucleation. When plated on KB, these strains showed the same weak fluorescence associated with some strains of P. syringae pv. actinidiae (4). All these characteristics support identification of the strains as P. syringae pv. actinidiae. Using P. syringae pv. actinidiae-specific primers PsaF1/R2 (2), the expected 280-bp fragment was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA extracted from the four strains. The four amplicons were sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. KF206138 to 41) and found to be 100% identical to each other and to the corresponding DNA fragment of the pathotype strain, ICMP 9617 (AY342165). A similar conclusion was reached using the duplex PCR targeting the ompP1 and the avrD genes (1); two amplicons of 492 and 226 bp were obtained with each of the four strains as expected for P. syringae pv. actinidiae. The DNA sequence of the 492-bp amplicon (KF206134 to 37) was 100% identical to that of strains of P. syringae pv. actinidiae, such as Psa 10627 (JQ934475.1). Strain 13094 isolated from A. arguta and pathotype strain ICMP 9617 were sprayed at a concentration of 3 × 10⁹ cfu/ml on to the undersides of leaves of three 6- to 8-week-old seedlings of A. chinensis‘Hort16A’ and three similar seedlings of A. deliciosa ‘Bruno.’ Those are the conditions under which the pathogenicity of strains of P. syringae pv. actinidiae is usually evaluated (4). After 2 weeks of incubation, small necrotic angular spots were observed on all plants inoculated with 13094 or ICMP 9617 but not on the water-treated control plants. The bacteria isolated from those necrotic spots had the same morphological characteristics on KB as P. syringae pv. actinidiae and gave a 280-bp amplicon after PCR with the PsaF1/R2 primers. Leaves of two rooted cuttings of A. arguta‘Tahi’ were spray inoculated with strain 13094 at a concentration of 2.7 × 10⁹ cfu/ml or with water. Necrotic spots developed on leaves 1 week after inoculation. No spots developed on the water-treated plants. The bacteria isolated from those necrotic spots had the same morphological characteristics on KB as P. syringae pv. actinidiae and gave a 280-bp amplicon after PCR with the PsaF1/R2 primers. Isolation of P. syringae pv. actinidiae from A. arguta has been reported only once before (3). This is this is the first report of P. syringae pv. actinidiae being isolated from A. arguta vines in New Zealand. This limited outbreak did not lead to any loss of production and since then only very few symptoms have been observed in this particular orchard.References: (1) A. Gallelli et al. J.

The content of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), true protein (TP), ether extract (EE), water soluble carbohydrates (WSC), ash-free neutral detergent fiber (NDFom), ash-free acid detergent fiber (ADFom), lignin(sa), ash, Ca, P, Na, K, oxalic acid and nitrate were determined. Soluble CP (SP) and protein fractions non-protein N (A), true protein rapidly degraded in the rumen (B₁), true protein degraded in the rumen at a moderate rate (B₂), true protein associated with the cell wall and slowly degraded in the rumen (B₃) and acid detergent insoluble CP (C) were measured according to the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. In vitro gas production (IVGP), OM disappearance (OMD) and NDFom disappearance (NDFD) were determined using a gas production technique. Results showed that the later harvest date increased (P<0.05) DM, EE, WSC, NDFom, ADFom, lignin(sa), B₃ and C; while CP, TP, ash, Ca, P, K, SP, A, B₁, B₂, nitrate, total and soluble oxalic acid, IVGP, b (i.e., gas production from the insoluble fermentable fractions at 120h), c (i.e., rate of gas production during incubation), OMD and NDFD decreased (P<0.05). With increasing N fertilization rate, CP, TP, EE, P, nitrate, oxalic acid, SP, A, b, OMD and NDFD increased (P<0.05), however B₂ declined (P<0.05). Increasing N fertilization increased yield, CP concentration and nutrient digestibility. At 40d after planting use of amaranth forage as a ruminant feed is limited due to its high nitrate content. However, at 60d, although a depression in digestibility and CP content occurred, this forage has the potential as a ruminant feed due to the much lower nitrate levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmaranthus hypochondriacus 3aacid detergent fiber 3acell walls 3acrude protein 3adigestibility 3adry matter content 3afertilizer rates 3agas production (biological) 3aharvest date 3alignin 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient content 3anutritive value 3aoxalic acid 3aplanting 3arumen 3atrue protein1 aRouzbehan, Y.1 aRezaei, J.0 tAnimal feed science and technology.g2012 Jan. 20, v. 171, no. 1 p.6-13dElsevier B.V.x0377-84017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anifeedsci.2011.09.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02078naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245009900155300001400254520102500268592002801293650001901321650001101340650000901351650001101360650001401371650001801385650001501403650002101418650001101439650002101450651001901471700001701490773012601507856007401633852000901707655001201716IND60764788420221120191809.0220904e20100307xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076478842DNAL7 a10.17221/1466-pps2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStará, J.,10aFlight pattern of <i>Archips podana</i> (Lep.: Tortricidae) based on data from pheromone traps  ap. 75-81.  aIn 9 years of the period 1993–1999 and 2001–2003 the flight activity of <I>Archips podana</I> was investigated by pheromone traps placed in four apple orchards in Central and East Bohemia.

We here report detailed electrochemical investigations on the recently reported trivalent lanthanide coordination complexes [((ᴬᵈ,ᴹᵉArO)₃mes)Ln] (1–Ln), with Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Er, and Yb, which were now found to perform as active electrocatalysts for the reduction of water to dihydrogen. Reactivity studies involving complexes 1–Ln and the Ln(II) analogues [K(2.2.2-crypt)][((ᴬᵈ,ᴹᵉArO)₃mes)Ln] (2–Ln) suggest a reaction mechanism that differs significantly from the reaction pathway found for the corresponding uranium catalyst [((ᴬᵈ,ᴹᵉArO)₃mes)U] (1–U). While complexes 1−Ln activate water via a radical pathway, only upon a 1 e⁻ reduction to yield the reduced species 2−Ln, the 5f analogue 1−U directly reduces H₂O via a 2 e⁻ pathway. The electrocatalytic H₂O reduction by complexes 1–Ln is initiated by the respective Ln(III)/Ln(II) redox couples, which gradually turn to more positive values across the Ln series. This correlation has been exploited to tune the catalytic overpotential of water reduction by choice of the lanthanide ion. Kinetic studies of the 1–Ln series were performed to elucidate correlations between overpotential and turnover frequencies of the 4f-based electrocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acoordination compounds 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy conversion 3areaction mechanisms 3auranium1 aPalumbo, Chad T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6436-46021 aZiller, Joseph W.1 aGembicky, Milan1 aRheingold, Arnold L.1 aEvans, William J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0651-418X1 aMeyer, Karsten1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7844-29980 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2018 Feb. 21, v. 140, no. 7 p.2587-2594dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.7b115323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03203naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010100171300001600272520169200288592002801980650002502008650002002033650001602053650001902069650002902088650002802117650002202145650003002167650002002197650002202217650002102239650001002260650001202270650003102282650001602313650001502329650001502344650001802359650001702377650001102394650001702405651002302422700001902445773012902464856008202593961001302675852000902688655001202697IND60549200120221117035031.0160907e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054920012DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-13-0420-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchillinger, W. F.10aNatural Suppression of Rhizoctonia Bare Patch in a Long-Term No-Till Cropping Systems Experiment  ap. 389-394.  aThe soilborne fungus Rhizoctonia solani AG-8 is a major concern for farmers who practice no-till in the inland Pacific Northwest of the United States. Bare patches caused by Rhizoctonia spp. first appeared in 1999 during year 3 of a 15-year no-till cropping systems experiment near Ritzville, WA (269 mm of annual precipitation). The extent and pattern of patches were mapped each year from 1999 to 2012 at the 8-ha study site with a backpack-mounted global positioning system equipped with mapping software. Bare patches appeared in winter and spring wheat (SW; Triticum aestivum), spring barley (SB; Hordeum vulgare), yellow mustard (Brassica hirta), and safflower (Carthamus tinctorius). At its peak in years 5 to 7, bare patches occupied as much as 18% of total plot area in continuous annual monoculture SW. The area of bare patches began to decline in year 8 and reached near zero levels by year 11. No measurable patches were present in years 12 to 15. Patch area was significantly greater in continuous SW compared with SW grown in a 2-year rotation with SB. Additionally, the 15-year average grain yield for SW in rotation with SB was significantly greater than for continuous SW. Russian thistle (Salsola tragus), a troublesome broadleaf weed with a fast-growing tap root, was the only plant that grew within patches. This article reports the first direct evidence of natural suppression of Rhizoctonia bare patch with long-term no-till in North America.

We conducted this study because the effect of Cimicifugae Rhizoma extract (CRE) on allergic asthma has not yet been evaluated. To induce allergic airway inflammation, we intraperitoneally injected ovalbumin (OVA) mixed with aluminum hydroxide into mice twice at intervals of 2 weeks (Days 0 and 14) and then inhaled them thrice with 1% OVA solution using a nebulizer (Days 21 to 23). CRE (30 and 100 mg/kg) was administered orally daily for 6 days (Days 18 to 23). The mice showed remarkable reduction in allergic inflammation at 100 mg/kg of CRE, as evidenced by decreased inflammatory cell counts, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, OVA-specific immunoglobulin E level, airway hyperresponsiveness, and production of mucus. Additionally, these effects were involved with the enhancement of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and reduction of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Our findings indicated that CRE effectively protected against OVA-induced inflammation and oxidative stress via upregulation of the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 signaling and downregulation of NF-κB phosphorylation in asthma caused by OVA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum hydroxide 3aasthma 3acytokines 3afever 3agelatinase B 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3aimmunoglobulin E 3ainflammation 3amedicinal plants 3amucus 3aovalbumin 3aoxidative stress 3apain 3aphosphorylation 3aquinones 3arhizomes 3aEast Asia1 aSong, Kwang Hoon1 aLee, Ik Soo1 aLee, Se Jin,1 aKim, Woong-Il 1 aPak, So-Won 1 aShin, In-Sik 1 aKim, Taesoo 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Oct. 15, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101016263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03635naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002900153245012700182300001800309500001500327520192600342592002802268650001802296650001702314650002302331650001902354650001402373650001802387650002702405650001102432650002402443650001902467650001102486650001702497650001402514650001302528650002602541650002202567650001102589653001802600653000802618653002502626653001002651653000602661653000702667653000702674653000802681653002502689653001802714653000602732653001702738700002402755700002502779700001702804773010402821856008702925852000903012655001203021IND60559649420221119153300.0170713e20170101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055964942DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGärdenäs, Annemieke I.14aThe grain storage of wet-deposited caesium and strontium by spring wheat — A modelling study based on a field experiment  ap. 1313-1325.  a2019-12-06  aThe aims of this study were to extend the Tracey model in order to quantify and to analyse spring wheat's grain storage dynamics of wet-deposited radionuclides. Tracey, a dynamic model of trace element cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, was extended with descriptions of wet-deposition, interception, foliar uptake and radioactive decay. Radionuclide fluxes were set proportional to corresponding water or carbon fluxes, simulated with CoupModel.The extended Tracey was calibrated against experimental data, where 134Cs and 85Sr were deposited on spring wheat at six growth stages in 2010 and 2011. Sensitivities of grain storage to wheat's and radionuclide properties were assessed, using the Eikos software, by 1000 Monte Carlo simulations for each of the 48 scenarios (combination of 2 radionuclides, 1 foliar uptake, 2 root uptake approaches, 6 deposition treatments and 2years). Simulations were accepted if simulated grain storage values were within 95% confidence intervals (CI) of measurements.We found that 15% of 134Cs and 85Sr simulations for 2011, and 6% of the 2010 simulations met the CI-criterion. Foliar uptake accounted for 99% and 90% of total plant uptake of 134Cs and 85Sr, respectively. Mean simulated grain storage at harvest increased with lateness of deposition, as the stored proportion of radionuclide deposited was 0.02% when deposition was before flowering, 2% between flowering and ripening, and 5% (2010) or 10% (2011, late harvest) after ripening, respectively. Similarly, the property that governed grain storage depended on the growth stage at time of deposition; stem and leaf fixation rates (deposition before flowering), grain fixation rates (between flowering and ripening) and grains' interception capacity (after ripening).We conclude that grains' interception capacities can be used to predict grain storage of radionuclides deposited in the riskiest period, i.e. close to harvest.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoliar uptake 3aharvest date 3aMonte Carlo method 3adynamic models 3aflowering 3aradionuclides 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3acesium 3aconfidence interval 3awet deposition 3acarbon 3aspring wheat 3astrontium 3aripening 3afield experimentation 3acomputer software 3aleaves 0aFoliar uptake 0aPRU 0adevelopmental stages 0aCrops 0aD 0aGS 0aTE 0aARU 0aDynamic model Tracey 0aRadioactivity 0aS 0aInterception1 aBerglund, S.

Due to rising concerns about the occurrence of MBC resistance in different Calonectria populations and variability in prochloraz efficacy in controlling these pathogens, a detailed study on prochloraz sensitivity distributions of Calonectria isolates belonging to the Calonectria scoparia complex was carried out. In total, 105 isolates collected in two distinct periods (1993 to 1996 and 2005 to 2009) were analyzed for prochloraz sensitivity. Based on DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analyses of β-tubulin, histone H3, and translation elongation factor-1α gene sequences, 69 and 36 isolates were identified as C. pauciramosa and C. polizzii, respectively. The isolates collected more recently (group B) had a reduced prochloraz sensitivity, as indicated by greater values for the effective dose to reduce growth by 50% than those collected earlier (group A). The reduced sensitivity detected in vitro corresponded to partial loss of fungicide efficacy in controlling infections in red clover and feijoa under controlled and semi-field conditions, respectively. Frequent prochloraz application in nurseries for controlling Calonectria spp. infections is discouraged.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcca sellowiana 3aCalonectria 3aTrifolium pratense 3abenzimidazole 3acarbamates 3ahistones 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apesticide application 3aphylogeny 3aprochloraz 3asequence analysis 3atubulin 3aItaly1 aAiello, Dalia1 aPolizzi, Giancarlo1 aPerrone, Giancarlo1 aStea, Gaetano1 aVitale, Alessandro0 tPlant disease.g2014 Mar., v. 98, no. 3 p.344-350dThe American Phytopathological Societyx0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-04-13-0425-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03255naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094024003900130040001800169100002300187245009800210300001600308520171600324592002802040596004502068650002102113650001502134650002702149650001302176650001202189650001602201650001302217650001602230650001202246650002002258650001402278650001002292650001302302651001102315653002002326653002102346653001602367653001602383653002202399653002102421653001402442653001402456700002102470700002402491773011802515856008302633852000902716655001202725IND60535953220221119110712.0190411e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053595322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.baae.2014.12.0042doi7 a10.1016/j.baae.2014.12.0042chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtwater, Daniel Z.10aSeedling root traits strongly influence field survival and performance of a common bunchgrass  ap. 128-140.  aSeedling survival is a limiting factor in arid-land restoration. We investigated how variation in the root traits of glasshouse-reared seedlings related to the field performance of different genotypes from two populations of Elymus elymoides (squirreltail), a common bunchgrass native to the Western United States. Seeds from 100 E. elymoides individuals were collected from two sites in northern Nevada. We planted offspring of these 100 individuals in the glasshouse to characterize 10-day root traits of each maternal family. Root traits of glasshouse-reared plants and seed size measures were correlated with the performance of siblings grown in field plots close to the seed collection sites. Seedling root traits were related to performance of siblings at both sites. We estimate that within-population variation in root traits was associated with a more than six- to nine-fold increase in seedling survival probability and a two-fold increase in height at the less productive site, and a two-fold increase in survival and 1.2-fold increase in size at the more productive site. At both sites, effects of root traits were complex, with extreme values of some traits favoured and intermediate values of other traits favoured. There is a recognized need to integrate understanding of plant functional traits into larger conceptual frameworks of ecological restoration. Here we show that within-population variation in a suite of root functional traits relates to large variation in seedling survival and size of an arid-land grass species, improving our understanding of how trait variation affects performance in the field. Understanding such variation may be used to positively impact restoration outcomes.  aPublisher supplied data  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000199 3aElymus elymoides 3aarid lands 3aecological restoration 3agenotype 3agrasses 3agreenhouses 3aplanting 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3aseed collecting 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asiblings 3aNevada 0aBromus tectorum 0aElymus elymoides 0aGreat Basin 0aRestoration 0aRoot architecture 0aRoot development 0aRoot size 0aSeed mass1 aJames, Jeremy J.1 aLeger, Elizabeth A.0 tBasic and applied ecology.g2015 Mar., v. 16, no. 2 p.128-140dElsevier GmbHwJournal:jnl3925117x1439-17917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.baae.2014.12.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03162naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100006200151245011100213300001600324520155000340592002801890650002301918650002501941650001701966650001501983650002101998650001602019650001102035650002502046650002402071650002502095650001502120650002202135650003302157650001302190650002502203653002302228653003402251653001702285653000802302653000802310700002002318700002302338700002302361700002302384700002902407773011302436856008602549852000902635655001202644IND60542902720221120234231.0190408e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054290272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.02.0442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhuyan, Deep Jyoti1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9736-019710aMicrowave-assisted extraction of Eucalyptus robusta leaf for the optimal yield of total phenolic compounds  ap. 290-299.  aEucalyptus robusta (E. robusta) has a significant value in traditional medicine and recently has been shown to possess many pharmacological properties in vitro. This study was designed to utilise microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) to yield optimal total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), proanthocyanidin levels and antioxidant capacity from E. robusta using water as the solvent, facilitated by the use of response surface methodology (RSM). A three-level-three-factor Box–Behnken design was implemented to elucidate the effect of irradiation time, power and sample-to-solvent ratio on the yields of these phytochemicals. The results highlighted the accuracy and reliability of RSM as a tool for predicting the yields of TPC, TFC, proanthocyanidins and total antioxidants using MAE. Sample-to-solvent ratio had the greatest impact on the TPC yield followed by power and irradiation time. The optimal MAE conditions for TPC and TFC were 3min, 600W power and 2g/100mL sample-to-solvent ratio. The experimental yield of TPC was 58.40±1.03mg GAE/g, and 19.15±1.06mg RE/g of TFC was obtained under these optimal conditions. These conditions, optimised for maximum TPC yield also liberated 62%, 64.6%, 66.3% and 67% of the maximum proanthocyanidins, ABTS, DPPH and CUPRAC values, respectively. This study revealed that MAE is a reliable and efficient method for extracting high yields of phytochemicals from E. robusta, with significant potential to be up-scaled for industrial, nutraceutical or pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEucalyptus robusta 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3airradiation 3aleaves 3amedicinal properties 3amicrowave treatment 3aphytopharmaceuticals 3aprediction 3aproanthocyanidins 3aresponse surface methodology 3asolvents 3atraditional medicine 0aEucalyptus robusta 0aMicrowave-assisted extraction 0aOptimisation 0aRSM 0aBBD1 aVan Vuong, Quan1 aChalmers, Anita C.1 avan Altena, Ian A.1 aBowyer, Michael C.1 aScarlett, Christopher J.0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2015 July, v. 69 p.290-299dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2015.02.0443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01767naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245012200162300001600284500001500300520079700315592002801112650001901140650001501159650001501174650001101189650001501200653001401215700001801229773011501247852000901362856008201371655001201453IND4444081020221122231157.0190314e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444408102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10086-010-1106-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSobue, Nobuo10aImprovement of simple impedance tomography method in RF range for estimating moisture distribution in squared timbers  ap. 366-370.  a2019-12-06  aImprovement of the simple tomography method for estimating moisture distribution in squared timbers was conducted by using impedance measurement in the RF range at 250 kHz. The local impedance in the horizontal and vertical directions was measured during natural drying. An inverse procedure using a trial-and-error method was used to reconstitute the cross-sectional moisture distribution from the surface impedance measurement. Two essential corrections for the spatial heterogeneity of the electric field between electrodes and for the calculation error due to the algorithm of the trial-and-error method were introduced to improve the accuracy of the reconstitution of the moisture distribution. The reconstituted moisture distribution matched well that determined by the oven-dry method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectric field 3atomography 3aelectrodes 3adrying 3aalgorithms 0aimpedance1 aWoodhead, Ian0 tJournal of wood science.g2010 Oct., v. 56, no. 5 p.366-370dSpringer JapanwJournal:jnl56734x1435-02117nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10086-010-1106-53Available from publisher's site 7aarticle03146naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100004800140245012500188300001800313520160800331592002801939650002501967650002401992650001202016650002602028650001702054650002102071650002502092650001402117650001202131650002302143650003002166650002202196650001902218650001302237650000902250650001302259650001302272650002202285700001602307700001702323700001502340700001802355700001402373700001402387700001502401773012902416856007402545852000902619655001202628IND60634990020221118230818.0190327e20190326xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063499002DNAL7 a10.1039/c8bm01295d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiuThese authors contributed equally., Yang12aA brand-new generation of fluorescent nano-neural tracers: biotinylated dextran amine conjugated carbonized polymer dots  ap. 1574-1583.  aThe anterograde neuroanatomical tracing technique plays a crucial role in studying and charting the complex interconnections of the nervous system. But there are several major limitations for traditional neural tracers, such as complex immunohistochemical staining procedures, low fluorescence intensity and quick fluorescence quenching. Carbon dots (CDs) as fluorescent bio-probes have been widely used in the biological studies due to their superior optical properties, excellent chemical stability, low toxicity, and easy modifications. In this study, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and red fluorescent carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) are successfully conjugated to develop a brand-new generation of fluorescent nano-neural tracers: BDA–CPDs. They are successfully applied as fluorescent probes for in vitro and in vivo bioimaging. In vitro biodistribution of BDA–CPDs shows that they distribute mainly in lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, two metabolic pathways of BDA–CPDs are found through the investigation of in vivo biodistribution of BDA–CPDs. Furthermore, they can be taken up and anterogradely transported by neurons within the peripheral nervous system of rats. Our results suggest that BDA–CPDs have many advantages over traditional tracers, such as low toxicity, high photoluminescence intensity, excellent photostability and easy procedures. Anterograde pathway tracing with BDA–CPDs is a simple, direct and economical way of studying the connections in the nervous system. Therefore, BDA–CPDs are reliable and valuable fluorescent anterograde neural tracers.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon quantum dots 3adextran 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3afluorescence 3afluorescent dyes 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alysosomes 3aneurons 3aoptical properties 3aperipheral nervous system 3aphotoluminescence 3aphotostability 3apolymers 3arats 3astaining 3atoxicity 3atracer techniques1 aLiu, Junjun1 aZhang, Jiayi1 aLi, Xiucun1 aLin, Fangsiyu1 aZhou, Nan1 aYang, Bai1 aLu, Laijin0 tBiomaterials science.g2019 Mar. 26, v. 7, no. 4 p.1574-1583dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26911x2047-48497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c8bm01295d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01884naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002200145245012000167300002000287520070600307592002801013650001301041650001101054650001401065650002301079650002101102650002301123650001301146650000901159650001301168650002201181700002201203700002301225700002101248700001801269773012101287856008101408852000901489655001201498IND60582685920171214000000.0171031e20171006xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058268592DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.joc.7b019902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Thomas J.,10aUse of (Cyclopentadienone)iron Tricarbonyl Complexes for C–N Bond Formation Reactions between Amines and Alcohols  ap. 10489-10503.  aThe application of a series of (cyclopentadienone)iron tricarbonyl complexes to “borrowing hydrogen” reactions between amines and alcohols was completed in order to assess their catalytic activity. The electronic variation of the aromatic groups flanking the CO of the cyclopentadienone influenced the efficiency of the reactions; however, in other cases, the Knölker catalyst 1, containing trimethylsilyl groups flanking the cyclopentadienone ketone, gave the best results. In some cases, the change of the ratio of amine to alcohol improves the conversion significantly. The application of iron catalysts to the synthesis of a range of amines, including unsaturated amines, was investigated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalcohols 3aamines 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achemical reactions 3ahydrogen 3airon 3amoieties 3aorganic chemistry1 aCumbes, Madeleine1 aDiorazio, Louis J.1 aClarkson, Guy J.1 aWills, Martin0 tJournal of organic chemistry.g2017 Oct. 06, v. 82, no. 19 p.10489-10503dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-69047nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.joc.7b019903Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01222naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245005700186300001800243520019800261592002800459650001900487650002000506650001400526650001000540650005500550650001000605650001300615650005100628773009200679856008100771990002300852852000900875655001200884IND60093828520221117223506.0141104e20110308xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009382852DNAL7 a213771002pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.01.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiklas, Karl J.10aClimbing Plants: Attachment and the Ascent for Light  ap.

To gain insight into this process, we carried out kinetic analysis of a miRNA's turnover following termination of its biogenesis and during regulation of a target that is not subject to Ago2-mediated catalytic cleavage. By quantitating the number of molecules of the miRNA and its target in steady state and in the course of its decay, we found that each miRNA molecule was able to regulate at least two target transcripts, providing in vivo evidence that the miRNA is not irreversibly sequestered with its target and that the nonslicing pathway of miRNA regulation is multiple-turnover. Using deep sequencing, we further show that miRNA recycling is limited by target regulation, which promotes posttranscriptional modifications to the 3′ end of the miRNA and accelerates the miRNA's rate of decay. These studies provide new insight into the efficiency of miRNA regulation that help to explain how a miRNA can regulate a vast number of transcripts and that identify one of the mechanisms that impart specificity to miRNA decay in mammalian cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogenesis 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3amammals 3amicroRNA 2aBase Sequence 2aCell Line 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aFlow Cytometry 2aGene Expression Regulationxgenetics 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHumans 2aKinetics 2aMicroRNAsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNerve Tissue Proteinsxgenetics 2aOligonucleotidesxgenetics 2aRNA Stabilityxphysiology 2aReceptors, Nerve Growth Factorxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aChauhan, Hemangini1 aGardner, Thomas J.1 aJayaprakash, Anitha D.1 aSachidanandam, Ravi1 aBrown, Brian D.0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Mar. 8, v. 21, no. 5 p.369-376dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.01.0673Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02543naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001600270520135100286592002801637650002101665650001401686650001501700650001501715650001601730650001001746650001301756650001101769650001401780650001801794650002201812650001701834700001601851700001801867700001601885700001801901773012301919856008202042852000902124655001202133IND60595965220221121020922.0180619e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059596522DNAL7 a10.1007/s00343-017-6239-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTang, Xianghai10aComplete genome of Cobetia marina JCM 21022T and phylogenomic analysis of the family Halomonadaceae  ap. 528-536.  aCobetia marina is a model proteobacteria in researches on marine biofouling. Its taxonomic nomenclature has been revised many times over the past few decades. To better understand the role of the surface-associated lifestyle of C. marina and the phylogeny of the family Halomonadaceae, we sequenced the entire genome of C. marina JCM 21022ᵀ using single molecule real-time sequencing technology (SMRT) and performed comparative genomics and phylogenomics analyses. The circular chromosome was 4 176 300 bp with an average GC content of 62.44% and contained 3 611 predicted coding sequences, 72 tRNA genes, and 21 rRNA genes. The C. marina JCM 21022ᵀ genome contained a set of crucial genes involved in surface colonization processes. The comparative genome analysis indicated the significant differences between C. marina JCM 21022ᵀ and Cobetia amphilecti KMM 296 (formerly named C. marina KMM 296) resulted from sequence insertions or deletions and chromosomal recombination. Despite these differences, pan and core genome analysis showed similar gene functions between the two strains. The phylogenomic study of the family Halomonadaceae is reported here for the first time. We found that the relationships were well resolved among every genera tested, including Chromohalobacter, Halomonas, Cobetia, Kushneria, Zymobacter, and Halotalea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChromohalobacter 3aHalomonas 3aZymobacter 3abiofouling 3achromosomes 3agenes 3agenomics 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3atransfer RNA1 aXu, Kuipeng1 aHan, Xiaojuan1 aMo, Zhaolan1 aMao, Yunxiang0 tJournal of oceanology and limnology.g2018 Mar., v. 36, no. 2 p.528-536dScience PresswJournal:26756x2096-55087nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-017-6239-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100005600188245008800244300001200332506007600344520155700420592002801977506003702005650001202042650002502054650002402079650002802103650001602131650001002147650001302157650001102170650001502181650001302196650000902209650002202218650003502240700002702275700002102302773010902323856008102432852000902513655001202522IND60597858320221207094135.0180627e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059785832DNAL7 a10.1007/s13205-018-1312-12doi7 aPMC60201002pmcid7 a299633492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZargar, Seema1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5622-084110aVariants in MEF2A gene in relation with coronary artery disease in Saudi population  ap. 289.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study investigated the association of variants in myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A) gene with coronary artery disease (CAD) via case control study on Saudi population. Several studies have indicated a high expression of MEF2A in the human coronary endothelium. The entire (exon 11 putative susceptibility exon) of MEF2A gene was sequenced using direct DNA sequencing method in 120 sporadic patients and 100 controls. Total number of variants were identified and crude odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. In total, three variants were identified, namely, CAG repeats, AGC deletion, and SNP rs: 325400. No significant link was observed between the common (CAG) ₙ polymorphism, AGC deletion, and CAD risk as reported in other populations, but interestingly, rs325400 (G1323T) in Saudis was found to be associated with the CAD with odds ratio 2.0102 (CI = 1.3405–3.0146) and significance of p = 0.00048. None of Saudi subjects (normal as well as diseased) showed 21-bp deletion as reported previously for other populations. In addition, genotype TT of rs325400 is associated with significantly higher levels of LDL-C and lower level of HDL-C. Among the quantitative parameters, lower HDL-C and higher LDL-C was found to be associated with disease. We report that MEF2A gene based on SNP rs325400 (G1323T) can be considered as a susceptibility factor for CAD and presence of T allele makes Saudis at more risk to CAD, while other variants detected in this gene do not have any association in Saudi population.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3acase-control studies 3aconfidence interval 3acoronary artery disease 3aendothelium 3aexons 3agenotype 3ahumans 3aodds ratio 3apatients 3arisk 3asequence analysis 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism1 aAljafari, Abdulaziz A.1 aWani, Tanveer A.0 t3 Biotech.g2018 July, v. 8, no. 7 p.289-289dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-018-1312-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02525naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001900166245014700185300001800332520124400350592002801594650002601622650001301648650001501661650001201676650001501688650001401703650001201717650001301729650001501742650001101757650001501768650001801783700001901801700001801820700001801838700002101856773013601877856008102013852000902094655001202103IND60080770520221118054645.0140811e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008077052DNAL7 a241944152pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-013-2252-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWehrer, Markus10aElectrical resistivity tomography as monitoring tool for unsaturated zone transport: an example of preferential transport of deicing chemicals  ap. 8964-8980.  aNon-invasive spatially resolved monitoring techniques may hold the key to observe heterogeneous flow and transport behavior of contaminants in soils. In this study, time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was employed during an infiltration experiment with deicing chemical in a small field lysimeter. Deicing chemicals like potassium formate, which frequently impact soils on airport sites, were infiltrated during snow melt. Chemical composition of seepage water and the electrical response was recorded over the spring period 2010. Time-lapse electrical resistivity tomographs are able to show the infiltration of the melt water loaded with ionic constituents of deicing chemicals and their degradation product hydrogen carbonate. The tomographs indicate early breakthrough behavior in parts of the profile. Groundtruthing with pore fluid conductivity and water content variations shows disagreement between expected and observed bulk conductivity. This was attributed to the different sampling volume of traditional methods and ERT due to a considerable fraction of immobile water in the soil. The results show that ERT can be used as a soil monitoring tool on airport sites if assisted by common soil monitoring techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical resistance 3ahydrogen 3alysimeters 3amelting 3amonitoring 3apotassium 3aseepage 3asnowmelt 3asoil water 3aspring 3atomography 3awater content1 aLissner, Heidi1 aBloem, Esther1 aFrench, Helen1 aTotsche, Kai Uwe0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 15 p.8964-8980dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-013-2252-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02901naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245013600164300001800300520112800318592002801446596010301474650002601577650002901603650002101632650001501653650002301668650001101691650001001702650001301712650002001725650003701745650001801782650001401800650002001814650002001834650002801854650002901882653001401911653002701925653000801952700001501960700005501975700001802030700001802048700001402066700001402080700001402094700001402108773013302122856008302255852000902338655001202347IND60753887520221118071923.0211020e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075388752DNAL7 a10.1094/PHYTO-08-20-0323-R2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Chuang10aMitogen-Activated Protein Kinase MAPKKK7 from Plasmodiophora brassicae Regulates Low-Light-Dependent Nicotiana benthamiana Immunity  ap. 1017-1028.  aMAPKKK is the largest family of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and is known to play important roles in plant pathogen interaction by regulating fungal cell proliferation, growth, and pathogenicity. Thus far, only a few have been characterized because of the functional redundancy of MAPKKKs. In this study, it is interesting that Plasmodiophora brassicae (Pb)MAPKKK7 was clustered into the A3 subgroup of plant MAPKKKs by a phylogenetic analysis and also with the BCK1 and STE groups of fungal MAPKKKs. PbMAPKKK7 function in reactive oxygen species accumulation and cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana was characterized. Agroinfiltration with the PbMAPKKK7 mutated protein kinase domain relieved these changes. Interestingly, the induction of cell death was dependent on light intensity. Transcriptional profiling analysis demonstrated that PbMAPKKK7 was highly expressed during cortex infection stages, indicating its important role in P. brassicae infection. These functional analyses of PbMAPKKK7 build knowledge of new roles of the MAPK cascade pathway in N. benthamiana and P. brassicae interactions.  aPublisher supplied data  a201910626064cSichuan Province University Student Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3aPlasmodiophora brassicae 3aagroinfiltration 3acell death 3acell proliferation 3acortex 3afungi 3aimmunity 3alight intensity 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3apathogenicity 3aphylogeny 3aplant pathogens 3aplant pathology 3areactive oxygen species 3atranscription (genetics) 0aPbMAPKKK7 0aplant immune responses 0aROS1 aLiao, Rong1 aZheng, Jing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1229-20261 aFang, Xingyan1 aWang, Wenming1 aFan, Jing1 aYuan, Shu1 aDu, Junbo1 aYang, Hui0 tPhytopathology.g2021 June, v. 111, no. 6 p.1017-1028dThe American Phytopathological SocietywJournal:jnl44575x0031-949X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-08-20-0323-R3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02313naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001800161245009100179300001600270500000900286520102000295592002801315650000901343650001501352650002001367650002701387650000901414650002601423650002401449650001101473650002101484650001301505650002301518650001501541650001601556650002301572650001801595700002501613773014801638856009601786852000901882655001201891IND60668373920221118045710.0191125e197607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066837392DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1976.03615995004000040033x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBar-Yosef, B.10aDistribution of Water and Ions in Soils Irrigated and Fertilized from a Trickle Source  ap. 575-582.  aepub  aSimultaneous distributions of water, NO₃-N and P in clay and sandy soils irrigated daily from a trickle source were studied in the laboratory. Hydraulic conductivity data, water retention curves and adsorption isotherms to the soils were determined to enable verification of mathematical models against the experimental results obtained under various conditions. It was found that when adding identical amounts of water, but increasing the trickle discharge rate in the sandy soil from 250 to 2,500 ml/hour, the vertical movement of the wetting front increased and the horizontal movement decreased. In a sequence of three cycles of irrigation with a nutrient solution, losses of nitrate were observed in the clay soil, probably due to denitrification processes. The restricted mobility of the phosphate ions, even in the sandy soil, implies that a preirrigation mixing of P in the soil, supplemented by its addition to the irrigation solution, is necessary to obtain a uniform P concentration in the soil volume.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclay 3aclay soils 3adenitrification 3ahydraulic conductivity 3aions 3airrigation scheduling 3amathematical models 3amixing 3anitrate nitrogen 3anitrates 3anutrient solutions 3aphosphates 3asandy soils 3asorption isotherms 3awetting front1 aSheikholslami, M.

Experimental evidence on the economic and non-economic determinants of demand  ap. 66-75.  aFocusing on consumer co-operatives, I test the conventional economic worldview that relative price is a main determinants of consumer behaviour using survey instruments in a classroom setting. I examine the role which non-economic variables such as 'warm glow' might play in determining demand. My findings challenge the narrow economic worldview that only economic variables count; but support a core assumption that economic variables are of fundamental importance to individual's choice decisions. Significantly, individuals are willing to pay higher prices for co-operative products even if they are not co-op members. However, as the price of co-operative products increases relative to the products of non-co-operatives, demand falls amongst both non-members and members of co-operatives. But demand is more inelastic for co-op members. When price is the same for co-ops and non-co-op, even non-co-ops members prefer to purchase products sold by co-operatives. The co-operative advantage provides co-ops with a protective belt against competition from non-cooperatives. This also speaks to the potential strength of consumer co-ops in competitive markets. Firms that invest in both economic and non-economic determinants of consumer demand, should be characterized by a significant competitive advantage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aconsumer behavior 3aconsumer demand 3acooperatives 3aprices 3awillingness to pay 0aCo-operatives 0aSurvey experiment 0aCo-operative advantage 0aChoice theory 0aWelfare improvement 0aWarm glow0 tJournal of co-operative organization and management.g2016 Dec., v. 4, no. 2 p.66-75dElsevier LtdwJournal:21615x2213-297X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcom.2016.08.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03266naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245014600170300001800316520203200334592002802366650001302394650001902407650001602426650001002442650001502452650001902467650002602486650001902512650001502531650000902546650001602555650001402571650001602585700001802601700002302619773013602642856008102778852000902859655001202868IND60080770820221118054737.0150217e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008077082DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2601-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchurig, Christian10aHexadecane and pristane degradation potential at the level of the aquifer—evidence from sediment incubations compared to in situ microcosms  ap. 9081-9094.  aMonitored natural attenuation is widely accepted as a sustainable remediation method. However, methods providing proof of proceeding natural attenuation within the water-unsaturated (vadose) zone are still relying on proxies such as measurements of reactive and non-reactive gases, or sediment sampling and subsequent mineralisation assays, under artificial conditions in the laboratory. In particular, at field sites contaminated with hydrophobic compounds, e.g. crude oil spills, an in situ evaluation of natural attenuation is needed, because in situ methods are assumed to provide less bias than investigations applying either proxies for biodegradation or off-site microcosm experiments. In order to compare the current toolbox of methods with the recently developed in situ microcosms, incubations with direct push-sampled sediments from the vadose and the aquifer zones of a site contaminated with crude oil were carried out in conventional microcosms and in situ microcosms. The results demonstrate the applicability of the in situ microcosm approach also outside water-saturated aquifer conditions in the vadose zone. The sediment incubation experiments demonstrated turnover rates in a similar range (vadose, 4.7 mg/kg*day; aquifer, 6.4 mgₕₑₓₐdₑcₐₙₑ/kgₛₒᵢₗ/day) of hexadecane degradation in the vadose zone and the aquifer, although mediated by slightly different microbial communities according to the analysis of fatty acid patterns and amounts. Additional experiments had the task of evaluating the degradation potential for the branched-chain alkane pristane (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane). Although this compound is regarded to be hardly degradable in comparison to n-alkanes and is thus frequently used as a reference parameter for indexing the extent of biodegradation of crude oils, it could be shown to be degraded by means of the incubation experiments. Thus, the site had a high inherent potential for natural attenuation of crude oils both in the vadose zone and the aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3abiodegradation 3afatty acids 3agases 3ahexadecane 3ahydrophobicity 3amicrobial communities 3amineralization 3aoil spills 3aoils 3aremediation 3asediments 3avadose zone1 aMiltner, Anja1 aKaestner, Matthias0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 15 p.9081-9094dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2601-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245023100153300001800384500002000402520203800422592002802460650001902488650001602507650001702523650002302540650001502563650002302578650001302601650001102614650002402625650001402649650002402663650003102687650001802718650001502736700001602751700001302767700001302780700001902793700001202812700005502824773014902879856007503028852000903103655001203112IND60773526820221120110828.0220417e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077352682DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.116272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Le10aSingle‐molecule real‐time sequencing of the full‐length transcriptome of purple garlic (Allium sativum L. cv. Leduzipi) and identification of serine O‐acetyltransferase family proteins involved in cysteine biosynthesis  ap. 2864-2873.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Garlic (Allium sativum L.), whose bioactive components are mainly organosulfur compounds (OSCs), is a herbaceous perennial widely consumed as a green vegetable and a condiment. Yet, the metabolic enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of OSCs are not identified in garlic. RESULTS: Here, a full‐length transcriptome of purple garlic was generated via PacBio and Illumina sequencing, to characterize the garlic transcriptome and identify key proteins mediating the biosynthesis of OSCs. Overall, 22.56 Gb of clean data were generated, resulting in 454 698 circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads, of which 83.4% (379 206) were identified as being full‐length non‐chimeric reads – their further transcript clustering facilitated identification of 36 571 high‐quality consensus reads. Once corrected, their genome‐wide mapping revealed that 6140 reads were novel isoforms of known genes, and 2186 reads were novel isoforms from novel genes. We detected 1677 alternative splicing events, finding 2902 genes possessing either two or more poly(A) sites. Given the importance of serine O‐acetyltransferase (SERAT) in cysteine biosynthesis, we investigated the five SERAT homologs in garlic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a three‐tier classification of SERAT proteins, each featuring a serine acetyltransferase domain (N‐terminal) and one or two hexapeptide transferase motifs. Template‐based modeling showed that garlic SERATs shared a common homo‐trimeric structure with homologs from bacteria and other plants. The residues responsible for substrate recognition and catalysis were highly conserved, implying a similar reaction mechanism. In profiling the five SERAT genes’ transcript levels, their expression pattern varied significantly among different tissues. CONCLUSION: This study's findings deepen our knowledge of SERAT proteins, and provide timely genetic resources that could advance future exploration into garlic's genetic improvement and breeding. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAllium sativum 3aagriculture 3abiosynthesis 3acatalytic activity 3acondiments 3aconsensus sequence 3acysteine 3agarlic 3agenetic improvement 3aphylogeny 3areaction mechanisms 3aserine O-acetyltransferase 3atranscriptome 3avegetables1 aZhang, Chao1 aYin, Wei1 aWei, Wei1 aWang, Yonghong1 aSa, Wei1 aLiang, Jian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7500-17190 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2022 May, v. 102, no. 7 p.2864-2873dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.116273Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02821naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245019100169300001800360520159400378592002801972650001802000650001502018650001502033650001002048650001402058650001002072650002202082650001902104650002202123650002402145651002002169651002202189700001602211700002002227700002102247773009802268856004802366852000902414655001202423IND50070396220221118005252.0131106e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007039622DNAL7 a10.1007/s10592-013-0504-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAustin, Jeremy J.10aUncovering cryptic evolutionary diversity in extant and extinct populations of the southern Australian arid zone Western and Thick-billed Grasswrens (Passeriformes: Maluridae: Amytornis)  ap. 1173-1184.  aThe Western and Thick-billed Grasswrens (Aves: Passeriformes: Maluridae: Amytornis textilis and Amytornis modestus, respectively) exemplify issues surrounding the evolution, biogeography and conservation of Australia's arid and semi-arid zone fauna. The two species together have historically occurred across much of southern Australia. They showed high intraspecific taxonomic diversity and short range endemism but suffered high rates of recent anthropogenic extinction. Of 11 named and 1 un-named subspecies, 5 are extinct and 3 are vulnerable or critically endangered. To clarify taxonomic issues, and to understand their pre-extinction phylogeography and identify extant populations and taxa of conservation value, we sequenced ~1,000 bp of the mtDNA ND2 gene from all extant populations and all but one extinct population. We confirmed reciprocal monophyly of A. modestus and A. textilis and identified strong phylogeographic structure associated with morphological divergence within each species. Populations of A. t. myall at the western edge of their range in South Australia may preserve "ghost" lineages of extinct subspecies from Western Australia as a result of ancient gene flow. Our results support recent taxonomic revisions, and highlight the critical importance of including samples of extirpated populations and extinct species to fully understand and interpret extant diversity. Conservation and management plans should recognise and seek to preserve the unique evolutionary diversity present in surviving populations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPasseriformes 3aarid zones 3aextinction 3afauna 3agene flow 3agenes 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeography 3aspecies diversity 3ataxonomic revisions 3aSouth Australia 3aWestern Australia1 aJoseph, Leo1 aPedler, Lynn P.1 aBlack, Andrew B.0 tConservation genetics.g2013 Dec., v. 14, no. 6 p.1173-1184dSpringer-Verlagx1566-06217nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10592-013-0504-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01317naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002100161245007300182300001600255500000900271520037300280592002800653650001200681650001800693650001800711700002300729700002100752773014900773856009600922852000901018655001201027IND60668374120221118045635.0191125e197109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066837412DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1971.03615995003500050060x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelton, James R.14aThe Determination of Mercury in Soils by Flameless Atomic Absorption  ap. 850-852.  aepub  aA method is described for the determination of mercury in soils at the ppb level or greater.

Mechanical shock is one of the unavoidable factors of post-harvest handling. In this research, a metabolomics strategy based on ultra performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) was used to investigate the metabolic characteristics of live scallops (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) subjected to mechanical shock. Phosphoarginine and ATP-related compound levels were also measured to understand the metabolic disturbances. Live scallops maintained in a circulating seawater system for 36 h formed the control group, while those individuals dropped 15 times onto a hard surface from a height of 1 m before being maintained in a circulating seawater system formed the shock group. Samples were collected from the adductor muscles, and multivariate statistical analyses were performed to identify the potential biomarkers of mechanical shock due to post-harvest handling. Our results suggested that obvious metabolic disturbances occurred when scallops suffered mechanical shock during post-harvest handling. A total of 18 biomarkers were identified, including 10 upregulated and 8 downregulated biomarkers. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the biosynthesis of amino acids and cysteine and methionine metabolism were prone to interference when M. yessoensis was subjected to mechanical shock during early post-harvest handling. This study provides a new perspective into the metabolic profiles of scallops subjected to various stressors and can assist in the improvement of disposal methods of post-harvest scallops.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMizuhopecten yessoensis 3abiomarkers 3abiosynthesis 3acysteine 3adepuration 3amass spectrometry 3ametabolomics 3amethionine 3amultivariate analysis 3amuscles 3apostharvest treatment 3ascallops 3aseawater 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aMizuhopecten yessoensis 0aMetabolomics 0aMechanical shock 0aPost-harvest handling1 aXu, Tanye1 aLi, Yaxuan1 aLiu, Yang1 aLiu, Junrong0 tAquaculture.g2021 Feb. 25, v. 533 p.736061-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7360613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02670naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003200133040001800165100002800183245011000211300001200321506007600333520149000409592002801899506003701927650002501964650000801989650002001997650001802017650004302035650001402078650002502092700001702117700002102134773008702155856004502242852000902287655001202296IND4463093020221207065054.0120907e201112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446309302DNAL7 a221362932pmid7 aPMC33058962pmcid7 a10.1186/1746-4811-7-402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalvo-Chirnside, Eliane10aProtocol: high throughput silica-based purification of RNA from Arabidopsis seedlings in a 96-well format  ap. 176.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe increasing popularity of systems-based approaches to plant research has resulted in a demand for high throughput (HTP) methods to be developed. RNA extraction from multiple samples in an experiment is a significant bottleneck in performing systems-level genomic studies. Therefore we have established a high throughput method of RNA extraction from Arabidopsis thaliana to facilitate gene expression studies in this widely used plant model. We present optimised manual and automated protocols for the extraction of total RNA from 9-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings in a 96 well plate format using silica membrane-based methodology. Consistent and reproducible yields of high quality RNA are isolated averaging 8.9 μg total RNA per sample (~20 mg plant tissue). The purified RNA is suitable for subsequent qPCR analysis of the expression of over 500 genes in triplicate from each sample. Using the automated procedure, 192 samples (2 × 96 well plates) can easily be fully processed (samples homogenised, RNA purified and quantified) in less than half a day. Additionally we demonstrate that plant samples can be stored in RNAlater at -20°C (but not 4°C) for 10 months prior to extraction with no significant effect on RNA yield or quality. Additionally, disrupted samples can be stored in the lysis buffer at -20°C for at least 6 months prior to completion of the extraction procedure providing a flexible sampling and storage scheme to facilitate complex time series experiments.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aRNA 3agene expression 3aplant tissues 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3atime series analysis1 aKane, Steven1 aKerr, Lorraine E0 tPlant methods.g2011 Dec., v. 7, no. 1 p.176-176dSpringer-Verlagx1746-48117nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1746-4811-7-40  aDNAL 7aarticle03417naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002400166245011900190300001800309520223000327592002802557650001402585650002702599650001602626650002902642650001202671650002402683650001302707650003202720651001202752651001602764700001802780700001902798773013602817856008102953852000903034655001203043IND60080771120221118054601.0140811e201408  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008077112DNAL7 a247370152pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-014-2749-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFleischer, Matthias10aWhere can cone penetrometer technology be applied? Development of a map of Europe regarding the soil penetrability  ap. 9016-9027.  aOver the past decades, significant efforts have been invested in the development of push-in technology for site characterization and monitoring for geotechnical and environmental purposes and have especially been undertaken in the Netherlands and Germany. These technologies provide the opportunity for faster, cheaper, and collection of more reliable subsurface data. However, to maximize the technology both from a development and implementation point of view, it is necessary to have an overview of the areas suitable for the application of this type of technology. Such an overview is missing and cannot simply be read from existing maps and material. This paper describes the development of a map showing the feasibility or applicability of Direct Push/Cone Penetrometer Technology (DPT/CPT) in Europe which depends on the subsurface and its extremely varying properties throughout Europe. Subsurface penetrability is dependent on a range of factors that have not been mapped directly or can easily be inferred from existing databases, especially the maximum depth reachable would be of interest. Among others, it mainly depends on the geology, the soil mechanical properties, the type of equipment used as well as soil-forming processes. This study starts by looking at different geological databases available at the European scale. Next, a scheme has been developed linking geological properties mapped to geotechnical properties to determine basic penetrability categories. From this, a map of soil penetrability is developed and presented. Validating the output by performing field tests was beyond the scope of this study, but for the country of the Netherlands, this map has been compared against a database containing actual cone penetrometer depth data to look for possible contradictory results that would negate the approach. The map for the largest part of Europe clearly shows that there is a much wider potential for the application of Direct Push Technology than is currently seen. The study also shows that there is a lack of large-scale databases that contain depth-resolved data as well as soil mechanical and physical properties that can be used for engineering purposes in relation to the subsurface.  aPublisher supplied data 3adatabases 3adirect push technology 3aengineering 3aenvironmental monitoring 3ageology 3aphysical properties 3asoil map 3asoil penetration resistance 3aGermany 3aNetherlands1 avan Ree, Derk1 aLeven, Carsten0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 15 p.9016-9027dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2749-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03177naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245015300171300001600324520166800340592002802008650001802036650002202054650001202076650001102088650001102099650001402110650001402124650001702138650001402155650002302169650002802192650001502220650001302235650002302248650001502271650001102286651001002297653002402307653001202331653001102343653002802354653002302382653002302405700001402428700001902442773010502461856008402566852000902650655001202659IND60545795520221118005854.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054579552DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Chengsong10aAcute effects of cadmium and copper on survival, oxygen consumption, ammonia-N excretion, and metal accumulation in juvenile Exopalaemon carinicauda  ap. 209-214.  aRidgetail white prawn (Exopalaemon carinicauda), a commercially important species in China, is a potential candidate for evaluating impairments caused by environmental pollutants in coastal and estuarine areas. The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the acute effects of cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) on survival, oxygen consumption, ammonia-N excretion, and metal accumulation in E. carinicauda. The feasibility of using this species for pollution monitoring was also evaluated. Results showed that the median lethal concentrations (LC50) for 24h, 48h, 72h, and 96h were 0.66mg/L, 0.379mg/L, 0.343mg/L, and 0.258mg/L for Cd, and 0.932mg/L, 0.748mg/L, 0.725mg/L, and 0.712mg/L for Cu. Cd exposure (0.66mg/L) caused an inhibition in oxygen consumption of 21.1 percent and an increase in ammonia-N excretion of 47.1 percent, thereby decreasing the atomic ratio of oxygen consumed to nitrogen consumed (O:N ratio) of 46.32 percent relative to the control. Cu exposure (0.932mg/L) also resulted in an inhibition in oxygen consumption of 34.8 percent and a decrease in the O:N ratio of 23.9 percent in relation to the control, but the ammonia-N excretion was not influenced by the Cu exposure. Concentration-depended accumulation was observed in the experimental animals, which a maximum of 244.8 folds and 1.1 folds increase of mental concentration was measured upon exposure to 24h LC50 of Cd and Cu for 24h, respectively. The change in O:N ratio indicated an alteration in energy utilization. Based on its sensitivity to heavy metals and its availability all year round, E. carinicauda can be used as a test organism to monitor for metal pollution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacute effects 3aammonium nitrogen 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenergy 3aestuaries 3aexcretion 3aheavy metals 3ajuveniles 3alaboratory animals 3alethal concentration 50 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3aoxygen consumption 3apollutants 3ashrimp 3aChina 0aAmmonia-N excretion 0aCadmium 0aCopper 0aExopalaemon carinicauda 0aMetal accumulation 0aOxygen consumption1 aLi, Fuhua1 aXiang, Jianhai0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2014 June, v. 104 p.209-214dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02669naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245010400164500002200268520100500290592002801295650002301323650002501346650002001371650001001391650001101401650001301412650001801425650001501443650001901458650002401477650001501501650001301516650001801529650002701547653001001574653002101584653002601605653001001631653000801641653000901649653000801658653000801666653000801674653001201682700001701694700001701711700001401728700001501742700001801757700001701775700001601792700001401808700005901822773008201881856008301963852000902046655001202055IND60655343020221118045106.0190801e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065534302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2019.1440102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Qiong10aKnockdown of SSATX, an alternative splicing variant of the SAT1 gene, promotes melanoma progression  aPre-press version  aAlternative splicing can generate multiple protein messages from a single gene and has emerged as an important mechanism to regulate cancer pathways. The human SAT1 gene produces two transcript variants: one translates spermidine/spermine N-1 acetyltransferase (SSAT1), the rate-limiting enzyme in the catabolism of polyamines, and the other generates SSATX, which has largely unknown biological functions. Here, we used experimental data and analyses of several melanoma transcriptome datasets to reveal that SSATX is weakly expressed in melanoma cells. SSATX knockdown promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of human melanoma cells via the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in a manner that was independent of SSAT1 expression. Based on our data, we propose that SSATX functions as a long non-coding RNA prior to its degradation in melanoma cells. Overall, our findings indicate that SSATX acts as a tumor suppressor, which may aid the future diagnosis and treatment of melanoma.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetyltransferases 3aalternative splicing 3adata collection 3agenes 3ahumans 3amelanoma 3amessenger RNA 3ametabolism 3anon-coding RNA 3asignal transduction 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3atranscriptome 3atranslation (genetics) 0aSSATX 0aTumor suppressor 0aWnt signaling pathway 0aSSAT1 0aNMD 0aDMEM 0aFBS 0aP/S 0aIPA 0aTCF/LEF1 aDeng, Youhui1 aXu, Yuanyuan1 aDing, Nan1 aWang, Chen1 aZhao, Xuetong1 aLou, Xiaomin1 aLi, Yongjun1 aZhao, Hua1 aFang, Xiangdong1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6628-86200 tGene.g2019 July 24,  p.144010-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.1440103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03796naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245017000175506010400345506007600449520190800525592002802433506003702461650002402498650002902522650001702551650002302568650001302591650001702604650002302621650001602644650001702660650001602677650001702693650002402710650001402734650001502748650001202763650001802775650002202793651001102815653002402826653001402850653002902864653002302893653002402916653001502940700001202955700001802967700001802985700001703003773009903020856009003119852000903209655001203218IND60714869620221207095246.0220704e20210215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071486962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7360722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPuvanendran, V.10aProbiotic Carnobacterium divergens increase growth parameters and disease resistance in farmed Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae without influencing the microbiota.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAquaculture represents the fastest growing food sector and the second largest export commodity in Norway. Disease in aquaculture causes mortality and huge losses in farmed fish. Probiotic treatment of farmed fish, i.e. feeding of fish with live, beneficial microorganisms, may represent one part of a sustainable solution to these problems. Some carnobacteria of fish origin have shown promising results as probiotics for fish. In this study, two Carnobacterium divergens strains were fed to Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae through intermittent feeding with Artemia franciscana containing the bacterial strains. Cod larvae fed with the carnobacteria showed a significantly higher growth and survival during the larval rearing stage compared to the larvae fed A. franciscana with no carnobacteria (control treatment). Following the probiotic feeding period, the cod larvae were challenged with a pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio anguillarum. Cod larvae from probiotic treatment showed significantly better disease resistance compared to the control. Microbiota analysis by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing verified that enrichment of carnobacteria in the A. franciscana feed. Analysis of the whole larvae detected only minor relative levels of carnobacteria in the probiotic treated larvae, which was non-significant compared to the control larvae (p = 0.062). The probiotic treatment had no significant impact on the overall microbiota diversity or composition in the larvae during the probiotic feeding period or after the disease challenge. Despite this, significantly improved growth and survival during larval rearing and post-pathogen challenge suggest probiotic effects of C. divergens mixture on cod larval fish performance and welfare. Studies examining the mode of action should be carried out to get more insight to lead to the commercial application of C. divergens in Atlantic cod larviculture.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArtemia franciscana 3aCarnobacterium divergens 3aGadus morhua 3aVibrio anguillarum 3abacteria 3abiodiversity 3adisease resistance 3afarmed fish 3afish feeding 3afish larvae 3alarviculture 3amechanism of action 3amortality 3aprobiotics 3arearing 3aribosomal RNA 3asequence analysis 3aNorway 0aAtlantic cod larvae 0aProbiotic 0aCarnobacterium divergens 0aVibrio anguillarum 0a16S rRNA sequencing 0aMicrobiota1 aRud, I.1 aMSW, Breiland1 aArnesen, J.A.1 aAxelsson, L.0 tAquaculture.g2021 Feb. 15, v. 532 p.736072-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl59663x0044-84867nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.7360723Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245007500167300001400242520088600256592002801142650002501170650001301195650001401208650001701222653002101239653001601260653001701276653003301293773013501326856008201461852000901543655001201552IND60612589220221120141314.0180905e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061258922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcom.2016.09.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTalonen, Antti10aSystematic literature review of research on mutual insurance companies  ap. 53-65.  aCustomer-owned insurance companies (mutuals) are prominent actors in the insurance industry and have significantly increased in market share in the relatively recent past. However, the discussion related to mutuals lacks a systematic and multidisciplinary literature review providing a comprehensive overview of current scientific knowledge. The purpose for the paper is threefold. It categorises the existing research by year of publication, scientific journal, type of article, and type of insurance considered. Secondly, it identifies approaches and themes that capture the nature and content of the research on mutual insurance companies. Finally, it analyses how the literature has defined mutual insurance. In the process, the work critically evaluates the current status of the research on mutuals and sets out the implications for future research and work by practitioners.  aPublisher supplied data 3abusiness enterprises 3aindustry 3ainsurance 3amarket share 0aMutual insurance 0aCooperative 0aCo-operative 0aSystematic literature review0 tJournal of co-operative organization and management.g2016 Dec., v. 4, no. 2 p.53-65dElsevier LtdwJournal:21615x2213-297X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcom.2016.09.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02902naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245013700211300002000348500001900368520157500387592002801962650004401990650001702034650001302051650002102064650003302085650002002118650001802138700006002156700006102216700006002277773012402337856008202461852000902543655001202552IND60737996620221116201330.0210520e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073799662DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-021-06113-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaeedi, Istebreq A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1254-748X10aInvestigation of the functional network modifier loading on the stoichiometric ratio of epoxy resins and their dielectric properties  ap. 12948-12964.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aReactive molecular additives have often been employed to tailor the mechanical properties of epoxy resins. In addition, several studies have reported improved electrical properties in such systems, where the network architecture and included function groups have been modified through the use of so-called functional network modifier (FNM) molecules. The study reported here set out to investigate the effect of a glycidyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (GPOSS) FNM on the cross-linking reactions, glass transition, breakdown strength and dielectric properties of an amine-cured epoxy resin system. Since many previous studies have considered POSS to act as an inorganic filler, a key aim was to consider the impact of GPOSS addition on the stoichiometry of curing. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed significant changes in the cross-linking reactions that occur if appropriate stoichiometric compensation is not made for the additional epoxide groups present on the GPOSS. These changes, in concert with the direct effect of the GPOSS itself, influence the glass transition temperature, dielectric breakdown behaviour and dielectric response of the system. Specifically, the work shows that the inclusion of GPOSS can result in beneficial changes in electrical properties, but that these gains are easily lost if consequential changes in the matrix polymer are not appropriately counteracted. Nevertheless, if the system is appropriately optimized, materials with pronounced improvements in technologically important characteristics can be designed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acrosslinking 3aepoxides 3aglass transition 3aglass transition temperature 3asilsesquioxanes 3astoichiometry1 aChaudhary, Sunny1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2664-70831 aAndritsch, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3462-022X1 aVaughan, Alun S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0535-513X0 tJournal of materials science.g2021 Aug., v. 56, no. 22 p.12948-12964dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-021-06113-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03396naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245011400177500002200291520172500313592002802038650001202066650002102078650001702099650002502116650002502141650001902166650002502185650001302210650002202223650004002245650004302285650001302328650002402341650001702365650002102382653000802403653001002411653000802421653000702429653000702436653000802443653000702451653000902458653001502467653002902482700001502511700001802526700002102544700001802565700006102583773008202644856008302726852000902809655001202818IND60655343120221118045235.0190801e20190724xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065534312DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2019.1440112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAtageldiyeva, Kuralay K.10aApolipoprotein E genetic polymorphism influence the susceptibility to nephropathy in type 2 diabetes patients  aPre-press version  aAn association between Apolipoprotein E (Apo E) alleles and genotypes and diabetic nephropathy (DN) was suggested, but with inconsistent results. We tested the relationship between serum lipids, Apo E alleles and genotypes with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), and DN pathogenesis.Study subjects comprised 1389 normoglycemic controls, and 1422 T2DM patients, of whom 825 were normoalbuminuric (DWN), and 597 presented with nephropathy (DN).Significantly lower Apo ε2, and higher Apo ε4 allele frequencies was seen among T2DM patients than controls. Significantly higher frequency of ε3/ε4, and lower frequencies of ε3/ε3, ε2/ε3, and ε4/ε4 carriers was seen among T2DM cases. Apo ε2-carrying individuals were more frequently found in controls than in patients, while significantly higher frequency of ε4-carrying genotypes was seen in T2DM cases. Significantly higher ε2, and lower ε3 allele frequencies were noted for DN group compared to DWN group. Significantly higher frequency of ε2-containing ε2/ε3 and ε2/ε4, and lower frequencies of ε3/ε3 carriers was seen among DN cases. Apo ε3/ε3 was associated with higher total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in DN patients, and significantly higher triglyceride levels were seen in ε2/ε3-carrying DN patients. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the association of Apo ε3-containing ε3/ε3, ε2/ε3, and ε3/ε4, and Apo ε2-containing ε2/ε4 with DN, after controlling for key covariates.The results of this case-control study provide evidence that the ε2 and ε3 alleles of APOE modify lipid profile, and constitute independent risk factors of DN in type 2 diabetes. The molecular mechanisms underlying this risk is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aapolipoprotein E 3ablood lipids 3acase-control studies 3adiabetic nephropathy 3agene frequency 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenotype 3alipid composition 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aregression analysis 3arisk factors 3atriacylglycerols 0aAER 0aApo E 0aBMI 0aCI 0aDN 0aDWN 0aOR 0aT2DM 0aGenotyping 0aType 2 diabetes mellitus1 aNemr, Rita1 aEchtay, Akram1 aRacoubian, Eddie1 aSarray, Sameh1 aAlmawi, Wassim Y.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1633-97570 tGene.g2019 July 24,  p.144011-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6378x0378-11197nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2019.1440113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01961naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002300161245007100184300001800255500000900273520089900282592002801181650001401209650001301223650002101236650001801257650001901275650002101294650002401315650001101339700001801350773015001368856009601518852000901614655001201623IND60668374420221118045646.0191125e198411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066837442DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1984.03615995004800060036x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmgren, G.

The proposed procedure is as follows: React 0.2 g of soil for 10 min with 2 mL of 4M KOH. Dilute to 20 mL and neutralize with HCl to a phenolphthalein end point. Add 2 mL of 1M KF and re-titrate the suspension to the same end point with drop count additions of 0.1M HCl. Studies of the procedures' sensitivity to reagent concentration, soil/solution ratio and time are presented. Evidence is also presented to demonstrate that this method does not extract Al from crystalline clay minerals.

The antimicrobial activity of 10 honey samples of known origin and 4 propolis extracts gathered from the same beekeepers located in Transylvania, Romania, were used against certain microorganisms: Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. The study also investigated the positive interaction of propolis aqueous extracts when used with poly-floral honey against the same microorganisms. The most sensitive to the activity of honey samples was the S. aureus strain (the largest inhibition area 18 mm) for poly-floral honey and P. aeruginosa strain (17 mm) for sunflower honey, both from Alba County. P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus strains (32 mm) were sensitive to the activity of propolis extracts samples. Ciprofloxacin showed a higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus and B. cereus (30 mm). The antimicrobial effect of honey and propolis were more powerful when combined. Statistical analysis showed that both the strain type and the type of honey used influenced the diameter of the inhibition zone. In the case of propolis, no connection between propolis origin (regardless of its concentration) and the microbial activity was found but the microbial strains used influence the diameters of inhibition zones.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApis mellifera 3aBacillus cereus 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aHelianthus annuus 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantibacterial properties 3aarea 3aciprofloxacin 3adiameter 3ahoney 3amicrobial activity 3apropolis 3astatistical analysis 3aRomania 0aHoney 0aPropolis 0aAntimicrobial activity 0aPathogenic bacteria1 aGlevitzky, Mirel1 aTit, Delia Mirela1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0296-65921 aBehl, Tapan1 aHeghedűş-Mîndru, Ramona Cristina1 aZaha, Dana Carmen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4021-49891 aUrsu, Francesca1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3199-37411 aPopa, Maria1 aGlevitzky, Ioana1 aBungău, Simona0 tFood bioscience.g2021 June, v. 41 p.101014-dElsevier LtdwJournal:21610x2212-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fbio.2021.1010143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03077naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003500135040001800170100002200188245015400210300001200364506007600376520152900452592002801981506003702009650001102046650002002057650002502077650002002102650002002122650001702142650001602159650001502175650002202190650001302212650001302225650001002238700001802248700001802266700001902284700006502303700001702368773013102385856008202516852000902598655001202607IND60569857820221207143928.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056985782DNAL7 aPMC53711972pmcid7 a283513992pmid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1676-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNaumann, Johannes10aEffects of hyperthermic baths on depression, sleep and heart rate variability in patients with depressive disorder: a randomized clinical pilot trial  ap. 172.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Despite advances in the treatment of depression, one-third of depressed patients fail to respond to conventional antidepressant medication. There is a need for more effective treatments with fewer side effects. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether hyperthermic baths reduce depressive symptoms in adults with depressive disorder. METHODS: Randomized, two-arm placebo-controlled, 8-week pilot trial. Medically stable outpatients with confirmed depressive disorder (ICD-10: F32/F33) who were moderately depressed as determined by the 17-item Hamilton Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score ≥18 were randomly assigned to 2 hyperthermic baths (40 °C) per week for 4 weeks or a sham intervention with green light and follow-up after 4 weeks. Main outcome measure was the change in HAM-Dₜₒₜₐₗ ₛcₒᵣₑ from baseline (T0) to the 2-week time point (T1). RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were randomized (hyperthermic baths, n = 17; sham condition, n = 19). The intention-to-treat analysis showed a significant (P = .037) difference in the change in HAM-Dₜₒₜₐₗ ₛcₒᵣₑ with 3.14 points after 4 interventions (T1) in favour of the hyperthermic bath group compared to the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that hyperthermic baths do have generalized efficacy in depressed patients.

In addition, residual atrazine was measured in the samples of combined contamination. Results showed that the notable effects of either or both contaminants on the microbial activity and biological processes. Enzyme activity data demonstrated that the order of sensitivity to contamination was urease>invertase>catalase. BSR was strongly stimulated by atrazine/Pb at the early exposure (0–7 days for single contaminant and 7–14 days for combined contaminants). The stimulation effects on BSR were higher at low concentrations of the contamination (FR and Pb300). The combined treatments of 5FR+Pb600 inhibit BSR and NNM. Overall, the parameters associated with N cycling (urease and NNM) were more sensitive than others. Both Pb concentrations (300 and 600mg/kg) had little influence on the dissipation of high concentrations of atrazine (5FR) during the 28-day-incubation. This study has provided useful information on potential ecotoxicology effects of combined contamination of atrazine and Pb on relative microbial biological process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aatrazine 3abeta-fructofuranosidase 3acatalase 3aecotoxicology 3aenzyme activity 3aherbicidal properties 3alead 3amicrobial activity 3amicrobial contamination 3amineralization 3anitrogen 3apollution 3asoil 3asoil respiration 3aurease 0aEnzyme activity 0aSoil respiration 0aNet N mineralization 0aDissipation1 aWang, Hui1 aYang, Baoshan1 aHe, Fei0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2014 Apr., v. 102 p.93-99dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03174naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002800140245012200168300001800290500002000308520165200328592002801980596005902008650002102067650002702088650001602115650002902131650001702160650001202177650002302189650002402212650001102236650001102247650001102258650002002269650001402289650002102303700005602324700002102380700002202401700002402423700002402447773014902471856007502620852000902695655001202704IND60773527320221122220816.0220417e202205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077352732DNAL7 a10.1002/jsfa.116292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVerrillo, Mariavittoria10aValorization of lignins from energy crops and agro‐industrial byproducts as antioxidant and antibacterial materials  ap. 2885-2892.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Developing eco‐friendly antioxidant and antimicrobial substances originating from biomass residues has recently attracted considerable interest. In this study, two lignosulfonates and various oxidized water‐soluble lignins were investigated for their antioxidant properties, as assessed by ABTS, DPPH and Folin–Ciocalteu methods, and their antimicrobial activity against some bacterial strains responsible for human pathologies. RESULTS: The lignosulfonates showed the largest antiradical/antimicrobial capacity, whereas the other substrates were less effective. The observed antioxidant/antibacterial properties were positively correlated with lignin aromatic/phenolic content. The positive correlation between antiradical and antimicrobial activities suggests that lignin scavenging capacity was also involved in its antibacterial activity. A greater antimicrobial performance was generally observed against Gram‐positive bacterial strains, and it was attributed to the intrinsic larger susceptibility of Gram‐positive bacteria to lignin phenols. A significant though lesser inhibitory activity was also found against Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the dependence of lignin antioxidant/antibacterial power on its extraction method and chemical structure, as well as on the type of bacterial strains. Identifying the relationship between lignin molecular composition and its antioxidant/antibacterial features represents an advance on the potential future use of renewable and eco‐compatible lignin materials in nutraceutical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic sectors. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.  aPublisher supplied data  aPON03PE_00107_01cMinistry of Research of Italy (MIUR) 3aEscherichia coli 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aagriculture 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidants 3abiomass 3achemical structure 3adietary supplements 3aenergy 3ahumans 3alignin 3alignosulfonates 3aoxidation 3awater solubility1 aSavy, Davide1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8059-54271 aCangemi, Silvana1 aSavarese, Claudia1 aCozzolino, Vincenza1 aPiccolo, Alessandro0 tJournal of the science of food and agriculture.g2022 May, v. 102, no. 7 p.2885-2892dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.wJournal:jnl48536x0022-51427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.116293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03869naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006200146245007400208300002000282500001900302520277600321592002803097650001503125650001903140650001403159650001503173650001503188650001103203650001503214650001103229700006403240773013803304856008003442852000903522655001203531IND60701326720221120215417.0200710e20200612xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070132672DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c040372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOvalle, Vincent J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0586-222X10aImpact of Electrolyte Anions on the Adsorption of CO on Cu Electrodes  ap. 14713-14721.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons and oxygenates on Cu electrodes proceeds through surface-adsorbed CO. The adsorption and desorption of this intermediate play a key role in determining the product selectivity of this electrocatalytic process. It is therefore critical to understand the molecular factors that determine the adsorption of CO on Cu electrodes. In prior studies, it was suggested that specifically adsorbing anions of the supporting electrolyte compete with CO for surface sites at low overpotentials. However, prior infrared (IR) spectroscopy of CO adsorption on Cu electrodes did not compare the relative CO coverages in the presence of different anions and was restricted to a narrow range of electrolyte concentrations (0.1 to 0.2 M). Therefore, the impact of anions on the adsorption of CO on Cu is not fully understood to date. Herein we systematically explored the adsorption and desorption of CO on polycrystalline Cu electrodes in the presence of specifically and nonspecifically adsorbing anions (Cl–, SO₄²–, ClO₄–) at two different concentrations (10 mM and 1 M) of the corresponding sodium salts. With surface-enhanced IR absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS), we monitored the C≡O stretch band of atop-bound CO (COₐₜₒₚ) and an infrared band of the hydration shells of interfacial anions as a function of electrode potential. We found that at an electrolyte concentration of 10 mM, the adsorption and desorption of COₐₜₒₚ are virtually independent of the identity of the anions. In contrast, at an electrolyte concentration of 1 M, the COₐₜₒₚ coverage is significantly impacted by the electrolyte anions. The saturation coverages of COₐₜₒₚ are lower in the 1 M electrolytes compared with those in the 10 mM electrolytes. The magnitude and mechanism of the modulation depend on the identity of the anions. Weakly and nonspecifically adsorbing anions (SO₄²–, ClO₄–) limit the COₐₜₒₚ saturation coverage by blocking a fraction of CO adsorption sites. However, their site-blocking ability depends on the CO coverage, as evidenced by the hysteresis in the CO adsorption/desorption profiles, which likely originates from a reversible CO-induced surface reconstruction. Chloride ions, which can specifically adsorb on Cu electrodes, lower the CO coverage by modulating the CO adsorption energy. This modulation manifests itself in (1) a distinctly higher C≡O stretch frequency in the presence of this anion relative to that measured in the other electrolytes and (2) the absence of the hysteresis in the adsorption/desorption profiles. Our study highlights the intricate interplay between anions and surface-adsorbed CO at the Cu electrode/electrolyte interface.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon dioxide 3achlorides 3adesorption 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3ahysteresis 3asodium1 aWaegele, Matthias M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1186-75450 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 June 12, v. 124, no. 27 p.14713-14721dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c040373Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02440naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010100172300001400273520117700287592002801464650001101492650001401503650001001517650001901527650001401546650002701560650001701587650001401604650002001618650001201638650002201650650002501672653001401697653001401711653001101725653001101736653001601747653001601763700001901779773010301798856008401901852000901985655001201994IND60545795920221118005628.0160903e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054579592DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSurita, Sharon C.12aA multiphase analysis of partitioning and hazard index characteristics of siloxanes in biosolids  ap. 79-83.  aSiloxanes are widely used in personal care and industrial products due to their soft texture, low surface tension, thermal stability, antimicrobial and hydrophobic properties, among other characteristics. As a result, they are released to gas phase during waste decompositions and found in biogas at landfills and digester gas at wastewater treatment facilities. The objectives of this study were to investigate the release of siloxanes in aqueous and gaseous phase as well as in biosolids in a local wastewater treatment facility. The formation reactions were estimated using first order kinetics for commonly found siloxanes (L3, D3, D4, D5 and D6) during waste decomposition. Expected concentrations and the risk factors of exposure to siloxanes were evaluated based on the initial concentrations, partitioning characteristics and persistence parameter. D4 and D5 presented the highest initial gaseous phase concentrations of 5000 and 1800μg/m3 respectively. Based on first order kinetics, partition coefficients and initial concentrations, the hazards potentials were largest for D4 in both liquid phase and biosolids while D6 poses the highest risk in gaseous phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiogas 3abiosolids 3agases 3ahydrophobicity 3alandfills 3apartition coefficients 3arisk factors 3asiloxanes 3asurface tension 3atexture 3athermal stability 3awastewater treatment 0aSiloxanes 0aBiosolids 0aBiogas 0aHazard 0aDegradation 0aPersistence1 aTansel, Berrin0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2014 Apr., v. 102 p.79-83dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012400169300001600293520124300309592002801552650001001580650001701590650002201607650001601629650001101645650002401656650003301680650002201713650001601735650001901751700002001770773012401790856008101914852000901995655001202004IND50073639120221118023147.0150213e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007363912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11746-013-2377-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhodadadi, Maryam10aOptimization of Lipase-Catalyzed Interesterification of Flaxseed Oil and Tricaprylin Using Response Surface Methodology  ap. 395-403.  aThe biosynthesis of structured lipids (SL) in organic solvent media was carried out by the interesterification of flaxseed oil (FO) and tricaprylin (TC), using Novozym 435. The bioconversion yield (BY, %) of medium-long-medium type SL, including C-caprylic and Ln-linolenic acids (CLnC), La-linoleic acid (CLaC) and O-oleic acid (COC), was monitored. Response surface methodology was used to obtain significant models for the responses, on the basis of a five level, five variable central composite rotatable design. In the experimental preliminary trials significant reaction parameters, including reaction temperature (Tᵣ), TC/FO molar ratio (Mᵣ), enzyme concentration (Ec), reaction time (Rₜ) and initial water activity (aw), were considered for optimization. Significant models for CLnC, CLaC and COC were determined after regression analysis with backward elimination. The optimal conditions, generated for a maximum CLnC, CLaC and COC, were found to be 54.50–56.25 °C for Tᵣ, 6.23–6.25 mol/mol for Mᵣ, 2.68–3.13 % for Ec, 36.58–37.50 h for Rₜand 0.15–0.33 for aw. Under these optimum conditions, the BY of CLnC, CLaC and COC was predicted to be 32.48–36.67, 3.26–3.38 and 5.79–6.16 %, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacids 3abiosynthesis 3abiotransformation 3alinseed oil 3amodels 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3astructured lipids 3atemperature 3awater activity1 aKermasha, Selim0 tThe journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society.g2014 Mar., v. 91, no. 3 p.395-403dSpringer-Verlagx0003-021X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11746-013-2377-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245013700168300001400305520126700319592002801586650002201614650001501636650002501651650001601676650001501692650001601707650001001723650001701733650001001750650001701760650002801777650001301805650001001818650001001828650001601838650002201854650002101876650002101897650002501918650001701943653001501960653001401975653002201989700001902011700001602030700001702046773010302063856008402166852000902250655001202259IND60545796120221118005748.0160903e201404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054579612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jianchao12aA multi-biomarker assessment of single and combined effects of norfloxacin and sulfamethoxazole on male goldfish (Carassius auratus)  ap. 12-17.  aIn the present study, the sublethal effects of norfloxacin alone and in combination with sulfamethoxazole in goldfish (Carassius auratus) were investigated, the biomarkers including acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in brain, 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and superoxides dismutase (SOD) activities in liver, vitellogenin (Vtg) in serum and DNA damage in gonad were determined after 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of exposure. Brain AChE activity was significantly inhibited by norfloxacin (≥0.4mg/L) after 4 and 7 days and the mixtures with sulfamethoxazole (≥0.24mg/L) after 4 days of exposure, and significant concentration–response relationships were obtained. Liver EROD, GST and SOD activities were significantly increased by the individual and mixed pharmaceuticals in most cases and exhibited analogously bell-shaped concentration–response curves. Serum Vtg was increased by the highest concentration of norfloxacin and two higher concentrations of the mixtures. Higher concentrations of the test antibiotics induced significant DNA damage in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.

The sludge acute toxicity indicated by the inhibitory ratio to luminous bacteria T3 was evaluated. The influent COD was controlled at approximately 300 mg/L, and aerobic conditions were maintained in the SBR. It was found that the process of BPA biodegradation, as opposed to BPA adsorption, contributed to the formation of sludge toxicity; there was a positive relationship between sludge toxicity and influent BPA concentration, and the toxicity centralized in intracellular regions and the intersection of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in sludge flocs. Since the BPA biodegradation process dedicated to sludge toxicity, the influence of key operational parameters such as sludge retention time (SRT) and hydraulic retention time (HRT) on sludge toxicity were investigated. It was founded that sludge toxicity decreased significantly when SRT and HRT were shortened from 20 to 10 days and 12 to 8 h, respectively. The results of Pearson correlation analysis indicated that the Shannon index H of the bacterial community correlated significantly to sludge toxicity. The results from both similarity analysis and UPGMA indicated that influent quality characteristic contributes much more to bacterial community than operation parameters, and then leads to difference between blank and control sludge toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactivated sludge 3aacute toxicity 3aadsorption 3aaerobic conditions 3abacteria 3abacterial communities 3abiodegradation 3abisphenol A 3achemical oxygen demand 3awastewater1 aZhao, Jianguo1 aZhao, Jun1 aYang, Ne,1 aZhang, Fei1 aJiang, Zijian0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2014 Aug., v. 21, no. 15 p.9287-9296dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-2837-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02171naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100006500146245008800211300002000299500001900319520112600338592002801464650003001492650002101522650001601543650001101559650001301570700005901583773013801642856008001780852000901860655001201869IND60701327120210618000000.0200710e20200611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070132712DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c045982doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFeliciano, Gustavo T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5559-591910aTwo-Dimensional Nature and the Meaning of the Density of States in Redox Monolayers  ap. 14918-14927.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIt has been suggested that the transport of charge in molecular electronics and redox junctions is, at the sub-nanoscale, that is, for dimensions lower than 5 nm, fundamentally related [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys, 2020, 10.1039/D0CP01621G]. In the present work, supported on conceptual and computational methods of density functional theory, we provided additional evidence for this relationship, by showing that redox molecular structures assembled over conductive electrodes resemble, in terms of their electrochemical DOS, 2DEG structures. Owing to the fact that 2DEG structures are commonly taken as the fundamental physical model applied in the designing of field-effect transistors, an electrochemical “version” is important as a blueprint for the development of devices required in electrochemical environments. Additionally, the effect of the dielectrics of the solvent and of the counter ions over the electrochemical 2D DOS of redox molecular films was studied using hybrid computational methods. The results of computational simulation of the DOS were qualitatively compared with those obtained experimentally.  aPublisher supplied data 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectronics 3amodels 3asolvents1 aBueno, Paulo R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2827-02080 tJournal of physical chemistry.g2020 June 11, v. 124, no. 27 p.14918-14927dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23573x1932-74557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcc.0c045983Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04018naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001700094024002100111024002800132024002200160024001900182040001800201100002200219245013600241300001700377506007600394506017300470520160400643506003702247650001102284650002002295650002002315650001702335650001402352650001402366650001702380650001402397650001502411650004302426650001502469650000902484650002802493650001602521700002502537700001702562700002102579700002202600700001602622700001902638700002202657700002002679700001802699700002202717700002302739700002402762700002002786700002102806700001602827700002302843700002402866773010102890856011202991856007403103956012503177961000903302852000903311655001203320IND60006125820221214223807.0150817e201508  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6000612582DNAL7 a3188922aris7 a10113/612582hdl7 a10.1093/ajh/hpu2922doi7 aPMC45063232pmcid7 a256664682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEspeland, Mark A.10aSystolic blood pressure control among individuals with type 2 diabetes: A comparative effectiveness analysis of three interventions  ap. 995-1009.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWorks produced by employees of the U.S. Government as part of their official duties are not copyrighted within the U.S. The content of this document is not copyrighted.  aBACKGROUND The relative effectiveness of 3 approaches to blood pressure control—(i) an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) focused on weight loss, (ii) frequent goal-based monitoring of blood pressure with pharmacological management, and (iii) education and support—has not been established among overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes who are appropriate for each intervention. METHODS Participants from the Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) cohorts who met criteria for both clinical trials were identified. The proportions of these individuals with systolic blood pressure (SBP) <140 mm Hg from annual standardized assessments over time were compared with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS Across 4 years among 480 Look AHEAD and 1,129 ACCORD participants with baseline SBPs between 130 and 159 mm Hg, ILI (OR = 1.46; 95% CI = [1.18–1.81]) and frequent goal-based monitoring with pharmacotherapy (OR = 1.51; 95% CI = [1.16–1.97]) yielded higher rates of blood pressure control compared to education and support. The intensive behavioral-based intervention may have been more effective among individuals with body mass index >30 kg/m2, while frequent goal-based monitoring with medication management may be more effective among individuals with lower body mass index (interaction P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS Among overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes, both ILI and frequent goal-based monitoring with pharmacological management can be successful strategies for blood pressure control.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadults 3abody mass index 3aclinical trials 3adrug therapy 3aeducation 3aequations 3ahypertension 3alifestyle 3amonitoring 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3aoverweight 3arisk 3asystolic blood pressure 3aweight loss1 aProbstfield, Jeffery1 aHire, Donald1 aRedmon, J.

Microbial inoculants are strongly emerging as potential alternatives to agrochemicals and offer an eco‐friendly fertilization strategy to reduce our dependence on synthetic chemical fertilizers. Effects of a N‐fixing strain Pseudomonas protegens CHA0‐ΔretS‐nif on ginger plant growth, yield, and nutrient uptake, and on earthworm biomass and the microbial community were investigated in glasshouse fields in Shandong Province, northern China. RESULTS: Application of CHA0‐ΔretS‐nif could promote ginger plant development, and significantly increased rhizome yields, by 12.93% and 7.09%, respectively, when compared to uninoculated plants and plants treated with the wild‐type bacterial strain. Inoculation of CHA0‐ΔretS‐nif had little impact on plant phosphorus (P) acquisition, whereas it was associated with enhanced N and potassium (K) acquisition by ginger plants. Moreover, inoculation of CHA0‐ΔretS‐nif had positive effects on the bacteria population size and the number of earthworms in the rhizosphere. Similar enhanced performances were also found in CHA0‐ΔretS‐nif‐inoculated ginger plants even when the N‐fertilizer application rate was reduced by 15%. A chemical N input of 573.8 kg ha⁻¹ with a ginger rhizome yield of 1.31 × 10⁵ kg ha⁻¹ was feasible. CONCLUSIONS: The combined application of CHA0‐ΔretS‐nif and a reduced level of N‐fertilizers can be employed in glasshouse ginger production for the purpose of achieving high yields while at the same time reducing the inorganic‐N pollution from traditional farming practices. © 2021 The Authors.

Using zebrafish (Danio rerio), this study is the first to demonstrate that hypoxia causes endocrine disruption by simultaneously acting on multiple targets along the brain–pituitary–gonadal (BPG)–liver axis in fish. Alterations in the expression of key genes associated with reproductive endocrine pathways in the brain (sGnRH), pituitary (FSHβ and LHβ), gonads (FSH-R, LH-R, HMGR, StAR, CYP19A, CYP11A, CYP11β and 20β-HSD), and liver were correlated with significant reductions of estradiol in females and testosterone in males. Hypoxia also induced sex-specific and tissue-specific changes in the expression of estrogen, androgen, and membrane progestin receptors along the BPG axis, suggesting disruption of the feedback and synchronization of hormone signals. Furthermore, the hypoxia-induced upregulation of hepatic sex hormone-binding globulin suggests an increase in hormone transport and reduced bioavailability in blood, while upregulation of hepatic CYP3A65 and CYP1A in females suggests an increase in estrogen biotransformation and clearance. Given that the regulation of reproductive hormones and the BPG–liver axis are highly conserved, this study provides new insights into the hypoxia-induced endocrine disrupting mechanisms and reproductive impairment in other vertebrates.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDanio rerio 3abioavailability 3abiotransformation 3ablood 3abrain 3aestradiol 3afemales 3afish 3agenes 3agonadotropin-releasing hormone 3agonads 3ahypoxia 3aliver 3amales 3areceptors 3asex hormone-binding globulin 3atestosterone 0aHypoxia 0aReproduction 0aEndocrine disruption 0aBPG–liver axis1 aYu, Richard M.K.1 aMurphy, Margaret B.1 aLau, Karen1 aWu, Rudolf S.S.0 tEcotoxicology and environmental safety.g2014 Apr., v. 102 p.70-78dElsevier Inc.x0147-65137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2014.01.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03270naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001100151245013800162300001800300520171900318592002802037650001602065650001202081650001302093650000902106650001202115650001502127650001902142650002602161650002102187650001102208650000902219650002402228650001902252650001302271650001102284651001302295653002402308653002202332653001902354653001202373653001902385653001802404653001502422653001202437700001702449700003102466773014802497856008602645852000902731655001202740IND60753888720221118071941.0211020e20211216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075388872DNAL7 a10.1080/00103624.2021.19664392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aImran,10aManagement of Nano-black Carbon, Phosphorous and Bio Fertilizer Improve Soil Organic Carbon and Ensilage Biomass of Soybean and Maize  ap. 2837-2851.  aField experiments were conducted for two-consecutive summer seasons of 2016–17 and 2017–18 at Agriculture Research Institute Mingora Swat, Pakistan, on soybean and maize under soybean-wheat (S-W) and maize-wheat (M-W) cropping systems. Three peach sources were used as a residues, its compost and its Nano-black carbon, three phosphorus-rates (50, 75 and 100 kg-ha⁻¹) and two beneficial microbes (PSB and Trichoderma) were tested for improvement of ensilage biomass of maize and soybean, and soil organic-carbon (SOC) under both cropping systems. The results revealed that all the treated plots produced highest SOC compared to the control plots under soybean and maize cropping system. Improved SOC was noted with the OS amendment of Nano-black carbon in both cropping systems. Whereas minimum SOC was noted in soybean experimentation with compost while in maize plot reduced SOC was noted with peach residues incorporation. Beneficial microbes had a significant effect on SOC and improved SOC was recorded with soil application Trichoderma as compared to seed inoculation with PSB in soybean and maize plots. Phosphorus levels had also significant effect on SOC and highest SOC was recorded at 100 kg P ha⁻¹ followed by 75 kg P ha⁻¹ whereas the smallest SOC was recorded with 50 kg P ha⁻¹. Ensilage highest biomass of the both crops was noted with peach Nano-black carbon, followed by compost and reduced biomass were noted with peach residues application. Among the P-rate, increased ensilage biomass was recorded with 100 kg P ha⁻¹application while in case of beneficial microbes application, soil application of Trichoderma produced highest biomass as compared to seed inoculation with PSB.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTrichoderma 3abiomass 3acomposts 3acorn 3apeaches 3aphosphorus 3aplant analysis 3aresearch institutions 3aseed inoculation 3asilage 3asoil 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil treatment 3asoybeans 3asummer 3aPakistan 0aBeneficial microbes 0anano-black carbon 0acarbon sources 0acompost 0apeach residues 0aprofitability 0aseed yield 0asoybean1 aAmānullāh,1 aAl Tawaha, Abdel Rahman M.0 tCommunications in soil science and plant analysis.g2021 Dec. 16, v. 52, no. 22 p.2837-2851dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl1842x1532-24167nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00103624.2021.19664393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02617naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100002000161245005400181300001400235500000900249520145000258592002801708650002401736650001301760650002001773650002401793650001901817650001301836650001301849650001301862650001401875650002301889650000901912650000901921700001901930700001901949773014601968856009602114852000902210655001202219IND60668375220221118045610.0191125e197401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066837522DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1974.03615995003800010030x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArdakani, M. S.10aOxidation of Ammonium to Nitrate in a Soil Column  ap. 96-99.  aepub  aA mathematical model based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics for oxidation of ammonium to nitrate during downward flow in a column of soil mixed with sand has been tested. First the column was perfused with nitrite to stimulate the growth of nitrite oxidizing microorganisms in order to decrease the concentration of nitrite at any time in the column during subsequent perfusion with ammonium. The nitrite oxidizers multiplied in a quasilogistic fashion to nearly maximal numbers, exceeding ammonium oxidizers by at least a factor of 10². After a population density of 10³/cm³ was reached for NO₂⁻ oxidizers, the column was perfused with ammonium solution; in a steady state the ammonium concentration decreased with depth (proportional to time of flow) in accord with Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The rate constants for oxidation of NH₄⁺ were proportional to the numbers of ammonium oxidizing microorganisms extant at any given time of observation; these numbers increased exponentially at first but leveled off after about 3 weeks of continuous perfusion of the column. As expected, the decline of ammonium concentration with depth during solution flow just equalled the appearance of nitrate with very low concentrations of nitrite in the steady state. From the data the normalized rate constant is 4.5 × 10⁻³ ppm cm³/hour per microbe at room temperature, about five times greater than the corresponding figure for nitrite oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aammonium 3aenzyme kinetics 3amathematical models 3amicroorganisms 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aoxidants 3aoxidation 3apopulation density 3asand 3asoil1 aRehbock, J.

The loading and release behavior of ibuprofen on the GPNPs were investigated. The GPNPs exhibited not only high loading but also controlled release behavior. The cytotoxicity of the GPNPs was evaluated by incubating with HEK293T cell lines and they were shown to be of low cytotoxicity.

Various species of Ribes, Pedicularis, and Castilleja are alternate hosts on which C. ribicola forms its uredinial and telial states during the mid-summer to fall. In an effort to mitigate the damage caused by white pine blister rust, the planting of ornamental species of Ribes, such as R. occidentalis, is prohibited in 14 states. Indiana currently has no restrictions on the planting of Ribes spp. Since 2010, a Cronartium sp. has been observed producing uredinia and telia on R. odoratum ‘Crandall’ H.L. Wendl. leaves in an urban environment in West Lafayette, Indiana. Symptoms include yellow-orange lesions on the leaf upper surface with uredinia on the underside. These persist from late summer until leaf drop. Telia were collected in 2011 to establish the identity of the causal agent using morphological and molecular analyses. Morphological comparisons between this specimen and other Cronartium species were made using Arthur (2). Filiform telial columns ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 mm in length. Teliospores were cylindrical to sub-ventricose, truncate on either end with one end generally tapering more than the other, and measured 9.0 to 18.6 × 37.2 to 60.0 μm (average 11.9 × 47.4 μm from 30 spores across 4 leaves). These teliospore measurements overlap those of C. ribicola and C. occidentale, but are more consistent with C. ribicola, in which the spores are wider and longer (8 to 12 × 30 to 60 μm) than in C. occidentale (9 to 10 × 27 to 56 μm). For molecular analyses, two nuclear ribosomal loci were sequenced: the internal transcribed spacer regions 1, 2, and 5.8S (ITS) and the 5′ end of the large subunit (28S) (1). The ITS sequence was 665 bp long (KF387533) and the 28S was 892 bp (KC876675). These sequences were queried to GenBank using a BLASTn search. The 28S shared 99% identity (891/892 bp) and the ITS shared 100% identity (663/663 bp) to other published C. ribicola sequences with no close matches to any other species with either locus. Both morphological and molecular methods indicate this species to be C ribicola, making this a first report of white pine blister rust on R. odoratum in Indiana. This fungus has been observed previously on R. odoratum in the northeastern United States (Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and New Hampshire), the Rockies (Colorado), northwestern United States (Washington), and Canada (3). In Indiana, C. ribicola has also been reported on R. cysnobati. There are no other reports of this fungus on any other host within the state. However, the aecial host, Pinus strobus, does grow within the state, and within West Lafayette. To our knowledge, WPBR has only been observed (not reported) once in Indiana in the past 30 years (Paul Pecknold, personal communication). Further monitoring of C. ribicola hosts is needed in Indiana to determine the extent of the disease. The specimen has been vouchered in the Arthur Herbarium (PUR N6734).References: (1) M. C. Aime.

E.12aAninterval fuzzy model for magnetic monitoring: estimation of a pollution index  ap. 1477-1485.  aIn this contribution, a methodology is reported in order to build an interval fuzzy model for the pollution index PLI (a composite index using relevant heavy metal concentration) with magnetic parameters as input variables. In general, modelling based on fuzzy set theory is designed to mimic how the human brain tends to classify imprecise information or data. The âinterval fuzzy modelâ reported here, based on fuzzy logic and arithmetic of fuzzy numbers, calculates an âestimation intervalâ and seems to be an adequate mathematical tool for this nonlinear problem. For this model, fuzzy c-means clustering is used to partition data, hence the membership functions and rules are built. In addition, interval arithmetic is used to obtain the fuzzy intervals. The studied sets are different examples of pollution by different anthropogenic sources, in two different study areas: (a) soil samples collected in Antarctica and (b) road-deposited sediments collected in Argentina. The datasets comprise magnetic and chemical variables, and for both cases, relevant variables were selected: magnetic concentration-dependent variables, magnetic features-dependent variables and one chemical variable. The model output gives an estimation interval; its width depends on the data density, for the measured values. The results show not only satisfactory agreement between the estimation interval and data, but also provide valued information from the rules analysis that allows understanding the magnetic behaviour of the studied variables under different conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3adata collection 3afuzzy logic 3aheavy metals 3amonitoring 3apollution 3asediments 3asoil sampling 3aArgentina1 aChaparro, Marcos A.

Wats.), is one of the industrially important essential oils. Since the content and composition of essential oils is known to depend on extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including climate and season of harvest, knowledge of the optimal harvesting time is necessary for production of quality essential oil. Hence, experiments were conducted to study the variation in the essential oil composition of palmarosa harvested twelve times at short intervals during a six month period from October 2012 to March 2013. Chemical profiling of the essential oils was attempted by GC/GC–MS analysis, which revealed the presence of eleven compounds in the essential oil. The compounds are myrcene, cis-β-ocimene, trans-β-ocimene, linalool, neral, geraniol, geranial, geranylacetate, caryophyllene, geranyl isobuterate, and farnesol. A significant increase in the geraniol content and a significant decrease in the geranylacetate were noticed with passage of time.Maximum and minimum temperatures exhibited significant positive correlation with geraniol and showed significant negative relation with geranylacetate. Geraniol and geranylacetate in the essential oil were inversely related.Ideal harvesting time is around 70–80 days taking in to consideration of oil content, oil yield/plant and the content of geraniol and geranylacetate in the essential oil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCymbopogon 3aclimate 3aessential oils 3afarnesol 3ageranial 3ageraniol 3aharvest date 3alinalool 3alipid content 3amyrcene 3aneral 3aoils 3atemperature 0aPalmarosa 0aGeraniol 0aGeranylacetate 0aRelative humidity1 aSrinivas, K.V.N.S.1 aKumar, J.

Historic remote-sensing imagery (acquired in 1979, 1989, 2000, 2006, and 2013) was processed by the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method to obtain LULC data, and a long-term hydrologic impact assessment (L-THIA) model was applied to evaluate the long-term effects of LULC changes on surface run-off. The results show the urbanized area in Dongguan has increased more than 52% from 1979 to 2013 and the percentages of annual surface run-off depth and annual surface run-off coefficient are 58% and 5.83%, respectively. The increase in annual surface run-off is related to urbanization, and the centre area of the city has experienced the largest increase in annual surface run-off. The 32 towns’ local indicators of spatial association show centre towns are hot spots of increases in annual surface run-off in Dongguan city.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahydrologic models 3aland cover 3aland use 3along term effects 3aremote sensing 3ariver deltas 3arivers 3arunoff 3asupport vector machines 3atowns 3aurbanization1 aChen, Yangbo1 aZhou, Jinhui0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 36, no. 21 p.5336-5352dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10948343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001300146245007200159300001600231520204100247592002802288650001202316650001502328650001802343650001602361650002102377650001202398650001902410650001702429650001202446650003402458650002602492650002002518650003102538650001402569650001602583650001402599650001202613650002002625700001302645700001302658700001302671773012702684856008102811852000902892655001202901IND60764786320221120191758.0220904e20190927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076478632DNAL7 a10.17221/145/2018-vetmed2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, H.,10aHypoglycaemic crisis induced by non-islet cell tumours in two dogs  ap. 407-416.  aTwo dogs were admitted for the diagnosis and treatment of neoplasia (a hepatic and a mammary tumour, respectively), lethargy, quadriparesis and abnormal mentation with hypoglycaemia. The blood analyses showed severe hypoglycaemia (1.32 and 1.60 mmol/l, respectively). Although prompt treatment, including intravenous administration of dextrose, was initiated, the blood glucose concentrations were not restored to a normal range. After the diagnostic procedures, no aetiology other than the hepatic tumour identified by the abdominal radiography and ultrasonography, and a mammary tumour that might have caused the hypoglycaemia, were identified. Because there was a high suspicion of non-islet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia as a paraneoplastic syndrome, the dogs underwent a hepatic lobectomy and total mastectomy with an ovariohysterectomy, respectively. Within 12 hours after surgery, the blood glucose concentrations of both cases had normalised, even without the administration of dextrose. The histopathological examinations identified a hepatocellular adenoma and a mammary carcinoma, respectively. The endocrine analysis of the serum at admission revealed low serum insulin concentrations (&lt; 1.44 pmol/l) and high serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor 2 in both dogs. Therefore, the diagnosis in both dogs was confirmed to be non-islet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia. Both dogs remained alive without the recurrence of hypoglycaemia 24 months later. Previously, the administration of intravenous dextrose has been considered as the initial treatment in dogs with hypoglycaemia; however, this can temporarily ameliorate the clinical signs related to the non-islet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia and help the anaesthesia for the surgical tumour resection as an emergency. Therefore, the definitive treatment of non-islet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia might be rapid surgical intervention, which can be associated with good prognosis in dogs with severe non-islet cell tumour-induced hypoglycaemia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenoma 3aanesthesia 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abreast neoplasms 3aglucose 3ahistopathology 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3ainsulin-like growth factor II 3aintravenous injection 3aliver neoplasms 3amammary neoplasms (animal) 3aprognosis 3aradiography 3aresection 3aspaying 3aultrasonography1 aKang, JH1 aKang, BT1 aYang, MP0 tVeterinární medicína.g, v. 64, no. 9 p.407-416dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21422x0375-84277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/145/2018-vetmed3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03590naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245015400166300001600320520214800336592002802484650002502512650002702537650002802564650001802592650001302610650002102623650002502644650001202669650001302681650001302694650001402707650001502721650002602736650003802762651001502800700002602815700001802841700001402859700001602873700002302889773012902912856008203041852000903123655001203132IND60549198020221122133705.0160907e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054919802DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-04-13-0459-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAvenot, H. F.10aSensitivities of Baseline Isolates and Boscalid-Resistant Mutants of Alternaria alternata from Pistachio to Fluopyram, Penthiopyrad, and Fluxapyroxad  ap. 197-205.  aResistance of Alternaria alternata to boscalid, the first succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicide labeled on pistachio, has become a common occurrence in California pistachio orchards and affects the performance of this fungicide. In this study, we established the baseline sensitivities of A. alternata to the new SDHIs fluopyram, fluxapyroxad, and penthiopyrad and assessed their cross resistance patterns with boscalid. Examination of the effective fungicide concentration that inhibits mycelial growth to 50% relative to the control (EC₅₀) for 50 baseline isolates revealed that the majority were sensitive to boscalid, penthiopyrad, fluopyram, and fluxapyroxad. Analysis of EC₅₀ values for boscalid for 117 A. alternata isolates originating from boscalid-exposed orchards showed that 44, 3, 1, and 69 isolates had sensitive, reduced sensitivity, moderately resistant, and highly resistant boscalid phenotypes, respectively. Molecular investigation of the occurrence of known SDH mutations showed that, among the 69 isolates highly resistant to boscalid, 44, 2, 14, and 1 isolates possessed the mutations leading to the H277Y, H277R, H134R, and H133R amino acid substitutions in AaSDHB, AaSDHB, AaSDHC, and AaSDHD subunits, respectively. Some SDHB or SDHC mutants displayed highly sensitive, sensitive, or reduced sensitivity phenotypes toward penthiopyrad or fluxapyroxad, whereas other had low, moderate, or high levels of resistance to these fungicides. In contrast, all the SDHB mutants were sensitive to fluopyram, while 10, 5, and 1 SDHC mutants had sensitive, reduced sensitivity, and moderately resistant fluopyram phenotypes, respectively. The SDHD mutant had reduced sensitivity to fluopyram and penthiopyrad but was highly resistant to fluxapyroxad. The discrepancies of cross-resistance patterns between SDHIs suggest that their binding sites in complex II may differ slightly and that additional mechanisms of resistance to these compounds are likely involved. Ultimately, the findings of this study should lead to the rational and sustained deployment of new SDHIs in Alternaria late blight spray programs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlternaria alternata 3aPhytophthora infestans 3aamino acid substitution 3abinding sites 3aboscalid 3across resistance 3afungicide resistance 3amutants 3amycelium 3aorchards 3aphenotype 3apistachios 3aresistance mechanisms 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aCalifornia1 avan den Biggelaar, H.1 aMorgan, D.

This study explores two supervised classification methods to identify MPB-caused mortality (red attack) in heterogeneous montane forests of the Colorado Front Range using 1 m-resolution 2011 imagery of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP): maximum likelihood using the red, green, and blue bands, and the red-green index (RGI), and a thresholding technique using the RGI. Two variations of the RGI threshold method were also explored: the addition of a green-band threshold and the incorporation of a focal analysis. Evaluation pixels were used to assess the accuracy of the classification methods. The maximum likelihood (97 Percentage Correctly Classified (PCC); 11% error of commission for red attack) and RGI threshold (85 PCC; 46% error of commission for red attack) classification methods overestimated the red attack. The RGI and green band threshold classification reduced the error of commission (5%) and had high overall accuracy (97 PCC). In a comparison of classification methods across tree-density sites, we found the maximum likelihood classification had a very high accuracy in the high-density site (95 PCC), but substantially lower accuracy in the low-density site (85 PCC) due to the presence of more visible cover types. The RGI threshold classification with the green band constraint produced more consistent PCCs across tree densities: high (93.7 PCC), moderate (95.2 PCC), and low (92.0 PCC). Our results indicate forest structure may affect the classification accuracy and should be considered when selecting a classification method for a landscape.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDendroctonus ponderosae 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aPinus ponderosa 3alandscapes 3amontane forests 3amortality 3aremote sensing 3atree mortality 3atrees 3aColorado1 aVeblen, Thomas T.1 aLeyk, Stefan1 aWessman, Carol A.0 tInternational journal of remote sensing.g2015 Nov. 2, v. 36, no. 21 p.5353-5372dTaylor & Francisx1366-59017nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2015.10953693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02824naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245013500167300001600302520151500318592002801833650001501861650001301876650001501889650001401904650001001918650001101928650001401939650000901953650002201962650001901984650001602003650001902019700001702038700002002055700002002075700002102095700001802116773011002134852000902244856008102253930003302334946001102367655001202378IND60438691520221122105818.0151023e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043869152DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-006-0301-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaleotti, Paolo10aEffects of female mating status on copulation behaviour and sperm expenditure in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius italicus  ap. 711-718.  aSperm competition models predict that males should adjust their sperm expenditure according to the risk and/or intensity of sperm competition. In this paper, we analysed copulatory behaviour of both sexes and sperm expenditure in relation to female mating status (virgin or mated) in the freshwater crayfish Austropotamobius italicus, a species where males have been reported to feed on and remove sperm laid by other males. The same females were allowed to be inseminated sequentially by two males, and we compared the sexual behaviours of partners between the first (virgin females) and the second mating (mated females). We found that female resistance did not differ between the first and the second mating, nor males refused or took more time to mount a mated female. However, when mating with a mated female, males reached an effective copulation position significantly later. This occurred because second-mating males removed, by eating, all or most spermatophores previously deposited by first males. As removal was often incomplete, this resulted in a larger amount of sperm being deposited on female ventral parts after the second mating, although second males did not allocate more sperm to mated females than first males did. Thus, the peculiar mode of sperm competition, where males remove previously deposited sperm, and the consequent predictable strong last male prevalence in paternity likely led to the observed lack of adjustment of sperm expenditure to female mating status in this species.  aPublisher supplied data 3acopulation 3acrayfish 3afreshwater 3aingestion 3amales 3amodels 3apaternity 3arisk 3asperm competition 3aspermatophores 3aspermatozoa 3avirgin females1 aPupin, Fabio1 aRubolini, Diego1 aSacchi, Roberto1 aNardi, Pietro A.1 aFasola, Mauro0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2007 Mar., v. 61, no. 5 p.711-718dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-006-0301-23Available from publisher's site  a20070304b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03253naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001800142245016200160300001800322520170900340592002802049650001502077650001102092650001402103650002302117650001302140650001502153650001502168650003402183650002202217650001602239650001302255650002402268650001502292650002202307650001502329700001302344700001702357700002002374700001702394700005602411700005602467700001602523773014702539856007602686852000902762655001202771IND60634987920221119182935.0190327e20190306xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063498792DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b001542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Zhongke10aUltrathin Black Phosphorus-on-Nitrogen Doped Graphene for Efficient Overall Water Splitting: Dual Modulation Roles of Directional Interfacial Charge Transfer  ap. 4972-4979.  aFew-layered exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) has attracted surging interest for electronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. As compared to excellent progress in electronic and optoelectronic applications, very few reports are available for electrocatalysis by metal-free EBPs. Herein, we couple solution-processable ultrathin EBP nanosheets with higher Fermi level of N-doped graphene (NG) into a new metal-free 2D/2D heterostructure (EBP@NG) with well-designed interfaces and unique electronic configuration, as efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts toward hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) for overall water splitting in alkaline media. By rational interface engineering, the synergy of EBP and NG is fully exploited, which not only improves the stability of EBP, but also effectively modulates electronic structures of each component to boost their intrinsic activities. Specifically, due to the lower Fermi level of EBP relative to NG, their electronic interaction induces directional interfacial electron transfer, which not only enriches the electron density over EBP and optimizes H adsorption/desorption to promote HER, but also introduces abundant positively charged carbon sites on NG and provides favorable formation of key OER intermediates (OOH*) to improve OER energetics. Thus, despite that pure EBP or NG alone has poor or negligible activity, EBP@NG achieves remarkably enhanced bifunctional HER/OER activities, along with an excellent durability. This endows an optimized electrolyzer using EBP@NG as anode and cathode with a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm–², which is smaller than that of the costly integrated Pt/C@RuO₂ couple (1.60 V).  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aanodes 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acathodes 3adesorption 3adurability 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectron transfer 3aelectronics 3agraphene 3ahydrogen production 3ananosheets 3aoxygen production 3aphosphorus1 aLi, Jing1 aYang, Meijia1 aFang, Zhengsong1 aJian, Junhua1 aYu, Dingshan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2913-24321 aChen, Xudong1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9499-54211 aDai, Liming0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Mar. 06, v. 141, no. 12 p.4972-4979dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b001543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04495naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100001500188245015800203300001200361506007600373520243200449592002802881596006202909596005202971506003703023650001903060650002903079650002603108650001603134650002303150650001703173650001103190650001203201650002303213650001303236650001203249650001503261650001303276650002603289650002603315650001603341650001303357650002703370650001703397650002903414650002903443650001103472700002003483700001503503700001703518700002203535700001803557700002103575700001903596700001903615773012003634856008203754852000903836655001203845IND60597855920221207093116.0191213e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059785592DNAL7 a299837432pmid7 aPMC60202112pmcid7 a10.1186/s13068-018-1176-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshii, Jun12aA pyruvate carbon flux tugging strategy for increasing 2,3-butanediol production and reducing ethanol subgeneration in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 180.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a promising host cell for producing a wide range of chemicals. However, attempts to metabolically engineer Crabtree-positive S. cerevisiae invariably face a common issue: how to reduce dominant ethanol production. Here, we propose a yeast metabolic engineering strategy for decreasing ethanol subgeneration involving tugging the carbon flux at an important hub branching point (e.g., pyruvate). Tugging flux at a central glycolytic overflow metabolism point arising from high glycolytic activity may substantially increase higher alcohol production in S. cerevisiae. We validated this possibility by testing 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO) production, which is routed via pyruvate as the important hub compound. RESULTS: By searching for high-activity acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzymes that catalyze the important first-step reaction in 2,3-BDO biosynthesis, and tuning several fermentation conditions, we demonstrated that a stronger pyruvate pulling effect (tugging of pyruvate carbon flux) is very effective for increasing 2,3-BDO production and reducing ethanol subgeneration by S. cerevisiae. To further confirm the validity of the pyruvate carbon flux tugging strategy, we constructed an evolved pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC)-deficient yeast (PDCΔ) strain that lacked three isozymes of PDC. In parallel with re-sequencing to identify genomic mutations, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis of intermediate metabolites revealed significant accumulation of pyruvate and NADH in the evolved PDCΔ strain. Harnessing the high-activity ALS and additional downstream enzymes in the evolved PDCΔ strain resulted in a high yield of 2,3-BDO (a maximum of 0.41 g g⁻¹ glucose consumed) and no ethanol subgeneration, thereby confirming the utility of our strategy. Using this engineered strain, we demonstrated a high 2,3-BDO titer (81.0 g L⁻¹) in a fed-batch fermentation using a high concentration of glucose as the sole carbon source. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the pyruvate carbon flux tugging strategy is very effective for increasing 2,3-BDO production and decreasing ethanol subgeneration in Crabtree-positive S. cerevisiae. High activity of the common first-step enzyme for the conversion of pyruvate, which links to both the TCA cycle and amino acid biosynthesis, is likely important for the production of various chemicals by S. cerevisiae.  aPublisher supplied data  a15K06579cJapan Society for the Promotion of Science (JP)  aJPMJMI17EJcJapan Science and Technology Agency0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aacetolactate synthase 3aamino acids 3abatch fermentation 3abiosynthesis 3acarbon 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3agenomics 3aglucose 3aglycolysis 3aisozymes 3aliquid chromatography 3ametabolic engineering 3ametabolites 3amutation 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3apyruvic acid 3atandem mass spectrometry 3atricarboxylic acid cycle 3ayeasts1 aMorita, Keisuke1 aIda, Kengo1 aKato, Hiroko1 aKinoshita, Shohei1 aHataya, Shoko1 aShimizu, Hiroshi1 aKondo, Akihiko1 aMatsuda, Fumio0 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2018 Dec., v. 11, no. 1 p.180-180dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-018-1176-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245011300163520140500276592002801681650003501709650002501744650001701769650001701786650001001803650001501813650002101828650002001849650001401869650002401883650001901907650002801926650002301954700002101977773012701998856007902125852000902204655001202213IND60754147320221120034811.0211023e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075414732DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox101016082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Qinhong 14aThe Role of RBC Oxidative Stress in Sickle Cell Disease: From the Molecular Basis to Pathologic Implications  aSickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited monogenic disorder and the most common severe hemoglobinopathy in the world. SCD is characterized by a point mutation in the β-globin gene, which results in hemoglobin (Hb) S production, leading to a variety of mechanistic and phenotypic changes within the sickle red blood cell (RBC). In SCD, the sickle RBCs are the root cause of the disease and they are a primary source of oxidative stress since sickle RBC redox state is compromised due to an imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants. This imbalance in redox state is a result of a continuous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the sickle RBC caused by the constant endogenous Hb autoxidation and NADPH oxidase activation, as well as by a deficiency in the antioxidant defense system. Accumulation of non-neutralized ROS within the sickle RBCs affects RBC membrane structure and function, leading to membrane integrity deficiency, low deformability, phosphatidylserine exposure, and release of micro-vesicles. These oxidative stress-associated RBC phenotypic modifications consequently evoke a myriad of physiological changes involved in multi-system manifestations. Thus, RBC oxidative stress in SCD can ultimately instigate major processes involved in organ damage. The critical role of the sickle RBC ROS production and its regulation in SCD pathophysiology are discussed here.  aPublisher supplied data 3aNAD(P)H oxidase (H2O2-forming) 3aantioxidant activity 3aautoxidation 3aerythrocytes 3agenes 3ahemoglobin 3aoxidative stress 3apathophysiology 3aphenotype 3aphosphatidylserines 3apoint mutation 3areactive oxygen species 3asickle cell anemia1 aZennadi, Rahima 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101016083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03292naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245009400187300001800281520137700299592002801676650002001704650001401724650002001738650001301758650002201771650001901793650001401812650001001826650001901836650001101855650000901866650001401875650000901889650002001898650001101918650001201929650004001941650004301981650004302024650005502067650005702122650001102179650002402190650001802214650001402232650002002246650001102266650004102277650004002318650004002358651001002398651001002408700001802418700002602436773013502462856004802597852000902645655001202654IND50067495020221118111250.0130629e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006749502DNAL7 a233291282pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-012-1390-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuffino, Barbara10aEnvironmental–sanitary risk analysis procedure applied to artificial turf sports fields  ap. 4980-4992.  aOwing to the extensive use of artificial turfs worldwide, over the past 10 years there has been much discussion about the possible health and environmental problems originating from styrene-butadiene recycled rubber. In this paper, the authors performed a Tier 2 environmental-sanitary risk analysis on five artificial turf sports fields located in the city of Turin (Italy) with the aid of RISC4 software. Two receptors (adult player and child player) and three routes of exposure (direct contact with crumb rubber, contact with rainwater soaking the rubber mat, inhalation of dusts and gases from the artificial turf fields) were considered in the conceptual model. For all the fields and for all the routes, the cumulative carcinogenic risk proved to be lower than 10(-6) and the cumulative non-carcinogenic risk lower than 1. The outdoor inhalation of dusts and gases was the main route of exposure for both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic substances. The results given by the inhalation pathway were compared with those of a risk assessment carried out on citizens breathing gases and dusts from traffic emissions every day in Turin. For both classes of substances and for both receptors, the inhalation of atmospheric dusts and gases from vehicular traffic gave risk values of one order of magnitude higher than those due to playing soccer on an artificial field.  aPublisher supplied data 3aathletic fields 3abreathing 3acarcinogenicity 3achildren 3acomputer software 3adirect contact 3aemissions 3agases 3alawns and turf 3amodels 3arain 3areceptors 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arubber 3atraffic 2aBenzenexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aButadienesxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aElastomersxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aEnvironmental Exposurexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aHumans 2aModels, Theoretical 2aParticle Size 2aRecycling 2aRisk Assessment 2aSoccer 2aStyrenesxadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aToluenexadverse effectsxanalysis. 2aXylenesxadverse effectsxanalysis. 3aItaly 0aItaly1 aFiore, Silvia1 aZanetti, Maria Chiara0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2013 July, v. 20, no. 7 p.4980-4992dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-012-1390-2  aDNAL 7aarticle03226naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001500148245015200163300001600315520170200331592002802033650002102061650001902082650001602101650001102117650001002128650002002138650002202158650002002180650001202200650001402212650001902226650003302245650002402278650001302302650002802315650001402343650002502357650004302382650001802425650001202443700001602455700001602471700001602487773011102503856008402614961001302698852000902711655001202720IND60549198320221120083122.0160907e201402  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054919832DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-05-13-0495-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSikdar, P.10aDevelopment of PCR Assays for Diagnosis and Detection of the Pathogens Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis and Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens in Apple Fruit  ap. 241-246.  aSpeck rot caused by Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis and Sphaeropsis rot caused by Sphaeropsis pyriputrescens are two recently reported postharvest diseases of apple. Infection by these two pathogens occurs in the orchard but remains latent before harvest. Symptoms develop after harvest and are similar to those of gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea. Accurate diagnosis of these diseases is important during the fruit inspection process, particularly in the instance of fruit destined for export. Early near-harvest detection of latent infections in apple fruit is an important step to implement relevant pre- and postharvest measures for disease control. The aim of this study was to develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for diagnosis and early detection of latent infections of apple fruit by P. washingtonensis and S. pyriputrescens. Species-specific primers based on the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region were designed for use in PCR assays. Conventional and real-time PCR assays were developed and validated using fruit inoculated with P. washingtonensis, S. pyriputrescens, or B. cinerea and compared with identifications using traditional isolation-based assays. For wound-inoculated fruit, the PCR assays consistently provided the correct identification of the pathogen used as the inoculant in 6 h of processing time, compared with 5 to 6 days using culture-based methods. Real-time PCR assays effectively detected latent infections in symptomless stem and calyx tissues of fruit that were inoculated with the pathogens in the orchard during the growing season. The PCR assays provide a rapid, accurate method for diagnosis and early detection of these diseases.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBotrytis cinerea 3aPhacidiopycnis 3aSphaeropsis 3aapples 3acalyx 3adisease control 3adisease detection 3aearly diagnosis 3aexports 3agray mold 3agrowing season 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3amicrobial detection 3aorchards 3apathogen identification 3apathogens 3apostharvest diseases 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal DNA 3atissues1 aOkubara, P.1 aMazzola, M.1 aXiao, C.

The present study aimed at evaluating the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and oral toxicity of the ethanol extract (EEEp), dichloromethane fraction (FDMEp) of E. plicata, and isoeleutherin. For the cytotoxicity evaluation, the viability test (MTT) was used. Genotoxicity was accessed through the Comet assay (alkaline version), acute and subacute oral toxicities were also evaluated. The antioxidant capacity of the samples in the wells where the cells were treated with E. plicata was evaluated. Furthermore, the participation of caspase-8 in the possible mechanism of action of isoeleutherin, eleutherin, and eleutherol was also investigated through a docking study. FDMEp and isoeleutherin were cytotoxic, with higher rates of DNA fragmentation observed for FDMEp and isoeleutherin, and all samples displayed higher antioxidant potential than the control. In the acute oral toxicity test, EEEp, FDMEp, and isoeleutherin did not cause significant clinical changes. In the subacute toxicity assay, EEEp and FDMEp also did not cause clinical, hematological, or biochemical changes. The three compounds bound similarly to caspase-8. Despite the results of cytotoxicity, in vitro studies demonstrated that the use of EEEp appears to be safe and cell death may involve its binding to caspase-8.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3aacute oral toxicity 3aantioxidant activity 3acaspase-8 3acell death 3acomet assay 3acytotoxicity 3aethanol 3agenotoxicity 3amechanism of action 3amedicinal plants 3amethylene chloride 3anaphthoquinones 3asubacute toxicity 3aviability assays 0aALT 0aAST 0aBCRJ 0aBFS 0aDARP 0aDMEM 0aDMSO 0aDPPH 0aEDTA 0aEEEp 0aFADD 0aFDMEp 0aFrAE 0aGA 0aGOLD 0aHPLC 0aIC50 0aMTT 0aMD 0aNMR 0aNMU 0aOECD 0aPDB 0aRPMI 0aROS 0arpm 0aRSMD 0aTLC 0aTNFR 0aEleutherine plicata 0aToxicity 0aIsoeleutherin 0aEleutherin 0aEleutherol1 ada Rocha Galucio, Natasha Costa1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4923-14781 ade Albuquerque, Kelly Cristina Oliveira1 aBrígido, Heliton Patrick Cordovil1 aVarela, Everton Luiz Pompeu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9710-37911 aCastro, Ana Laura Gadelha1 aVale, Valdicley Vieira1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6570-48751 aBahia, Marcelo Oliveira1 aRodriguez Burbano, Rommel Mario1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4872-234X1 ade Molfeta, Fábio Alberto1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6773-69231 aCarneiro, Liliane Almeida1 aPercario, Sandro1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9528-03611 aDolabela, Maria Fâni1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0804-58040 tToxicology reports.g2021, v. 8 p.1480-1487dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23254x2214-75007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.toxrep.2021.07.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03073naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245009500168300001600263500001500279520156700294592002801861650000901889650001101898650002101909650002401930650001101954650002301965650002201988650002002010650001202030650001902042650001502061650002202076650001102098650001402109650001302123650002302136650001202159650001202171651002602183651001302209653001502222700002502237700001702262700002302279700002302302700002002325773012902345856004802474852000902522655001202531IND50066090020221120230143.0130430e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006609002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11027-012-9372-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNkem, Johnson N.10aProfiling climate change vulnerability of forest indigenous communities in the Congo Basin  ap. 513-533.  a2019-12-06  aThe livelihood strategies of indigenous communities in the Congo Basin are inseparable from the forests, following their use of forest ecosystem goods and services (FEGS). Climate change is expected to exert impacts on the forest and its ability to provide FEGS. Thus, human livelihoods that depend on these FEGS are intricately vulnerable to climate impacts. Using the livelihood strategies of the two main forest indigenous groups; the Bantus and Pygmies, of the high forest zone of southern Cameroon; this paper examines the nature and pattern of their vulnerability to different climate risks as well as highlights how place of settlement in the forest contributes to the vulnerability of people in forest systems. Forests provide different capitals as FEGS and make direct and indirect contributions to livelihoods which are exploited differently by the two indigenous groups. The results show that vulnerability of forest communities is structured by lifestyle, culture and the livelihood strategies employed which are largely shaped by the place of settlement in the forest. The Pygmies living within the forests are engaged in nomadic gathering and foraging of non-timber forest resources. The Bantus prefer forest margins and are mostly preoccupied with sedentary farming, using the forest as additional livelihood opportunity. The contrasting lifestyles have implications on their vulnerability and adaptation to climate impacts which need to be taken into considerations in planning and implementation of national climate change adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3arisk 3abasins 3aforest resources 3acommunity structure 3ahumans 3aecosystem services 3anational planning 3afarming systems 3acapital 3aclimate change 3alivelihood 3aforest ecosystems 3apeople 3alifestyle 3aforaging 3aforest communities 3aclimate 3aforests 3aRepublic of the Congo 3aCameroon 0aadaptation1 aSomorin, Olufunso A.1 aJum, Cyprian1 aIdinoba, Monica E.1 aBele, Youssoufa M.1 aSonwa, Denis J.0 tMitigation and adaptation strategies for global change.g2013 June, v. 18, no. 5 p.513-533dSpringer-Verlagx1381-23867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11027-012-9372-8  aDNAL 7aarticle02004naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012600169300001400295520092400309592002801233650001601261650001301277650001901290650002101309650002001330650001201350650001301362650001501375700001401390700001801404700001301422700001801435773009401453856008601547852000901633655001201642IND60095637720221119180518.0141104e20111101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009563772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.06.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarillé, R.10aPhoto-responsive polymer with erasable and reconfigurable micro- and nano-patterns: An in vitro study for neuron guidance  ap. 63-71.  aThe interaction of cells with nanoscale topography has proven to be an important modality in controlling cell responses. Topographic parameters on material surfaces play a role in cell growth. We have synthesized a new bio compatible polymer containing photoswitching molecules. Stripepatterned (groove/ridge pattern) were patterned and erased with ease on this bio azopolymer with two different set-ups: one with the projection of an optical interference pattern and the other one by molecular self-organization with one single laser beam. These two set-ups allow the re-writing of pattern after erasing and its inscription in vitro. PC12 cells were cultured on the bio-photoswitching patterned polymer and compared with PC12 cells growing on a well know substrate: poly-l-lysine.

The increase in C and N supply to the soil has the potential to improve soil quality and crop productivity compared with monoculture cover crop species. We examined above- and belowground (0- to 120-cm soil depth) biomass yields and C and N contents of a legume [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth)], nonlegume [rye (Secale cereale L.)], and biculture of legume and nonlegume (vetch and rye) cover crops planted without tillage in the fall of 1999 to 2001 in central Georgia. After cover crop kill in the spring, cotton (Gossypium hitsutum L.) and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench)] were planted using three tillage practices (no-till, strip till, and chisel till) with three N fertilization rates (0, 60 to 65, and 120 to 130 kg N ha⁻¹). The field experiment was arranged in a split-split plot treatment with three replications on a Dothan sandy loam (fine-loamy, kaolinitic, thermic, Plinthic Kandiudults). Aboveground biomass yield of rye decreased from 6.1 to 2.3 Mg ha⁻¹ from 2000 to 2002, but yield of hairy vetch varied (2.4 to 5.2 Mg ha⁻¹). In contrast, biomass yield of vetch and rye biculture (5.6 to 8.2 Mg ha⁻¹) was greater than that of rye and vetch planted alone in all years. Compared with winter weeds in no cover crop treatment, C content in rye (1729 to 2670 kg ha⁻¹) was greater due to higher biomass yield, but N content in vetch (76 to 165 kg ha⁻¹) was greater due to higher N concentration, except in 2002. As a result, C (2260 to 3512 kg ha⁻¹) and N (84 to 310 kg ha⁻¹) contents in biculture were greater than those from monocultures in all years. Similarly, belowground biomass yield and C and N contents were greater in biculture than in monocultures. In 2001, aboveground biomass yield and C and N contents in cover crops were also greater in strip till with biculture than in other treatments, except in chisel till with vetch and biculture, but belowground biomass yield and N content were greater in chisel till with biculture than in no-till, strip till, and chisel till with weeds. Cotton lint yield was lower with biculture than with rye, but sorghum grain yield and cotton and sorghum biomass (stems + leaves) yields and N uptake were greater with biculture than with rye. Because of higher biomass yield and C and N contents, biculture of hairy vetch and rye cover crops may increase N supply, summer crop yields, and N uptake compared with rye and may increase potentials to improve soil organic matter and reduce N leaching compared with vetch.  aPublisher supplied data 3ano-tillage 3astrip tillage 3afiber crops 3acarbon 3anitrogen content 3aGossypium hirsutum 3adry matter accumulation 3agrain yield 3asoil fertility 3aVicia villosa 3asoil organic matter 3aSecale cereale 3acrop rotation 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acotton 3agrain crops 3afertilizer rates 3achiseling 3agrain sorghum 3acover crops 3aSorghum bicolor 3achemical constituents of plants 3aGeorgia1 aWhitehead, Wayne F.1 aSingh, Bharat P.0 tAgronomy journal.g2005 Sept., v. 97, no. 5 p.1403-1412dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/37163Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2004.02743Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle02146naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245008700172300001600259520080300275592002801078650002001106650001301126650001801139650001201157650001001169650001201179650001401191650001901205650001401224651001301238700001601251700002101267700002101288700001901309700001801328700002001346700002301366700002301389700002001412773011001432852000901542856008101551930003301632946001101665655001201676IND60438692220221120031252.0151023e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043869222DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-006-0287-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatsumoto-Oda, Akiko10aEstrus cycle asynchrony in wild female chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii  ap. 661-668.  aAlthough estrous synchrony has been reported in a number of mammalian species, most often among primates, methodological and analytical problems make it difficult to interpret these results. We developed a novel estrous synchrony index and employed a randomization procedure to analyze long-term observations of female chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) estrous cycles at the Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania. Our results revealed that female chimpanzees at Mahale avoid synchronizing their estrous periods with each other. We also found that birthrates decreased as the breeding sex ratio increased. We suggest that estrous asynchrony decreases female-female competition for mates. Asynchrony may also reduce the potential for male sexual coercion by nonpreferred mating partners.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPan troglodytes 3abreeding 3aestrous cycle 3afemales 3amales 3amammals 3amountains 3anational parks 3asex ratio 3aTanzania1 aHamai, Miya1 aHayaki, Hitosige1 aHosaka, Kazuhiko1 aHunt, Kevin D.1 aKasuya, Eiiti1 aKawanaka, Kenji1 aMitani, John Cary,1 aTakasaki, Hiroyuki1 aTakahata, Yukio0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2007 Mar., v. 61, no. 5 p.661-668dSpringer-Verlagx0340-54437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-006-0287-93Available from publisher's site  a20070304b20070402c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02619naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002000166245010700186300001600293500001500309520103300324592002801357650002401385650001501409650001901424650002101443650001401464650001701478650002001495650002901515650001801544650001201562650003101574650003201605650003001637650001201667650002801679650001701707650004201724650002701766653001001793700001801803700002101821700002101842700002201863773009101885856008101976990002302057852000902080655001202089IND60093826620221117223735.0141104e20110222xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009382662DNAL7 a213155962pmid7 a10.1016/j.cub.2011.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamikawa, Ryoma10aSplit Introns in the Genome of Giardia intestinalis Are Excised by Spliceosome-Mediated trans-Splicing  ap. 311-315.  a2019-12-06  aSpliceosomal introns are hallmarks of most eukaryotic genomes and are excised from premature mRNAs by a spliceosome that is among the largest, and most complex, molecular machine in cells [1]. The divergent unicellular eukaryote Giardia intestinalis, the causative agent of giardiasis, also possesses spliceosomes, but only four canonical (cis-spliced) introns have been identified in its genome to date [2–4]. We demonstrate that this organism has a novel form of spliceosome-mediated trans-splicing of split introns that is essential for generating mature mRNAs for at least two important genes: one encoding a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which controls the conformation of a suite of cellular proteins [5], and the other encoding a dynein molecular motor protein, involved in the motility of eukaryotic flagella [6]. These split introns have properties that distinguish them from other trans-splicing systems known within eukaryotes, suggesting that Giardia independently evolved a unique system to splice split introns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aheat shock proteins 3agiardiasis 3atrans-splicing 3aeukaryotic cells 3aflagellum 3aspliceosomes 3aGiardia lamblia 3amolecular motor proteins 3adynein ATPase 3aintrons 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aGenome, Protozoanxgenetics 2aGiardia lambliaxgenetics 2aIntrons 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aRNA Splicing 2aRNA, Messengerxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSpliceosomesxgenetics 0agenes1 aInagaki, Yuji1 aTokoro, Masaharu1 aRoger, Andrew J.1 aHashimoto, Tetsuo0 tCurrent biology.g2011 Feb. 22, v. 21, no. 4 p.311-315dElsevier Inc.x0960-98227nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.01.0253Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02602naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002100142245010200163300001800265520139100283592002801674650001501702650001501717650002601732650001101758650001301769650001501782650001801797650003101815700002501846700001801871700005901889700006001948773014702008856007602155852000902231655001202240IND60634988620221119183126.0190327e20190312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063498862DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b009132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQazvini, Omid T.12aA Robust Ethane-Trapping Metal–Organic Framework with a High Capacity for Ethylene Purification  ap. 5014-5020.  aThe separation of ethane from ethylene is of prime importance in the purification of chemical feedstocks for industrial manufacturing. However, differentiating these compounds is notoriously difficult due to their similar physicochemical properties. High-performance porous adsorbents provide a solution. Conventional adsorbents trap ethylene in preference to ethane, but this incurs multiple steps in separation processes. Alternatively, high-purity ethylene can be obtained in a single step if the adsorbent preferentially adsorbs ethane over ethylene. We herein report a metal–organic framework, MUF-15 (MUF, Massey University Framework), constructed from inexpensive precursors that sequesters ethane from ethane/ethylene mixtures. The productivity of this material is exceptional: 1 kg of MOF produces 14 L of polymer-grade ethylene gas in a single adsorption step starting from an equimolar ethane/ethylene mixture. Computational simulations illustrate the underlying mechanism of guest adsorption. The separation performance was assessed by measuring multicomponent breakthrough curves, which illustrate that the separation performance is maintained over a wide range of feed compositions and operating pressures. MUF-15 is robust, maintains its performance in the presence of acetylene, and is easily regenerated by purging with inert gas or by placing under reduced pressure.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acoordination polymers 3aethane 3aethylene 3afeedstocks 3amanufacturing 3aphysicochemical properties1 aBabarao, Ravichandar1 aShi, Zhao-Lin1 aZhang, Yue-Biao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8270-10671 aTelfer, Shane G.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1596-66520 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 Mar. 12, v. 141, no. 12 p.5014-5020dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b009133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04171naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100006300188245015700251300001200408506007600420520228600496592002802782596007102810596004002881506003702921650002202958650002102980650003003001650001103031650001403042650001103056650002003067650001003087650001703097650001303114650002303127650001003150650001703160650001803177650002503195650001003220650001103230650002003241650001303261700002503274700002003299700002303319700002103342700002603363773011303389856008203502852000903584655001203593IND60597856420221207082646.0191016e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059785642DNAL7 a299410452pmid7 aPMC60202212pmcid7 a10.1186/s13071-018-2952-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHodgkinson, Jane E.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9152-848110aClonal amplification of Fasciola hepatica in Galba truncatula: within and between isolate variation of triclabendazole-susceptible and -resistant clones  ap. 363.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Fasciola hepatica is of worldwide significance, impacting on the health, welfare and productivity of livestock and regarded by WHO as a re-emerging zoonosis. Triclabendazole (TCBZ), the drug of choice for controlling acute fasciolosis in livestock, is also the drug used to treat human infections. However TCBZ-resistance is now considered a major threat to the effective control of F. hepatica. It has yet to be demonstrated whether F. hepatica undergoes a genetic clonal expansion in the snail intermediate host, Galba truncatula, and to what extent amplification of genotypes within the snail facilitates accumulation of drug resistant parasites. Little is known about genotypic and phenotypic variation within and between F. hepatica isolates. RESULTS: Six clonal isolates of F. hepatica (3× triclabendazole-resistant, TCBZ-R and 3× triclabendazole-susceptible, TCBZ-S) were generated. Snails infected with one miracidium started to shed cercariae 42–56 days post-infection and shed repeatedly up to a maximum of 11 times. A maximum of 884 cercariae were shed by one clonally-infected snail (FhLivS1) at a single time point, with > 3000 clonal metacercariae shed over its lifetime. Following experimental infection all 12 sheep were FEC positive at the time of TCBZ treatment. Sheep infected with one of three putative TCBZ-S clones and treated with TCBZ had no parasites in the liver at post-mortem, whilst sheep each infected with putative TCBZ-R isolates had 35–165 adult fluke at post-mortem, despite TCBZ treatment. All six untreated control animals had between 15–127 parasites. A single multi-locus genotype was reported for every fluke from each of the six clonal isolates. Adult F. hepatica showed considerable variation in weight, ranging from 20–280 mg, with variation in weight evident within and amongst clonal isolates. CONCLUSIONS: A genetic clonal expansion occurs within G. truncatula, highlighting the potential for amplification of drug resistant genotypes of F. hepatica. Variation in the weight of parasites within and between clonal isolates and when comparing isolates that are either susceptible or resistant to TCBZ represent inherent variation in liver fluke and cannot be attributed to their resistance or susceptibility traits.  aPublisher supplied data  aBB10002480cBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council  aEU FOOD-CT-200X-023025: DELIVERcEU0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aFasciola hepatica 3aGalba truncatula 3aWorld Health Organization 3aadults 3acercariae 3aclones 3adrug resistance 3adrugs 3afascioliasis 3agenotype 3aintermediate hosts 3aliver 3aliver flukes 3ametacercariae 3aphenotypic variation 3asheep 3asnails 3atriclabendazole 3azoonoses1 aCwiklinski, Krystyna1 aBeesley, Nicola1 aHartley, Catherine1 aAllen, Katherine1 aWilliams, Diana J.

The behaviour of business entities in agriculture is significantly influenced by the current support scheme and the level of support within the EU CAP but also by market conditions. The impacts of the particular scenarios on the changes of production indicate that Slovak agriculture will approach just slowly the 2008 production level. This will be decisively influenced by the price development. Despite of this, it is evident that the most favourable result can be achieved under the Flat Rate Scenario while the absolute abolition of direct payments (Liberal Scenario) will bring very unfavourable economic consequences with impacts on agricultural production in Slovakia. &nbsp;  aPublisher supplied data 3aCommon Agricultural Policy 3amarkets 3aprices 3aSlovakia0 tZemědělská ekonomika.g, v. 57, no. 1 p.10-20dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:22848x0139-570X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/146/2010-agricecon3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01421naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001800139245007800157300001800235520037100253592002800624650002300652650002300675650001100698650001900709650003100728650002200759700002600781700001800807700001600825700001900841700002000860773010700880856007500987852000901062655001201071IND60578597620221121201758.0170813e20130920xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057859762DNAL7 a10.1021/ol40252932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJang, Joo Hee10aCu2+-Responsive Bimodal (Optical/MRI) Contrast Agent for Cellular Imaging  ap. 4702-4705.  aA water-soluble T₁ magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent (1) has been synthesized.

To increase the drug's bioavailability by ocular instillation, TA was encapsulated in nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC), previously optimized by our group using a factorial design approach. In the present paper, nanometric (∼200nm), unimodal and negatively charged NLC loaded with the fluorescent lipid marker Nile red (NR-NLC) and drug (TA-NLC) were produced by high pressure homogenization. Based on the selected formulations, in vivo tests were carried out by eye-drop instillation of NR-NLC in mice, revealing the systems’ ability of delivering lipophilic actives to the posterior segment of the eye via the corneal and non-corneal pathways. Short and long-term stability of TA-NLC was assessed by high performance stability analysis using the Turbiscan®. The results showed a backscattering of less than 1.5% and during a period of 6 months, anticipated the low tendency of these particles for aggregation during shelf life when stored at room temperature.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadrenal cortex hormones 3aambient temperature 3abioavailability 3acolloids 3acornea 3afluorescence 3ahomogenization 3aintravitreal injection 3amice 3ashelf life 3atriamcinolone1 aNikolic, Sasha1 aEgea, Maria A.1 aSouto, Eliana B.1 aGarcía, María L.,0 tColloids and surfaces.g2011 Nov. 1, v. 88, no. 1 p.150-157dElsevier B.V.x0927-77657nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfb.2011.06.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02578naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001800144245013500162520133900297592002801636650002301664650001801687650002501705650001701730650001501747650002101762650001601783650002101799650001701820650002801837650001101865650001301876700002001889700001701909700001801926700002101944773012701965856007902092852000902171655001202180IND60754148120221120172545.0211023e20211013xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075414812DNAL7 a10.3390/antiox101016142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChung, Yerim 10aAntioxidant Activity and Inhibitory Effect on Nitric Oxide Production of Hydroponic Ginseng Fermented with Lactococcus lactis KC24  aPanax ginseng Meyer is used as a medicinal plant. The aim of this study was to ferment hydroponic ginseng with Lactococcus lactis KC24 and confirm its antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect on nitric oxide (NO) production. Flavonoid and phenol contents in fermented ginseng extracts were measured. Antioxidant activity was measured by DPPH, ABTS, reducing power, FRAP and β-carotene assays. Additionally, inhibitory effects on NO production and toxicity of the fermented extract were determined using RAW 264.7 cells. Phenol and flavonoid contents increased as the fermentation time increased, and the contents were higher in hydroponic ginseng than in soil-cultivated ginseng. The DPPH assay revealed that the antioxidant activity of the 24 h fermented extract significantly increased from 32.57% to 41% (p < 0.05). The increase in antioxidant activity may be affected by an increase in phenol and flavonoid contents. At 1 mg/mL solid content, the 24 h fermented hydroponic ginseng extract inhibited NO production from 9.87 ± 0.06 μM to 1.62 ± 0.26 μM. In conclusion, the increase in antioxidant activity affects the inhibition of NO production, suggesting that fermented hydroponic ginseng may be used in the industries of functional food and pharmaceutical industry as a functional material with anti-inflammatory effects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactococcus lactis 3aPanax ginseng 3aantioxidant activity 3afermentation 3aflavonoids 3afunctional foods 3ahydroponics 3amedicinal plants 3anitric oxide 3apharmaceutical industry 3aphenol 3atoxicity1 aPark, Ji Young,1 aLee, Ji Eun,1 aKim, Kee-Tae 1 aPaik, Hyun-Dong 0 tAntioxidants.g2021 Oct. 13, v. 10, no. 10dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:27130x2076-39217nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/antiox101016143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle
