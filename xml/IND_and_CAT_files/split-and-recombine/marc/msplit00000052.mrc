Herein, highly fluorescent bovine serum albumin (BSA)-directed Au–BSA NCs are synthesized as a platform for further conjugation with human antistaphylococcal immunoglobulin (antiSAIgG) and the photodynamic (PD) synthesizer Photosens™ (PS) to fabricate Au–BSA–antiSAIgG–PS complexes. The complexes possess three theranostic modalities: biospecific detection of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, intense red fluorescence due to Au–BSA NCs (quantum yield, ∼14%), and synergistic PD inactivation due to the PS dye. Owing to biospecific targeting and intense red fluorescence, the Au–BSA–antiSAIgG probe can detect pathogenic bacteria in bacterial mixtures through fluorescence microscopy or even through naked eye inspection of sediments under UV illumination. The developed complexes can be used at a physiological pH of ∼7, in contrast to nonspecific electrostatic binding of Au–human serum albumin NCs to S. aureus at pH < 5–6. PD treatment of methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with Au–BSA–antiSAIgG–PS complexes and 660 nm light irradiation significantly inactivates both types of bacteria. By using the developed strategy, Au–BSA–PS complexes can be further modified with other targeting and chemotherapeutic molecules, thus ensuring new theranostic applications in current nanomedicine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantibiotic resistance 3abacteria 3abioimaging 3abovine serum albumin 3adrug therapy 3adyes 3afluorescence 3afluorescence microscopy 3agold 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulins 3airradiation 3amethicillin 3amethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 3ananogold 3ananomedicine 3apH 3asediments 3aultraviolet radiation 3avirulent strains1 aTuchina, Elena1 aTuchin, Valery1 aKhlebtsov, Nikolai G.,0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 20, v. 5, no. 76 p.61639-61649dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11713e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02584naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245010300174300001800277520108900295592002801384650001301412650001101425650001201436650001201448650001201460650001301472650001501485650001101500650001501511650002601526650002001552650001201572650001501584650001701599650000901616650001401625650001401639650001801653650001801671650001201689650001101701650001201712650000901724700001901733700001901752700001601771700002401787773014101811856008101952852000902033655001202042IND60133125620221120192819.0150518e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013312562DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-014-3881-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPiepenschneider, Meike10aElement concentrations in urban grass cuttings from roadside verges in the face of energy recovery  ap. 7808-7820.  aGrass from municipal roadside verges is a potential yet largely unused resource for bioenergy recovery, which is mainly due to its unknown elemental composition. Therefore, we measured the concentration of 16 elements (Ca, K, Mg, N, Na, P, S, Al, Cd, Cl, Cr, Cu, Mn, Pb, Si and Zn) in a material from the city of Kassel harvested in different management intensities. The element concentrations were mainly close to reference values of agricultural or nature conservation grassland and usually within the range of literature data. Concentrations of most elements, including heavy metals, were below limiting values. Only N and Cl concentrations in the raw material exceeded the limiting values for combustion, but washing and dewatering of the biomass with the “integrated generation of solid fuel and biogas from biomass” technique resulted in concentrations in the press cake well below the limiting values. Considering the element concentrations of grass from urban roadside verges, utilisation for energy recovery may be possible, provided an appropriate technology is applied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achromium 3acombustion 3acopper 3adewatering 3aelemental composition 3aenergy recovery 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3aheavy metals 3alead 3amagnesium 3amanganese 3anormal values 3araw materials 3asilicon 3asodium 3awashing 3azinc1 aDe Moor, Sofie1 aHensgen, Frank1 aMeers, Erik1 aWachendorf, Michael0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research.g2015 May, v. 22, no. 10 p.7808-7820dSpringer-VerlagwJournal:jnl4122550x1614-74997nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-014-3881-93Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02587naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245010600158520132600264592002801590650001301618650001801631650001601649650001801665650001201683650001501695650001101710650001501721650003001736650001601766650001201782650001001794650001301804651001901817700002301836700002301859700002101882700002501903700002601928773011801954856007202072852000902144655001202153IND60648667620221121100552.0190701e20160512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064866762DNAL7 a10.3390/f70501062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillet, Pauline10aWhat Are the Impacts of Deforestation on the Harvest of Non-Timber Forest Products in Central Africa?  aThe objective of the study is to evaluate the impact of forest transition on non-timber forest product (NTFP) harvesting in Central Africa. We analyze the evolution of several parameters, including distance from NTFP harvest site to road, proportion of dietary intake and villagers’ incomes. The research is based on field surveys, participatory mapping and the geolocation of activities in three study sites representing different stages along the Mather’s forest transition curve: (i) intact forest; (ii) partially degraded forest; and (iii) small areas of degraded forest with plantations of useful trees. The results show that the maximum distance from harvest site to road is higher in Site 2 compared to Site 1 as a consequence of a lower availability of NTFPs; and that this distance is significantly lower in Site 3 due to a drastically smaller village territory. The diversity of bushmeat decreases as game evolves from large to small species, commensurate with the progression of forest transition. As a consequence, there is also a reduction in the proportion of these products represented both in household dietary intake and cash income. This analysis establishes a strong link between the Mather’s forest transition curve and a decline in the importance of NTFPs in village production and livelihoods.  aPublisher supplied data 3abushmeat 3adeforestation 3afood intake 3aforest damage 3aforests 3aharvesting 3aincome 3alivelihood 3anontimber forest products 3aplantations 3asurveys 3atrees 3avillages 3aCentral Africa1 aVermeulen, Cédric1 aDoucet, Jean-Louis1 aCodina, Elisabet1 aLehnebach, Charlotte1 aFeintrenie, Laurène,0 tForests.g2016 May 12, v. 7, no. 5dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70501063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03116naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245013300155300001600288500002000304520175900324592002802083650001702111650002902128650003302157650002202190650001102212650001502223650001702238650001602255650002202271650001902293650001502312650002502327650001302352650001102365651002702376651001702403700001602420700001602436773013602452856007302588852000902661655001202670IND60651693420221117092252.0190712e20150113xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065169342DNAL7 a10.3390/su70108112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSizo, Anton10aFutures Analysis of Urban Land Use and Wetland Change in Saskatoon, Canada: An Application in Strategic Environmental Assessment  ap. 811-830.  aJournal Article  aThis paper presents a scenario-based approach to strategic environmental assessment (SEA) for wetland trend analysis and land use and land cover (LUC) modeling in an urban environment. The application is focused on the Saskatoon urban environment, a rapidly growing urban municipality in Canada’s prairie pothole region. Alternative future LUC was simulated using remote sensing data and city spatial planning documentation using a Markov Chain technique. Two alternatives were developed and compared for LUC change and threats to urban wetland sustainability: a zero alternative that simulated trends in urban development and wetland conservation under a business as usual scenario, in the absence of prescribed planning and zoning actions; and an alternative focused on implementation of current urban development plans, which simulated future LUC to account for prescribed wetland conservation strategies. Results show no improvement in future wetland conditions under the city’s planned growth and wetland conservation scenario versus the business as usual scenario. Results also indicate that a blanket wetland conservation strategy for the city may not be sufficient to overcome the historic trend of urban wetland loss; and that spatially distributed conservation rates, based on individual wetland water catchment LUC peculiarities, may be more effective in terms of wetland conservation. The paper also demonstrates the challenges to applied SEA in a rapidly changing urban planning context, where data are often sparse and inconsistent across the urban region, and provides potential solutions through LUC classification and prediction tools to help overcome data limitations to support land use planning decisions for wetland conservation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMarkov chain 3aenvironmental assessment 3aland use and land cover maps 3aland use planning 3amodels 3aprediction 3aspatial data 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aurban planning 3awatersheds 3awetland conservation 3awetlands 3azoning 3aPrairie Pothole region 3aSaskatchewan1 aNoble, Bram1 aBell, Scott0 tSustainability.g2015 Jan. 13, v. 7, no. 1 p.811-830dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2270x2071-10507nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su70108113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02611naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245004600160300001600206520168300222592002801905650001001933650002501943650001101968650002001979650003301999650001402032650002002046650000902066700001902075700001802094773010402112856004802216852000902264655001202273IND4478988520221118144102.0120727e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447898852DNAL7 a10.1007/s00226-010-0382-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTan, P. L.10aRoughness models for sanded wood surfaces  ap. 129-142.  aThe understanding of the effects of variables is crucial to achieve the desired sanded surface quality at optimum condition. In wood surface evaluation, it is known that anatomies on wood surface could distort the roughness value and cause a misinterpretation of the processing performance. In this study, statistical approaches were taken to characterize the influence of sanding variables as well as to analyze the anatomical noises that were inherited from intra- and inter-species of woods. Four available roughness parameters (R a , R q , R k and R ap) were used to examine the surface of three distinct wood species, viz. kembang semangkok, red oak and spruce in wide-belt sanding. Based on the mean values, analysis of variance showed that species (anatomy) was significant to all conventional parameters except R ap which was filtered by monitoring the second derivative of Abbott-curve. In spite of this, R ap recorded a more widely dispersed deviation of random measurement values than R k and R a . The effects of grit size and feed rate were found to be significant. Empirical roughness models were established using response surface methodology, and the errors were calculated by comparing the model values to all the randomly measured values. Although exhibiting slight species-dependant effect by nature, R k showed reliable consistency by recording the lowest error values (<10%) for both intra- and inter-species measurements. Experimental results also suggested that three random measurements at each run could be sufficient. The method of constructing machinability models can be readily applied in the industry as a quality control tool for wide-belt sander.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPicea 3aanalysis of variance 3amodels 3aquality control 3aresponse surface methodology 3aroughness 3asurface quality 3awood1 aSharif, Safian1 aIzman, Sudin,0 tWood science and technology.g2012 Jan., v. 46, no. 1-3 p.129-142dSpringer-Verlagx0043-77197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00226-010-0382-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02295naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100006000140245010100200300001600301500001900317500001100336520102000347592002801367596002901395596002901424596002101453596000901474650001701483650001401500650002401514650001101538650002401549650002001573650003401593650002201627650002001649700001801669773011501687856007401802852000901876655001201885IND60681928920221122172650.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068192892DNAL7 a10.1111/febs.150732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnand, Aditya A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2643-032X10aStructural insights into ISRIB, a memory‐enhancing inhibitor of the integrated stress response  ap. 239-245.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aREVIEW  aThe integrated stress response (ISR) regulates protein synthesis under conditions of stress. Phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 by stress‐sensing kinases converts eIF2 from substrate to competitive inhibitor of its dedicated nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, arresting translation. A drug‐like molecule called integrated stress response inhibitor (ISRIB) reverses the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation and restores translation by targeting eIF2B. When administered to mice, ISRIB enhances cognition and limits cognitive decline due to brain injury. To determine ISRIB’s mechanism of action, we solved an atomic structure of ISRIB bound to the human eIF2B decamer. We found that ISRIB acts as a molecular staple, pinning together tetrameric subcomplexes of eIF2B along the assembly path to a fully active, decameric enzyme. In this Structural Snapshot, we discuss ISRIB’s mechanism, its ability to rescue disease mutations in eIF2B and conservation of the enzyme and ISRIB‐binding pocket.  aPublisher supplied data  cCalico Life Sciences LLC  cRogers Family Foundation  cWeill Foundation  cHHMI 3abrain damage 3acognition 3acognitive disorders 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3aphosphorylation 3aphosphotransferases (kinases) 3aprotein synthesis 3astress response1 aWalter, Peter0 tFEBS journal.g2020 Jan., v. 287, no. 2 p.239-245dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3943524x1742-464X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.150733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100002300163245014900186300001600335520122900351592002801580650003101608650001401639650001501653650001601668650001201684650002401696650001101720650002501731650002601756650000701782650003301789650002701822650001601849650001801865650005801883650002901941650001701970650003101987650001302018650002302031650006602054650001602120653001902136653003102155653002702186653003302213653002102246700002902267700001802296700002002314773013802334852000902472856008002481655001202561IND4440363520221118144049.0181123e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444036352DNAL7 a213391272pmid7 a10.1177/10820132093532192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArrivukkarasan, S.10aEffect of Medium Composition and Kinetic Studies on Extracellular and Intracellular Production of L-asparaginase from Pectobacterium carotovorum  ap. 115-125.  aMicrobial L-asparaginase occupies a prominent place among biocatalysts owing to their ability to catalyze the reaction that hydrolyze the asparagine molecule. Effect of various medium components on the production of L-asparaginase in submerged fermentation by Pectobacterium carotovorum was studied for optimal nutrient requirements. Six different media compositions were tested for the L-asparaginase production keeping fermentation conditions constant at temperature 30 °C, initial pH 7.0 and agitation speed of 120 rpm. Maximum intracellular and extracellular L-asparaginase activity was obtained in the medium containing tryptone, yeast extract, monosodium glutamate, K₂HPO₄ and L-asparagine. These medium components were further optimized by central composite experimental design using response surface methodology. Maximum intracellular and extracellular L-asparaginase activity of 2.282 U/mL and 0.587 U/mL were obtained respectively at the late logarithmic phase in optimized media. Unstructured kinetic models were used to describe the cell growth and product formation kinetics.

Instrument parameter settings were optimized to obtain high sensitive and accurate determination of 3‐HMG acid. The use of helium gas heated to temperature of 400°C was observed to permit deprotonation, 3‐HMG acid producing an abundant (M‐H)⁻ (m/z 161) in the negative ion mode. The calibration curve was determined to be linear over the range of 0.05‐5 mg/L, with the correlation coefficient r = 0.9988 and the relative standard deviations (n = 6) in the range of 1.5‐11.8%. The limit of detection was 0.002 mg/L, and the limit of quantitation was 0.007 mg/L. The recoveries ranged from 88.0% to 123.1%. Four urine samples from patients and four simulated urine samples were investigated. The results of DART‐MS were in agreement with the values determined using established methods at the hospitals. The proposed method demonstrated significant potential in the application of the high‐throughput screening in newborn screening.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017C37064cAnalysis and Measurement Foundation of Zhejiang Province  aLGC19B050013cAnalysis and Measurement Foundation of Zhejiang Province  a2016J01cKey Laboratory Item of Furniture Inspection Technology of Zhejiang Province  a2014AA02902cNational High Technology Research and Development Program of China  a51503182cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3adeprotonation 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3ahelium 3ahospitals 3amass spectrometry 3aneonates 3apatients 3arapid methods 3ascreening 3astandard deviation 3atemperature 3aurine1 aLiu, Yanshuxian1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5214-854X1 aHuang, Xiaoli1 aHu, Zhenzhen1 aLiu, Huijun1 aWang, Lili1 aLiu, Charles1 aRen, Yiping0 tJournal of mass spectrometry.g2019 Feb., v. 54, no. 2 p.134-140dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3941715x1076-51747nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jms.43143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04169naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002600164245014600190300001400336520217000350592002802520650001102548650001802559650001202577650001602589650001102605650001602616650001702632650001702649650001202666650002902678650002802707650001402735650001402749650004302763650001302806650001002819650000902829650001002838650001802848650002502866650003702891650002302928650002602951650005902977650001103036650001103047650004103058650002903099650000903128650003103137650001603168650003403184650002403218700002703242700002103269700002103290700002003311773010703331856004803438852000903486655001203495IND4486946720221118234150.0121003e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448694672DNAL7 a205679342pmid7 a10.1007/s12011-010-8751-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDoşa, Monica Daniela10aInfluence of Therapy with Metformin on the Concentration of Certain Divalent Cations in Patients with Non-insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus  ap. 36-46.  aResearch was performed on a group of 30 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), who never received antidiabetic medication before, and on a group of 17 healthy adults. The patients were administered treatment with metformin, 1,000 mg/day. Plasmatic and urinary concentration of magnesium have been measured, copper and zinc along with the concentrations of glucose, HDL, LDL, cholesterol, tryglicerides, HbA1c, and total erythrocyte magnesium, in advance and after 3 months of treatment. Data showed significant differences in the NIDDM group vs the control group: for plasma magnesium—1.95 ± 0.19 vs 2.20 ± 0.18 mg/dl, p < 0.001; urine magnesium—237.28 ± 34.51 vs 126.25 ± 38.22 mg/24 h, p < 0.001; erythrocyte magnesium—5.09 ± 0.63 vs 6.38 ± 0.75 mg/dl, p < 0.001; plasma zinc—67.56 ± 6.21 vs 98.41 ± 20.47 μg/dl, p < 0.001; urine zinc—1,347.54 ± 158.24 vs 851.65 ± 209.75 μg/24 h, p < 0.001; plasma copper—111.91 ± 20.98 vs 96.33 ± 8.56 μg/dl, p < 0.001; and urine copper—51.70 ± 23.79 vs 36.00 ± 11.70 μg/24 h, p < 0.05. Treatment with metformin for 3 months modified significant erythrocyte magnesium—5.75 ± 0.61 vs 5.09 ± 0.63 mg/dl, p < 0.001 and urine magnesium—198.27 ± 27.07 vs 237.28 ± 34.51 mg/24 h, p < 0.001, whereas it did not modify significant the plasmatic and urinary concentration of the other cations. The erythrocyte magnesium concentration was inversely correlated with HbA1c (r = −0.438, p = 0.015). The plasma level of copper was positively correlated with HbA1c (r = 0.517, p < 0.003), tryglicerides (r = 0.534, p < 0.003), and cholesterol (r = 0.440, p < 0.05), and the plasma level of zinc was inversely correlated with glycemia (r = −0.399, p = 0.029). Our data show a significant action of metformin therapy, by increasing the total intraerythrocyte magnesium concentration and decreasing the urinary magnesium elimination, positively correlated with the decrease of glycemia and HbA1c in NIDDM patients.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood glucose 3acations 3acholesterol 3acopper 3acorrelation 3adrug therapy 3aerythrocytes 3aglucose 3ahigh density lipoprotein 3alow density lipoprotein 3amagnesium 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3aurine 3azinc 2aAdult 2aBlood Glucose 2aCase-Control Studies 2aCations, Divalentxbloodxurine. 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCopperxbloodxurine. 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapyxurine. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aMagnesiumxbloodxurine. 2aMale 2aMetforminxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged 2aTrace Elementsxbloodxurine. 2aZincxbloodxurine.1 aHangan, Laurentiu-Tony1 aCrauciuc, Eduard1 aGaleş, Cristina1 aNechifor, Mihai0 tBiological trace element research.g2011 July, v. 142, no. 1 p.36-46dSpringer-Verlagx0163-49847nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12011-010-8751-9  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001600144245015400160300002000314520158100334592002801915650002801943650001201971650000901983650000901992650002502001650001302026650001502039650001802054653002102072653003702093653001602130653002802146653002002174700001902194700001302213700005802226700005502284773014102339856007802480852000902558655001202567IND60685543520221119163551.0200304e20200207xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068554352DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c000792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLan, Lingyi10aOne-Step and Spontaneous in Situ Growth of Popcorn-like Nanostructures on Stretchable Double-Twisted Fiber for Ultrasensitive Textile Pressure Sensor  ap. 10689-10696.  aHighly conductive fibers play an essential role in the development of electronic textiles for wearable devices. Even though great progress has been made recently, big challenges of developing simple and rapid methods to prepare functional fibers with stretchability, high sustainability, and electrical conductivity still remain. Herein, we proposed a simple, rapid, and scalable approach to fabricate stretchable and conductive fibers by growing Au nanostructures on a double-twisted fiber coated with metallic MoS₂ nanosheets. The formation of Au nanostructures with a unique “popcorn”-like shape (namely, Au “nanopopcorn”, AuNPC) occurs instantaneously and spontaneously on the surface of MoS₂-coated fiber, without any additional reducing reagents or heating conditions. Moreover, the overall fabrication process takes less than 5 min, demonstrating the realization of fast fabrication of functional conductive fibers. The obtained fiber with piezoresistive property can be fabricated into a pressure sensor. The unique morphology of AuNPC with a rough surface can significantly enhance the performance of the pressure sensor, with high sensitivity of up to 0.19 kPa–¹ and a fast response time of 93 ms. Furthermore, the functional fiber can be woven into electronic textiles with sensing arrays, which has multiple two-dimensional (2D) force mapping properties. Therefore, we envision that this simple, rapid, and scalable method to fabricate conductive functional fibers would show great potential in the field of electronic textiles and wearable devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aelectrical conductivity 3afabrics 3agold 3aheat 3amolybdenum disulfide 3ananogold 3ananosheets 3arapid methods 0afunctional fiber 0apopcorn-like gold nanostructures 0aself-growth 0atextile pressure sensor 0awearable device1 aZhao, Fengnian1 aYao, Yao1 aPing, Jianfeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0579-98301 aYing, Yibin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3392-93800 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 07, v. 12, no. 9 p.10689-10696dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c000793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02977naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001300139245012400152300001800276520191600294592002802210650001902238650001802257650002802275650001702303650001202320650002602332650001102358650001302369700001402382700002102396700001502417773011102432856007502543852000902618655001202627IND60529640620221122072408.0160717e20140617xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052964062DNAL7 a10.1021/ac501265y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aQi, Huan10aPeptide Microarray with Ligands at High Density Based on Symmetrical Carrier Landscape Phage for Detection of Cellulase  ap. 5844-5850.  aPeptide microarrays evolved recently as a routine analytical implementation in various research areas due to their unique characteristics. However, the immobilization of peptides with high density in each spot during the fabricating process remains a problem, which will affect the performance of the resultant microarray greatly. To respond to this challenge, a novel peptide immobilization method using symmetrical phage carrier was developed in this work. The cellulytic enzyme endoglucanase I (EG I) was used as a model for selection of its specific peptide ligands from the f8/8 landscape library. Three phage monoclones were selected and identified by the specificity array, of which one phage monoclone displaying the fusion peptide EGSDPRMV (phage EGSDPRMV) could bind EG I specifically with highest affinity. Subsequently, the phage EGSDPRMV was used directly to construct peptide microarray. For comparison, major coat protein pVIII fused EG I specific peptide EGSDPRMV (pVIII-fused EGSDPRMV) which was isolated from phage EGSDPRMV was also immobilized by traditional method to fabricate peptide microarray. The fluorescent signal of the phage EGSDPRMV-mediated peptide microarray was more reproducible and about four times higher than the value for pVIII-fused EGSDPRMV-based microarray, suggesting the high efficiency of the proposed phage EGSDPRMV-mediated peptide immobilization method. Further, the phage EGSDPRMV based microarray not only simplified the procedure of microarray construction but also exhibited significantly enhanced sensitivity due to the symmetrical carrier landscape phage, which dramatically increased the density and sterical regularity of immobilized peptides in each spot. Thus, the proposed strategy has the advantages that the immobilizing peptide ligands were not disturbed by their composition and the immobilized peptides were highly regular with free amino-terminal.  aPublisher supplied data 3abacteriophages 3acoat proteins 3aendo-1,4-beta-glucanase 3afluorescence 3aligands 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3apeptides1 aWang, Fei1 aPetrenko, V.

The development of an efficient, economical, and eco-friendly anti-corrosion coating is essential to replace existing carcinogenic and toxic silicone-based coatings used by insulator industries. This article investigates the anticorrosion performance of a novel cerium-based sealing coating for insulator pins installed in highly corrosive (35 μm per year) industrial regions. The coating bath parameters were optimized to improve the self-healing, thermal, crack, and corrosion resistance of the coating. After immersion in a 60 000 ppm CeCl₃·7H₂O sealing coating bath for 60 minutes, a Ce-rich and dense protective coating (24.4 μm) is formed on the pin surface. The specimens immersed in a 60 000 ppm Ce sealing coating bath for 60 minutes show the lowest Icₒᵣᵣ. The anticorrosion performance is enhanced by 95% for coated pins than non-coated ones. The electrochemical experiments, macroscopic and microscopic structural analysis confirm the anticorrosion performance of Ce-based sealing coatings for high voltage insulator pins. This work will facilitate a new branch of eco-friendly coatings for insulator and power industries.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarcinogenicity 3acorrosion 3aelectric potential difference 3aelectrochemistry1 aKim, Taeyong1 aRabelo, Matheus1 aPham, Duy Phong1 aYi, Junsin0 tRSC advances.g2022 Jan. 19, v. 12, no. 5 p.2612-2621dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra08223j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03072naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002100092024003900113040001800152100001500170245019600185300001800381520135500399592002801754650005601782650001501838650002301853650001001876650002101886650002101907650002101928650001401949650001101963650002501974650001201999650005002011650002002061650001202081700001402093700001602107700001402123700001702137773009802154856011202252856008502364956011902449961001302568852000902581655001202590IND4463981120221119033517.0141109e20120521xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446398112DNAL7 a10113/543312hdl7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.03.0382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, X.-Z.10aAntibody repertoire development in fetal and neonatal piglets.

Serum Ig levels were greatly elevated in PRRSV-infected fetuses; IgG was elevated >50-fold, IgM>5–15-fold and IgA>2-fold compared to control fetuses. Their IgM to IgG to IgA profile was the same as that in isolator piglets infected for the same period with wild-type PRRSV. Fetal animals showed less repertoire diversification than even isolator piglets that were maintained germfree (GF) while the repertoire diversification index (RDI) for PRRSV-infected isolator piglets was 10-fold higher and comparable to littermates infected with swine influenza (S-FLU). However, when expressed as the RDI:Ig ratio, infected fetuses appeared 10-fold less capable of repertoire diversification than uninfected littermates and GF isolator piglets. Compared to S-FLU isolator piglets that resolve the infection, the RDI:Ig of PRRSV-infected isolator piglets was 100-fold lower. Overall, infection of fetuses with an attenuated virus shows the same immune dysregulation seen postnatally in wild type infected isolator piglets, indicating that: (a) attenuation did not alter the ability of the virus to cause dysregulation and (b) the isolator infectious model reflects the fetal disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aantibodies 3aantibody formation 3afetus 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aimmunoglobulin G 3aimmunoglobulin M 3ainfection 3amodels 3aneonatal development 3apiglets 3aporcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 3aswine influenza 3aviruses1 aWertz, N.1 aLager, K.L.1 aTobin, G.1 aButler, J.E.0 tVaccine.g2012 May 21, v. 30, no. 24 p.3646-3652dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/543313Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.03.0383Available from publisher's site  aARIS submissionbhttp://parking.nal.usda.gov/shortterm/ind1/114712_Reprint_277318_Sun_et_al_Lager_Vaccine_2012.pdf  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011700164300001800281520195300299592002802252650004102280650001902321650001102340650002602351650001702377650002402394650002202418650001502440650002602455650001102481650001402492650001202506650001402518650001802532650001302550650001602563650001202579650001802591650001302609650001402622650002102636650000902657700002102666700001902687700001702706700002102723773011002744856008102854852000902935655001202944IND60437516020221120024652.0151022e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043751602DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-003-1534-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Tongli10aEffects of inbreeding on coastal Douglas fir growth and yield in operational plantations: a model-based approach  ap. 1162-1171.  aIn advanced generation seed orchards, tradeoffs exist between genetic gain obtained by selecting the best related individuals for seed orchard populations, and potential losses due to subsequent inbreeding between these individuals. Although inbreeding depression for growth rate is strong in most forest tree species at the individual tree level, the effect of a small proportion of inbreds in seed lots on final stand yield may be less important. The effects of inbreeding on wood production of mature stands cannot be assessed empirically in the short term, thus such effects were simulated for coastal Douglas fir [Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco] using an individual-tree growth and yield model TASS (Tree and Stand Simulator). The simulations were based on seed set, nursery culling rates, and 10-year-old field test performance for trees resulting from crosses between unrelated individuals and for inbred trees produced through mating between half-sibs, full-sibs, parents and offspring and self-pollination. Results indicate that inclusion of a small proportion of related clones in seed orchards will have relatively low impacts on stand yields due to low probability of related individuals mating, lower probability of producing acceptable seedlings from related matings than from unrelated matings, and a greater probability of competition-induced mortality for slower growing inbred individuals than for outcrossed trees. Thus, competition reduces the losses expected due to inbreeding depression at harvest, particularly on better sites with higher planting densities and longer rotations. Slightly higher breeding values for related clones than unrelated clones would offset or exceed the effects of inbreeding resulting from related matings. Concerns regarding the maintenance of genetic diversity are more likely to limit inclusion of related clones in orchards than inbreeding depression for final stand yield.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii 3abreeding value 3aclones 3afield experimentation 3aforest trees 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic variation 3ainbreeding 3ainbreeding depression 3amodels 3amortality 3aparents 3aphylogeny 3aplant density 3aplanting 3aprobability 3aprogeny 3aseed orchards 3aseed set 3aseedlings 3aself-pollination 3awood1 aAitken, Sally N.1 aWoods, Jack H.1 aPolsson, Ken1 aMagnussen, Steen0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2004 Apr., v. 108, no. 6 p.1162-1171dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-003-1534-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02969naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009200173520146500265592002801730650001901758650001201777650001601789650001101805650001501816650002301831650001001854650001401864650001201878650000901890650001401899650002301913650001801936650001401954650001501968650001401983650001301997653001002010653002402020653001902044653001302063653002502076653001402101653003102115700002602146700002302172700002602195700002202221773009002243856008502333852000902418655001202427IND60618442120221119041908.0181207e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061844212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fooweb.2018.e001022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCampião, Karla M.10aDwarf vs giant: An unexpected interaction between a small treefrog and a large nematode  aParasitism is one of the most common strategies of resource exploitation in the planet, and the body size of the interacting species is a key factor to understanding the ecology and evolution of this trophic strategy. Here we report for the first time an unexpected interaction between a large nematode species of Eustrongylides (162 mm) and an adult female of the dwarf treefrog Dendropsophus nanus (28 mm). Species of Eustrongylides have complex life cycles, and their transmission occurs through a series of trophic interactions. The first intermediate hosts are oligochaetes, which can be ingested by several species of fish and, occasionally, by amphibians and reptiles. The parasite cycle is completed when these hosts are preyed on by birds. Anurans fill an important trophic position in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, acting as prey and predators for a wide variety of invertebrates and vertebrates. In this sense, parasites are good indicators of food web links, and the occurrence of a parasite in a host may reflect interactions between the host and its prey and predators. One intriguing fact we observed is the large size achieved by the parasite in a such a small host, since larger parasites tend to be associated with larger hosts that provide more relaxed niche constraints. Our finding raises many questions on the frequency and outcomes of such interactions, pointing to the critical influence of parasite transmission in food webs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEustrongylides 3aHylidae 3aOligochaeta 3aadults 3aamphibians 3aaquatic ecosystems 3abirds 3abody size 3afemales 3afish 3afood webs 3aintermediate hosts 3ainvertebrates 3aparasites 3aparasitism 3apredators 3areptiles 0aAnura 0aDendropsophus nanus 0aEustrongylides 0aParasite 0aTrophic transmission 0aBody size 0aPredator-prey interactions1 aDantas, Silionamã P.1 aTavares, Helane D.1 aMartins, Jucilla K.V.1 aOda, Fabrício H.0 tFood webs.g2018 Dec., v. 17 p.e00102-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23213x2352-24967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fooweb.2018.e001023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02834naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100005300145245009400198300001600292500002000308520129200328592002801620650002201648650002901670650002501699650002201724650001701746650001301763650001101776650001701787650001401804650002101818650001401839650002001853650001301873650001801886650001901904650001001923650002401933650001301957650001601970650001701986650001602003700001702019700002602036700001202062700001902074773012302093856007902216852000902295655001202304IND60683357120221122154228.0200208e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068335712DNAL7 a10.1111/1750-3841.150262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Rui1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4243-309610aBiotransformation of green tea (Camellia sinensis) by wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 306-315.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 71B was used in fermentation of green tea to modulate the volatiles and nonvolatiles. After fermentation, higher alcohols, esters, and acids, such as isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, ethyl octanoate, ethyl decanoate, octanoic, and decanoic acids were generated. Some key aroma compounds of tea including linalool, hotrienol, dihydroactinidiolide, and 2‐phenylethanol increased significantly. Among these compounds, linalool and 2‐phenylethanol increased by 1.3‐ and 10‐fold, respectively, which impart floral and fruity notes to fermented green tea. Alkaloids including caffeine, theobromine, and theophylline were reduced significantly after fermentation, while the most important free amino acid in tea, theanine, was not metabolized by S. cerevisiae. Tea catechins decreased whereas gallic and caffeic acids increased significantly, resulting in the unchanged antioxidant capacity of the fermented green tea. Hence, this work highlighted the potential of using S. cerevisiae to modulate green tea aroma and nonvolatiles. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: A novel fermented tea is produced by yeast fermentation. Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to significant changes in tea volatiles and nonvolatiles. Antioxidant capacity remained stable after fermentation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aantioxidant activity 3abiotransformation 3acaffeic acid 3acaffeine 3aesters 3afermentation 3aflavanols 3afree amino acids 3agreen tea 3aisoamyl alcohol 3alinalool 3aoctanoic acid 3aodor compounds 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3atheanine 3atheobromine 3atheophylline 3awine yeasts1 aSun, Jingcan1 aLassabliere, Benjamin1 aYu, Bin1 aLiu, Shao Quan0 tJournal of food science.g2020 Feb., v. 85, no. 2 p.306-315dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl48587x0022-11477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1750-3841.150263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02327naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245010100155300001800256520106100274592002801335650004401363650003701407650001501444650001401459650002801473650002101501650001101522650001401533650002201547650001801569650002201587650002301609650001001632650003701642700001801679700001401697773012201711856007501833852000901908655001201917IND60765549220221120191513.0220130e20220121xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076554922DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra08275b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jing12aA novel l-histidine based ionic liquid (LHIL) as an efficient corrosion inhibitor for mild steel  ap. 2947-2958.  aA novel l-histidine based ionic liquid (LHIL) was developed and successfully synthesized. Its structure was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ¹H-NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The outstanding corrosion inhibition effect of the LHIL on mild steel in 1 M hydrochloric acid was thoroughly evaluated by Tafel plots, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and localized electrochemical strategies. The results revealed that the corrosion of mild steel was effectively suppressed by the adsorption of LHIL on its surface, and the best inhibition efficiency reached 98.8%. The adsorption behavior of LHIL on steel obeyed the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which involved both chemisorption and physisorption. Theoretical calculations indicated the strong chemisorption of LHIL on steel, as proved by the low energy gap (ΔE = 0.0522 eV) and high binding energy (Ebᵢₙdᵢₙg = 303.47 kcal mol⁻¹), which clearly confirmed the effectiveness of LHIL for steel protection.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aadsorption 3acorrosion 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy 3ahistidine 3ahydrochloric acid 3aionic liquids 3amass spectrometry 3asorption isotherms 3asteel 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy1 aLiu, Chengbao1 aQian, Bei0 tRSC advances.g2022 Jan. 21, v. 12, no. 5 p.2947-2958dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d1ra08275b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03060naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245008800165300001800253500001500271520141600286592002801702650001301730650001901743650001901762650001701781650003201798650001601830650002601846650003701872650001801909650002201927650002001949650000901969650000901978650001901987650002602006650002002032650002402052650002102076653002002097700001602117700001702133700001502150700001702165700001802182700001202200700001602212700001602228700001802244700001802262773011202280856008102392852000902473655001202482IND60548053520221122105735.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054805352DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2064-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLin, Qingshan10aProduction of Influenza Virus HA1 Harboring Native-Like Epitopes by Pichia pastoris  ap. 1275-1289.  a2019-12-06  aThe outbreak of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza which exhibits high variation had brought a serious threat to the safety of humanity. To overcome this high variation, hemagglutinin-based recombinant subunit vaccine with rational design has been considered as a substitute for traditional virion-based vaccine development. Here, we expressed HA1 part of the hemagglutinin protein using the Pichia pastoris expression system and attained a high yield of about 120 mg/L through the use of fed-batch scalable fermentation. HA1 protein in the culture supernatant was purified using two-step ion-exchange chromatography. The resultant HA1 protein was homogeneous in solution in a glycosylated form, as confirmed by endoglycosidase H treatment. Sedimentation velocity tests, silver staining of protein gels, and immunoblotting were used for verification. The native HA1 reacted well with conformational, cross-genotype, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, whereas a loss of binding activity was noted with the denatured HA1 form. Moreover, the murine anti-HA1 serum exhibited a virus-capture capability in the hemagglutination inhibition assay, which suggests that HA1 harbors native-like epitopes. In conclusion, soluble HA1 was efficiently expressed and purified in this study. The functional glycosylated protein will be an alternative for the development of recombinant protein-based influenza vaccine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aepitopes 3aneutralization 3aimmunoblotting 3afermentation 3aion exchange chromatography 3ablood serum 3aKomagataella pastoris 3ahemagglutination inhibition test 3aglycosylation 3aInfluenza A virus 3asilver staining 3amice 3agels 3ahemagglutinins 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aavian influenza 3avaccine development 3asubunit vaccines 0aPichia pastoris1 aYang, Kunyu1 aHe, Fangping1 aJiang, Jie1 aLi, Tingting1 aChen, Zhenqin1 aLi, Rui1 aChen, Yixin1 aLi, Shaowei1 aZhao, Qinjian1 aXia, Ningshao0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 179, no. 7 p.1275-1289dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2064-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03703naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100003500112245011700147300001600264506002800280520256500308592002802873506003702901650001602938650002102954650001202975650002202987653001503009653001803024653002603042700002603068700002503094700003303119773020403152852000903356655001203365IND60785668820221207121917.0201111e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078566882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBitencourt, Débora dos Santos10aEfeitos do Método Pilates na composição corporal de indivíduos adultos saudáveis: uma revisão sistemática  ap. 693-698.  aResource is Open Access  aO Método Pilates (MP) caracteriza-se por ser um método de condicionamento físico e mental, que propõe movimentos que envolvem diversos grupos musculares, podendo gerar alterações fisiológicas e corporais em seus praticantes.

ABSTRACT Effects of Pilates Method in body composition of healthy adults: a systematic review The Pilates Method (PM) is a method of physical and mental conditioning, which proposes movements involving several groups of muscle. PM may cause physiological and body changes for its practitioners. The aim was to identify the effects of PM in body composition of healthy adults through a systematic review of randomized studies. In order to find studies on the topic, systematic searches were conducted in six electronic databases between February and April, 2015. The terms used during the search were: Pilates, Pilates trainning, Pilates-based exercises, adultos, adults, composição corporal, body composition, somatotipo, somatotype, and combinations of such words. The methodological quality of the papers was assessed by PEDro scale. Three papers were selected for analysis by the end of the search, one of them had a good methodological quality (80%); and, the other two, a low methodological quality (50% and 40%). It was concluded that there is moderate scientific evidence about the effect of Pilates Method in body composition of healthy adults practitioners. It is suggested that more studies in this area should be done.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEchinochloa 3abody composition 3amuscles 3asystematic review 0aexercício 0aantropometria 0acomposição corporal1 aJunior, Orlando Bulso1 aHaas, Aline Nogueira1 aKomeroski, Isabel Giovannini0 tRevista brasileira de obesidade, nutrição e emagrecimento.g2018 Feb., v. 11, no. 68 p.693-698dInstituto Brasileiro de Pesquisa e Ensino em Fisiologia do ExercíciowJournal:27930x1981-99197nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02906naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100003700140245013300177300001800310520137600328592002801704650001901732650002201751650002101773650002101794650002701815650002601842650002901868650001401897650001001911650001801921650001001939650003701949650001401986650001102000650001902011650001702030650001402047650001302061700001802074700003002092700001702122700001702139700002102156700001702177773012202194856007502316852000902391655001202400IND60765549320221120191545.0220130e20220124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076554932DNAL7 a10.1039/d1ra08296e2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahri, Nurulizzatul Ningsheh M.10aAntimicrobial activity of silver sulfide quantum dots functionalized with highly conjugated Schiff bases in a one-step synthesis  ap. 3136-3146.  aIn the present paper, low-dimensional Ag₂S QDs were fabricated for the first time, with four different dithiocarbazate derivative Schiff bases (SB) as capping agents in a one-pot synthesis. These SB-capped Ag₂S QDs were almost spherical with an average size range of 4.0 to 5.6 nm, which is slightly smaller than conventional thioglycolic acid (TGA)-capped Ag₂S QDs. We demonstrate that the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtillus and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and a prevalent fungal pathogen (Candida albicans) are inhibited more when the bacterial and fungal cells were nurtured with the synthesized SB-Ag₂S QDs, compared with TGA-Ag₂S QDs or free unbound Schiff bases. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) results confirmed that even low concentrations of SB-Ag₂S QDs were able to inhibit bacterial (MIC 5–75 μg mL⁻¹) and fungal growth (MIC 80–310 μg mL⁻¹), and in some cases they performed better than streptomycin (8–25 μg mL⁻¹). Lethality bioassay results confirmed that SB-Ag₂S QDs were not toxic to brine shrimp (Artemia salina). The results show that capping agents are essential in the design of functional Ag₂S QDs, and highlight that Schiff bases provide an excellent opportunity to optimize the biological activities of silver based QDs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia salina 3aBacillus subtilis 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aantimicrobial properties 3abioassays 3adeath 3afungal growth 3afungi 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3apathogens 3asilver 3asilver sulfide 3astreptomycin 3asynthesis 3atoxicity1 aTaha, Hussein1 aS.

Despite the presence of several valuable components in the fish processing discards, the latter are usually dumped into landfills or at sea, having potentially harmful environmental effects or end up as low commercial value products (e.g., white fish meal). Still, fish processing by-products can be considered as an alternative raw material for the preparation of high-protein ingredients, especially for the production of food grade gelatin due to the presence of large amounts of collagen in fish skins, scales, and bones. Although fish gelatin is an alternative to the commercially available mammalian gelatins, its production on a large commercial scale has been hampered, mainly, due to the inferior quality characteristics compared to its mammalian counterparts. This review article summarizes and highlights the potential utilization of by-products generated during fish processing for gelatin extraction. Furthermore, several technical challenges and directions of ongoing research are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abones 3abyproducts 3acollagen 3afish 3afish meal 3afish processing 3afish skin 3afood production 3agelatin 3aingredients 3alandfills 3amammals 3araw materials 0aFish processing by-products 0afish gelatin 0agelatin manufacture 0afish skins 0afish scales 0afish bones1 aZotos, Anastasios0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 25, no. 1 p.65-92dTaylor & Francisx1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2013.8277673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02662naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002200188245009100210300001800301506007600319520137700395592002801772506003701800650002301837650002001860650001201880650001601892650001101908650001901919650001801938650001501956650001901971650001601990700001802006700002602024773011202050856008102162852000902243655001202252IND60548053620221207130958.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054805362DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2062-32doi7 aPMC49787692pmcid7 a270522082pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAdamczyk, Michał10aCO2 Biofixation and Growth Kinetics of Chlorella vulgaris and Nannochloropsis gaditana  ap. 1248-1261.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCO₂ biofixation was investigated using tubular bioreactors (15 and 1.5 l) either in the presence of green algae Chlorella vulgaris or Nannochloropsis gaditana. The cultivation was carried out in the following conditions: temperature of 25 °C, inlet-CO₂ of 4 and 8 vol%, and artificial light enhancing photosynthesis. Higher biofixation were observed in 8 vol% CO₂ concentration for both microalgae cultures than in 4 vol%. Characteristic process parameters such as productivity, CO₂ fixation, and kinetic rate coefficient were determined and discussed. Simplified and advanced methods for determination of CO₂ fixation were compared. In a simplified method, it is assumed that 1 kg of produced biomass equals 1.88 kg recycled CO₂. Advance method is based on empirical results of the present study (formula with carbon content in biomass). It was observed that application of the simplified method can generate large errors, especially if the biomass contains a relatively low amount of carbon. N. gaditana is the recommended species for CO₂ removal due to a high biofixation rate—more than 1.7 g/l/day. On day 10 of cultivation, the cell concentration was more than 1.7 × 10⁷ cells/ml. In the case of C. vulgaris, the maximal biofixation rate and cell concentration did not exceed 1.4 g/l/day and 1.3 × 10⁷ cells/ml, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aChlorella vulgaris 3aNannochloropsis 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3agrowth models 3amicroalgae 3aphotosynthesis 3atemperature1 aLasek, Janusz1 aSkawińska, Agnieszka0 tApplied biochemistry and biotechnology.g2016 Aug., v. 179, no. 7 p.1248-1261dSpringer USx0273-22897nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-016-2062-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02608naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006100142245007700203300001800280500001900298520115100317592002801468650002101496650002201517650003001539650001801569650003701587650002501624700006001649700005401709700001601763700001801779700001801797700001801815700005701833700002101890700005501911773014701966856007602113852000902189655001202198IND60732638620221120113359.0210331e20201201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073263862DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c101752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStonemeyer, Scott1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8135-562510aStabilization of NbTe₃, VTe₃, and TiTe₃ via Nanotube Encapsulation  ap. 4563-4568.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe structure of MX₃ transition metal trichalcogenides (TMTs, with M a transition metal and X a chalcogen) is typified by one-dimensional (1D) chains weakly bound together via van der Waals interactions. This structural motif is common across a range of M and X atoms (e.g., NbSe₃, HfTe₃,TaS₃), but not all M and X combinations are stable. We report here that three new members of the MX₃ family which are not stable in bulk, specifically NbTe₃, VTe₃, and TiTe₃, can be synthesized in the few- (2–4) to single-chain limit via nanoconfined growth within the stabilizing cavity of multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) reveal the chain-like nature and the detailed atomic structure. The synthesized materials exhibit behavior unique to few-chain quasi-1D structures, such as few-chain spiraling and a trigonal antiprismatic rocking distortion in the single-chain limit. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide insight into the crystal structure and stability of the materials, as well as their electronic structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon nanotubes 3acrystal structure 3adensity functional theory 3aencapsulation 3atransmission electron microscopy 3avan der Waals forces1 aCain, Jeffrey D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9244-42711 aOh, Sehoon1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0518-40911 aAzizi, Amin1 aElasha, Malik1 aThiel, Markus1 aSong, Chengyu1 aErcius, Peter1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6762-99761 aCohen, Marvin L.1 aZettl, Alex1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6330-136X0 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2020 Dec. 01, v. 143, no. 12 p.4563-4568dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c101753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02810naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001500139245015400154300001600308500001500324520141500339592002801754650001901782650002701801650001001828650002301838650001101861650002301872650001201895650001201907650002101919650002601940650003401966650002302000650001602023650001502039650000902054651002002063653003202083700001702115700001602132773012202148856007302270852000902343655001202352IND60132533420221118173016.0150505e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013253342DNAL7 a10.1111/avj.123162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLanyon, SR10aSurvey of farmer knowledge and attitudes to endemic disease management in South Australia, with a focus on bovine viral diarrhoea (bovine pestivirus)  ap. 157-163.  a2019-12-04  aOBJECTIVE: We aimed to establish the attitudes of South Australian cattle farmers towards endemic animal disease prevention and control, with a particular focus on the awareness of and attitudes towards bovine viral diarrhoea (BVD). METHODS: This cross‐sectional postal survey involved mailing a questionnaire to all South Australian cattle owners with 35 or more head of cattle. RESULTS: Worms and lice were the most common animal disease concerns. Less than half of responding farmers were adequately vaccinating their herds against clostridial diseases, but 53.0% stated that they utilised quarantine procedures. Less than 20% of respondents had actively taken part in BVD educational opportunities, or had vaccinated or tested their herd for BVD; less than 20% of respondents were actively involved in any systematic control of Johne's disease. Overall, farmers’ actual knowledge of BVD was lower than their perceived understanding, although their interest in BVD and its control was high. CONCLUSIONS: Disease prevention measures such as vaccination, quarantine and participation in systematic control schemes were used by a minority of respondents. The results suggest that respondents acknowledge BVD as an important and relevant disease, despite many believing it was not a problem in their herd. Interest in BVD appears to be high and it is likely that an education program would be well received.  aPublisher supplied data 3aquestionnaires 3aattitudes and opinions 3aherds 3adisease prevention 3acattle 3aeducation programs 3afarmers 3asurveys 3aparatuberculosis 3abovine viral diarrhea 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aindigenous species 3avaccination 3aquarantine 3alice 3aSouth Australia 0aBovine viral diarrhea virus1 aAnderson, ML1 aReichel, MP0 tAustralian veterinary journal.g2015 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.157-163dAustralian Veterinary Association]x0005-04237nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/avj.123163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03126naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245013500161300002000296520140100316592002801717650001401745650002101759650001901780650001601799650002701815650001301842650001601855650001801871650002301889650001301912650001901925650001401944650002101958650001901979650002801998650001702026653002202043653002502065653001402090653003002104653002902134700001802163700001902181700002402200700005702224700001602281700005902297773014102356856007802497852000902575655001202584IND60685544020221119163628.0200304e20200211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068554402DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.0c003312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJain, Poonam10aSerotonin–Stearic Acid Bioconjugate-Coated Completely Biodegradable Mn₃O₄ Nanocuboids for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Targeting  ap. 10170-10182.  aIn this study, a serotonin–stearic acid (ST-SA)-based bioconjugate was synthesized for the surface modification of manganese oxide-based nanocuboids (MNCs) for delivering of anticancer drug (i.e., doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX)) to human liver cancer cells. MNCs were synthesized by chemical precipitation method, and their surface was modified with ST-SA bioconjugate for targeting of MNCs to cancer cells. The ST-SA@MNCs along with DOX showed good colloidal stability, high drug encapsulation (98.3%), and drug loading efficiencies (22.9%) as well as pH-responsive biodegradation. Coating with ST-SA conjugate provided a shield to MNCs which sustained their degradation in an acidic environment. The release of DOX was higher (81.4%) in acidic media than under the physiological conditions (20.5%) up to 192 h. The in vitro anti-proliferation assay showed that ST-SA@MNCs exhibit higher cell growth inhibition compared to that of pure DOX after 48 h of treatment. The cellular uptake and apoptosis studies revealed the enhanced uptake of ST-SA@MNCs in contrast to the MNCs due to overexpressed ST receptor on hepatocellular carcinoma cells and triggered the generation of reactive oxygen species in the cells. Therefore, these results indicated that the DOX-loaded, ST-SA stabilized MNCs improved the therapeutic index of DOX and would be a promising therapeutic candidate for tumor therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aapoptosis 3abiodegradability 3abiodegradation 3acell growth 3achemical precipitation 3acoatings 3adoxorubicin 3aencapsulation 3agrowth retardation 3ahepatoma 3ahuman diseases 3amanganese 3amanganese oxides 3aneoplasm cells 3areactive oxygen species 3atherapeutics 0aMn3O4 nanocuboids 0asurface modification 0aserotonin 0adoxorubicin hydrochloride 0ahepatocellular carcinoma1 aBhagat, Stuti1 aTunki, Lakshmi1 aJangid, Ashok Kumar1 aSingh, Sanjay1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6256-70911 aPooja, Deep1 aKulhari, Hitesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1834-11320 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 9 p.10170-10182dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c003313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04213naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002500150245013100175520268700306592002802993650002003021650001303041650002303054650001503077650001403092650001503106650001003121650000903131650001103140650002703151650001003178650001603188650001403204650001903218650002803237650001103265650001103276650002003287650001503307650001103322653003003333653002103363653001803384700002103402700002003423700002603443700001903469773010103488856008503589852000903674655001203683IND60787541920221121095846.0221004e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078754192DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2022.1050432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIntawicha, Payungsuk10aEffects of breeding season and estrus synchronization protocols on the fertility of anestrus swamp buffaloes (Bubalus Bubalis)  aThe present study aimed to investigate the seasonal calving pattern of the swamp buffaloes and to test various estrus synchronization protocols and breeding treatments to improve the reproductive efficiency of the anestrous female buffaloes. In Study 1, we first investigated the breeding records of female buffaloes in the Phayao Animal Breeding and Research Center (PABRC) from year 2004 to 2013, aiming to compare the calving rates in three different breeding seasons, i.e. winter season (Oct. – Jan., Group 1), rainy season (Jun. – Sep., Group 2), and summer season (Feb. – Apr., Group 3). We found that the best average calving rate was observed in the winter season (74%) compared to other seasons (11-15%). Therefore, all the protocols tested in Study 2 were only compared during the winter season. In Study 2, different synchronization protocols were compared based on the resulting conception rates and the cost of estrus induction for postpartum anestrous buffaloes under field conditions during the winter season. Sixty buffalo cows were allocated to the following treatment groups by completely randomized design. The estrous cycle of buffalo cows was synchronized by Norgestomet ear implant (Norgestomet, n=30, T1), controlled internal drug release (CIDR, n=30, T2), or ovulation synchronization (Ovsynch, n=30, T3) protocols. Results from Study 1 showed that, in the winter season, buffalo cows had the highest birth rate (74.1%, 291/393), compared to the rainy (14.8%, 58/393) and summer (11.2%, 44/393) seasons. The weaning weight of buffaloes born in the rainy season was greater than their summer and winter counterparts (p < 0.05). The average daily gain (ADG) of summer-born buffaloes was higher than those born in the rainy and the winter seasons (p < 0.01). Results for Study 2 showed no differences in behavioral estrus, clear mucus discharge and dilation of cervical passage among all treatment groups (p > 0.05). However, the pregnancy rate detected by ultrasonography 90 days after TAI and the parturition rate in the Ovsynch group were all 53.3%, which was higher (p < 0.01) than CIDR (40.0%) and Norgestomet (30.0%) treated groups. Moreover, the average cost for those cows treated with CIDR protocols was higher than those with Norgestomet and Ovsynch protocols. In conclusion, breeding in winter season can result in a better birth rate in swamp buffaloes. Adoption of the Ovsynch may have triggered the ovarian activity of buffaloes and have resulted in more than half of the anestrous postpartum swamp buffaloes becoming pregnancy and parturition, as well as simultaneously lowering the cost compared to other synchronization procedures.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBubalus bubalis 3aanestrus 3aaverage daily gain 3abirth rate 3abuffaloes 3aconception 3adrugs 3aears 3aestrus 3aestrus synchronization 3amucus 3anorgestomet 3aovulation 3apregnancy rate 3areproductive efficiency 3asummer 3aswamps 3aultrasonography 3awet season 3awinter 0aOvulation synchronization 0aBreeding seasons 0aSwamp buffalo1 awichapon, Jakkit1 aKlamrak, Monpak1 aDongpaleethun, Chayut1 aJu, Jyh Cherng0 tLivestock science.g2022 Oct., v. 264 p.105043-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2022.1050433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02930naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245017400176300001600350520110100366592002801467650001801495650001401513650001101527650002301538650002501561650002601586650001001612650002201622650001501644650001401659650001901673650002601692650002501718650002001743650001101763650002501774650001301799651001401812651001101826653000801837653002101845653002401866653001401890653001501904700001901919700006701938700002302005700002502028700002502053700006702078773011502145856008302260852000902343655001202352IND60618442720221119041839.0200210e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061844272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2018.10.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarvalho-Batista, Abner10aGenetic comparison of the red shrimp Pleoticus muelleri (Decapoda: Solenoceridae) using the barcode gene reveals the absence of cryptic speciation along its distribution  ap. 392-399.  aDifferences in biological traits (abundance, longevity, size at the onset of sexual maturity, and maximum size) appearing in populations of Pleoticus muelleri from the Western Atlantic are currently considered as phenotypic plasticity. However, they may also be related to intraspecific genetic differentiation and to the occurrence of cryptic speciation. Thus, to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of P. muelleri along its distribution range, we compared cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI; the barcode gene) and 16S sequences of individuals from seven localities from the southeastern coast of Brazil and Argentina. Ten polymorphic sites were observed in eleven COI haplotypes, but only one polymorphic site was observed in two 16S haplotypes. The haplotype network, maximum likelihood phylogram, and analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated the absence of genetic structure between populations, which in turn, points to the absence of cryptic speciation. Therefore, the known phenotypic variations may be indeed a consequence of different environmental conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSolenoceridae 3abarcoding 3acoasts 3acryptic speciation 3acytochrome-c oxidase 3aenvironmental factors 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3ahaplotypes 3alongevity 3amarine science 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apopulation structure 3asexual maturity 3ashrimp 3astatistical analysis 3avariance 3aArgentina 3aBrazil 0aCOI 0aDendrobranchiata 0aGenetic variability 0aHaplotype 0aPenaeoidea1 aNegri, Mariana1 aTamburus, Ana Francisca1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1659-12901 aCosta, Rogério C.1 aCastilho, Antonio L.1 aZara, Fernando José1 aMantelatto, Fernando L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8497-187X0 tRegional studies in marine science.g2018 Nov., v. 24 p.392-399dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2018.10.0033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02534naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132100001900150245006300169300001400232520133600246592002801582650002501610650002601635650002001661650002301681650002301704650001901727650000901746650001101755650002601766650001101792650003301803650002001836650001301856650001801869650001101887700001701898700002001915773008201935856008602017852000902103655001202112IND4468936620221119024652.0141111e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446893662DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBanach, Ulrich10aMultigas sensors for the quality control of spice mixtures  ap. 23-27.  aSpices have an important impact on daily aliment. Changes of their quality resulting in far reaching consequences in different foodstuffs and imply financial losing and even health hazard. In this study it is demonstrated that application of two different portable multi gas sensors (electronic nose and ion mobility spectrometer) supported by multivariate data analysis can contribute to ensure quality control of spice mixtures and to find out product adulteration. Headspace above spice mixtures for sausages and saveloy and product counterfeitings was investigated by a metal oxide based electronic nose (e-nose of KAMINA-type). Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) of sensor resistivity data was performed for differentiation. Simultaneously an ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) was coupled to the emission chamber for detection of gaseous components above spice mixtures. The measured spectra show differences between the two spice mixtures and were discussed using a principal component analysis (PCA). The two multi gas sensors permit discrimination between the types of spice mixtures and can indicate product adulteration. Additionally, a headspace gas analysis by gas chromatography was performed to identify the main volatile components and to prove the chemical basis for the observed differences of the multi gas sensors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadulterated products 3adiscriminant analysis 3aelectronic nose 3agas chromatography 3aheadspace analysis 3ahealth hazards 3aions 3ametals 3amultivariate analysis 3aoxides 3aprincipal component analysis 3aquality control 3asausages 3aspectrometers 3aspices1 aTiebe, Carlo1 aHübert, Thomas0 tFood control.g2012 July, v. 26, no. 1 p.23-27dElsevier Ltdx0956-71357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2012.01.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01901naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245009800154300001800252500001900270520086400289592002801153650000801181650001701189650001701206700001501223700001701238700001601255700001601271700005601287773014701343856007601490852000901566655001201575IND60732638820221120113312.0210331e20210318xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073263882DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.0c112452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Jin10aDNA-Based Dynamic Mimicry of Membrane Proteins for Programming Adaptive Cellular Interactions  ap. 4585-4592.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCells sense and respond to the external environment, mainly through proteins presented on the membrane where their expression and conformation are dynamically regulated via intracellular programs.

The method was tested as a simple tool for use by catchment managers concerned with controlling erosion. The geology of the 58 km2 catchment comprises two distinct formations: basalt in the upper catchment with a characteristically high magnetic susceptibility and shales with a low magnetic susceptibility in the lower catchment. Application of an unmixing model incorporating a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis showed that Xlf provided a means to assign the proportion of each geological province contributing to the river's sediment load. Grab water samples were collected at ten-minute intervals during flood events for subsequent analysis of suspended sediment concentration and the magnetic susceptibility of the filtered sediment. Two floods are presented in detail, the first represents a significant event at the start of the wet season (max. discharge 32 m3 s−1); the second was a smaller flood (max discharge 14 m3 s−1) that occurred a month later. Suspended sediment concentrations during the twelve monitored events showed a characteristic decline over the wet season. The main source of suspended sediment was shown to be from the mudstones in the lower catchment, which contributed 86% of the total measured load. The sediment dynamics during the two floods monitored in detail were quite different from each other. In the first the sediment concentration was high (11 g L−1), peaking after the flood peak. The Xlf value increased during the event, indicating that contribution to the sediment load from basalt in the upper catchment increased during the recession limb. In the second, smaller flood the sediment peak (6 g L−1) coincided with the flood peak. Low Xlf values indicated that mudstones in the lower catchment soils dominated the sediment load throughout the entire event. Sediment tracing using a single property (Xlf) was thus used effectively to study changing sediment sources both between and during a flood event in a catchment with strongly contrasting magnetic signatures in different areas. The results support the use of magnetic susceptibility as a simple and cheap tool to determine sediment provenance that can be used to guide catchment restoration in similar environments.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3afloods 3amodels 3apollution load 3aprovenance 3arivers 3asediment yield 3asoil 3astorms 3asuspended sediment 3auncertainty analysis 3awatersheds 3awet season 3aSouth Africa 0aSuspended sediment 0aSediment tracing 0aMagnetic susceptibility 0aCatchment restoration1 avan der Waal, Bennie W.1 aPulley, Simon0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 June 01, v. 194 p.54-62dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03708naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006100147245017200208520218800380592002802568650002002596650001202616650000902628650001402637650002902651650001102680650002102691650001502712650002302727650001702750650001602767650000902783650001802792650000902810650001602819650001302835653002302848653002702871653002802898653001902926700005802945700002603003773011803029856008203147852000903229655001203238IND60741923420221118052308.0210806e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074192342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJalālī, Mahdī,1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2939-994310aImpact of sewage sludge, nanoparticles, and clay minerals addition on cucumber growth, phosphorus uptake, soil phosphorus status, and potential risk of phosphorus loss  aThere is little information about the impact of sewage sludge, nanoparticles, and clay minerals on cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) growth and phosphorus content in different plant parts. In this study we treated a soil with different rates of sewage sludge (1%, 5%, and 10%), along with two nanoparticles (SiO₂ and nano-montmorillonite at 0 and 1%), and two clay minerals (zeolite and vermiculite at 0 and 3%). We aimed at investigating the impact of these amendments on cucumber growth, phosphorus content in root, shoot, and fruit, phosphorus content in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, and determining the impact of these amendments on the potential risk of phosphorus loss from soil. Plant growth in the soil treated with sewage sludge at 1% and 5% was higher than that at 10% sewage sludge, while the cucumber in the 10% sewage sludge plus 1% nano-montmorillonite-treated soil dried out. Phosphorus content in fruit was higher than in root and phosphorus in root was higher than that in shoot. Cucumber plant in the 10% sewage sludge treated soil had the highest amount of phosphorus compared to the other treatments, while plants in the nanoparticles and clay minerals treatments had lower content of phosphorus than the control. The highest phosphorus content was extracted from soil treated with 10% sewage sludge, while the lowest was extracted from the soil treated with nanoparticles and clay minerals. In average of all treatments, soil phosphorus extracted by water-extractable phosphorus in the rhizosphere soil was higher than phosphorus in the non-rhizosphere soil. The results indicated that calcium chloride-extractable phosphorus was more effective in predicting phosphorus uptake than water-extractable phosphorus and Olsen-extractable phosphorus. Also, the soil treated with sewage sludge at 5% and 10% would potentially increase the risk of phosphorus losses. We concluded that the soil treated with 1% sewage sludge, with or without nanoparticles or clay minerals, could provide the amount of phosphorus required for the growth of cucumber, while there was no obvious potential risk of phosphorus loss, making this treatment more beneficial for cucumber.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCucumis sativus 3acalcium 3aclay 3acucumbers 3aenvironmental technology 3afruits 3alosses from soil 3aphosphorus 3aphosphorus content 3aplant growth 3arhizosphere 3arisk 3asewage sludge 3asoil 3avermiculite 3azeolites 0aCucumis sativus L. 0aPhosphorus application 0aPhosphorus availability 0aCritical level1 aJalali, Mohsen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2939-99431 aAntoniadis, Vasileios0 tEnvironmental technology & innovation.g2021 Aug., v. 23 p.101702-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23259x2352-18647nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eti.2021.1017023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03196naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002100135245010100156300001600257520194500273592002802218650001002246650001202256650002202268650001202290650001102302650001502313650001002328650002202338650001402360650001402374650001502388651001602403653002302419653002602442653003302468653001702501653001702518700001802535700002902553773008802582856007102670852000902741655001202750IND4475848420221119102849.0180525s2012    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447584842DNAL7 a10.1071/WR110872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoare, Joanne M.10aCan correlated population trends among forest bird species be predicted by similarity in traits?  ap. 469-477.  aContext Many conservation decisions rely on the assumption that multiple populations will respond similarly to management. However, few attempts have been made to evaluate correlated population responses to management or to identify traits that could be used to predict correlations. These assumptions are central to the use of the ‘population indicator-species concept’ (the idea that population trends of one species can be used as an index of trends in other species) for measuring the effects of key ecological drivers. Aims We investigated correlations among bird population trends in a mixed podocarp–hardwood forest in New Zealand in which introduced mammalian pests are controlled. We analysed trends in the abundance of 18 bird species (primarily passerines) over a 10-year period, using data from 5-min bird counts. Methods We used a Bayesian modelling approach to identify short-term correlations in population trends among species and to investigate whether ecological traits can be used to predict these correlated trends. Key results Population increases were detected in 9 of the 18 bird species over the 10-year period of the study. Population trends were correlated for 10% of species pairs (of which 81% were positive correlations). Correlations among seven of the nine species that increased in abundance were always positive; these species form a potential indicator pool. However, traits were not useful for predicting correlated population trends. Conclusions Bird species affected by a shared ecological driver (predation) can exhibit correlated population trends when introduced predators are controlled, but correlations cannot be predicted by similarity in ecological traits. Implications We advocate for testing consistency of correlations at multiple sites so as to validate the evidence-based use of the population indicator-species concept as a cost-effective alternative to monitoring whole communities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abirds 3aforests 3aindicator species 3amammals 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apests 3apopulation growth 3apredation 3apredators 3aprediction 3aNew Zealand 0aBayesian inference 0aecological indicators 0amanagement indicator species 0apoint counts 0apest control1 aMonks, Adrian1 aO’Donnell, Colin F.

We compared an outranking-facilitated assessment of actions with a simple and direct (baseline) ranking of the same actions by the participating stakeholders in terms of: 1) internal homogeneity of each assessment approach, (2) similarity of individual assessments between methods, and (3) effects of the use of implicit/explicit assessment criteria. The actions assessed combined various management approaches, including livestock management (rotation, resting), vegetation management (grass seeding, brush control), and hydraulic structures (dams, dykes). The outranking-facilitated assessment discriminated better between actions and reduced the variability of results between individual stakeholders as compared with the direct ranking of actions. In general, the two assessments significantly differed in the relative preference of the five management actions assessed, yet both assessments identified rotational grazing combined with vegetation management (grass seeding and brush control) as the most preferred management action in the study area. The comparative analysis revealed inconsistencies between the use of implicit and explicit assessment criteria. Our findings highlight the opportunities offered by outranking approaches to help capture, structure, and make explicit stakeholder perspectives in the framework of a participatory environmental assessment process, which may facilitate the understanding of the multiple preferences involved. The outranking integration process, which resembles a voting procedure, proved simple and transparent, with potential for contributing to stakeholder engagement and trust in participatory assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3abrush control 3aenvironmental assessment 3agrasses 3ahydraulic structures 3aland management 3alivestock 3amulti-criteria decision making 3arotational grazing 3asowing 3astakeholders 3avegetation 3awatersheds 3aArizona 0aDryland restoration 0aGrazing management 0aMulticriteria decision analysis 0aParticipatory assessment 0aOutranking 0aStakeholder1 aBautista, Susana1 aEdward deSteiguer, J.1 aOrr, Barron J.0 tJournal of environmental management.g2017 June 15, v. 195 p.70-77dElsevier Ltdx0301-47977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.11.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02880naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245008600165300001600251520149100267592002801758650002701786650002901813650001901842650002601861650001501887650002201902650001101924653002501935653001401960653001801974653001801992653002702010700001902037700001902056700001702075700002002092700001802112700001602130700001202146700001702158700001702175773012602192856008302318852000902401655001202410IND60774022220221120070646.0220620e20220915xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077402222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.0582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Yan-Yan10aSelf-assembly of peptide nanofibers with chirality-encoded antimicrobial activity  ap. 135-146.  aThe nanostructured antimicrobial agents, self-assembled by the antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), represent an intriguing platform for the treatment of pathogens. Although the structural characteristics significantly influence antimicrobial functionality, the role of chirality is usually ignored and still unclear. Herein, two homochiral AMPs (all L- or all D-amino acids), including C₁₆-ᴸV₄ᴸR₄ (LL) and C₁₆-ᴰV₄ᴰR₄ (DD), and a heterochiral AMP with alternating D-/L-amino acids, C₁₆-ᴰV₄ᴸR₄ (DL), were self-assembled into left-handed, right-handed, and right-handed helical nanofibers, respectively. The valine configuration determined the supramolecular chirality of the nanofibers. However, the DL molecules exhibited a highly aggregated propensity to form more stable helical nanofibers with a lower degree of twist and a larger helical pitch. This characteristic resulted in the optimal antimicrobial activity of the DL nanofibers against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Furthermore, the membrane permeability assay confirmed the higher activity for damaging the cell membrane by the DL nanofibers. These results demonstrated the significance of molecular chirality in directing the self-assembly of the amphiphilic peptides, eventually affecting their antimicrobial activity. This study opens up the possibility to fabricate promising nanostructured antimicrobial materials by controlling the chirality and structure of the materials.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimicrobial peptides 3aantimicrobial properties 3acell membranes 3amembrane permeability 3ananofibers 3aoptical isomerism 3avaline 0aAmphiphilic peptides 0aChirality 0aSelf-assembly 0aNanostructure 0aAntimicrobial activity1 aQin, Xiao-Tong1 aZhang, Jiaxing1 aSun, Mei-Yan1 aWang, Feng-Ping1 aHuang, Meimei1 aJia, Shi-Ru1 aQi, Wei1 aWang, Yuefei1 aZhong, Cheng0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2022 Sept. 15, v. 622 p.135-146dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002800150245014700178300001600325520095000341592002801291650001101319650001601330650001601346650001201362650001101374650001101385650002701396650004301423650002401466650001301490651001301503653002401516653001301540653002601553653001501579653007601594653002301670700003101693700002201724773012001746856008401866852000901950655001201959IND60479488020221120203356.0160122e20160102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047948802DNAL7 a10.1080/10498850.2013.8302792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcía-López, Mónica10aCarotenoid Pigments Composition of Two Commonly Discarded Decapod Crustaceans in Grand Sole and the Galician-Northern Portugal Coast Fisheries  ap. 114-121.  aCarotenoid composition of two commonly discarded decapod crustaceans, Liocarcinus depurator and Munida spp., was assessed in different catching months. Total carotenoid content ranged between 7 ± 1 and 22.4 ± 0.7 μ g g ⁻¹. Pigment separation was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector. Astaxanthin accounted for 21 to 50% of total carotenoids, and the remaining percentage corresponded mainly to esters of astaxanthin. The fatty acid profile of carotenoid extracts for each species was evaluated. Overall total unsaturated fatty acids content ranged from 406 to 1,631 μ g g ⁻¹. Both species were rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which on average represented 68% of total unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, the use of these low value by-catch species as a source of carotenoid pigments and fatty acids (e.g., for aquaculture formulations) is a possible alternative to their disposal at sea.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMunida 3aaquaculture 3aastaxanthin 3abycatch 3acoasts 3aesters 3afatty acid composition 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apigments 3aPortugal 0aCarotenoid pigments 0adiscards 0aLiocarcinus depurator 0aMunida spp 0ahigh performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) 0afatty acid profile1 aPérez-Martín, Ricardo I.1 aSotelo, Carmen G.0 tJournal of aquatic food product technology.g2016 Jan. 2, v. 25, no. 1 p.114-121dTaylor & Francisx1547-06367nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10498850.2013.8302793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03823naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245017500173300001600348520214400364592002802508650001702536650001102553650001702564650002302581650001502604650002602619650001402645650001902659650001802678650001902696650001502715650001302730650001902743650001602762650000902778650002202787651001302809653002602822653002402848653002302872653002302895653001102918653003702929700007202966700002403038700002403062773011503086856008303201852000903284655001203293IND60618443020221119041545.0200210e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061844302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2018.09.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatson, Stephen C.L.10aEvaluation of estuarine biotic indices to assess macro-benthic structure and functioning following nutrient remediation actions: A case study on the Eden estuary Scotland  ap. 379-391.  aDespite a wealth of methods currently proposed by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) to assess macro-benthic integrity, determining good ecological status (GES) and assessing ecosystem recovery following anthropogenic degradation is still one of the biggest challenges in marine ecology research. In this study, our aim was to test a number of commonly used structural (e.g. Shannon–Wiener, Average Taxonomic Diversity (Δ), M-AMBI) and functional indicators (e.g. BTA, BPc) currently used in benthic research and monitoring programmes on the Eden estuary (Scotland). Historically the estuary has a legacy of high nutrient conditions and was designated as a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2003, whence major management measures were implemented in order to ameliorate the risk of eutrophication symptoms. We therefore collected data on intertidal macro-benthic communities over a sixteen year interval, covering a pre-management (1999) and post-management (2015) period to assess the effectiveness of the intended restoration efforts. In the post-management period, the results suggested an improvement in the structure and functioning of the estuary as a whole, but macro-benthic assemblages responded to restoration variably along the estuarine gradient. The greatest improvements were noticed in the upper and central sites of the estuary with functional traits analysis suggesting an increased ability of these sites to provide ecosystem services associated with the benthic environment such as carbon and organic matter cycling. Generally, almost all of the structural and functional indicators detected the prevailing environmental conditions (with the exception of (Pielou’s index and Average Taxonomic Diversity (Δ)), highlighting the appropriateness of such methods to be used in monitoring the recovery of transitional systems. This research also provides a robust baseline to monitor further management actions in the Eden estuary and provides evidence that notable reductions in nitrate concentrations resulting from NVZ designations may result in significant improvements to benthic structure and functioning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abenthic zone 3acarbon 3acase studies 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3alittoral zone 3amarine science 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3aorganic matter 3aremediation 3arisk 3aspecies diversity 3aScotland 0aEcological indicators 0aMacro-invertebrates 0aEstuarine recovery 0aEcological quality 0aM-AMBI 0aBiological traits analysis (BTA)1 aPaterson, D.

RAF isoforms are commonly mutated oncogenes that serve as effector kinases in MAP kinase signaling. BRAF/CRAF heterodimers are believed to be the primary RAF signaling species, and many RAF inhibitors lead to a “paradoxical activation” of RAF kinase activity through transactivation of the CRAF protomer; this leads to resistance mechanisms and secondary tumors. It has been hypothesized that CRAF-selective inhibition might bypass paradoxical activation, but no CRAF-selective inhibitor has been reported and the consequences of pharmacologically inhibiting CRAF have remained unknown. Here, we use bio-orthogonal ligand tethering (BOLT) to selectively target inhibitors to CRAF. Our results suggest that selective CRAF inhibition promotes paradoxical activation and exemplify how BOLT may be used to triage potential targets for drug discovery before any target-selective small molecules are known.  aPublisher supplied data 3adrugs 3aligands 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3aoncogenes 3aprotein isoforms 3aprotein subunits 3atranscriptional activation1 aDale, Ian L.1 aThomas, Andrew P.1 aHunt, James1 aChin, Jason W.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1219-47570 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2021 Mar. 22, v. 143, no. 12 p.4600-4606dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c119583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01800naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001200150245009300162300001400255520052100269592002800790650002300818650001700841650001100858650001900869650002300888653002600911653002300937653003100960653001700991700001801008700001801026700001801044700001601062700001601078700001801094700001601112700001801128773013801146856008501284852000901369655001201378IND60787542620221121064900.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078754262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytol.2022.07.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSu, Xin10aThree new 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones from ‘Chong-lou’ agarwood of Aquilaria sinensis  ap. 86-90.  aThree new 2-(2-phenylethyl)chromones (1, 2 and 3), together with four known analogues 4~7 were isolated from ‘Chong-lou’ agarwood originating from Aquilaria sinensis for the first time.

Among the numerous plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) that colonize the rhizosphere of agronomically important crops, Azospirillum brasilense has been shown to exert strong stimulating activities on plants, by inducing alterations of the root architecture and an improvement of mineral nutrition, which could result from an enhancement of ion uptake mechanisms as well as by increased bioavailability of nutrients. Some studies have also established that A. brasilense can act as biocontrol agent, by preventing the growth and/or virulence of phytopathogens, most likely through the production of microbial siderophores that sequester Fe from the soil. Despite microbial siderophores complexed with Fe could be an easily accessible Fe source for plants, the possible involvement of A. brasilense in improving Fe nutrition in plants suffering from the micronutrient deficiency has not been investigated yet. Within the present research, the characterization of the physiological and biochemical effects induced by Fe starvation and PGPR inoculation in cucumber plants (Cucumis sativus L. cv. Chinese Long) was carried out. The analyses of root exudates released by hydroponically grown plants highlighted that cucumber plants respond differently depending on the nutritional status. In addition, following the cultivation period on calcareous soil, also the root exudates found in the extracts suggested a peculiar behaviour of plants as a function of the treatment. Interestingly, the presence of the inoculum in soil allowed a faster recovery of cucumber plants from Fe-deficiency symptoms, i.e. increase in the chlorophyll content, in the biomass and in the Fe content of leaves. These observations might suggest a feasible application of A. brasilense in alleviating symptoms generated by Fe-limiting growth condition in cucumber plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAzospirillum brasilense 3aCucumis sativus 3abioavailability 3abiochemical pathways 3abiological control agents 3abiomass 3acalcareous soils 3achlorophyll 3acrops 3acucumbers 3ahydroponics 3ainoculum 3aion transport 3airon 3aleaves 3anutrients 3aplant growth-promoting rhizobacteria 3aplant nutrition 3aplant pathogens 3arhizosphere 3aroot exudates 3asiderophores 3asolubility 3astarvation 3auptake mechanisms 3avirulence 0aAzospirillum brasilense 0aCucumis sativus L. 0aFe-deficiency 0aFe mobilization 0aRhizosphere 0aBiofertilization 0aPlant growth-promoting rhizobacteria1 aPenn, Alexander1 aTerzano, Roberto1 aCrecchio, Carmine1 aMimmo, Tanja1 aCesco, Stefano0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Feb., v. 87 p.45-52dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.12.0143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02713naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245008300164300001600247520158000263592002801843650002001871650001101891650001901902650001301921650001701934650002301951650002401974650002701998650001702025650001002042650001102052650001802063650001902081700002302100700001902123773011602142856004802258852000902306655001202315IND50064273020221119024808.0130327e201304  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006427302DNAL7 a10.1007/s11627-012-9488-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Guoquan10aAdditive effects of three auxins and copper on sorghum in vitro root induction  ap. 191-197.  aA healthy root system is vital for tissue culture plantlet survival and rapid adaptation from the in vitro microenvironment to glasshouse conditions. Optimization of the root induction medium is an effective way to promote root induction and elongation. Levels of three auxins (α-naphthaleneacetic acid [NAA], 3-indoleacetic acid [IAA], and 3-indolebutyric acid [IBA]) and copper sulfate (CuSO₄) have been investigated in a series of experiments with a sorghum inbred line, Tx430. Significant improvement in root proliferation and shoot growth were observed on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1 μmol/L CuSO₄, 1 mg/L NAA, 1 mg/L IAA, and 1 mg/L IBA. On average, one explant (the original in vitro-derived shoot) of Tx430 regenerated 56.7 roots, which was 20-fold higher on the optimal medium than on MS control medium. Another tested genotype SA281 showed similar response patterns as Tx430 across media. In addition, 100% of Tx430 and SA281 plantlets originating from the optimized root induction medium all survived after being transferred to potting soil in the glasshouse. The results demonstrate that a combination of auxins (NAA, IAA, and IBA) and CuSO₄ together at optimal concentrations provide additive effects on promoting root proliferation and explant growth of in vitro sorghum in root induction medium, and subsequently resulted in 100% survival rate of plantlets ex tissue culture. Compared with two published and frequently used root induction media, the optimized medium significantly enhanced root induction and plantlet growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditive effect 3acopper 3acopper sulfate 3agenotype 3ainbred lines 3aindole acetic acid 3aindole butyric acid 3anaphthaleneacetic acid 3aroot systems 3aroots 3ashoots 3asurvival rate 3atissue culture1 aGilding, Edward K.1 aGodwin, Ian D.0 tIn vitro cellular & developmental biology.g2013 Apr., v. 49, no. 2 p.191-197dSpringer-Verlagx1054-54767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11627-012-9488-2  aDNAL 7aarticle02358naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012100169300001600290520111600306592002801422650001901450650002701469650001601496650004201512650001501554650001401569650001601583650001701599650001401616650001901630650001701649650002001666650001301686700001801699700002401717773012801741856008201869852000901951655001201960IND60089402120221119130137.0141102e20110610xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008940212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuehler, Paul W.10aSodium nitrite induces acute central nervous system toxicity in guinea pigs exposed to systemic cell-free hemoglobin  ap. 412-417.  aSystemic cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) released via hemolysis disrupts vascular homeostasis, in part, through the scavenging of nitric oxide (NO). Sodium nitrite (NaNO₂) therapy can attenuate the hypertensive effects of Hb. However, the chemical reactivity of NaNO₂ with Hb may enhance heme- or iron-mediated toxicities. Here, we investigate the effect of NaNO₂ on the central nervous system (CNS) in guinea pigs exposed to systemic cell-free Hb. Intravascular infusion of NaNO₂, at doses sufficient to alleviate Hb-mediated blood pressure changes, reduced the expression of occludin, but not zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) or claudin-5, in cerebral tight junctions 4h after Hb infusion. This was accompanied by increased perivascular heme oxygenase-1 expression, neuronal iron deposition, increased astrocyte and microglial activation, and reduced expression of neuron-specific nuclear protein (NeuN). These CNS changes were not observed in animals treated with Hb or NaNO₂ alone. Taken together, these findings suggest that the use of nitrite salts to treat systemic Hb exposure may promote acute CNS toxicity.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood pressure 3acentral nervous system 3aguinea pigs 3aheme oxygenase (biliverdin-producing) 3ahemoglobin 3ahemolysis 3ahomeostasis 3anitric oxide 3aoccludins 3asodium nitrite 3atherapeutics 3atight junctions 3atoxicity1 aButt, Omer I.1 aD’Agnillo, Felice0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 10, v. 409, no. 3 p.412-417dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01926naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002200140245010500162300001600267520082700283592002801110650000901138650002501147650001401172650001201186650001801198650001301216650002301229650001201252650001101264650001201275651001301287700001901300773016201319856007401481852000901555655001201564IND60132534120221118173604.0150505e201506  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013253412DNAL7 a10.1111/cjag.120472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMicheels, Eric T.14aThe Effect of Market Orientation on Learning, Innovativeness, and Performance in Primary Agriculture  ap. 209-233.  aMarket awareness and innovativeness are important resources in any business environment. As customer needs and competitor responses change, performance may depend on the ability for firms to recognize and react to market shifts. Using survey data from beef farmers in Illinois, we examine the role market orientation, organizational learning, and innovativeness play on satisfaction with performance. We use a structural equation model to find that market‐oriented and innovative firms are more satisfied with their performance while controlling for structural and demographic variables. Results also show that while market‐oriented firms are more innovative, human capital resources moderate the ability to exploit innovations. We also find that an increase in experience correlates with less organizational learning.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeef 3abusiness enterprises 3aequations 3afarmers 3ahuman capital 3alearning 3amarket orientation 3amarkets 3amodels 3asurveys 3aIllinois1 aGow, Hamish R.0 tCanadian journal of agricultural economics.g2015 June, v. 63, no. 2 p.209-233dCanadian Agricultural Economics and Farm Management Society.x0008-39767nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cjag.120473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03061naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245011200161300001400273500001400287500002000301520143900321592002801760596001401788596005701802596007701859596003401936650002001970650002301990650001202013650001802025650001402043650001102057650001802068650001202086650002802098650002002126650001902146650001002165650001402175650001702189650001602206700002102222700001602243700002002259700006002279773012202339856007302461852000902534655001202543IND60683358120221120161106.0200208e202003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068335812DNAL7 a10.1111/gfs.124592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSousa, Dannylo O.12aA two‐year comparison on nutritive value and yield of eight lucerne cultivars and one red clover cultivar  ap. 76-85.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aRed clover (Trifolium pratense) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) are among the most common legume species used for ruminant feeding systems. Besides the greater nutritive quality and first‐year ley yield compared to lucerne, red clover decreases its yield over the years. However, under unfavourable soil conditions the persistency of lucerne can be compromised, not performing as expected. This study compared yield and chemical composition of eight lucerne cultivars and one tetraploid red clover cultivar, with similar growth capacity as lucerne, replicated over two years. In the second year, four lucerne cultivars and the red clover cultivar were analysed for crude protein (CP) fractions, dry matter and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility. A randomized block design was used with three field blocks per cultivar for the multiple comparisons within each year. There were differences in DM yield, concentrations of CP and NDF and CP fractions among the lucerne cultivars, but the differences were inconsistent between years and between growth cycles within year. The red clover cultivar had lower CP and NDF concentrations than a majority of the lucerne cultivars, and greater in vitro organic matter digestibility compared to all of the lucerne cultivars. Also, the red clover cultivar had greater rumen undegradable‐to‐degradable CP ratio but confirmed its lower yield persistency compared to the lucerne cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data  cAgroväst  cThe Rural Economy and Agricultural Society Sjuhärad  a2018/07268‐2cThe Fundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo  cSveriges Lantbruksuniversitet 3aMedicago sativa 3aTrifolium pratense 3aalfalfa 3acrude protein 3acultivars 3adesign 3adigestibility 3agrasses 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3aorganic matter 3arumen 3aruminants 3asoil quality 3atetraploidy1 aHansen, Hanne H.1 aHallin, Ola1 aNussio, Luiz G.1 aNadeau, Elisabet1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7430-21220 tGrass and forage science.g2020 Mar., v. 75, no. 1 p.76-85dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31078x0142-52427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gfs.124593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02506naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245016700166300001800333520137400351592002801725650001901753650001501772650000701787650001301794650001601807650001601823650002201839700002401861700003001885700001701915700002201932773011201954856008102066852000902147655001202156IND60548054220221122181241.0160903e201608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054805422DNAL7 a10.1007/s12010-016-2063-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlagöz, Dilek10aCovalent Immobilization and Characterization of a Novel Pullulanase from Fontibacillus sp.

The apparent K ₘ values were 1.49, 1.54, and 0.59 mg/mL pullunan, respectively, for the free and immobilized pullulanases on Florisil® and nano-silica. The corresponding apparent V ₘₐₓ values were 0.59, 1.53, and 1.57 U mg prot.⁻¹ min.⁻¹. Thermal stability of pullulanases immobilized on Florisil® and nano-silica was enhanced 6.5- and 15.6-folds, respectively at 35 °C and 6.6- and 16.0-folds, respectively, at 50 °C. The pullulanases immobilized on Florisil® and nano-silica protected 71 and 90 % of their initial activities after 10 reuses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglutaraldehyde 3ahydrolysis 3apH 3apullulan 3apullulanase 3atemperature 3athermal stability1 aYıldırım, Deniz,1 aGüvenmez, Hatice Korkmaz1 aSihay, Damla1 aTükel, S.

The enrichment degraded 120mg/L toluene within 5d in the presence of 2M NaCl or 150mg/L toluene within 7d in the presence of 1–1.5M NaCl. PCR–DGGE (polymerase chain reaction–denatured gradient gel electrophoresis) profiles demonstrated the dominant species in the enrichments distributed between five main phyla: Gammaproteobacteria, Sphingobacteriia, Prolixibacter, Flavobacteriia and Firmicutes. The Marinobacter, Prolixibacter, Balneola, Zunongwangia, Halobacillus were the dominant genus. PCR detection of genotypes involved in bacterial BETX degradation revealed that the degradation pathways contained all the known initial oxidative attack of BTEX by monooxygenase and dioxygenase. And the subsequent ring fission was catalysed by catechol 1,2-dioxygenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy profiles showed that the bacterial consortium adjusted the osmotic pressure by ectoine and hydroxyectoine as compatible solutes to acclimate the different salinity conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) 3aHalobacillus 3aMarinobacter 3abenzene 3abiodegradation 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3agenotype 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aosmotic pressure 3apolymerase chain reaction 3asalinity 3asediments 3asodium chloride 3asolutes 3atoluene 3axylene 2aBacteriaxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aBenzenexmetabolism 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aDNA Primers 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aGeologic Sedimentsxchemistry 2aPhylogeny 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aWater Microbiology 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxmetabolism 3aEast China Sea1 aZhang, Qian1 aWang, Xiao-Li1 aMa, Xing-Yuan1 aLin, Kuang-Fei1 aLiu, Yong-Di1 aGu, J.-D.,1 aLu, Shu-Guang1 aShi, Lei1 aLu, Qiang1 aShen, Ting-Ting0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Nov., v. 124 p.129-136dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2012.08.0333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02477naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245009600178520126900274592002801543650002001571650000801591650001301599650002001612650002301632650001101655650001701666650001501683650001201698650002301710650001701733650001201750651001601762653002401778653002701802653002601829700002701855773009401882856008201976852000902058655001202067IND60741923920221118052229.0211017e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074192392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.dib.2021.1071752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodriguez-Reyes, Miguel G.10aStool microbiome dataset of the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot (Amazona vittata)  aThe Puerto Rican parrot (Amazona vittata), endemic to Puerto Rico, is the only native parrot in the United States and is classified as a critically endangered species. There are two captive populations of A. vittata in Puerto Rico located in the Iguaca Aviary in El Yunque National Rainforest and the José L. Vivaldi Aviary in the Río Abajo Forest. To characterize the microbial communities of A. vittata’s stool, 21 stool samples from captive birds were collected, DNA extracted and sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Sequences were processed by removing host sequences (A. vittata genome) and low-quality reads. Taxonomic and functional profiles were generated using MG-RAST. The most abundant domain was Bacteria (96%), followed by Virus (3%), and Eukaryota (0.6%). Among the functions in the microbiome, the most abundant was related to carbohydrates (14%), followed by clustering-based subsystems (12%), protein metabolism (8%), and amino acids and derivatives (7%). This dataset describes the stool microbiome of A. vittata using a metagenomics approach. Data can be used to develop holistic conservation strategies for A. vittata and other endangered birds, as well as to search for bioprospects with potential biomedical and biotechnological applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmazona vittata 3aDNA 3aaviaries 3adata collection 3aendangered species 3agenome 3ametagenomics 3amicrobiome 3aparrots 3aprotein metabolism 3arain forests 3aviruses 3aPuerto Rico 0aPuerto Rican parrot 0aAvian stool microbiome 0aA. vittata microbiome1 aRios-Velazquez, Carlos0 tData in Brief.g2021 Aug., v. 37 p.107175-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:23203x2352-34097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.1071753Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03683naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001800146245009500164300001400259520234000273592002802613650001002641650001102651650001002662650002302672650001202695650001502707650001102722650001202733650001302745650002102758650001702779650001402796650001802810650002402828650001002852653001102862653003202873653001202905653001402917653001302931653001002944653001902954700001402973773011302987856008003100852000903180655001203189IND60479488520221120203422.0160122e20080601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047948852DNAL7 a10.1556/ComEc.9.2008.1.32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPálková, K.10aPositive relationship between plant palatability and litter decomposition in meadow plants  ap. 17-27.  aPhysical supporting or defense structures of plants, which decrease palatability, remain in plant tissue after a plant’s death and so decrease detritus decomposition rates. Consequently, palatability and detritus decomposition rate are expected to be positively correlated. Carbon is the main component of these restricting structures, whereas nitrogen is expected to increase plant attractiveness for herbivores. In this study, we tried to confirm the expected positive relationship between palatability and detritus decomposition rate and to find the species functional traits that are responsible for this concordant response. Some traits are shared by species as a consequence of their common phylogenetic history; consequently, we also studied the effect of phylogenetic correction on the expected relationships.We assessed the palatability of meadow plant species to a generalist slug Arion lusitanicus in an aquarium grazing experiment and detritus decomposition rate in a field litter-bag test. The two characteristics are positively correlated and the relationship is strengthened by phylogenetic correction. The relationship was strongest for the decomposition rates during the first three months of exposition, but weakened when the exposition period was from six months to a year. Palatability was negatively affected by plant carbon content, but no relationship was found between plant palatability and nitrogen content. Similarly, only the relationship of litter decomposition with litter carbon content was significant. The regression tree method was used to detect the influence of species traits on species palatability and detritus decomposition rate. In general, leaf dry matter content, litter carbon content and seed weight were chosen as the best predictors of plant palatability response. Results for the detritus decomposition rate response mainly reflect supporting or defensive structure contents. Litter carbon content, seed weight and plant height are the most apparent common predictors of these variable responses.In general, our study confirmed the positive relationship between plant palatability and detritus decomposition. Both plant tissue grazing and detritus decomposition are slowed down by plant tissue supportive structures, manifested as high dry matter content or high tissue carbon content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArion 3acarbon 3adeath 3adry matter content 3agrazing 3aherbivores 3aleaves 3ameadows 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3apalatability 3aphylogeny 3aplant tissues 3aregression analysis 3aslugs 0aCarbon 0aDetritus decomposition rate 0aGrazing 0aHerbivory 0aNitrogen 0aSlugs 0aSpecies traits1 aLepš, J.0 tCommunity ecology.g2008 June 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.17-27dAkadémiai KiadówJournal:J000000060x1585-85537nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ComEc.9.2008.1.33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03415naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005700150245014100207506011700348506007600465520171100541592002802252506003702280650002202317650001002339650001502349650001302364650001702377650000902394650002202403650002302425650001902448650001502467651001502482653001702497653002302514653002602537653002002563653001902583700005302602700001602655700001502671700005602686773009702742856008502839852000902924655001202933IND60787542920221207132724.0220914e202210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078754292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aeolia.2022.1008192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolesar, K.R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9771-070812aA modified resultant drift potential for more accurate prediction of sand transportation in the vicinity of the Keeler Dunes, California  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Keeler Dunes Complex is an active dune field located on the northwest corner of Owens (dry) Lake, California. Previous studies (Lancaster and McCarley-Holder, 2013) implicated the exposed surface of the Owens River Delta as the source of sediment for the Keeler Dunes based on the calculation of the Resultant Drift Potential (RDP). Measurements from sand flux monitoring stations located between the Owens River Delta and Keeler Dunes were used to determine the accuracy of using RDP for estimating actual sand transportation. It was found that the net average direction of sand transportation in this area (133°) was not accurately predicted by RDP (97°). Therefore, prior conclusions based on RDP erroneously attributed sediment from the Owens River Delta as a source for the Keeler Dunes. Since RDP calculations are widely used and a convenient method for determining the direction and magnitude of net sand transportation based on meteorological measurements, methods for modifying the RDP to achieve better agreement with sand flux measurements are desirable. Two modifications were found to improve the agreement between calculated RDP and measured sand transportation: 1) accounting for temporal variability in sediment availability (RDP = 130°), and 2) utilization of an area-specific threshold friction velocity (RDP = 129°). Combining these two modifications also resulted in good agreement (RDP = 137°) with the measured sand transportation but did not improve agreement further. These findings suggest that information about surface characteristics (sediment availability and surface roughness) are important to consider when estimating sand transportation based on wind energy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afriction velocity 3alakes 3aprediction 3aresearch 3ariver deltas 3asand 3asurface roughness 3atemporal variation 3atransportation 3awind power 3aCalifornia 0aKeeler Dunes 0aOwens River Valley 0aSediment availability 0aDrift potential 0aDune formation1 aMavko, M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7067-85331 aBurgess, E.1 aNguyen, N.1 aSchaaf, M.D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5075-12890 tAeolian research.g2022 Oct., v. 58 p.100819-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12141x1875-96377nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2022.1008193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02597naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011900164300001600283506010400299506007600403520111800479592002801597506003701625650001601662650001501678650001601693650001001709650001301719650001401732650001201746650001701758653002501775653001801800653003401818653002001852653000901872653000901881700002001890700002601910773012301936856008302059852000902142655001202151IND60774022620221207090638.0220517e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077402262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2022.04.0632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPal, Antara10aStructure and anisotropic dynamics of stimuli responsive colloidal ellipsoids at the nearest neighbor length scale  ap. 352-359.  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStimuli-responsive self-assembly of (an) isotropic colloids has resulted in a plethora of self-assembled structures with potential applications in fabricating smart materials. A lack of detailed understanding of the interplay between these self-assembled structures and the resulting dynamics has often impeded the exploitation of their full potential. Herein, we have unveiled the relationship between the field-driven self-assembled structures and the corresponding collective dynamics at the nearest neighbor length scale using X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy and magnetic colloidal ellipsoids. We demonstrate that the effective long-time collective diffusion coefficient, Deff(q), scales with the inverse of the scattered intensity for various stimuli-responsive self-assembled phases. At high-volume fraction, the system approaches a kinetically arrested state. The anisotropic slowdown of Deff(q) hints towards the formation of an oriented glass. Our approach opens new avenues for exploring the stimuli-responsive dynamics of strongly interacting colloidal systems with diverse shapes and properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-radiation 3aanisotropy 3adiffusivity 3aglass 3aisotropy 3amagnetism 3aphotons 3aspectroscopy 0aAnisotropic dynamics 0aSelf-assembly 0aMagnetic anisotropic colloids 0aLiquid crystals 0aXPCS 0aSASX1 aKamal, Md.

In order to update the yield response function of N, to make it better suited to current grassland farming, field experiments were conducted at two sites in 2015–2017 with two cultivars of timothy (Phleum pratense L.) and one of meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.). Dry matter (DM) yield, nutritive value and N balance were evaluated, with N application levels 0, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400 and 450 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹. The grasses were harvested three times per season. The data indicate that the DM yield response was significantly stronger, and N was used more efficiently for DM production than earlier without compromising the nutritive value, especially during the first two years. The third harvest produced on average 23% of the annual yield, utilizing N efficiently. N application rates below 350 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ did not cause substantial overwintering losses or lodging. The data indicate that with changing climate and improved cultivars and management practices, there is a need to modify the rates and timing of N application. The results suggest that N application levels could be increased by at least 50 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹ from the current maximum accepted rate (250 kg N ha⁻¹ year⁻¹) without too high NO₃‐ or CP concentrations in feed, or too high N balance that indicates increasing risk of N leaching.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Agricultural Fund for Rural Development: Europe investing in Rural Areas  cYara Suomi Ltd  cMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry (MMM, Makera)  cMinistry of Agriculture 3aFestuca pratensis 3aPhleum pratense 3aadministrative management 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3afertilizer rates 3afield experimentation 3aforage grasses 3agrasslands 3aleaching 3alodging 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutritive value 3aoverwintering 3arisk 3awinter1 aKorhonen, Panu1 aKykkänen, Sanna1 aKärkönen, Anna1 aToivakka, Minna1 aKauppila, Raimo1 aVirkajärvi, Perttu0 tGrass and forage science.g2020 Mar., v. 75, no. 1 p.111-126dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl31078x0142-52427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gfs.124613Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03099naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001300147245011900160300001800279520157300297592002801870650002001898650002301918650002201941650001101963650001001974650002001984650002202004650001302026650001902039650001302058650001902071650003002090650002702120650001202147650004502159700001402204700002202218700001702240700001802257700001702275700001702292700001602309700001702325700002402342700001502366773011002381856008102491852000902572655001202581IND60437518820221117174606.0151022e200404  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6043751882DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-003-1533-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPugh, T.12aA new cacao linkage map based on codominant markers: development and integration of 201 new microsatellite markers  ap. 1151-1161.  aA linkage map of cacao based on codominant markers has been constructed by integrating 201 new simple sequence repeats (SSR) developed in this study with a number of isoenzymes, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP), microsatellite markers and resistance and defence gene analogs (Rgenes-RFLP) previously mapped in cacao. A genomic library enriched for (GA)ₙ and (CA)ₙ was constructed, and 201 new microsatellite loci were mapped on 135 individuals from the same mapping population used to establish the first reference maps. This progeny resulted from a cross between two heterozygous cacao clones: an Upper-Amazon Forastero (UPA 402) and a Trinitario (UF 676). The new map contains 465 markers (268 SSRs, 176 RFLPs, five isoenzymes and 16 Rgenes-RFLP) arranged in ten linkage groups corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of cacao. Its length is 782.8 cM, with an average interval distance between markers of 1.7 cM. The new microsatellite markers were distributed throughout all linkage groups of the map, but their distribution was not random. The length of the map established with only SSRs was 769.6 cM, representing 94.8% of the total map. The current level of genome coverage is approximately one microsatellite every 3 cM. This new reference map provides a set of useful markers that is transferable across different mapping populations and will allow the identification and comparison of the most important regions involved in the variation of the traits of interest and the development of marker-assisted selection strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aTheobroma cacao 3achromosome mapping 3achromosome number 3aclones 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenomic libraries 3ahaploidy 3aheterozygosity 3aisozymes 3alinkage groups 3amarker-assisted selection 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aprogeny 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism1 aFouet, O.1 aRisterucci, A.

Bcl-2 is an oncogene, and Bcl-2 small interfering RNA (Bcl-2 siRNA) can inhibit its expression. Here, a fluorescent and gene-loading capacity vector DPL, derived from diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP), was developed for Bcl-2 siRNA-targeted delivery and tumor imaging in vitro and in vivo. The vector DPL showed a significant emission enhancement after interacting with siRNA, which was used to track the gene transfer process. Compared to commercial transfection reagent Lipo 2000, DPL obviously downregulated the Bcl-2 protein expression and exhibited excellent antitumor efficacy with less Bcl-2 siRNA. Importantly, DPL can target tumors to transport Bcl-2 siRNA to tumor sites in vivo based on the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect for effective in vivo tumor therapy. This work inspired us to design and synthesize a multifunctional gene vector for tumor targeting and gene therapy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acancer therapy 3afluorescence 3agene expression regulation 3agene therapy 3aimage analysis 3aneoplasms 3aoncogenes 3apermeability 3aprotein synthesis 3asmall interfering RNA 3atransfection 0atumor targeting 0aBcl-2 siRNA 0atumor therapy 0aliving imaging 0agene delivery1 aLiu, Xu-Ying1 aMa, Le-Le1 aLu, Zhong-Lin1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5473-28890 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2020 Feb. 11, v. 12, no. 9 p.10193-10201dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c006523Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02463naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001800150245014800168300001600316520096500332592002801297650000901325650001401334650001401348650001201362650002001374650001001394650001001404650002401414650004001438653002001478653002501498653002601523653004101549653001201590653002201602653003001624700002401654700001601678700001201694700001601706700002001722700002201742773012301764856008501887852000901972655001201981IND60543321120221118184759.0190410e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054332112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.12.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaomin10aDevelopmental patterns of emission of scent compounds and related gene expression in roses of the cultivar Rosa x hybrida cv. ‘Yves Piaget’  ap. 109-114.  a2-Phenylethanol (2PE) and 3,5-dimethoxytoluene (DMT) are characteristic scent compounds in specific roses such as Rosa x hybrida cv. ‘Yves Piaget’. We analyzed the endogenous concentrations and emission of 2PE and DMT during the unfurling process in different floral organs, as well as changes in transcript levels of the two key genes, PAR and OOMT2.The emission of both 2PE and DMT increased during floral development to reach peaks at the fully unfurled stage. The relative transcripts of PAR and OOMT2 also increased during floral development. Whereas the maximum for OOMT2 was found at the fully unfurled stage (stage 4), similar expression levels of PAR were detected at stage 4 and the senescence stage (stage 6). The results demonstrate a positive correlation between the expression levels of PAR and OOMT2 and the emission of 2PE and DMT. In addition, endogenous volatiles and relative transcripts showed tissue- and development-specific patterns.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRosa 3acultivars 3aflowering 3aflowers 3agene expression 3agenes 3aodors 3aphenylethyl alcohol 3aphotosynthetically active radiation 0a2-Phenylethanol 0a3,5-Dimethoxytoluene 0aFloral scent compound 0aRosa x hybrida cv. ‘Yves Piaget’ 0aGC–MS 0aReal time qRT-PCR 0aRelative transcript level1 aBaldermann, Susanne1 aCao, Shuyan1 aLu, Yao1 aLiu, Caixia1 aHirata, Hiroshi1 aWatanabe, Naoharu0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2015 Feb., v. 87 p.109-114dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2014.12.0163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02559naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245010800162506002800270520108000298592002801378506003701406650002001443650002001463650002001483650002401503650001001527650001201537650001301549650002301562650001301585650002101598650003201619650001001651650002001661651001801681653002201699653002201721653002101743700001901764700002501783773021001808856007402018852000902092655001202101IND60785670220221207122252.0220704e202202  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078567022DNAL7 a10.12899/asr-23422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVroh, Bi Tra Aimé10aPlant species diversity and structure in tree plantations at Téné Protected Forest (Côte d’Ivoire)  aResource is Open Access  aThis study assessed flora establishment in the exotic tree plantations. The old and young Tectona grandis L.f. plantations, mixed-species plantations (Tectona grandis, Gmelina arborea Roxb., Cedrela odorata L.) and a neighbouring unmanaged forest were inventoried in Téné Protected Forest. In each habitat type, all vascular plant species were recorded and tree species with diameter at breast height ≥ 10 cm were measured and counted. The conservation value was determined through the listing of rare, threatened or endemic species. The diversity, the structure, and aboveground biomass have been estimated for comparison. The results showed that, plant species richness and diversity decreased significantly from unmanaged forest to mixed-species plantations and Teak plantations, while, tree density, basal area and biomass were similar between the four habitat types. This study suggests that the value of forest plantations for plant diversity varies considerably depending on whether the exotic tree species are planted as mixed-species or monocultural plantations.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCedrela odorata 3aGmelina arborea 3aTectona grandis 3aaboveground biomass 3aflora 3aforests 3ahabitats 3aindigenous species 3aresearch 3aspecies richness 3atree and stand measurements 3atrees 3avascular plants 3aCote d'Ivoire 0aforest plantation 0atimber production 0acôte d’ivoire1 aKone, Youssouf1 aDjongmo, Victor Awé0 tAnnals of Silvicultural Research.g2022 Feb., v. 47, no. 1dConsiglio per la ricerca in agricoltura e l'analisi dell'economia agraria - Research Centre for Forestry and WoodwJournal:21325x2284-354X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.12899/asr-23423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01592naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245012800156300001600284520037300300592002800673650001100701650001400712650001200726650002300738650002100761650000900782650001400791650001400805650004400819700001800863700001800881700002200899700002000921700002100941700001900962773013000981856007401111852000901185655001201194IND60639027220221119175730.0190501e20170105xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063902722DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc08430c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zigeng10aInsights into the electrochemical performances of Bi anodes for Mg ion batteries using ²⁵Mg solid state NMR spectroscopy  ap. 743-746.  aBi nanowires as anode materials for Mg ion batteries exhibit excellent electrochemical behaviour, forming Mg₃Bi₂; this is in part ascribed to the rapid Mg mobility between the two Mg sites of Mg₃Bi₂, as revealed by the ²⁵Mg NMR spectra of Mg₃Bi₂ formed electrochemically and via ball-milling.

The strain was pale-orange pigmented, Gram-stain negative, strictly aerobic, coccus shaped, and non-motile. Preliminary analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed an affiliation with the family Flavobacteriaceae of the phylum Bacteroidetes, and it had the greatest sequence similarity (96.0%) to Seonamhaeicola algicola Gy8ᵀ. The DNA G + C content was 34.3 mol%. MK-6 was the major menaquinone, with iso-C15:1 H and/or C13:0 3-OH (24.3%), iso-C15:0 (19.5%), iso-C15:0 3-OH (14.2%), and iso-C17:0 3-OH (15.9%) as the main (> 10%) cellular fatty acids. The major polar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminolipids, and two unidentified lipids.

In chloroplasts, iron is essential for photosynthetic electron transport and functions as a cofactor for superoxide dismutases. Thus, iron homeostasis is critical for chloroplast and plant development. To better understand the mechanisms by which iron is transported into chloroplasts, we cloned and characterized the Nicotiana tabacum homolog of AtPIC1, which is a chloroplast iron transporter in Arabidopsis thaliana. NtPIC1 was expressed in many tissues of the tobacco plant, and the encoded protein was localized to the chloroplast envelope. Southern blotting indicated that there is a single copy of NtPIC1 in the tobacco genome. Moreover, yeast complementation assays suggested that NtPIC1 transports iron. We used RNA interference to downregulate NtPIC1 in transgenic plants, which resulted in albinism, dwarfism, iron-deficient chloroplasts, and chloroplast that exhibited ultrastructural defects. NtPIC1 overexpression resulted in deep-green leaves, elevated levels of chlorophyll, more densely packed chloroplasts, and the accumulation of iron and starch grains within chloroplasts. In addition, NtPIC1 influenced the expression of genes involved in iron transport, iron storage, iron oxidative stress, and the biogenesis of iron-sulfur proteins. These results suggest that NtPIC1 transports iron into chloroplasts, regulates iron homeostasis, and influences plant development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aRNA interference 3aSouthern blotting 3aalbino 3abiogenesis 3abiosynthesis 3acell respiration 3achlorophyll 3achloroplasts 3aelectron transfer 3agenes 3agrowth and development 3ahomeostasis 3aion transport 3airon 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3astarch granules 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atobacco 3atransgenic plants 3atransporters 3ayeasts1 aGuo, Changhong1 aTerachi, Toru1 aCai, Hongsheng1 aYu, Diansi0 tPlant molecular biology reporter.g2015 June, v. 33, no. 3 p.401-413dSpringer-Verlagx0735-96407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-014-0758-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02974naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245008600158300002000244520167800264592002801942650001301970650002201983650001102005650001102016650001902027650001802046650002102064650002102085650001702106650001402123650001302137650001802150650001902168650001302187650002402200650001902224700001502243700001802258700001502276700001702291773012502308856007402433852000902507655001202516IND60686847420221118065713.0200319e20200312xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068684742DNAL7 a10.1039/d0ra00562b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Changtong10aElectrochemical grafting of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) on a carbon-fibre surface  ap. 10599-10605.  aIn this work, glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) was polymerised and grafted onto the surface of carbon fiber (CF) by using electrochemical grafting to improve the interfacial properties between the fibre and epoxy resin. The optimised conditions for electrochemical grafting and the reaction mechanism were also investigated. Results showed that GMA was covalently grafted to the CF surface by the assistance of aluminium chloride, which is a good electrolyte for electrochemical grafting. The GMA grafting ratio on the CF surface increased with electrolyte concentration and reaction time, and an optimal current intensity for the electropolymerisation was determined. On the basis of the strong correlation between the grafting ratio and the carboxyl content in the CF, a two-step mechanism of electrochemical grafting on the CF surface was proposed: first, the surface of CF was anodised to produce oxygen-containing functional groups, mainly including COOH, OH and CO. Next, when CF was used as the anode in the electrical grafting reaction, the COOH on the surface of CF would lose electrons and then remove carbon dioxide to generate carbon radicals on the surface of CF. The carbon radical would attack the carbon–carbon double bond in GMA to initiate the radical polymerisation of GMA monomers and graft polymers would be formed on the CF surface. Compared with untreated CF, the interfacial shear strength (IFSS) test proved the improvement of the interface adhesion of the modified carbon fibre (mCF) composites. This work provided a controllable electrochemical approach that could simply and quickly graft poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (PGMA) on the surface of CF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadhesion 3aaluminum chloride 3aanodes 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon fibers 3achemical bonding 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrolytes 3aelectrons 3aepoxides 3afree radicals 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3areaction mechanisms 3ashear strength1 aRuan, Ruyu1 aWang, Wenshun1 aGao, Aijun1 aXu, Lianghua0 tRSC advances.g2020 Mar. 12, v. 10, no. 18 p.10599-10605dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00562b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02125naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000008004100012016002200053024003200075040001800107100001200125245012300137300001600260520109000276592002801366650001001394650001401404650001301418650001901431650002001450650001701470650002501487650001601512650002301528650001801551700001701569700002001586700001601606773008701622856004501709852000901754655001201763IND44789523120705e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447895232DNAL7 a10.1002/star.2011001892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xia10aPhysicochemical, morphological, and thermal properties of starches separated from bulbs of four Chinese lily cultivars  ap. 545-551.  aThe starches separated from bulbs of four different lily cultivars (Lanzhou, Pinglu, Yixing‐1, and Yixing‐2) were investigated for physicochemical, morphological, crystalline, and thermal properties. AM content of lily bulbs starches from different cultivars ranged from 19.46 to 25.17%. The swelling power of starches ranged between 14.4 and 21.3 g/g, and the solubility ranged from 8.92 and 16.6% at the temperature of 85°C. Four cultivars of lily starches paste had excellent transparency and the transmittance value of Lanzhou lily as high as 54.7%. The transmittance of the gelatinized aqueous starch suspensions, from all lily cultivars, decreased with increase in storage period. The shape of starch granules varied from triangular to cylindrical and XRD of four lily starches all showed B‐type pattern. The transition temperatures and enthalpy of gelatinization (ΔHgel) were determined using DSC. Tp varied from 62.52 to 65.25°C. Pinglu lily starch showed the highest ΔHgel and gelatinization range (Tc–To) index among starches from four different lily cultivars.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulbs 3acultivars 3aenthalpy 3agelatinization 3astarch granules 3astorage time 3aswelling (materials) 3atemperature 3athermal properties 3atransmittance1 aGao, Wenyuan1 aJiang, Qianqian1 aXia, Yuzhuo0 tStärke =.g2012 July, v. 64, no. 7 p.545-551dWILEY‐VCH Verlagx0038-90567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/star.201100189  aDNAL 7aarticle01202naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245007800171300001800249520015000267592002800417650000800445650001700453650002500470650002200495653002200517653001700539653002200556653002100578653001600599700002400615773013100639856008500770852000900855655001200864IND60558049520221117232644.0161107e20161107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055804952DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b014732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJewess, Michael10aElectrocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation for Distributed Fertilizer Production?  ap. 5855-5858.  aRecent advances in the title topic are discussed in relation to sustainable distributed production of nitrogen fertilizer by electrolysis of air.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aelectrolysis 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anitrogen fixation 0aNitrogen fixation 0aSolar energy 0aAmmonia oxidation 0aHydrogen storage 0aChatt cycle1 aCrabtree, Robert H.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Nov. 07, v. 4, no. 11 p.5855-5858dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b014733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02448naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245011000165300001800275520115000293592002801443650002001471650001601491650001501507650001101522650001301533650002201546650001901568650002201587650002301609650001801632650001301650650001801663650001601681650001801697700002101715700001801736700002201754700002701776700001801803773009101821856008101912852000901993655001202002IND60585175120221121043500.0171104e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058517512DNAL7 a10.1007/s12155-017-9860-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ximing10aConcentrated HCl Catalyzed 5-(Chloromethyl)furfural Production from Corn Stover of Varying Particle Sizes  ap. 1018-1024.  a5-(Chloromethyl) Furfural (CMF) is a potential chemical building block for replacing petroleum-derived chemicals derived from lignocellulosic feedstocks. In this study, hand harvested corn stover and mechanically forage chopped corn stover was processed in a 1 L hydrolysis reactor to produce CMF in a biphasic, two solvent system. Both 1,2 dichloroethane (DCE) and dichloromethane (DCM) were tested as organic solvents. The results showed that DCE performed better than DCM due to temperature and pressure limitations of the reactor system. Using DCE as the extracting solvent, the effects of solids loading, particle size, and moisture content of the corn stover on the hydrolysis efficiency were determined. One liter acid hydrolysis reactor provides consistent and reproducible yields of 63% CMF from hand harvested corn stover as feedstock at solid loading of 10% wt/v, 100C for 1 h. For the forage chopped corn stover, increasing particle size brings an increase in the feedstock sugar content. Foraged chopped corn stover (FCCS) particle sizes larger than 19 mm (0.75 in.) results in significant reduction in CMF yield from 43 to 35%.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacid hydrolysis 3acorn stover 3afeedstocks 3aforage 3afurfural 3ahydrochloric acid 3alignocellulose 3amanual harvesting 3amethylene chloride 3aparticle size 3asolvents 3asugar content 3atemperature 3awater content1 aEren, Necla Mine1 aKreke, Thomas1 aMosier, Nathan S.1 aEngelberth, Abigail S.1 aKilaz, Gozdem0 tBioEnergy research.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 4 p.1018-1024dSpringer USx1939-12347nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12155-017-9860-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01672naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245011400166300001800280520040500298592002800703650002400731650001400755650002300769650002300792650001100815650001700826650002200843650001000865653002100875653003600896653002500932653002100957653002800978700001701006700001901023700001801042700001901060773008101079856008101160852000901241655001201250IND60551459920221120173559.0161018e20150311xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055145992DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tet.2015.01.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoon, Soo-Yeon10aCopper-catalyzed N-arylation of tert-butyl N-sulfonylcarbamates with diaryliodonium salts at room temperature  ap. 1566-1573.  aA new and mild synthetic approach for the synthesis of N-arylsulfonamides under copper-catalyzed conditions at room temperature has been developed.

Efforts to devise convergent synthetic strategies to targets of interest to improve liquid–liquid separation outcomes continue, but significant challenges to improve solubility in process-relevant diluents to effectively define meaningful structure–activity relationships remain. In the current work, a synthetic method to achieve the challenging 2,2′-bipyridine bond of the bis-1,2,4-triazinyl-2,2′-bipyridine (BTBP) complexant class leveraging a Pd-catalyzed Ullman-type coupling is reported.

Method optimization, relevant substrate scope and application, as well as a preliminary mechanistic interrogation are reported herein.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactinides 3acatalytic activity 3alanthanides 3amoieties 3anuclear fuels 3apalladium 3asolubility 3astructure-activity relationships1 aCarrick, Jesse D.0 tRSC advances.g2020 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 18 p.10807-10815dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00673d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245014300154300001800297520168200315592002801997650001402025650002302039650002102062650002202083650001502105650001702120650001602137650003102153650002302184650001802207650001202225650001202237700001702249700001602266700005702282773014602339856007602485852000902561655001202570IND60646003320221121220247.0190605e20190512xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064600332DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b029202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGe, Yao10aIr-Catalyzed Double Asymmetric Hydrogenation of 3,6-Dialkylidene-2,5-diketopiperazines for Enantioselective Synthesis of Cyclic Dipeptides  ap. 8981-8988.  aAn Ir/spiro[4,4]-1,6-nonadiene-based phosphine-oxazoline ligand (SpinPHOX) complex-catalyzed double asymmetric hydrogenation of 3,6-dialkylidene-1,4-dimethylpiperazine-2,5-diones has been developed, providing efficient and practical access to a wide variety of chiral 3,6-disubstituted-2,5-diketopiperazines in high yields with exclusive cis-diastereo- and excellent enantioselectivities (>99% de, up to 98% ee). The synthetic utilities of the protocol have been demonstrated in a gram scale synthesis of 6a and efficient construction of chiral products 8, 14, and 17 as well as a 2-butenyl-bridged bicyclic diketopiperazine 10 and hydroxydiketopiperazine 11. With an analogous achiral Ir catalyst, the hydrogenation of enantiopure monohydrogenated intermediate 7a gave cis-6a as the only product, indicating that the second-step hydrogenation of the titled transformation is a chiral substrate controlled process. The reaction profile study for asymmetric hydrogenation (AH) of 5a revealed that the concentration of the monohydrogenation intermediate 7a remained at a low level (<8%) during the course of hydrogenation. The hydrogenation of 5a to 6a proceeded significantly faster than that of its half-hydrogenated intermediate (S)-7a, indicating that the titled reaction involves primarily a processive mechanism, in which a single catalyst molecule performs consecutive hydrogenation of the two C═C double bonds in substrate 5a without dissociation of the partially reduced 7a. The present protocol represents a rare example of asymmetric catalytic consecutive hydrogenation of heterocycles and provides an alternative way for efficient construction of cyclic dipeptides.  aPublisher supplied data 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3adiketopiperazines 3adipeptides 3adissociation 3aenantiomers 3aenantioselective synthesis 3aenantioselectivity 3ahydrogenation 3airidium 3aligands1 aHan, Zhaobin1 aWang, Zheng1 aDing, Kuiling1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4074-19810 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 May 12, v. 141, no. 22 p.8981-8988dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b029203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03491naa a2200625 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002900166245013200195300001600327500001500343520166100358592002802019650001302047650001902060650001302079650001302092650001202105650002802117650001202145650001702157650001802174650000902192650001302201650001102214650001202225650003802237650000902275650001402284650002402298650001202322650002902334650001602363650002502379650001502404650001202419650003302431650002102464650002102485650005302506650002402559653002802583700001702611700002102628700001902649700001502668773011302683856004802796852000902844655001202853IND50058959220221118144202.0130518e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005895922DNAL7 a226958022pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-012-4205-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLöser, C.q(Christian),10aFormation of ethyl acetate by Kluyveromyces marxianus on whey during aerobic batch and chemostat cultivation at iron limitation  ap. 685-696.  a2019-12-06  aThe ability of Kluyveromyces marxianus to convert lactose into ethyl acetate offers a chance for an economic reuse of whey. Former experiments with K. marxianus DSM 5422 proved limitation of growth by iron (Fe) or copper as a precondition for significant ester synthesis. Several aerobic batch and chemostat cultivations were done with whey-borne media of a variable Fe content for exploring the effect of Fe on growth, the Fe content of biomass, and metabolite synthesis. At low Fe doses, Fe was the growth-limiting factor, the available Fe was completely absorbed by the yeasts, and the biomass formation linearly depended on the Fe dose governed by a minimum Fe content in the yeasts, x Fₑ,ₘᵢₙ. At batch conditions, x Fₑ,ₘᵢₙ was 8.8 μg/g, while during chemostat cultivation at D = 0.15 h⁻¹, it was 23 μg/g. At high Fe doses, sugar was the growth-limiting factor, Fe was more or less absorbed, and the formed biomass became constant. Significant amounts of ethyl acetate were only formed at Fe limitation while high Fe doses suppressed ester formation. Analysis of formed metabolites such as glycerol, pyruvate, acetate, ethanol, ethyl acetate, isocitrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, and malate during chemostat cultivation allowed some interpretation of the Fe-dependent mechanism of ester synthesis; formation of ethyl acetate from acetyl-SCoA and ethanol is obviously initiated by a diminished metabolic flux of acetyl-SCoA into the citrate cycle and by a limited oxidation of NADH in the respiratory chain since Fe is required for the function of aconitase, succinate dehydrogenase, and the electron-transferring proteins.  aPublisher supplied data 3aproteins 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aacetates 3acitrates 3alactose 3aKluyveromyces marxianus 3aethanol 3apyruvic acid 3asuccinic acid 3airon 3aglycerol 3ayeasts 3amalates 3asuccinate dehydrogenase (quinone) 3awhey 3aoxidation 3aaconitate hydratase 3abiomass 3aelectron transport chain 3ametabolites 2aAcetatesxmetabolism 2aAerobiosis 2aBiomass 2aDairy Productsxmicrobiology 2aIndustrial Waste 2aIronxmetabolism 2aKluyveromycesxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aLactosexmetabolism 0asuccinate dehydrogenase1 aUrit, Thanet1 aFörster, Sylvia1 aStukert, Anton1 aBley, Th.,0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2012 Nov., v. 96, no. 3 p.685-696dSpringer-Verlagx0175-75987nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-012-4205-y  aDNAL 7aarticle02917naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002100183245008400204506007600288520149500364592002801859506003701887650001401924650001501938650003101953650001901984650001502003650002102018650003002039650001802069650001802087650002902105650002402134650001402158650001502172650001202187700001702199700002102216700002002237773011702257856007602374852000902450655001202459IND60648665120221207131243.0190701e20190531xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064866512DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80601872doi7 aPMC66172752pmcid7 a311592202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGyawali, Pradip 10aCurrent and Emerging Technologies for the Detection of Norovirus from Shellfish  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aReports of norovirus infections associated with the consumption of contaminated bivalve molluscan shellfish negatively impact both consumers and commercial shellfish operators. Current virus recovery and PCR detection methods can be expensive and time consuming. Due to the lack of rapid, user-friendly and onsite/infield methods, it has been difficult to establish an effective virus monitoring regime that is able to identify contamination points across the production line (i.e., farm-to-plate) to ensure shellfish quality. The focus of this review is to evaluate current norovirus detection methods and discuss emerging approaches. Recent advances in omics-based detection approaches have the potential to identify novel biomarkers that can be incorporated into rapid detection kits for onsite use. Furthermore, some omics techniques have the potential to simultaneously detect multiple enteric viruses that cause human disease. Other emerging technologies discussed include microfluidic, aptamer and biosensor-based detection methods developed to detect norovirus with high sensitivity from a simple matrix. Many of these approaches have the potential to be developed as user-friendly onsite detection kits with minimal costs. However, more collaborative efforts on research and development will be required to commercialize such products. Once developed, these emerging technologies could provide a way forward that minimizes public health risks associated with shellfish consumption.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNorovirus 3abiomarkers 3ahealth effects assessments 3ahuman diseases 3amonitoring 3aoligonucleotides 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apublic health 3arapid methods 3aresearch and development 3aseafood consumption 3ashellfish 3atechnology 3aviruses1 aKC, Sanjaya 1 aBeale, David J.,1 aHewitt, Joanne 0 tFoods.g2019 May 31, v. 8, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80601873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02045naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009000158300002000248520101700268592002801285650002301313650003701336650001501373650001101388650002101399700001601420700001801436700001401454700001701468700001501485773012401500856007401624852000901698655001201707IND60669089020221121005240.0190920e20150727xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066908902DNAL7 a10.1039/c5ra11667h2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXue, Xiangxin10aEnhanced Raman scattering when scatterer molecules located in TiO₂/Ag nanojunctions  ap. 64235-64239.  aThe TiO₂/4-mercaptopyridine (4-Mpy)/Ag sandwich structure has been fabricated by a self-assembly method and the enhanced Raman scattering of the molecule embedded in the nanojunction, known as surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), was studied. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been employed to investigate the formation process of the TiO₂/4-Mpy/Ag sandwich structure. Raman spectra of the TiO₂/4-Mpy/Ag sandwich structure were significantly enhanced relative to those observed on 4-Mpy adsorbed on Ag particles or TiO₂/4-Mpy. A possible distribution of 4-Mpy molecules in the fabrication of TiO₂/4-Mpy/Ag assemblies has been proposed. It shows that 4-Mpy molecules adsorb on the surface of the TiO₂ NPs, and the 4-Mpy molecules connect with Ag NPs via the S atom. The analysis of XPS confirms the result obtained from Raman spectra of TiO₂/4-Mpy/Ag assemblies. The SERS enhancement mechanism is discussed briefly in the article, and we ascribed it to the charge-transfer mechanism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3ananosilver 3asilver 3atitanium dioxide1 aXu, Dongduo1 aRuan, Weidong1 aChen, Lei1 aChang, Limin1 aZhao, Bing0 tRSC advances.g2015 July 27, v. 5, no. 79 p.64235-64239dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ra11667h3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03050naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002500138245013400163520172400297592002802021650001902049650002202068650001202090650001102102650002202113650001802135650002102153650001402174650001602188650002002204650001302224650001702237650001402254650001002268650002002278650003202298650000902330700002002339700001902359700002602378773011902404856007202523852000902595655001202604IND60648665220221120145505.0190701e20160324xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064866522DNAL7 a10.3390/f70400732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKeasberry, Amanda M.10aSpatial Patterns of Irradiance and Advanced Reproduction along a Canopy Disturbance Severity Gradient in an Upland Hardwood Stand  aRegeneration failure of Quercus in mature Quercus-dominated forests has been reported throughout the temperate zone. Quercus seedlings are often abundant in these forests, yet frequently fail to recruit to larger size classes despite canopy disturbances. To examine intra-stand patterns of advanced reproduction, competition, and irradiance in an upland Quercus stand, we installed a 2 ha plot that captured the canopy disturbance severity gradient caused by a wind event. To quantify disturbance severity and stand conditions, we inventoried all living and dead woody stems ≥5 cm diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.37 m above the surface) and quantified irradiance in 25 m2 quadrats (n = 800) using synchronized ceptometers. To inventory patterns of advanced reproduction within the plot, we recorded the species of every woody stem >1 m in height and <5 cm dbh. We also documented the species and height of every Quercus stem ≥0.5–<5 cm dbh and the species, height, and distance to each stem nearest the focal Quercus stem. At the genus-level, Quercus was the most common nearest neighbor. However, at the species-level, the most common nearest neighbors were Acer saccharum and Ostrya virginiana. Competition index values significantly differed by species (p < 0.01), but did not significantly differ by disturbance severity class and we found no significant interactions between species and disturbance class. Quercus advanced reproduction was significantly clustered through the study plot and cluster locations overlapped with clusters of high irradiance, but these patterns were scale-dependent. Our results indicate that an appreciation for intra-stand heterogeneity may improve forest management planning.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer saccharum 3aOstrya virginiana 3aQuercus 3acanopy 3aforest management 3aforest stands 3ahardwood forests 3ahighlands 3ainventories 3alight intensity 3aplanning 3areproduction 3aseedlings 3astems 3atemperate zones 3atree and stand measurements 3awind1 aHart, Justin L.1 aDey, Daniel C.1 aSchweitzer, Callie J.0 tForests.g2016 Mar. 24, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70400733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03281naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245009900167300001600266520180100282592002802083650002602111650004302137650003002180650002402210650004802234650002802282650003102310650001302341650001002354650002002364650001402384650001002398650001402408650001402422650001402436650001302450650001302463650001502476651000902491700002602500700001702526700002102543700002602564773010702590856008102697852000902778655001202787IND60585175520221121043448.0171104e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058517552DNAL7 a10.1007/s12602-017-9271-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharif, Alireza14aThe Role of Probiotics in the Treatment of Dysentery: a Randomized Double-Blind Clinical Trial  ap. 380-385.  aDiarrhea is considered as an important cause of morbidity and mortality, even though one of the main reasons of death following diarrhea is initiated by dysentery. In recent years, the consumption of probiotics has been proposed for the treatment of infectious diarrhea. Despite most of the studies on probiotics have focused on acute watery diarrhea, few studies in the field of dysentery have found beneficial effects of probiotics. This study is a randomized double-blind clinical trial. The patients were randomly placed into control and case groups. In the intervention group, the patients received probiotics in the form of Kidilact® sachet, which contained high amounts of 7-strain friendly bacteria strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium breve, and Streptococcus thermophiles. On the other hand, the patients in the control group received placebo sachets on a daily basis for 5 days. It is notable that the treatment protocol of acute dysentery was done on both groups. The results of this study showed significant differences in the duration of blood in diarrhea between probiotic consumers (2.62 days) and the control group (3.16 days) (P value = 0.05). Additionally, significant differences in the average length of hospitalization in probiotic consumers (3.16 days) and control (3.66 days), (P value = 0.02) could be claimed that the consumption of probiotics is effective in reducing the duration of dysentery and diarrhea. The results of this study suggest that the use of probiotics can be effective in reducing the duration of blood in diarrhea.

In reverse transcription, NC destabilizes nucleic acid secondary structures and catalyzes the annealing of HIV-1 TAR RNA to its DNA copy (cTAR) to form the heteroduplex TAR/cTAR. A screening program led to the identification of the plant polyphenols acutissimins A and B as potent inhibitors of NC in different assays. These two flavano-ellagitannins, which are found in wine aged in oak barrels, exhibited different mechanisms of protein inhibition and higher potency relatively to their epimers, epiacutissimins A and B, and to simpler structures notably representing hydrolytic fragments and metabolites therefrom.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aRNA 3aannealing 3achemical reactions 3achemical structure 3adrugs 3ametabolites 3anucleocapsid proteins 3aoak barrels 3aplant identification 3apolyphenols 3areverse transcription 3ascreening 3avirus replication 3awines 0aPolyphenols 0aEllagitannins 0aAcutissimins 0aNCp7 0aTAR1 aCappellini, Marta1 aSinigaglia, Laura1 aJacquet, Rémi1 aDeffieux, Denis1 aFabris, Dan1 aQuideau, Stéphane,1 aGatto, Barbara1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9465-69130 tTetrahedron.g2015 May 20, v. 71 p.3020-3026dElsevier Ltdx0040-40207nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tet.2015.01.0353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01377naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245005500161300001800216520056200234592002800796650001300824650002300837650001200860700002300872773013300895856007401028852000901102655001201111IND60639027920221119175844.0190501e20170209xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063902792DNAL7 a10.1039/c6cc08468k2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJandl, Christian12aA hybrid carbocyclic/N-heterocyclic carbene ligand  ap. 2098-2101.  aWe report the synthesis and characterisation of the first complex bearing a bidentate carbocyclic/N-heterocyclic carbene ligand, which represents an unprecedented combination of these two carbene classes.

This paper reports on exploratory research, which used examples of SFSCs from London to build a more detailed understanding of different types of urban SFSC and their relative performance compared to each other. To do this, we undertook a participatory sustainability impact assessment (SIA) in which local food system stakeholders were asked to rank the perceived impacts of five different urban and peri-urban SFSCs compared with the current ‘mainstream’ food supply system (defined as supermarkets retailing mass-produced, standardized food products). The SFSCs ranked were: (1) urban gardening (self-supply), (2) urban gardening (commercial), (3) community supported agriculture (CSA), (4) direct sale (on-farm) and (5) direct sale (off-farm). Results from the SIA showed that CSAs were regarded as delivering the highest overall social, economic and environmental benefits, followed by urban gardening (commercial), urban gardening (self-supply) and direct sales (off-farm). The lowest overall rating was for the supply chain direct sales (on-farm). All five SFSCs were ranked highest on the social aspects of sustainability. Following the participatory SIA of perceived sustainability, we next developed a questionnaire in order to test the feasibility of measuring the specific (rather than ‘perceived’) impacts of an urban SFSC. We applied the test at a community-led local food market in South London, where we conducted face-to-face interviews with all market stallholders (18 respondents) and a random sample of consumers (51 respondents). Results from the community-led market were similar to those acquired at the SIA workshop, with greater agreement about the social benefits of the market, compared with economic and environmental impacts. The results also suggest that producers underestimated consumers’ willingness to share the risks that the producers face and we identify this as an important aspect for future research. The paper concludes with reflections on the strengths and weaknesses of the SIA methodology.  aPublisher supplied data 3acommunity supported agriculture 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3afood availability 3afood supply chain 3afoods 3agardening 3ainterviews 3alocal food systems 3aquestionnaires 3arisk 3asales 3asocial benefit 3astakeholders 3asupermarkets 3asupply chain 3awillingness to pay 3aUnited Kingdom1 aKneafsey, Moya1 aSarrouy Kay, Carla1 aDoernberg, Alexandra1 aZasada, Ingo0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2018 Dec., v. 33, no. 6 p.518-529dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3649527x1742-17137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705170005643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02772naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001200153245008800165500001900253520147100272592002801743650001201771650001301783650002101796650001401817650001701831650001801848650001601866650001101882650002201893650001301915650000701928650002501935653001901960653002501979653001702004653002002021653001902041700002602060700002402086773011902110856008802229852000902317655001202326IND60713213420221120052736.0210212e20210415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071321342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1425192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Wei10aEffect of copper oxide on monochloramine decomposition in bromide-containing waters  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCopper oxide (CuO), a common corrosion product found in copper pipes, has been shown to catalyse the decay of different oxidants in drinking water, including chlorine, bromine, iodine, and chlorine dioxide. However, its impact on monochloramine (NH₂Cl), a disinfectant commonly used in long distribution system worldwide is still unknown. In this study, the effect of CuO on NH₂Cl decay in the absence or presence of bromide was investigated. Results showed that in the presence of CuO and the absence of bromide, NH₂Cl slightly decayed under acidic conditions. When bromide was present in NH₂Cl solutions, the total oxidant concentration (sum of the different bromo-chloro-amines) was significantly decreased by CuO. This was primarily due to the degradation of bromochloramine (NHBrCl) by CuO which was evidenced by membrane inlet mass spectrometry. The decomposition rate of the total oxidant was similar for different CuO dosages (0.02–0.2 g/L) but increased with increasing bromide concentration (0–80 μM) and decreasing pH (6.5–8). An apparent second-order rate constant of 0.73 M⁻¹ s⁻¹ was determined with respect to NH₂Cl and bromide concentrations for a CuO concentration of 0.05 g/L. Our findings suggest that, during water transportation in copper pipes or in distribution systems where copper oxide is present, special attention should be given to the stability of chloramines when bromide-containing waters are chloraminated.  aPublisher supplied data 3abromine 3achlorine 3achlorine dioxide 3acorrosion 3acupric oxide 3adisinfectants 3aenvironment 3aiodine 3amass spectrometry 3aoxidants 3apH 3awater transportation 0aDrinking water 0aDistribution systems 0aDisinfection 0aBromochloramine 0aChloramination1 aCroué, Jean-Philippe1 aAllard, Sébastien,0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Apr. 15, v. 765 p.142519-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1425193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02331naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245010400166300001600270520129200286592002801578650003001606650001701636650002801653650002001681650001401701650001501715700001901730700001601749700001301765700001801778773010701796856008101903852000901984655001201993IND60585175920221119055643.0171104e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058517592DNAL7 a10.1007/s12602-017-9326-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHegarty, J.

Bacteriocin production has often been mooted as a desirable probiotic trait and, in specific cases, has been shown to promote probiotic survival within the gastrointestinal tract, contribute to the control of pathogens and even influence host gene expression in the gut. However, it is not clear what proportion of probiotic strains routinely found in commercial products produces bacteriocins, and additionally, it is not known which bacteriocins are produced most frequently. To address this, we conducted a culture-based assessment of the bacteriocinogenic ability of bacterial strains found in a variety of commercially available probiotic products. We detected eight bacteriocin-producing isolates from 16 tested products. Interestingly, in all cases, the isolates were Lactobacillus acidophilus, and the bacteriocin produced was identified as the narrow spectrum class II bacteriocin, lactacin B. The apparent absence of other bacteriocin-producing strains from across these products suggests a lack of heterogeneity in bacteriocin production within probiotic products and suggests that bacteriocin production is not being optimally harnessed as a probiotic trait.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLactobacillus acidophilus 3abacteriocins 3agastrointestinal system 3agene expression 3apathogens 3aprobiotics1 aGuinane, C.

They are also an important delivery system of genetic information, which is essential for the survival of wild species in ecosystems and the production of agricultural crops. In this review, seed traits and genes that are potentially important for agricultural applications are discussed. Over the long period of crop domestication, seed traits have been modified through intentional or unintentional selections. While most selections have led to seed traits favorable for agricultural consumption, such as larger seeds with higher nutritional value than the wild type, other manipulations in modern breeding sometimes led to negative traits, such as vivipary, precocious germination on the maternal plant or reduced seed vigor, as a side effect during the improvement of other characteristics. Greater effort is needed to overcome these problems that have emerged as a consequence of crop improvement. Seed biology researchers have characterized the function of many genes in the last decade, including those associated with seed domestication, which may be useful in addressing critical issues in modern agriculture, such as the prevention of vivipary and seed shattering or the enhancement of yields. Recent discoveries in seed biology research are highlighted in this review, with an emphasis on their potential for translational biology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadverse effects 3aagroecosystems 3acrop production 3acrops 3adomestication 3afeeds 3afoods 3afuels 3agenes 3agermination 3anutritive value 3aplanting seed 3aresearchers 3aseed shattering 3aseeds 3avigor 2aAgriculturexmethods 2aGenes, Plantxgenetics 2aOrgan Sizexgenetics 2aPlant Dormancyxgenetics 2aQuantitative Trait, Heritable 2aSeed Dispersalxgenetics 2aSeedsxanatomy & histologyxgeneticsxgrowth & development.1 aMartin, Ruth C.1 aNonogaki, Hiroyuki0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2012 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.5-15dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcr1123Available from publisher's Web site  aDNAL 7aarticle03023naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002000138245009100158520183300249592002802082650001102110650001502121650001202136650002502148650001802173650001202191650003502203650001502238650002302253650001102276650001902287650001302306650001702319650002502336651001202361700002002373700002002393773011902413856007202532852000902604655001202613IND60648665620221120160123.0190701e20160416xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064866562DNAL7 a10.3390/f70400852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLopatin, Eugene10aAssessment of Compliance with PEFC Forest Certification Indicators with Remote Sensing  aThe majority of Finnish forests (95%) are certified by the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC). It is a worldwide leading forest certification scheme. The aim of this study is to analyze the Finnish National Standard of PEFC certification and identify the indicators that can be reliably estimated with remote sensing (RS) techniques. The retrieved data are further verified with a chosen geographical information system (GIS) application. The rapid increase in certified areas globally has created a certain level of mistrust that makes the evaluation by certification bodies (CB) questionable. Firstly, the area of the field audit is limited, and the verification results are based on sampling techniques. Secondly, the evaluation of the indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) is based on auditor expertise and thus is prone to bias. Thirdly, the actual condition of large forest stands in Eastern and Northern Finland are not easy to determine and verify. Thus, PEFC certification in Finland, in particular, faces numerous challenges in regard to the quality of field assessment due to the intensive forest management model with a high number of annual felling sites. At the same time, small scale and scattered harvesting sites are difficult to assess. Our proposed approach combined with remote assessment reliably verified 18% of the standard and could substantially reduce the costs associated with field audits in Finland. The results from our verification analysis are spatially explicit and geographically referenced and can be published in open access portals for interested parties. Moreover, it provides improved transparency in field assessments for the PEFC certification. The novel approach proposed here requires further investigation at larger scales (e.g., national level).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaudits 3acompliance 3afelling 3aforest certification 3aforest stands 3aforests 3ageographic information systems 3aharvesting 3aintensive forestry 3amodels 3aremote sensing 3asampling 3astakeholders 3asustainable forestry 3aFinland1 aTrishkin, Maxim1 aGavrilova, Olga0 tForests.g2016 Apr. 16, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70400853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03421naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245013800169300001800307520161100325592002801936650002201964650001701986650001402003650002202017650001202039650002602051650001502077650001902092650002902111650002102140650001902161650001802180650001302198650001502211650001102226650001602237650002402253650001802277650001102295653001802306653001702324653002402341653001402365653002602379653002902405700001702434700001902451700001602470700001802486700002102504700003602525700003302561773013102594856008502725852000902810655001202819IND60558050120171219000000.0161107e20161107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055805012DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b015702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLozano, Pedro10aClean Enzymatic Preparation of Oxygenated Biofuels from Vegetable and Waste Cooking Oils by Using Spongelike Ionic Liquids Technology  ap. 6125-6132.  aThe biocatalytic synthesis of oxygenated biofuels (fatty acid solketal esters, FASEs) and biodiesel (fatty acid methyl esters, FAMEs) was carried out by both the direct esterification of fatty acids (i.e., lauric, myristic, palmitic, and oleic acids, respectively) with solketal or methanol, and the transesterification of vegetable oils (i.e. sunflower, olive, cottonseeds, and waste cooking oil) with the same alcohols, in hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs) based on cations with long alkyl side-chains (e.g., octadecyltrimethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide [C₁₈tma][NTf₂]). These hydrophobic ILs are temperature switchable ionic liquid/solid phases that behave as sponge-like system. As liquid phases, they are excellent monophasic reaction media for proposed biotransformations with all the assayed fat substrates, e.g. near to 100% yield of fatty acids solketyl esters (FASEs) and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) in 6 h at 60 °C. By using waste cooking oil mixed with free fatty acids as substrate, green biofuels containing either both FAMEs and FASEs (e.g., aprox. 80% FAMEs and 20% FASEs, etc.) can easily be prepared. Moreover, the reaction mixture can be easily fractionated by iterative centrifugations at controlled temperature into three phases, i.e. solid IL, water, and FAMEs + FASEs mixture leading to a straightforward and clean approach allowing the full recovery of the biocatalyst/IL system for further reuse and the simple product isolation. Furthermore, the enzyme did not shown any loss in activity during reuse in these reaction systems after six operation cycles.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelianthus annuus 3abiocatalysts 3abiodiesel 3abiotransformation 3acations 3acooking fats and oils 3acottonseed 3aesterification 3afatty acid methyl esters 3afree fatty acids 3ahydrophobicity 3aionic liquids 3amethanol 3aoleic acid 3aolives 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3avegetable oil 3awastes 0aIonic liquids 0aBiocatalysis 0aOxygenated biofuels 0aBiodiesel 0aSustainable chemistry 0aClean chemical processes1 aGomez, Celia1 aNicolas, Angel1 aPolo, Ramon1 aNieto, Susana1 aBernal, Juana M.1 aGarcía-Verdugo, E.q(Eduardo),1 aLuis, S.

The addition of GO delayed the onset temperature of the reaction between B and KNO₃, and brought the second reaction stage forward, however, it did not change the reaction mechanism. The integral model functions, which were in good agreement with the values calculated using the Kissinger and Ozawa method, took the form of Jander equations for three-dimensional diffusion processes. Results showing the sensitivity to flame testing demonstrated that the higher the GO content, the more insensitive the system was to temperature, which was consistent with the conclusion of the previous thermal analysis on the onset temperature of the reaction between B and KNO₃. In a closed-vessel test, as the GO content increased, the pressure peak and maximum slopes of pressure–time curves increased. Under a thermal stimulus, GO was reduced to RGO, and when the stimulation was small and slow, this helped with heat dissipation and improved safety. If the stimulation was enough to ignite the energetic materials, GO contributed to the rapid attainment of the reaction temperature and sped up the reaction process.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aboron 3aequations 3agraphene oxide 3aheat transfer 3amass spectrometry 3amodels 3apotassium nitrate 3areaction mechanisms 3ascanning electron microscopy 3atemperature 3athermal analysis1 aYan, Tao1 aLi, Yaru1 aRen, Hui1 aWang, Qian1 aGuan, Fayang1 aJiao, Qingjie0 tRSC advances.g2020 Mar. 16, v. 10, no. 18 p.10789-10798dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d0ra00857e3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03503naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245008200171500001900253520195000272592002802222650001802250650001902268650001602287650001802303650001902321650001902340650001502359650001202374650001302386650002602399650002402425650001602449650001902465650001402484650001402498650002202512650004302534650000902577653002702586653002102613653003602634700001302670700001902683700001902702700001702721700001902738773011902757856008802876852000902964655001202973IND60713213620221120042346.0210312e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071321362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1425212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Jingjing10aMicrobial communities in rare earth mining soil after in-situ leaching mining  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn-situ leaching technology is now widely used to exploit ion adsorption rare earth ore, which has caused serious environmental problems and deterioration of mining soil ecosystems. However, our knowledge about the influences of mining operation on the microbiota in these ecosystems is currently very limited. In this study, diversity and composition of prokaryote and ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms in rare earth mining soil after in-situ leaching practice were examined using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that in-situ leaching mining considerably impacted microbial communities of the mining soils. The abundances of bacterial, archaeal, and ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) were significantly and negatively correlated with ionic rare earth elements (REEs), while their diversities were relatively stable. Total rare earth elements (TREEs) and ammonium were the strongest predictors of the bacterial community structure, and organic matter was the key factor predicting the variation in the archaeal community. Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria were the most abundant bacterial phyla, and archaeal communities were dominated by Thaumarchaeota. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that unclassified Thaumarchaeota and Crenarchaeota were the predominant AOA groups. The non-detection of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and the abundance of AOA indicated that archaea rather than bacteria were predominantly responsible for ammonia oxidation in the mining soil. Network analysis demonstrated that positive interactions among microorganisms could increase their adaptability or resistance to this harsh environment. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the prokaryotic communities and functional groups in rare earth mining soil after mining operation, as well as insight into the potential interactive mechanisms among soil microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aChloroflexi 3aCrenarchaeota 3aProteobacteria 3aThaumarchaeota 3aadsorption 3aammonia 3aammonium 3abacterial communities 3acommunity structure 3aenvironment 3aorganic matter 3aoxidation 3aphylogeny 3aprokaryotic cells 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3asoil 0aRare earth mining soil 0aMiSeq sequencing 0aAmmonia-oxidizing microorganism1 aLiu, Wei1 aZhang, Yingbin1 aChen, Chongjun1 aWu, Weixiang1 aZhang, Tian C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 755 p.142521-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1425213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02363naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245011100173300001800284500001500302520102000317592002801337650001601365650001101381650001501392650001401407650002601421650001301447650002001460650002201480650001501502650001701517653002101534653001801555653003601573653002601609653002401635700002401659700002101683773013101704856008501835852000901920655001201929IND60558050220221121021343.0161107e20161107xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055805022DNAL7 a10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b015712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSubramaniam, Bala10aQuantitative Sustainability Analysis: A Powerful Tool to Develop Resource-Efficient Catalytic Technologies  ap. 5859-5865.  a2019-12-06  aDemand for chemicals is growing.

Lessening the collateral environmental burden of such growth requires sustainable alternative technologies. Fortunately, green chemistry and engineering research has made remarkable progress, laying the foundation for developing efficient processes that conserve feedstock and energy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) also plays a key role by identifying environmental hotspots along the supply chain, either within the manufacturing plant (catalysts, solvents, reactors, separators) or upstream during raw material extraction or during the generation of fossil-based energy at any stage. We present several examples that illustrate how important it is to incorporate LCA with techno-economic analysisespecially during the early stages of process development. This approach is not just useful, it is an essential tool for the rational development of sustainable chemical processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aengineering 3aenergy 3aseparators 3acatalysts 3alife cycle assessment 3asolvents 3agreen chemistry 3achemical industry 3afeedstocks 3asupply chain 0aEnergy intensity 0araw materials 0aSustainable catalytic processes 0aLife cycle assessment 0aCommodity chemicals1 aHelling, Richard K.1 aBode, Claudia J.0 tACS sustainable chemistry .g2016 Nov. 07, v. 4, no. 11 p.5859-5865dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23317x2168-04857nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acssuschemeng.6b015713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03264naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001700142245016100159300001800320520167000338592002802008650002202036650001302058650002302071650002202094650003002116650002002146650001702166650001302183650001202196650001402208650001502222650001302237650001402250650002202264700001702286700005102303700001802354700001502372700005902387700006002446700005702506773014602563856007602709852000902785655001202794IND60646004020221121111757.0190605e20190508xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064600402DNAL7 a10.1021/jacs.9b033572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Hai-Xu10aRuthenium(II) Porphyrin Quinoid Carbene Complexes: Synthesis, Crystal Structure, and Reactivity toward Carbene Transfer and Hydrogen Atom Transfer Reactions  ap. 9027-9046.  aReactivity study of novel metal carbene complexes can offer new opportunities in catalytic carbene transfer reactions as well as in other synthetic protocols. Metal complexes with quinoid carbene (QC) ligands are assumed to be key intermediates in a variety of metal-catalyzed QC transfer reactions using diazo quinones, which demands development of the chemistry of QC transfer of well characterized metal–QC complexes. Herein we report the isolation and QC transfer of ruthenium porphyrins [Ru(Por)(QC)] which contribute the first examples of (i) structurally characterized metal–QC complex (by X-ray crystallography) and (ii) isolated metal–QC complex that undergoes QC transfer reaction. The complexes [Ru(Por)(QC)] were prepared from reaction of [Ru(Por)(CO)] with diazo quinones and exhibited dual reactivity, i.e., hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) as well as QC transfer. The stoichiometric QC transfer reactions from these Ru–QC complexes to nitrosoarenes (ArNO) afforded nitrones in up to 90% yield, and the corresponding catalytic reactions were also developed. Both the stoichiometric and catalytic reactions for a series of QC ligands bearing electron-donating and -withdrawing substituents showed a reverse substituent effect on the QC transfer reactivity. Complexes [Ru(Por)(QC)] are also reactive toward C–H and X–H (X = N, S) bonds and can catalyze aerobic oxidation of 1,4-cyclohexadiene; their stoichiometric HAT reactions with unsaturated hydrocarbons gave product yields of up to 88%. The unique dual reactivity and electronic feature of [Ru(Por)(QC)] were studied by spectroscopic means and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-ray diffraction 3acarbenes 3acatalytic activity 3acrystal structure 3adensity functional theory 3adiazo compounds 3ahydrocarbons 3ahydrogen 3aligands 3aoxidation 3aporphyrins 3aquinones 3aruthenium 3aspectral analysis1 aWan, Qingyun1 aWu, Kai1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3541-99901 aLow, Kam-Hung1 aYang, Chen1 aZhou, Cong-Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2235-60701 aHuang, Jie-Sheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1724-43621 aChe, Chi-Ming1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2554-72190 tJournal of the American Chemical Society.g2019 May 08, v. 141, no. 22 p.9027-9046dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:19166x1520-51267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b033573Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02271naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001400138245012900152520120000281592002801481650002301509650002001532650001401552650002101566650001501587650001501602650002401617650001001641700001901651700001601670700001801686700001701704773011901721856007201840852000901912655001201921IND60648665820221120160023.0190701e20160420xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064866582DNAL7 a10.3390/f70400872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Yuan10aDeriving Merchantable Volume in Poplar through a Localized Tapering Function from Non-Destructive Terrestrial Laser Scanning  aTimber volume is an important ecological component in forested landscapes. The application of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to volume estimation has been widely accepted though few species have well-calibrated taper functions. This research uses TLS technology in poplar (Populus × canadensis Moench cv. ‘I-72/58’) to extract stem diameter at different tree heights and establish the relationship between point cloud data and stem curve, which constitutes the basis for volume estimation of single trees and the stand. Eight plots were established and scanned by TLS. Stem curve functions were then fitted after extraction of diameters at different height, and tree heights from the point cloud data. Lastly, six functions were evaluated by R2 and RMSE. A modified Schumacher equation was the most suitable taper function. Volume estimates from the TLS-derived taper function were better than those derived using the stem-analysis data. Finally, regression analysis showed that predictions of stem size were similar when data were based on TLS versus stem analysis. Its high accuracy and efficiency indicates that TLS technology can play an important role in forest inventory assessment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPopulus canadensis 3adata collection 3aequations 3aforest inventory 3alandscapes 3aprediction 3aregression analysis 3atrees1 aLiang, Xinlian1 aLiang, Ziyu1 aWelham, Clive1 aLi, Weizheng0 tForests.g2016 Apr. 20, v. 7, no. 4dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2257x1999-49077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f70400873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01984naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245014700158300002000305520095700325650002701282650001701309650001501326650001301341650001601354650002501370700002001395700001901415700002301434773016401457856004001621852000901661655001201670IND4535083220221122144208.0160229e20141022xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453508322DNAL7 a10.1021/jf503151f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aButre, Claire I.10aDetermination of the Influence of Substrate Concentration on Enzyme Selectivity Using Whey Protein Isolate and Bacillus licheniformis Protease  ap. 10230-10239.  aIncreasing substrate concentration during enzymatic protein hydrolysis results in a decrease in hydrolysis rate. To test if changes in the mechanism of hydrolysis also occur, the enzyme selectivity was determined. The selectivity is defined quantitatively as the relative rate of hydrolysis of each cleavage site in the protein. It was determined from the identification and quantification of the peptides present in the hydrolysates. Solutions of 0.1â10% (w/v) whey protein isolate (WPI) were hydrolyzed by Bacillus licheniformis protease at constant enzyme-to-substrate ratio. The cleavage sites were divided into five groups, from very high (>10%) to very low selectivity (<0.1%). The selectivity toward cleavage sites after Glu 62 and 134 was 2 times higher at 10% (w/v) WPI than at the lower protein concentrations. This finding shows that both the rate of hydrolysis and the enzyme selectivity were influenced by the substrate concentration. 3aBacillus licheniformis 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3apeptides 3aproteinases 3awhey protein isolate1 aSforza, Stefano1 aGruppen, Harry1 aWierenga, Peter A.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2014 Oct. 22, v. 62, no. 42 p.10230-10239dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Divisionx0021-85617nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503151f  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245013900171300001400310520116600324592002801490650001401518650001901532650002001551650001901571650001401590650003101604650001601635650001701651650002001668650001101688650003301699650002601732650001001758650001601768653002101784653001801805653002901823653002601852700002301878773009801901856008501999852000902084655001202093IND60693059820221120131256.0200504e20200102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069305982DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2017.13381262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRao, K.

In order to find out the optimal response, a set of experiments was conducted. Grey relational analysis was applied to the experimental results to determine the optimal combination of load and fuel, by converting the multiresponse problem into the single response problem with the help of grey relational grade. Signal-to-noise ratio and grey relational grade are used as a performance index, and a combination of input parameters were predicted. Finally, for validation, response surface methodology is used to obtain a desirability approach which is used in turn to find the optimal combinations. It was observed that Mahua methyl ester +10% Diethyl ether as the fuel at 30 kg load is an optimal solution.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiesel 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3adiesel engines 3aemissions 3aenergy use and consumption 3aethyl ether 3ahydrocarbons 3anitrogen oxides 3aoxygen 3aresponse surface methodology 3asignal-to-noise ratio 3asmoke 3atemperature 0aDI diesel engine 0aDiethyl ether 0agrey relational analysis 0adesign of experiments1 aReddi, Varalakshmi0 tBiofuels.g2020 Jan. 2, v. 11, no. 1 p.37-47dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2017.13381263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02819naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001500147245012600162300001600288520176600304592002802070650000902098650002402107650001102131650001102142650001302153650001302166650001202179650001602191651001902207700002002226700001602246700001602262773008902278856008102367852000902448655001202457IND60133123820221120101711.0150518e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6013312382DNAL7 a10.1134/S00978078150301482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBobál, P.10aMathematical modelling of the dynamics of mountain basin snow cover in Moravian-Silesian Beskydy for operational purposes  ap. 302-312.  aThe objective of this paper is to evaluate the applicability of models and methods available for research to simulate runoff from snowmelt for operational purposes. Both the HYDROG model exclusively used in operational practice in the Czech Republic and the HEC-HMS model were evaluated in this study. In both models has been implemented the temperature index method to meet the given purpose of usage. While the HYDROG model is in fact basic implementation of the temperature index method, the HEC-HMS allows inclusion of other factors into the calculation, which are affecting the studied process, such as the cold content of snow cover, snowmelt above the active surface, thermal deficiency of snow cover, variability of thermal factor. HEC-HMS allows the division of the research area or river sub-basins into altitudinal zones. The upper stream of the Ostravice River was selected as the area of interest. Simulation was carried out on episodes occurring in 2006 and 2009. Although the temperature index method is not widely recommended for simulating the runoff for a time period shorter than one day, the results from both models in the given area proved that using appropriate input data, as well as parameterisation, can result in the values which are accurate enough even in one hour time periods. The value of the Nash-Sutcliff coefficient is larger than 0.5 in almost all cases, which generally indicates a satisfactory behaviour of the models during the simulation. Similarly, the satisfactory results were achieved with other criteria used for assessing the accuracy of modelling. Complementing additional parameters into the temperature index method using HEC-HMS enabled better simulation of snow-melt conditions than the simulation with HYDROG.  aPublisher supplied data 3acold 3amathematical models 3arivers 3arunoff 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3astreams 3atemperature 3aCzech Republic1 aPodhorányi, M.1 aMudroň, I.1 aHolubec, M.0 tWater resources.g2015 May, v. 42, no. 3 p.302-312dSpringer-Verlagx0097-80787nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S00978078150301483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03444naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100002100138245012800159300001400287500002000301520153400321592002801855596011901883596013502002596010702137650001602244650001402260650001102274650002502285650001702310650001502327650001202342650001002354650002302364650001502387650001402402650001302416650001702429651002102446700006402467700001802531700002002549700002202569700002302591700002002614700002102634700006002655773011802715856007202833852000902905655001202914IND60681927220221122172710.0200121e202001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068192722DNAL7 a10.1002/aqc.32422doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJublier, Noémie10aPassive monitoring of phenological acoustic patterns reveals the sound of the camouflage grouper, Epinephelus polyphekadion  ap. 42-52.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPassive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is a non‐invasive technique that uses hydrophones to monitor populations and ecosystem dynamics. Although many applications of PAM have been developed in recent years, it has never been used to identify a calling marine species. The south pass of Fakarava Atoll, French Polynesia, hosts spawning events of many reef fish species, including the camouflage grouper Epinephelus polyphekadion, with a spawning aggregation abundance exceeding 17 000 individuals during the full moons of June and July. The current study aimed to use PAM to distinguish camouflage grouper sounds among the vocal activities of all fish recorded during the aggregation periods. Audio recordings analysis resulted in the identification of 29 sound types, some of which showed diel and lunar patterns. Temporal analysis of these sounds in relation to spawning activities allowed the identification of camouflage grouper calls. These calls can be described as a single pulse or a series of ‘boom(s)’ with a pulse duration of ~44 ms and a low dominant frequency of 103 ± 31 Hz. Video recordings show that the camouflage grouper produces the ‘booms’ to initialize spawner ascent and to promote synchronous gamete release into the water column. The study highlights for the first time that PAM can be used to identify the previously unknown sound of a fish species. Moreover, we can use it to understand the phenology of some biological activities for improving the resolution of fish biodiversity assessments.  aPublisher supplied data  cContrat de Projet Etat‐Polynésie française 2015‐2020, LabEx Corail ‐ project Etape, PSL ‐ project Ecora)  aVI‐EPSCoR, NSF‐1355437cthe National Science Foundation's Virgin Islands Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research  aJ.0150.16)cUniversity of Liège and by the Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research (FRS–FNRS) 3aEpinephelus 3aacoustics 3aatolls 3abioactive properties 3abiodiversity 3aecosystems 3agrouper 3ahosts 3amimicry (behavior) 3amonitoring 3aphenology 3aspawning 3avocalization 3aFrench Polynesia1 aBertucci, Frédéric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2425-93621 aKéver, Loïc1 aColleye, Orphal1 aBallesta, Laurent1 aNemeth, Richard S.1 aLecchini, David1 aRhodes, Kevin L.1 aParmentier, Eric1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0391-75300 tAquatic conservation.g2020 Jan., v. 30, no. 1 p.42-52dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl51367x1052-76137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aqc.32423Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03370naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002500153245010100178500001900279520177200298592002802070650002202098650001902120650001602139650001002155650002102165650001602186650002002202650001402222650001102236650001702247650001402264650001402278650000902292650001502301650002702316651001802343653003002361653001302391653001002404653002402414700002002438700002202458700002102480700002402501700001302525700001902538700001802557700002502575773011902600856008802719852000902807655001202816IND60713213920221120042357.0210201e20210210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071321392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1425242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYitshak-Sade, Maayan10aPM2.5 and hospital admissions among Medicare enrollees with chronic debilitating brain disorders  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aAlthough long-term exposure to particulate matter<2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) has been linked to chronic debilitating brain disorders (CDBD), the role of short-term exposure in health care demand, and increased susceptibility for PM₂.₅-related health conditions, among Medicare enrollees with CDBD has received little attention. We used a causal modeling approach to assess the effect of short-term high PM₂.₅ exposure on all-cause admissions, and prevalent cause-specific admissions among Medicare enrollees with CDBD (Parkinson's disease-PD, Alzheimer's disease-AD and other dementia).We constructed daily zipcode counts of hospital admissions of Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 across the United-States (2000–2014). We obtained daily PM₂.₅ estimates from a satellite-based model. A propensity score matching approach was applied to match high-pollution (PM₂.₅ > 17.4 μg/m³) to low-pollution zip code-days with similar background characteristics. Then, we estimated the percent change in admissions attributable to high pollution. We repeated the models restricting the analysis to zipcode-days with PM₂.₅ below of 35 μg/m³.We observed significant increases in all-cause hospital admissions (2.53% in PD and 2.49% in AD/dementia) attributable to high PM₂.₅ exposure. The largest observed effect for common causes was for pneumonia and urinary tract infection. All the effects were larger in CDBD compared to the general Medicare population, and similarly strong at levels of exposure considered safe by the EPA.We found Medicare beneficiaries with CDBD to be at higher risk of being admitted to the hospital following acute exposure to PM₂.₅ levels well below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard defined as safe by the EPA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aacute exposure 3aair quality 3abrain 3achronic exposure 3aenvironment 3ahealth services 3ahospitals 3amodels 3aparticulates 3apneumonia 3apollution 3arisk 3asatellites 3aurinary tract diseases 3aUnited States 0aParticulate air pollution 0aDementia 0aPM2.5 0aParkinson's disease1 aNethery, Rachel1 aSchwartz, Joel D.1 aMealli, Fabrizia1 aDominici, Francesca1 aDi, Qian1 aAbu Awad, Yara1 aIfergane, Gal1 aZanobetti, Antonella0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Feb. 10, v. 755 p.142524-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1425243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02641naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003500151245011100186300001600297520137100313592002801684650001501712650002201727650001401749650001501763650001401778650002001792650001301812650001301825650001101838650001501849650002401864650001601888650002401904650003701928650001601965653001301981700003101994773010002025856008502125852000902210655001202219IND60693060020221120182238.0200504e20191102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069306002DNAL7 a10.1080/17597269.2017.13381282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAkhabue, Christopher Ehiaguina10aMonitoring the transesterification reaction of castor oil and methanol by ultraviolet visible spectroscopy  ap. 729-736.  aThis study investigated the kinetics of transesterification of castor oil with methanol by absorbance measurement using ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy.

Concentration of glycerol formed during the reaction was calculated from the measured absorbance of the reaction mixture. First-, second- and third-order reaction kinetic models with respect to castor oil were used to analyze the kinetic data by the integral method. Based on the correlation coefficient (R²) of the models tested, the second-order kinetic model best described the reaction, with a reaction rate constant of 7.221 L/mol.min at 50°C. Activation energy for the reaction was calculated to be 38.33 kJ/mol with a collision frequency factor of 176.708 m³/mol.s. There was a high degree of correlation between the experimental and the model rate constant values with R² of . It was concluded that the progress of the transesterification reaction for biodiesel production can be monitored by absorbance measurement.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbance 3aactivation energy 3abiodiesel 3acastor oil 3acatalysts 3afuel production 3aglycerol 3amethanol 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apotassium hydroxide 3atemperature 3atransesterification 3aultraviolet-visible spectroscopy 3awavelengths 0akinetics1 aOkwundu, Onyeka Stanislaus0 tBiofuels.g2019 Nov. 2, v. 10, no. 6 p.729-736dTaylor & FranciswJournal:2219x1759-72777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17597269.2017.13381283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02414naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245005900171300001200230520114900242592002801391650002501419650001001444650002001454650001801474650001001492650001801502650002401520650001701544650001001561650001701571650002801588653001501616653002601631653001501657653001701672653001601689700002501705700002001730773014001750856008101890852000901971655001201980IND60652410020221120212759.0190712e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065241002DNAL7 a10.1017/S17421705170006672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSwisher, Marilyn E.10aValue chains in renewable and sustainable food systems  ap. 1-5.  aGlobalization of food trade in agricultural commodities is in some senses the antithesis of key concepts of sustainable agriculture. Global trade in food products distances the depletion of resources and environmental impacts of food production from the economic and social processes that drive consumption and increases the global risks from introduction of species that become pests. However, both supply and market value chains have emerged as major sub-systems in the larger global agro-food trade system that exert enormous importance over the potential for change in agricultural production at the farm level. This special issue presents studies of seven value chains that exhibit the breadth of research about value chains and their potential contributions to sustainable agriculture. They address value chains at different scales and dealing in various products. These studies contribute to the body of knowledge with a focus on lesser researched regions and products. Most important, they demonstrate the potential for value chains to enhance agricultural sustainability for rural populations and reduce food insecurity and inequities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenvironmental impact 3afarms 3afood production 3afood security 3afoods 3aglobalization 3ainternational trade 3amarket value 3apests 3asupply chain 3asustainable agriculture 0acase study 0aenvironmental quality 0ainequality 0amarket chain 0avalue chain1 aRuiz-Menjivar, Jorge1 aKoenig, Rosalie0 tRenewable agriculture and food systems.g2018 Feb., v. 33, no. 1 p.1-5dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl3649527x1742-17137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S17421705170006673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02971naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245007700169300001600246520179700262592002802059650001102087650001202098650001902110650002902129650002102158650002702179650001102206650002002217650000902237653001902246653001502265653002502280653003202305653001702337700003302354773009302387856008402480852000902564655001202573IND60479485420221120211642.0160122e20160217xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047948542DNAL7 a10.1080/14693062.2014.9920032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAntal, Miklos,10aGreen growth and climate change: conceptual and empirical considerations  ap. 165-177.  aThe feasibility of green growth is studied in the context of climate change. As carbon emissions are easier to quantify than many other types of environmental pressure, it will be possible to reach a more definite conclusion about the likelihood of green growth than has been possible in the long-standing historical debate on growth versus the environment. We calculate the rate of decoupling between gross domestic product (GDP) and GHG emissions needed to achieve internationally agreed climate targets. Next, eight arguments are considered that together suggest that fast decoupling will be very difficult. Subsequently, we examine the main lines of research used by proponents of green growth to support their viewpoint, including theoretical arguments, exercises with integrated assessment models, and studies of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. It will be concluded that decoupling as a main or single strategy to combine economic and environmental aims should be judged as taking a very large risk with our common future. To minimize this risk we need to seriously consider reducing our dependence on growth. This requires a fundamental change of focus in both economic research and policy. Policy relevance Currently, green growth is the only strategy of mainstream economists and policy makers to address climate change. This article demonstrates that such an exclusive focus is very risky due to the scale of the challenge and the existence of various barriers to the fast decoupling of GHG emissions from economic output. It seems that the only option to combine environmental and economic objectives is reducing the dependence of our economies on growth. Finding strategies in line with this requires a fundamental change of focus in both economic research and policy.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agreenhouse gases 3agross domestic product 3amodels 3aresearch policy 3arisk 0aclimate change 0adecoupling 0adependence on growth 0aenvironmental Kuznets curve 0agreen growth1 aVan Den Bergh, Jeroen C.J.M.0 tClimate Policy.g2016 Feb. 17, v. 16, no. 2 p.165-177dTaylor & Francisx1752-74577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14693062.2014.9920033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03045naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245015400175520153300329592002801862650003001890650001501920650001501935650001401950650002001964650001801984650001302002650000902015650001902024650001702043650000702060650001102067650002302078650001602101650001502117650002002132650001502152653002702167653001902194653002102213700002102234700002302255700002202278700002502300773013402325856008302459852000902542655001202551IND60741920820221118052211.0211206e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074192082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.enmm.2021.1005012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBadawy, Abdelrahman A.10aUtilization and characterization of cellulose nanocrystals decorated with silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles for removal of lead ion from wastewater  aSeveral studies have been reported in order to utilize cellulosic based sorbents for lead decontamination from wastewater. However, the research still undergoes so that a highly efficient system is obtained. In the present study, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) were successfully decorated during the synthesis of silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles, separately. The obtained nanocomposites, Ag/CNC and ZnO/CNC, have been intensively investigated with FTIR, XRD, XPS, and TEM to emphasize the workability of in-situ surface modification of CNCs with Ag and ZnO nanoparticles. The performance of these nanocomposites as effective adsorbents for lead ion Pb(II) has been evaluated under various conditions such as pH, temperature, concentration, and time. Generally, Ag/CNC nanocomposite improved Pb(II) uptake by ~ 22% while ZnO/CNC improved uptake by ~ 60% compared to CNCs. However, the results revealed that 60 min was sufficient time to reach adsorption equilibrium in all cases, which indicates a fast adsorption process. Moreover, ion uptake is enhanced by increasing pH, temperature, and concentration of Pb²⁺. The kinetic model is pseudo-second-order and the adsorption obeyed Langmuir isotherm (R² ~ 0.997). The sorbents have revealed more than 94% removal efficiency for pb²⁺ from wastewater. Furthermore, the developed nanocomposites can be regenerated and reused for three cycles. No doubt, this work paves the way for next generation of functional biosorbants for water treatment applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadministrative management 3aadsorbents 3aadsorption 3acellulose 3adecontamination 3aion transport 3akinetics 3alead 3ananocomposites 3ananocrystals 3apH 3asilver 3asorption isotherms 3atemperature 3awastewater 3awater treatment 3azinc oxide 0aCellulose nanocrystals 0aNano-sized ZnO 0aAg nanoparticles1 aGhanem, Ahmed F.1 aYassin, Mohamed A.1 aYoussef, Ahmed M.1 aAbdel Rehim, Mona H.0 tEnvironmental nanotechnology, monitoring & management.g2021 Dec., v. 16 p.100501-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23256x2215-15327nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enmm.2021.1005013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01994naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245008400171300001600255520092300271592002801194650002501222650002301247650002201270650001001292650000901302650002201311650002401333650001301357650001901370700001401389700002301403773012701426856008201553852000901635655001201644IND60089399620221118075105.0141102e20110603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008939962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWestberg, Johan A.10aStanniocalcin 1 binds hemin through a partially conserved heme regulatory motif  ap. 266-269.  aHemin (iron protoporphyrin IX) is a necessary component of many proteins, functioning either as a cofactor or an intracellular messenger. Hemoproteins have diverse functions, such as transportation of gases, gas detection, chemical catalysis and electron transfer. Stanniocalcin 1 (STC1) is a protein involved in respiratory responses of the cell but whose mechanism of action is still undetermined. We examined the ability of STC1 to bind hemin in both its reduced and oxidized states and located Cys¹¹⁴ as the axial ligand of the central iron atom of hemin. The amino acid sequence differs from the established (Cys–Pro) heme regulatory motif (HRM) and therefore presents a novel heme binding motif (Cys–Ser). A STC1 peptide containing the heme binding sequence was able to inhibit both spontaneous and H₂O₂ induced decay of hemin. Binding of hemin does not affect the mitochondrial localization of STC1.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3acatalytic activity 3aelectron transfer 3agases 3aheme 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amechanism of action 3aproteins 3aprotoporphyrin1 aJiang, Ji1 aAndersson, Leif C.0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 3, v. 409, no. 2 p.266-269dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.05.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02985naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002100149245014000170520139700310592002801707650001601735650001801751650002901769650002401798650001301822650001101835650001501846650001301861651001001874653002101884653001901905653002501924653003001949653001701979653002801996700002102024700002302045700001702068700002002085700001702105700002202122700001902144700003402163700002902197700001502226700002102241773011202262856008402374852000902458655001202467IND60741920920221118052348.0210918e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074192092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e016822doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMukherjee, Tanoy10aIndian Grey Wolf and Striped Hyaena sharing from the same bowl: High niche overlap between top predators in a human-dominated landscape  aThe Semi-arid wildlands of the West Bengal state of India are known habitats of Indian Grey Wolf (Canis lupus pallipes) and Striped Hyaena (Hyaena hyaena) in India. However, increasing anthropogenic pressure in these regions is one major factor behind habitat loss and rising carnivore-human conflict. We mapped the suitable habitat and estimated the niche overlap of both species in the study landscape. Further, we assessed the habitat quality, identified corridors and quantified land sharing by both species. The anthropogenic disturbance (human settlements) was found to be one of the most significant contributors for both species. The higher Schoener’s D (0.612) and Hellinger’s based I value (0.858) indicates a considerable niche overlap of about 3529 km². We observed a high level of fragmentation in suitable patches of Grey Wolf compared to the Striped Hyaena. For both Striped Hyaena and Grey Wolf, connectivity exists among the large patch of western and southern Purulia and Bankura. The Grey Wolf corridors in the Jhargram district were also found connected with other areas. We found that both the species, which are generally known rivals showing tolerance towards each other, which is an strong evidence of land sharing among the species. We recommend that the suitable patches and corridors identified in the study may be prioritized for conservation and management.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis lupus 3aHyaena hyaena 3aanthropogenic activities 3ahabitat destruction 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3awildland 3aIndia 0aIndian Grey Wolf 0aStriped Hyaena 0aBiological corridors 0aEnsemble habitat modeling 0aSouth Bengal 0aResource poor landscape1 aChongder, Ishita1 aGhosh, Shankhamala1 aDutta, Akash1 aSingh, Abhishek1 aDutta, Ritam1 aJoshi, Bheem Dutt1 aThakur, Mukesh1 aSharma, Lalitq(Lalit Kumar),1 aVenkatraman, Chinnadurai1 aRay, Debal1 aChandra, Kailash0 tGlobal ecology and conservation.g2021 Aug., v. 28 p.e01682-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23212x2351-98947nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2021.e016823Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02289naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100002400112245014300136300001600279506002800295520119600323592002801519506003701547650001601584650002101600650001301621650001001634650001601644650001101660650001101671650001301682651001401695653000901709653002501718653001301743653001701756700001901773773010201792852000901894655001201903IND60785666220221207122255.0120119e201107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078566622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aROESMA, DEWI IMELDA10aMorphological divergences among three sympatric populations of Silver Sharkminnow (Cyprinidae: Osteochilus hasseltii C.V.) in West Sumatra  ap. 141-145.  aResource is Open Access  aRoesma DI, Santoso P. 2011.

The differences of habitat types and another ecological factors among populations may have a significant influences on variation and differentiation of morphological characters of this species. In order to elucidate the pattern of morphological divergence, meristic and morphometric characters of O. hasselti in Singkarak and Dibawah Lake and adjoining river were compared. Phenogram based on cluster analysis showed specific morphological divergence among populations. There were 23 characters significantly different among all compared populations, the highest degree of differentiation was found between Singkarak and Dibawah Lake population (22 characters significantly different) and the most similar population were Singkarak Lake and Ombilin an outlet river of lake (only six characters significantly different).  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOsteochilus 3acluster analysis 3ahabitats 3alakes 3amorphometry 3apeople 3arivers 3asympatry 3aIndonesia 0afish 0aOsteochilus hasselti 0ameristic 0amorphometric1 aSANTOSO, PUTRA0 tBiodiversitas.g2011 July, v. 12, no. 3 p.141-145dMBI & UNS SolowJournal:27804x2085-47227nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02338naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245008500175300001600260520118100276592002801457650001001485650001101495650001301506650001301519650002801532650001101560700001701571700002401588700001801612700002401630700001901654700002001673710005301693773012701746856008201873852000901955655001201964IND60089399720221118075115.0141102e20110603xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008939972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.1402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFendri-Kriaa, Nourhene12aA case of a Tunisian Rett patient with a novel double-mutation of the MECP2 gene  ap. 270-274.  aRett syndrome is an X-linked dominant disorder caused frequently by mutations in the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 gene (MECP2). Rett patients present an apparently normal psychomotor development during the first 6–18months of life. Thereafter, they show a short period of developmental stagnation followed by a rapid regression in language and motor development. The aim of this study was to perform a mutational analysis of the MECP2 gene in a classical Rett patient by sequencing the corresponding gene and modeling the found variants. The results showed the presence of a double-mutation: a new and de novo mutation c.535C>T (p.P179S) and the common c.763C>T (p.R255X) transition of the MECP2 gene. The p.P179S mutation was located in a conserved amino acid in CRIR domain (corepressor interacting region). Modeling results showed that the P179S transition could change local electrostatic properties by adding a negative charge due to serine hydroxyl group of this region of MeCP2 which may affect the function and stability of the protein. The p.R255X mutation is located in TRD-NLS domain (transcription repression domain-nuclear localization signal) of MeCP2 protein.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenes 3amodels 3amutation 3apatients 3apsychomotor development 3aserine1 aHsairi, Ines1 aKifagi, Chamseddine1 aEllouze, Emna1 aMkaouar-Rebai, Emna1 aTriki, Chahnez1 aFakhfakh, Faiza2 aThe Tunisian network on mental retardation study0 tBiochemical and biophysical research communications.g2011 June 3, v. 409, no. 2 p.270-274dElsevier Inc.x0006-291X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2011.04.1403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02874naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004700094040001800141100002000159245010900179300001600288500000900304520156600313592002801879650002101907650002101928650002401949650001201973650002201985650003102007650002602038650002102064650002102085650001102106650002002117650002202137700001902159773020702178856009402385852000902479655001202488IND60665954420221120234919.0191028e198310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066595442DNAL7 a10.2134/jeq1983.00472425001200040014x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAmundson, R.

Pers.] was grown on Holtville silty clay and San Emigdio fine sandy loam soils, which were amended with aerobically (AEDS) and anaerobically (ANDS) digesed sludges to supply N at 600, 900, and 1200 kg ha⁻¹. Ammonium sulfate [(NH₄)₂SO₄] was applied to other pots at rates to supply N at 300 and 600 kg ha⁻¹. A second 600 kg N treatment as (NH₄)₂SO₄ was applied in three split applications. All (NH₄)₂SO₄ treatments received 60 kg of P as monocalcium phosphate (MCP). Cumulative yields of bermudagrass grown on aerobic sludge treatments were greater than those yields on anaerobic sludge treatments for both soils. Patterns of plant yields indicate that a large initial release of plant-available N occurred in aerobic sludge treatments relative to anaerobic treatments. Though not statistically significant, more N was accumulated by plants grown on aerobic than on anaerobic sludge-amended soils. On both soils, aerobic sludge-P was more plant-available than anaerobic sludge-P. Calculated recoveries of sludge-applied N and P showed little variation due to soil type at equal rates of sludge application. For both soils, 1 Mg of aerobic sludge or anaerobic sludge produced bermudagrass yields equivalent to those resulting from the application of 24–37 kg (NH₄)₂SO₄-N and 7–10 kg (NH₄)₂SO₄-N, respectively. Tissue concentrations of Cd were below 9 × 10⁻⁴ mmol kg⁻¹ for all treatments, and were not considered to be excessive.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aammonium sulfate 3aanaerobic treatment 3acadmium 3acomparative study 3agreenhouse experimentation 3amonocalcium phosphate 3asandy loam soils 3asilty clay soils 3asludge 3asoil amendments 3asplit application1 aJarrell, W.

Shi, J. Chem. Phys., 2008, 128, 234707] to generate hierarchical nanostructured porous carbons (HNPCs). Bimodal pore size distributions with both mesopores (from templates) and micropores (from the direct quenching of the carbon source) were well developed during the mimetic nanocasting process. The structure and properties of the nanocast HNPCs can be tailored by various control parameters, such as the template–carbon interaction strength (εₜ), the template radius (rₜ), the number density of the carbon source (ρ₀) and the quench rate (qr). The mesopore wall is made of graphitic carbons, whose morphology can be well-controlled by εₜ and high temperature heat treatments, while the microporous structure can be engineered by ρ₀ and qr. The crystallinity of the mesopore wall and the structural integrity of HNPCs (characterized by the number of bridging bonds between the mesopore wall and the microporous region) can be balanced by fine-tuning the control parameters. The mimetic nanocasting method allows us to generate atomic models to quantify the relationship between the structure and properties of HNPCs, and to provide guidelines for identifying the optimal synthesis parameters for HNPCs with desired properties.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3acrystal structure 3aguidelines 3aheat treatment 3amicropores 3amodels 3amolecular dynamics 3aporosity 3aporous media 3atemperature1 aShi, Yunfeng1 aHuang, Liping0 tJournal of materials chemistry A.g2013 Feb. 26, v. 1, no. 12 p.3886-3894dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26903x2050-74967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2ta00777k3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01230naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100001800141245005100159300001400210506002800224520035800252592002800610506003700638653002600675653001400701653001900715773013300734856007600867852000900943655001200952IND60785666420221207121407.0090701e199808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078566642DNAL7 a10.15835/nbha2813332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCANTOR, Maria10aResults obtained on the gladiolus amelioration  ap. 67-69.  aResource is Open Access  aCe travail prente les deux dernies vari de glaieuls (Clujana, Lucia) crs et homologus SCPP Cluj.

Four chemical approaches—Soxhlet extraction with n-hexane, n-butanol agitation extraction, water agitation extraction, and matrix solid-phase microextraction (matrix-SPME)—were used to assess the relationships between the extractability of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p′-DDE), 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-2-(o-chlorophenyl) ethane (o,p′-DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p′-DDD), and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane (p,p′-DDT) in soil and their amounts uptaken by the earthworm (Eisenia foetida), Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. spp.), and cole (Brassica napus L.). These results indicated that the extractability and bioavailability of DDTs in soil decreased with time of aging. Correlation analysis showed that n-butanol extraction or 12-h matrix-SPME could be used to assess the bioavailability of DDTs to the earthworm, and Soxhlet extraction, n-butanol extraction, or 12-h matrix-SPME could be used to predict the bioavailability of DDTs to both Chinese cabbage and cole. As a solventless, time-efficient, and negligible-depletion technique, it could be concluded that matrix-SPME is a better approach to predict the bioavailability of DDTs to both the earthworm and vegetables, compared with Soxhlet extraction, n-butanol extraction, and water extraction. 3aChinese cabbage 3amicroextraction 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aEisenia fetida 3abioavailability 3asoil 3aethane 3aBrassica napus 3aearthworms 3aBrassica rapa subsp. oleifera 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aDDTxisolation & purificationxpharmacokinetics. 2aInsecticidesxpharmacokinetics 2aOligochaetaxmetabolism 2aSoil Pollutantsxpharmacokinetics 2aSolid Phase Microextractionxmethods 2aVegetablesxmetabolism 0aBrassica rapa subsp. campestris1 aChu, Xiaoqiang1 aWang, Xiuguo1 aPang, Guohui1 aYu, Yunlong0 tArchives of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2010 Jan., v. 58, no. 1 p.62-70dSpringer-Verlagx0090-43417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00244-009-9329-4 7aarticle04008naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245010700146300001800253500002400271520242500295650001302720650002302733650001602756650001102772650001202783650001602795650001202811650003302823650001002856650001302866650001702879650003002896650001202926650002102938650004102959650001103000650002603011650005603037650005603093650004503149650000903194650001603203700001903219700001503238773014003253852000903393856010003402655001203502IND4477975020221120023119.0140304s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447797502DNAL7 a146018852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovoni, K.E.14aThe ontogeny of the somatotropic axis in male and female Hereford calves from birth to one year of age  ap. 2811-2817.  aIncludes references  aInsulin-like growth factor-binding proteins-2 and -3 may play a role in age-dependent growth response to bovine ST (bST) treatment in cattle; however, samples have been collected at infrequent intervals and at limited time points. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to examine the ontogeny of components of the somatotropic axis in Hereford calves from birth to 1 yr of age at weekly intervals to determine whether there is a certain age or time frame when the somatotropic axis may change and/or potentially become more responsive to exogenous bST administration. Blood samples and body weight measurements were collected from eight male and eight female Hereford calves once per week from birth to 1 yr of age. Serum concentrations of ST, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were determined. Males began to grow faster than females at approximately 16 wk of age (P < 0.05). Average concentrations of ST, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 were greater in males than females (P < 0.01). Average concentrations of IGFBP-2 were greater in females than in males (P = 0.05). Concentrations of ST decrease with age (P < 0.01); however, the decrease occurred earlier in female calves. Concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 increased in males and females (P < 0.01), and concentrations of IGF-I began to plateau at approximately the same time as growth rate differences were observed (16 wk of age). Following an initial increase (birth to approximately 16 wk of age), concentrations of IGFBP-3 remained constant until approximately 43 wk of age. Concentrations of IGFBP-2 increased to approximately 10 wk of age (P < 0.05), followed by a decrease, and then, similar to IGFBP-3, remained constant until 43 wk of age. Correlations between average daily gain, ST, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were determined. Average daily gain was negatively (P < 0.01) correlated with ST and positively (P < 0.1) correlated with IGF-I. In females, ST was negatively (P < 0.01) correlated with IGF-I. Concentrations of ST were positively correlated (P < 0.01) with IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3. Concentrations of IGFBP-2 were negatively correlated (P < 0.01) with IGF-I and positively correlated (P < 0.01) with IGFBP-3. In conclusion, serum concentrations of ST, IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 differed between male and female calves. In addition, changes in components of the somatotropic axis occurred around the same time as males began to grow faster than females. 3aHereford 3aaverage daily gain 3abody weight 3acalves 3acalving 3acorrelation 3afemales 3ainsulin-like growth factor I 3amales 3aontogeny 3asomatotropin 2aAgingxbloodxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newborn 2aCattlexbloodxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2xblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3xblood 2aInsulin-Like Growth Factor Ixmetabolism 2aMale 2aSex Factors1 aHoagland, T.A.1 aZinn, S.A.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.2811-2817dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journalofanimalscience.org/content/81/11/2811.short3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03160naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001300142245012000155300001600275520175000291650002802041650002102069650002702090650003002117650002502147650002502172650002302197650001102220650002302231650002402254650001402278650002502292650001102317700001302328700001802341700001402359773010902373852000902482856008202491856008202573930003302655945001302688946001302701655001202714IND2205342420221117172021.0000620e199909  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220534242DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29007272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLima, G.10aInfluence of antagonist, host fruit and pathogen on the biological control of postharvest fungal diseases by yeasts  ap. 223-229.  aThe yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis (LS-11), Cryptococcus laurentii (LS-28), Candida famata (21-D) and Pichia guilliermondii (29-A) and the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans (LS-30), previously selected and characterized for mechanisms of action and antagonistic activity against postharvest pathogens in small and large-scale experiments, were used in this study in order to assess interrelationships among the main factors (antagonist, host fruit and fungal pathogen) involved in biological control of postharvest diseases. The antagonists were evaluated for their inhibitory activity (IA) against six common postharvest fungal pathogens on six different host fruits. Artificially wounded fruits were first inoculated with the antagonist and 2 h later with the pathogen; subsequently they were kept at 20 degrees C for 4-6 days. The IA of each antagonist was evaluated and data were submitted to factorial analysis of variance. The populations of antagonists were also monitored on wounded and unwounded fruits kept at 20 degrees C for 7 days. Each factor examined (antagonist, host fruit and fungal pathogen) as well as their interactions significantly affected the IA. However, among the antagonists, isolates LS-28 and LS-30 were only slightly affected by both host and pathogen, showing a wide range of activity, whereas isolate LS-11 had a variable IA. All the antagonists rapidly colonized the wounds, while their population remained substantially unchanged on unwounded fruits. These results suggest that in order to select yeasts with a broad spectrum of action, more suitable for commercial development, it would be advantageous to perform preliminary assays against several pathogens and in particular on different fruit species. 3aAureobasidium pullulans 3aCandida saitoana 3aCryptococcus laurentii 3aMeyerozyma guilliermondii 3aRhodotorula glutinis 3aanalysis of variance 3abiological control 3afruits 3afungal antagonists 3amechanism of action 3apathogens 3apostharvest diseases 3ayeasts1 aArru, S.1 aDe Curtis, F.1 aArras, G.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1999 Sept., v. 23, no. 3 p.223-229x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.29007273Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02884naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002000129245009700149300001800246500002400264520137500288650001701663650001801680650001601698650002201714650001301736650002801749650001001777650001301787650002501800650001201825650003701837650001101874650002001885650001301905650000901918650002801927650002001955700001801975700001501993700001602008700001602024700001602040700001602056700001802072700001802090700001602108773012202124852000902246856009902255655001202354IND4477976720221117172015.0140304s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447797672DNAL7 a129686892pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Koning, D.J.10aFull pedigree quantitative trait locus analysis in commercial pigs using variance components  ap. 2155-2163.  aIncludes references  aIn commercial livestock populations, QTL detection methods often use existing half-sib family structures and ignore additional relationships within and between families. We reanalyzed the data from a large QTL confirmation experiment with 10 pig lines and 10 chromosome regions using identity-by-descent (IBD) scores and variance component analyses. The IBD scores were obtained using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method, as implemented in the LOKI software, and were used to model a putative QTL in a mixed animal model. The analyses revealed 61 QTL at a nominal 5% level (out of 650 tests). Twenty-seven QTL mapped to areas where QTL have been reported, and eight of these exceeded the threshold to claim confirmed linkage (P < 0.01). Forty-two of the putative QTL were detected previously using half-sib analyses, whereas 46 QTL previously identified by half-sib analyses could not be confirmed using the variance component approach. Some of the differences could be traced back to the underlying assumptions between the two methods. Using a deterministic approach to estimate IBD scores on a subset of the data gave very similar results to LOKI. We have demonstrated the feasibility of applying variance component QTL analysis to a large amount of data, equivalent to a genome scan. In many situations, the deterministic IBD approach offers a fast alternative to LOKI. 3aMarkov chain 3aanimal models 3achromosomes 3acomputer software 3apedigree 3aquantitative trait loci 3aswine 3avariance 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aData Interpretation, Statistical 2aFemale 2aGenetic Linkage 2aGenotype 2aMale 2aQuantitative Trait Loci 2aSwinexgenetics1 aPong-Wong, R.1 aVarona, L.1 aEvans, G.J.1 aGiuffra, E.1 aSanchez, A.1 aPlastow, G.1 aNoguera, J.L.1 aAndersson, L.1 aHaley, C.S.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Sept., v. 81, no. 9 p.2155-2163dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journalofanimalscience.org/content/81/9/2155.short3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03950naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245012500147300001800272500002400290520248300314650002002797650002002817650001602837650001002853650001802863650001602881650003102897650002102928650001202949650001302961650004602974650003703020650003203057650001103089650002003100650000903120650002003129650002203149650003203171650003003203700001603233773012203249852000903371856010003380655001203480IND4477974720221117172010.0140304s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447797472DNAL7 a146018822pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEdmonds, M.S.10aEffect of dietary protein fluctuations and space allocation on performance and carcass quality of growing-finishing pigs  ap. 2783-2791.  aIncludes references  aTwo trials with growing-finishing pigs were conducted to evaluate the effects of fluctuating dietary CP levels and/or space allocation on performance and carcass traits. In Trial 1, three CP regimens were used with 216 growing-finishing pigs (mixed sex). Average initial and final weights of pigs were 31 and 103 kg, respectively. The CP regimens consisted of: 1) control (18% CP from wk 0 to 4; 15% CP from wk 4 to 12); 2) moderate CP variations (MCPV = 19.5% CP from wk 0 to 2, 16.5% CP from wk 2 to 6, 13.5% CP from wk 6 to 8, 16.5% CP from wk 8 to 10, 13.5% CP from wk 10 to 12); and 3) extreme CP variations (ECPV = 21% CP from wk 0 to 2, 15% CP from wk 2 to 4, 18% CP from wk 4 to 6, 12% CP from wk 6 to 8, 18% CP from wk 8 to 10, 12% CP from wk 10 to 12). Overall (wk 0 to 12), treatment differences were not observed (P > 0.05) for gain, feed intake, CP intake, gain:feed ratio, or gain/CP intake. Trial 2 involved 360 finishing pigs (mixed sex) in a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement (three dietary CP regimens, two floor space allowances). The diets consisted of: 1) control (16% CP from wk 0 to 4, 15% CP from wk 4 to 8; 14% CP from wk 8 to 12); 2) MCPV (17.5% CP from wk 0 to 2, 14.5% CP from wk 2 to 4, 16.5% CP from wk 4 to 6, 13.5% CP from wk 6 to 8, 15.5% CP from wk 8 to 10, 12.5% CP from wk 10 to 12); and 3) ECPV (19% CP from wk 0 to 2, 13% CP from wk 2 to 4, 18% CP from wk 4 to 6, 12% CP from wk 6 to 8, 17% CP from wk 8 to 10 wk, 11% CP from wk 10 to 12). Pigs were provided with either 1.12 m2 (uncrowded; five pigs/pen) or 0.56 m2 (crowded; 10 pigs/pen). Average initial weight was 49 kg and final weights were 126 kg (uncrowded) and 118 kg (crowded). Overall (0 to 12 wk), crowded pigs had lower (P < 0.05) ADG (822 vs. 916 g) and feed (as-fed) intakes (2,633 vs. 2,876 g) than uncrowded pigs. At the end of the 12-wk trial, a control vs. ECPV × space interaction (P < 0.05) occurred for weight gain, fat depth, and percentage of lean. Thus, uncrowded pigs fed ECPV gained faster (933 vs. 887 g) but had a lower percentage of lean (53.5 vs. 54.5) than controls, whereas crowded pigs on the ECPV regimen gained more slowly (812 vs. 842 g) but were leaner (54.8 vs. 54.6%) than those on the control CP regimen. Despite the wide dietary CP fluctuations, pigs in both trials consumed about the same quantity of CP during the 12-wk feeding periods. These data suggest that uncrowded pigs respond differently than crowded pigs to fluctuating levels of dietary CP. 3acarcass quality 3adietary protein 3afeed intake 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3aweight gain 2aAdipose Tissuexmetabolism 2aAnimal Husbandry 2aAnimals 2aCrowding 2aDietary Proteinsxadministration & dosage 2aDose-Response Relationship, Drug 2aEnergy Intakexdrug effects 2aFemale 2aHousing, Animal 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aRandom Allocation 2aSwinexgrowth & development 2aWeight Gainxdrug effects1 aBaker, D.H.0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.2783-2791dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journalofanimalscience.org/content/81/11/2783.short3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02709naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100001600161245012800177300001600305520098800321650002801309650001601337650001601353650001601369650001801385650002001403650001501423650001101438650001501449650001901464650001201483650001601495650003701511650005101548650002401599650001301623650001001636650002301646650003101669650001701700650008201717700001501799700001301814773010801827852000901935856008201944856008202026930003302108945001302141946001302154655001202167IND2202513720221123031141.0000212e199907  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220251372DNAL7 a104555032pmid7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29006852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.W.10aKinetic models for astaxanthin production by high cell density mixotrophic culture of the microalga Haematococcus pluvialis  ap. 691-696.  aHigh cell density cultivation of Haematococcus pluvialis for astaxanthin production was carried out in batch and fed-batch modes in 3.7-L bioreactors with stepwise increased light intensity control mode. A high cell density of 2.65 g L(-1) (batch culture) or 2.74 g L(-1) (fed-batch culture) was obtained, and total astaxanthin production in the fed-batch culture (64.36 mg L(-1)) was about 20.5% higher than in the batch culture (53.43 mg L(-1)). An unstructured kinetic model to describe the microalga culture system including cell growth, astaxanthin formation, as well as sodium acetate consumption was proposed. Good agreement was found between the model predictions and experimental data. The models demonstrated that the optimal light intensity for mixotrophic growth of H. pluvialis in batch or fed-batch cultures in a 3.7-L bioreactor was 90-360 micromol m(-2) s(-1), and that the stepwise increased light intensity mode could be replaced by a constant light intensity mode. 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aastaxanthin 3abioreactors 3acell growth 3aculture media 3alight intensity 3amicroalgae 3amodels 3aprediction 3asodium acetate 2aAnimals 2aBioreactors 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aChlorophytaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aComputer Simulation 2aKinetics 2aLight 2aModels, Biological 2aSodium Acetatexmetabolism 2aXanthophylls 2abeta Carotenexanalogs & derivativesxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification.1 aGong, X.D.1 aChen, F.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1999 July, v. 23, no. 1 p.691-696x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.29006853Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02129naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245011100158300001600269520095700285650002801242650001601270650001201286650001601298650001601314650001901330650002301349650001501372700001501387700001301402773010801415852000901523856008201532856008201614930003301696945001301729946001301742655001201755IND2203431620221123031256.0000329e199908  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220343162DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29007042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, X.W.10aDynamics and stability analysis of the growth and astaxanthin production system of Haematococcus pluvialis  ap. 133-137.  aThis paper investigated high cell density cultivation of Haematococcus pluvialis for astaxanthin production in 3.7-L bioreactors. A biomass concentration of 2.74 g L(-1) and an astaxanthin yield of 64.4 mg L(-1) were obtained. Based on the experimental results, a new and simple dynamic model is proposed, differing from Monod kinetics, to describe cell growth, product formation and substrate consumption. Good agreement was found between the model predictions and experimental data. The model revealed that there was cell growth inhibition on product formation and product feedback compensation for substrate consumption, but no substrate inhibition or product inhibition of cell growth. Stability analysis demonstrated that no multiplicity of steady states was observed; the unique positive steady state was locally asymptotically stable; and the effect of dilution rate on steady states was greater than that of the initial substrate concentration. 3aHaematococcus pluvialis 3aastaxanthin 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3acell growth 3adynamic models 3agrowth retardation 3aprediction1 aGong, X.D.1 aChen, F.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1999 Aug., v. 23, no. 2 p.133-137x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.29007043Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03717naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002600171245013800197300001800335500002400353500001500377520131500392650001501707650002701722650002201749650001301771650001801784650001101802650001301813650001001826650002201836650001401858650001401872650001901886650002501905650001201930650001801942650002701960650003601987650003102023650003302054650002502087650001402112650003102126650002702157650002702184650001402211650003302225650002502258650002502283650002702308650002702335650001702362650002302379651001202402651001802414651002102432651001202453651001102465651001702476651001102493653002302504653002602527653001702553653001802570653001802588653002402606700001602630700002102646700002702667700002602694773010302720852000902823856005502832655001202887IND4436617820221123011958.0100507e201005  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443661782DNAL7 a204063852pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04630.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNadin-Davis, Susan A.10aSpatial and temporal dynamics of rabies virus variants in big brown bat populations across Canada: footprints of an emerging zoonosis  ap. 2120-2136.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPhylogenetic analysis of a collection of rabies viruses that currently circulate in Canadian big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) identified five distinct lineages which have emerged from a common ancestor that existed over 400 years ago. Four of these lineages are regionally restricted in their range while the fifth lineage, comprising two-thirds of all specimens, has emerged in recent times and exhibits a recent demographic expansion with rapid spread across the Canadian range of its host. Four of these viral lineages are shown to circulate in the US. To explore the role of the big brown bat host in dissemination of these viral variants, the population structure of this species was explored using both mitochondrial DNA and nuclear microsatellite markers. These data suggest the existence of three subpopulations distributed in British Columbia, mid-western Canada (Alberta and Saskatchewan) and eastern Canada (Quebec and Ontario), respectively. We suggest that these three bat subpopulations may differ by their level of female phylopatry, which in turn affects the spread of rabies viruses. We discuss how this bat population structure has affected the historical spread of rabies virus variants across the country and the potential impact of these events on public health concerns regarding rabies. 3ahost range 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aRabies lyssavirus 3azoonoses 3apublic health 3arabies 3aancestry 3ahosts 3amitochondrial DNA 3aphylogeny 3aEptesicus 3anuclear genome 3apopulation structure 2aAnimals 2aBayes Theorem 2aCell Nucleusxgenetics 2aChiropteraxgeneticsxvirology. 2aCyclooxygenase 1xgenetics 2aDNA, Mitochondrialxgenetics 2aGenetics, Population 2aGeography 2aHost-Pathogen Interactions 2aLinkage Disequilibrium 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aPhylogeny 2aPrincipal Component Analysis 2aRNA, Viralxgenetics 2aRabiesxepidemiology 2aRabies virusxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aTime Factors 2aZoonosesxvirology 3aAlberta 3aUnited States 3aBritish Columbia 3aOntario 3aQuebec 3aSaskatchewan 0aCanada 0abat subpopulations 0arabies virus variants 0aRabies virus 0aDNA barcoding 0abig brown bat 0amicrosatellite loci1 aFeng, Yuqin1 aMousse, Delphine1 aWandeler, Alexander I.1 aAris-Brosou, Stephane0 tMolecular ecology.g2010 May, v. 19, no. 10 p.2120-2136dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0962-10837nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04630.x 7aarticle02087naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245003900146300001800185500002400203520091300227650001901140650001901159650001201178650002701190650002001217650001501237650002001252650001501272650005001287650002701337650001201364650002201376650001101398650001101409650002001420773014001440852000901580856010001589655001201689IND4477976020221123001527.0140304s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447797602DNAL7 a146018952pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCuomo, Chris10aScience, values, and common ground  ap. 2904-2907.  aIncludes references  aIn this paper, I argue that there may be common ground shared by animal science and its critics insofar as animal scientists seek improvement in their field in four areas: the quality of their products, the quality of life for those who make their livelihood in food production, the fair treatment of human workers, and the humane treatment of animals. I also propose that there are fundamental differences between improvement motivated by profit and improvement motivated by ethical values. Positive moral change is sometimes revolutionary, although it is often a matter of promoting positive incremental changes and keeping one’s attention on the effects of actions and attitudes. In conclusion, I suggest that in animal agriculture, positive change can be brought about by “getting closer” to the objects of scientific research, including nonhuman animals, by paying more attention to their welfare. 3aanimal science 3aanimal welfare 3aanimals 3aattitudes and opinions 3afood production 3alivelihood 3aquality of life 3ascientists 2aAnimal Husbandryxeconomicsxethicsxmethods. 2aAnimal Welfarexethics 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Domestic 2aHumans 2aMorals 2aQuality of Life0 tJournal of animal science.g2003 Nov., v. 81, no. 11 p.2904-2907dAmerican Society of Animal SciencewJournal:jnl45556x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://journalofanimalscience.org/content/81/11/2904.short3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04272naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003600133040001800169100002100187245009100208300001800299500002400317506007600341520219300417506003702610650001602647650000902663650002802672650001402700650002402714650001202738650001002750650002402760650001702784650001802801650001902819650001202838650001402850650001202864650001002876650001502886650003602901650005102937650002102988650001003009650002803019650001103047650001603058650002103074650001103095650001103106650001803117650002503135650000903160650002703169650001403196650002403210650001903234650002103253700001803274700002903292700001903321700001603340773013603356852000903492856004903501655001203550IND4439363620221207120220.0100702e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443936362DNAL7 a206301602pmid7 aPMC29069152pmcid7 a10.1016/j.jada.2010.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerge, Jerica M.10aParenting Style and Family Meals: Cross-Sectional and 5-Year Longitudinal Associations  ap. 1036-1042.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBackground: Research on family meals in the past decade has shown a positive association between family meal frequency and adolescent healthy dietary intake. However, less is known about factors within the home environment, such as parenting style, that may be associated with family meal patterns. Objective: The purpose of this study is to test cross-sectional and 5-year longitudinal associations between parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, permissive, and neglectful) and the frequency of family meals among adolescents. Study design: Data were from Project Eating Among Teens, a population-based study comprised of youth from diverse ethnic/racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Two cohorts of adolescents (middle school and high school) completed in-class surveys in 1999 (Time 1) and mailed surveys in 2004 (Time 2). Multiple linear regression models were used to predict mean frequency of family meals at Time 1 and Time 2 from adolescent report of parenting style (both mother and father) at Time 1. Cross-sectional analyses included both adolescent cohorts (n=4,746) and longitudinal analyses included only the younger cohort (n=806) because family meal frequency was not assessed in the older cohort at Time 2. Results: Cross-sectional results for adolescent girls indicated a positive association between maternal and paternal authoritative parenting style and frequency of family meals. For adolescent boys, maternal authoritative parenting style was associated with more frequent family meals. Longitudinal results indicated that authoritative parenting style predicted higher frequency of family meals 5 years later, but only between opposite sex parent/adolescent dyads. Conclusions: Future research should identify additional factors within the home environment that are associated with family meal frequency to develop effective interventions that result in increased family meals for youth. Also, future research should investigate the mealtime behaviors of authoritative parents and identify specific behaviors that dietetics practitioners and other health care providers could share with parents of adolescents to help them increase family meal frequency.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aadolescents 3aboys 3across-sectional studies 3adietetics 3aexperimental design 3afathers 3agirls 3ahealth care workers 3ahigh schools 3alinear models 3amiddle schools 3amothers 3aparenting 3asurveys 3ayouth 2aAdolescent 2aAdolescent Behaviorxpsychology 2aAdolescent Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAuthoritarianism 2aChild 2aCross-Sectional Studies 2aEating 2aEnvironment 2aFeeding Behavior 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aLinear Models 2aLongitudinal Studies 2aMale 2aParent-Child Relations 2aParenting 2aParentsxpsychology 2aPermissiveness 2aSex Distribution1 aWall, Melanie1 aNeumark-Sztainer, Dianne1 aLarson, Nicole1 aStory, Mary0 tJournal of the American Dietetic Association.g2010 July, v. 110, no. 7 p.1036-1042dAmerican Dietetic Associationx0002-82237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jada.2010.04.011 7aarticle02105naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245013300165300001600298520097000314651001001284653001901294653001701313653001501330653001901345653001401364653001301378653004101391653002201432700001801454700001701472773011601489852000901605856008501614930003301699946001101732655001201743IND4402186720221122230810.0080302e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440218672DNAL7 a10.1007/s00254-005-0123-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJin, Changning 10aConstruction techniques for the Taklamakan Desert Highway: research on the construction materials and the results of field tests  ap. 915-922.  aAfter conducting many laboratory and field experiments, several key technical issues related to the construction of China's Taklamakan Desert Highway have been satisfactorily resolved. In particular, considerable progress has been made on the dry compaction of a sand sub-base, road design parameters, the creation of a structure that combines a sub-grade and asphalt pavement, analysis of the stability of a sand sub-base strengthened with geotextiles, and on the development of a complete set of construction techniques. The achievements of this research were successfully applied for the first time in the Taklamakan Desert, where the environmental conditions are extremely harsh. The results suggest that the construction of this highway was economical and that the simple construction methods produced a reliable highway. The resulting highway is believed to be the world's first long-distance graded highway running through a huge desert with migrating dunes. 3aChina 0aDesert highway 0aAnemoarenyte 0aGeotextile 0aDry compaction 0aSub-grade 0aPavement 0aArid terrene construction techniques 0aTaklamakan Desert1 aDong, Zhibao 1 aLi, Zhinong 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2006 Mar., v. 49, no. 6 p.915-922dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-0123-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080302b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03156naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245009000183300001600273500002400289520146000313650001001773650002001783650001501803650002401818650002301842650001001865650002101875650001001896650001901906650002201925650001601947650002601963650002301989650001202012650001802024650003702042650002002079650001602099650002302115650001902138650003002157650002402187650004602211651001302257651001202270700002202282700002202304700002102326700002202347700002102369700002202390773008502412852000902497856004802506655001202554IND4416642620221122230840.0090220e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441664262DNAL7 a190345292pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-008-1224-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoss, Scott R.10aAvian host community structure and prevalence of West Nile virus in Chicago, Illinois  ap. 415-424.  aIncludes references  aVertebrate host diversity has been postulated to mediate prevalence of zoonotic, vector-borne diseases, such that as diversity increases, transmission dampens. This “dilution effect” is thought to be caused by distribution of infective bites to incompetent reservoir hosts. We quantified avian species richness, avian seroprevalence for antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV), and infection of WNV in Culex mosquitoes, in the Chicago metropolitan area, Illinois, USA, a region of historically high WNV activity. Results indicated high overall avian seroprevalence and variation in seroprevalence across host species; however, there was no negative correlation between avian richness and Culex infection rate or between richness and infection status in individual birds. Bird species with high seroprevalence, especially northern cardinals and mourning doves, may be important sentinels for WNV in Chicago, since they were common and widespread among all study sites. Overall, our results suggest no net effect of increasing species richness to West Nile virus transmission in Chicago. Other intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as variation in mosquito host preference, reservoir host competence, temperature, and precipitation, may be more important than host diversity for driving interannual variation in WNV transmission. These results from a fine-scale study call into question the generality of a dilution effect for WNV at coarser spatial scales. 3aCulex 3aWest Nile virus 3aantibodies 3acommunity structure 3adisease reservoirs 3adoves 3ahost preferences 3ahosts 3aseroprevalence 3aspecies diversity 3atemperature 3avector-borne diseases 3avirus transmission 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aBirdsxclassificationxvirology. 2aCulexxvirology 2aDNA Primers 2aDisease Reservoirs 2aInsect Vectors 2aSeroepidemiologic Studies 2aSpecies Specificity 2aWest Nile virusxisolation & purification 3aIllinois 0aChicago1 aHamer, Gabriel L.1 aWalker, Edward D.1 aRuiz, Marilyn O.1 aGoldberg, Tony L.1 aKitron, Uriel D.1 aBrawn, Jeffrey D.0 tOecologia.g2009 Mar., v. 159, no. 2 p.415-424dSpringer-Verlagx0029-85497nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-008-1224-6 7aarticle02537naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002400152245017200176300001600348500002400364500001500388520126000403650001101663650002001674650001001694650001601704650002101720650001301741650002001754650001901774650001601793650001201809650001101821651001101832653001201843700002701855700001401882700001301896700001601909773011401925852000902039856005502048655001202103IND4457773620221122221134.0110507e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445777362DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01583.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPereira Arantes, F.10aCollapse of the reproductive process of two migratory fish (Prochilodus argenteus and Prochilodus costatus) in the Três Marias Reservoir, São Francisco River, Brazil  ap. 847-853.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGenerally, migratory fish can complete vitellogenesis even when the migration process is interrupted; however, final oocyte maturation does not occur and therefore there is no spawning. To evaluate the reproductive process of migratory fish inside the reservoir of the Três Marias Dam (a lentic environment), 90 female and 81 male Prochilodus argenteus and 172 female and 115 male Prochilodus costatus were captured in this environment. Males and females from both species in the resting stage were pre-dominant, and the highest frequency of specimens in advanced maturation stages occurred in November, December and January. According to histological analysis, ovarian regression was frequent and vitellogenic oocytes undergoing atresia were intensely observed, moreover, no fish with ovaries and testes with characteristics of spawning and spermiation, respectively, were captured. This indicated that both species were preparing for reproduction and reaching advanced gonad maturation, but were unable to complete the process of reproduction in this environment. The data from this study indicate that the modification of portions of rivers to lentic environments can have a negative impact on the reproductive process of migratory fish in freshwater. 3arivers 3afish processing 3amales 3aspermiation 3awater reservoirs 3aspawning 3afreshwater fish 3alentic systems 3aProchilodus 3afemales 3atestes 3aBrazil 0aovaries1 aBatista dos Santos, H.1 aRizzo, E.1 aSato, Y.1 aBazzoli, N.0 tJournal of applied ichthyology.g2011 June, v. 27, no. 3 p.847-853dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0175-86597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0426.2010.01583.x 7aarticle02307naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245013800172300001600310500002400326520119200350650002701542650001601569650000901585650001001594650002301604650002001627650002401647650001701671650001201688700001801700700001401718700001601732773009901748852000901847856008901856655001201945IND4478170620221122181839.0140306s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447817062DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00187-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoto-Navarro, S.A.10aEffects of level and source of supplemental protein in a concentrate-based diet on growth performance of Boer × Spanish wether goats  ap. 101-106.  aIncludes references  aBoer×Spanish wether goats (50; 26.8+/-4.04 kg initial BW and 7 months of age) were used in a 27 week experiment to determine effects of two levels of CP (13 and 19%) and five protein sources varying in ruminal degradability (blood, corn gluten, feather, fish and soybean meals).

In summary, with a dietary concentrate level of 70% and at least 13% CP, differences in amino acid profiles among blood, corn gluten, feather, fish and soybean meals did not impact rate or efficiency of growth by Boer×Spanish wethers. 3aamino acid composition 3acorn gluten 3afish 3agoats 3agrowth performance 3aprotein sources 3aprotein supplements 3asoybean meal 3awethers1 aGoetsch, A.L.1 aSahlu, T.1 aPuchala, R.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.101-106dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00187-13Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03144naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135100001700153245011500170300001600285500002400301520177600325650001502101650001202116650001202128650003302140650001202173650001102185650002302196650001402219650001002233650001202243650001202255650000902267650001102276650001202287650002602299650002902325650001002354650001202364651001702376651001702393651001102410651001802421651001002439773009902449852000902548856009302557655001202650IND4478179620221122155426.0140307s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447817962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.smallrumres.2003.08.0142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIñiguez, L.10aGoats in resource-poor systems in the dry environments of West Asia, Central Asia and the Inter-Andean valleys  ap. 137-144.  aIncludes references  aA review of goat production systems in harsh and dry environments of West Asia, Central Asia and the Inter-Andean valleys of Latin America reveals that while goats are an important component of a considerable number of vulnerable and resource-poor production systems, the production performance and potentials have not been sufficiently characterized nor documented. In West and Central Asia goats are raised in dry regions with prolonged drought, extreme climate fluctuation, and water scarcity, and are confined to mixed flocks interspersed with sheep. Goats supply kids, milk and fiber, especially to farmers moving their animals through seasonal grazing. Goats in these systems have not been adequately studied, nor have they received the same attention as sheep. Only a few production systems are solely based on goats; these include intensive dairy Damascus goat production (Syria and Cyprus) and extensive fine-fiber production (mohair and cashmere) in other countries of West and Central Asia. Variability for fine-fiber production has yet to be fully assessed and exploited. Goats in the arid lands of the Inter-Andean valleys are associated with the poorer sectors of the population, even more so than their Asian counterparts. Most goat farmers in the Andean valleys live under extreme poverty, occupying degraded areas with limited cropping possibilities, where Criollo goats, introduced during colonial times, are dominant. Their genetic base has yet to be characterized. While improved management/feeding is possible for these systems, access to improved germplasm is required. Technological improvements can only be viable if market incentives and some degree of intensification are possible. Thus, research and development needs to focus on market issues. 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3afarmers 3aflocks 3agenetic background 3agermplasm 3agoats 3agrazing 3amarkets 3amilk 3amohair 3apoverty 3aproduction technology 3aresearch and development 3asheep 3avalleys 3aAndes region 3aCentral Asia 3aCyprus 3aLatin America 3aSyria0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Feb., v. 51, no. 2 p.137-144dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2003.08.0143Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02861naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009500161300001600256500002400272520208400296650001302380650001502393650001502408773009002423852000902513856008502522655001202607IND4420290620221122155409.0090508s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442029062DNAL7 a10.1007/s10708-008-9225-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCraine, Jim10aVirtualizing Los Angeles: Pierre Levy, The Shield, and http://theshieldrap.proboards45.com  ap. 235-243.  aIncludes references  aI explore how Pierre Levy's virtualization works between actual places, television, and the Internet by referencing the real landscapes of Los Angeles, the visualized landscapes of the FX network television show The Shield, and the cyberscapes of http://theshieldrap.proboards45.com/. Unlike current Deleuzean-based theories of visualization that privilege the passage from the virtual to the actual, Levy focuses instead on how virtualization moves back from the real/actual toward the virtual. I argue that this philosophical reversal illustrates the way in which the virtual constitutes the viewer/consumer and thus functions to resituate the virtual within the body through the use of digital landscapes. I further argue, using The Shield as the modality, that the virtual is necessarily an element of the very body which it serves to constitute because the virtual is indeed an essential part of the determination of the geographies of every concrete biocultural body. My example of The Shield becomes the means by which we can bring the force of the virtual, in the form of web-based landscapes, to bear on our experience. I use the show and its Internet counterpart as the catalyst for an expansion of the margin of indetermination constitutive of our technically-facilitated embodiment. By further relating the TV show to our seemingly playful interactions with the digital landscape, I explore how this interaction crosses multiple scales and multiple viewing modalities and further blurs the borders of experiential reality and the visualization of fantasized landscapes. The Shield's representations of the Los Angeles landscape become embodied experiences for viewers of the show and by virtualizing the real landscapes of Los Angeles and their televisual counterparts, http://theshieldrap.proboards45.com/ allows consumers to know the spaces of the city through their virtual experience of place as imagined by the website and its members. Thus, I show how Levy's virtualization theories can be used to specify the virtual dimension constitutive of human experience. 3aInternet 3alandscapes 3atelevision0 tGeoJournal.g2009 June, v. 74, no. 3 p.235-243dSpringer Netherlandsx0343-25217nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10708-008-9225-x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03475naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245011700172300001500289500002400304520226900328650001502597650002002612650002102632650001302653650001602666650001402682650000902696650001002705650001702715650001002732650001502742650001102757650002002768650001902788650001102807700001902818700002002837773009802857852000902955856008902964655001203053IND4478170520221122155327.0140306s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447817052DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00180-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarg, Satish Kumar10aEvaluation of the efficacy of fenbendazole against natural gastrointestinal nematodiasis in goats (Capra hircus)  ap. 97-100.  aIncludes references  aPresent study was conducted on 47 Barberi goats of either sex ageing around 1 year, naturally infected with strongyle nematodes. The animals were randomly divided into five groups each consisting of eight animals. The coproculture examination on day zero revealed mixed infection with the larvae of Haemonchus (74.4+/-1.02%), Oesophagostomum (23.0+/-0.45%) and Trichostrongylus (3.6+/-1.57%). The goats of groups II, III, IV and V were administered a single dose of fenbendazole at 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg body weight, respectively, while the animals of group I served as untreated control. The eggs per gram of faeces (EPG) were determined in animals of all the groups before treatment (day 0) and on days 7, 14 and 21 post-treatment. The percent reduction in EPG was found to be 9.8, 9.55 and 74.14% on day 7 post-medication in animals of groups II, III and IV, respectively, whereas 100% in animals of group V. Almost same level of reduction in EPG was maintained for up to 21 days in animals of all the treatment groups. In another two groups of animals, complete deworming of animals was ensured by administering ivermectin at 200 μg/kg. These animals were individually given an experimental infection with 2700 infective larvae of Haemonchus species. The animals were divided into two groups (I, II) of three and four animals, respectively. On day 26 post-infection, EPG was determined. The animals of group II were administered a single oral dose of fenbendazole (7.5 mg/kg) while the animals of group I served as untreated control. On day 4 post-medication, faecal samples were collected for EPG determination and animals of both the groups were sacrificed, their abomasum collected and examined for Haemonchus worms. The data revealed that fenbendazole at 7.5 mg/kg was completely effective in reducing the EPG load to zero and no worms could be seen in the abomasum of treated animals. Therefore, results of the present study suggest that fenbendazole may be used at the rate of 7.5 mg/kg body weight to treat natural nematodiasis in goats. Further, it is also suggested that goats may be dewormed at least three times in a year, before monsoon, after monsoon and before the onset of winter, to minimise the chances of nematodal infection in goats. 3aHaemonchus 3aOesophagostomum 3aTrichostrongylus 3aabomasum 3abody weight 3adeworming 3aeggs 3afeces 3afenbendazole 3agoats 3aivermectin 3alarvae 3amixed infection 3amonsoon season 3awinter1 aKatoch, Rajesh1 aChauhan, P.P.S.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.97-100dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00180-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02976naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001700149245009100166300001400257500002400271520193500295650002202230650001602252650001902268650001102287650001002298650000902308651001202317700001602329700001702345700001802362700002002380700001902400773009702419852000902516856008902525655001202614IND4478170320221122155428.0140306s2004    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447817032DNAL7 a10.1016/S0921-4488(03)00189-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJanssens, S.14aThe linear assessment scheme for sheep in Belgium: breed averages and assessor quality  ap. 85-95.  aIncludes references  aA linear assessment scheme for sheep was introduced in Belgium to generate more accurate and objective information on body characteristics of breeding stock. Body weight and six body dimensions were measured. Additionally, 14 exterior traits were scored on a nine-point scale. Data on 11 354 animals, from 15 pure breeds were recorded from 1993 to 2000. Breed averages and standard deviations are presented for sheep at 18 months of age. The data have served already in the discussion on standards and breeding objectives for different breeds by providing clear and indisputable figures on weight, body dimensions and type traits. Training sessions and exam trials for assessors were organised to ensure the quality of the scheme. Exam data from 2 years were analysed and revealed significant differences between assessors and breeds. For some traits, a significant breed by assessor interaction effect was found. Repeatabilities of traits ranged from 0.28 to 0.93 with higher values for the measured traits. Assessors were individually rated on five criteria of which consistency and conformability were the most important. When combining all 21 traits, consistency of assessors ranged from 0.62 to 0.81. Most assessors performed accurately for the measured traits, for fatness and for the muscularity of the gigot. Traits related to leg quality, top line and tail traits were poorly repeatable for most assessors. Conformability of assessors with the reference was on average 0.63. The traits for which consistency was low were also accompanied by low conformability values. Further comparisons of assessors with the reference included the difference in median value, the difference in range and the difference in proportion of the scores. Comparison of assessors in subsequent years showed that most of them improved in consistency and approached the reference. Continued training seemed worthwhile to improve assessor quality. 3abody conformation 3abody weight 3abreeding stock 3abreeds 3asheep 3atail 3aBelgium1 aWinandy, D.1 aTylleman, A.1 aDelmotte, Ch.1 aMoeseke, W.

The highest amylase yield (62% increase of the control) and operational stability (97% residual activity after 480 h repeated batch cultivation) were obtained with this system. This was confirmed by scanning electron micrographs.

It has recently been suggested that docosapentaenoic acid may have an important role, especially in infant nutrition, and that its positive health effects have been overlooked. Docosapentaenoic acid (C22:5, omega-3) production by a strain of Pythium acanthicum ATCC 18660 was thus investigated. Optimum conditions for growth of P. acanthicum ATCC 18660 and docosapentaenoic acid production were: pH 6.0, temperature 20 degrees C and incubation time, 10 days. Among different saccharides and complex nitrogen sources tested, glucose and sodium glutamate were preferred carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Maximum biomass content (10.4 g L-1) and docosapentaenoic acid yield (49.9 mg L-1) were obtained in 10 days. An increase in docosapentaenoic acid volumetric yields to 108-110 mg L-1 was obtained when linseed oil was used to supplement glucose or soy flour-containing medium. Batch feeding of additional glucose or linseed oil further enhanced the docosapentaenoic acid volumetric yield to 132 mg L-1 and 125 mg L-1, respectively, in 14 days. The specific production of docosapentaenoic acid in preliminary experiments ranged from 1.0-5.0 mg g-1 biomass. As conditions were optimised, docosapentaenoic acid specific production titers were generally in the range of 4.0-5.5 mg g-1 and increases in docosapentaenoic acid volumetric production could be attributed to increased biomass production. The limited improvement obtained by modifying culture conditions indicates that increasing volumetric yields of docosapentaenoic acid by modifying culture conditions appears to represent a significant barrier to commercialisation of such a process and suggests a more fundamental manipulation of metabolism and physiology is required. 3aPythium 3abiomass production 3acarbon 3acommercialization 3adocosahexaenoic acid 3adocosapentaenoic acid 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aglucose 3ainfant nutrition 3alinseed oil 3ametabolism 3amonosodium glutamate 3anitrogen 3aomega-3 fatty acids 3apH 3atemperature1 aWard, O.P.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1998 , v. 20, no. 3/4 p.187-191x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle04933naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245005000183300001600233500002400249500001500273520309400288650002703382650002403409650002303433650001603456650003403472650001403506650001703520650000803537650001503545650001303560650001403573650002203587650001403609650004103623650001603664650001803680650002203698650002603720650002903746650004003775650003103815650002803846650003403874650002003908651001003928653001503938700001603953700001503969700001903984700001604003700001504019700001904034700001604053773013204069852000904201856008504210655001204295IND4420313320221122122326.0090508s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442031332DNAL7 a193084752pmid7 a10.1007/s11356-009-0125-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Hongliang10aEndosulfan in China 2--emissions and residues  ap. 302-311.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aBackground, aim, and scope Endosulfan is one of the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and also a candidate to be included in a group of new persistent organic pollutants (UNEP 2007). The first national endosulfan usage inventories in China with 1/4° longitude by 1/6° latitude resolution has been reported in an accompanying paper. In the second part of the paper, we compiled the gridded historical emissions and soil residues of endosulfan in China from the usage inventories. Based on the residue/emission data, gridded concentrations of endosulfan in Chinese soil and air have been calculated. These inventories will provide valuable data for the further study of endosulfan. Methods Emission and residue of endosulfan were calculated from endosulfan usage by using a simplified gridded pesticide emission and residue model--SGPERM, which is an integrated modeling system combining mathematical model, database management system, and geographic information system. By using the emission and residue inventories, annual air and soil concentrations of endosulfan in each cell were determined. Results and discussion Historical gridded emission and residue inventories of α- and β-endosulfan in agricultural soil in China with 1/4° longitude by 1/6° latitude resolution have been created. Total emissions were around 10,800 t, with α-endosulfan at 7,400 t and β-endosulfan at 3,400 t from 1994 to 2004. The highest residues were 140 t for α-endosulfan and 390 t for β-endosulfan, and the lowest residues were 0.7 t for α-endosulfan and 170 t for β-endosulfan in 2004 in Chinese agricultural soil where endosulfan was applied. Based on the emission and residue inventories, concentrations of α- and β-endosulfan in Chinese air and agricultural surface soil were also calculated for each grid cell. We have estimated annual averaged air concentrations and the annual minimum and maximum soil concentrations across China. The real concentrations will be different from season to season. Although our model does not consider the transport of the insecticide in the atmosphere, which could be very important in some areas during some special time, the estimated concentrations of endosulfan in Chinese air and soil derived from the endosulfan emission and residue inventories are in general consistent with the published monitoring data. Conclusions To our knowledge, this work is the first inventory of this kind for endosulfan published on a national scale. Concentrations of the chemical in Chinese air and agricultural surface soil were calculated for each grid cell. Results show that the estimated concentrations of endosulfan in Chinese air and soil agree reasonably well with the monitoring data in general. Recommendations and perspectives The gridded endosulfan emission/residue inventories and also the air and soil concentration inventories created in this study will be updated upon availability of new information, including usage and monitoring data. The establishment of these inventories for the OCP is important for both scientific communities and policy makers. 3achemical concentration 3amathematical models 3aagricultural soils 3ainventories 3apersistent organic pollutants 3alongitude 3aspatial data 3aair 3aendosulfan 3alatitude 3aemissions 3aissues and policy 3adatabases 3aUnited Nations Environment Programme 2aAgriculture 2aAirxanalysis 2aChemical Industry 2aEndosulfanxchemistry 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aEnvironmental Pollutantsxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aInsecticidesxchemistry 2aPesticide Residuesxchemistry 2aSoilxanalysis. 3aChina 0aatmosphere1 aSun, Yeqing1 aLi, Yi-Fan1 aTian, Chongguo1 aWang, Degao1 aYang, Meng1 aDing, Yongshen1 aMa, Jianmin0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2009 May, v. 16, no. 3 p.302-311dSpringer-Verlagx0944-13447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-009-0125-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01706naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245009000129300001600219500001500235520064500250650001700895650003000912650001600942650002400958650002400982650001801006650002001024650001601044650002501060651001801085653001601103653002501119653000901144773009901153852000901252930003301261945001301294946001301307655001201320IND2195918020221122122306.0981209e199805  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219591802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGale, H.F.

The results show no difference in technology use due to rural-urban location. Characteristics of nonmetro plants, including size, prevalency of branch plants, and nature of production process, tend to raise nonmetro manufacturing technology use. Lower nonmetro schooling levels, an older labor force, and mix of industries with low technology use tend to reduce technology use in nonmetro areas. 3aurbanization 3ainformation dissemination 3aurban areas 3atechnology transfer 3aregression analysis 3amanufacturing 3alocation theory 3arural areas 3aprobabilistic models 3aUnited States 0acomparisons 0aeconomic development 0auses0 tAmerican journal of agricultural economics.g1998 May, v. 80, no. 2 p.347-359x0002-90927nnas  aDNAL  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03121naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002100156245004200177300001500219520211800234650001302352650001002365650001102375650001302386650001402399650001002413650001202423650001002435650001502445650001502460650001402475650001502489650001002504773017902514856005702693852000902750655001202759IND60626389620221122090711.0181220s1976    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062638962DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1976.tb00244.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOstrom, John H.,10aArchaeopteryx and the origin of birds  ap. 91-182.  aThe question of the origin of birds can be equated with the origin of Archaeopteryx, the oldest known bird. Analysis of the five presently known skeletal specimens of Archaeopteryx. and comparison with the skeletal anatomy of the several reptilian groups that have been proposed as possible ancestors of birds (Ornithopoda, Theropoda, Hseudosuchla and Sphenosuchidac), confirm the conclusions (long rejected by most subsequent workers) of Heilmann (1926), Lowe (1935, 1944) and Holmgren (1955), namely, that the skeletal anatomy of Archaeopteryx is extraordinarily similar to that of contemporaneous and succeeding coelurosaurian dinosaurs. Rejection of these similarities as adaptive structures only (parallel or convergent similarities), and therefore of no phylogenetic importance, is here considered invalid. Heilmann was the first to identify the only evidence that has been cited so far for dismissing coelurosaurian-avian ancestral–descendant relationships, the supposed absence of clavicles in all theropods, and on that basis suggested a common Archaeopteryx–dinosaur ancestry among pseudosuchian reptiles. That evidence is negative and thus inconclusive, and is now known to be false. With the exception of fused clavicles and unique ischial morphology, virtually every skeletal feature of Archaeopteryx is known in several contemporaneous or near-contemporary coelurosaurian dinosaurs and many of these conditions are unrelated, specialized features (the detailed morphology of the manus, metacarpus, carpus, humerus, scapulocoracoid, pes, metatarsus, tarsus, femur, pubis, ilium, skull and mandibles). The presence of so many derived characters in common clearly establishes that the closest ancestral affinities ot Archaeopteryx are with coelurosaurian theropods. There is no contrary evidence and any other explanation is illogical. All available evidence indicates unequivocally that Archaeopteryx evolved from a small coelurosaurian dinosaur and that modern birds are surviving dinosaurian descendants. Stated simply, avian phylogeny was: Pseudosuchia Coelurosauria Archaeopteryx higher birds. 3aancestry 3abirds 3acarpus 3aclavicle 3adinosaurs 3afemur 3ahumerus 3ailium 3ametacarpus 3ametatarsus 3aphylogeny 3apubic bone 3askull0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1976 June, v. 8, no. 2 p.91-182dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1976.tb00244.x  aDNAL 7aarticle01837naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011000128300001600238520064300254650001300897650002000910650002100930650002500951650002300976650001300999650001301012650001801025650001901043650001801062650001401080650002301094650002401117651001301141653002701154700001501181700001801196700002201214773009901236852000901335930003301344945001301377946001301390655001201403IND2195918420221122090804.0981209e199805  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219591842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVickner, S.S.12aA dynamic economic analysis of nitrate leaching in corn production under nonuniform irrigation conditions  ap. 397-408.  aWe develop a dynamic economic model that includes control variables for both nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation water to analyze interseasonal corn production and nitrate leaching in the presence of irrigation system nonuniformity.

There are often problems with fingerprinting pollution sources or clarifying the spreading pattern due to a wide variety of possibilities giving similar anomalies. The aims of the project were to evaluate the advantages of combining results from multigeophysical modelling and statistical/chemical modelling in order to identify pollution sources and the spreading pattern and to test a new technique for chemical fingerprinting. The project was carried out at a landfill in central Sweden using geophysical measurements and modelling of CVES, GPR and VLF as well as chemical modelling using M3 (multivariate mixing and mass balance calculations). The results indicate that by combining geophysical modelling and chemical calculations, the possibilities of fingerprinting the origin of pollution as well as delineating the spreading pattern are significantly increased. 3agroundwater 3ageophysics 3amodels 3apollution 3alandfills 0aPCA1 aJernberg, Hillevie 1 aRosenqvist, Andreas 0 tEnvironmental geology.g2006 Mar., v. 49, no. 5 p.720-732dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0943-01057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00254-005-0117-93Available from publisher's Web site  a20080302b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01441naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245010500131300001600236520054000252650001700792650002500809650001500834650002400849651001200873651002600885700003000911700002100941700002300962700002400985773012101009852000901130655001201139IND6081122120221122031922.0141110e200212  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND608112212DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShrestha, Ram K.10aVisitor Preferences and Values for Water-Based Recreation: A Case Study of the Ocala National Forest  ap. 547-559.  aWe used the open-ended contingent valuation method to elicit willingnes to pay (WTP) for day visitors and extended visitors on the Ocala National Forest (ONF), Florida.

In the experiment, assemblages varying in species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 species) and functional group richness (1-4, grasses, legumes, rosette forbs, and creeping forbs) were grown in control and fertilized plots, without any attempt to prevent the invasion of unsown species or to weed them. The relationship between species and functional group diversity and above-ground biomass was positive for sown species in all study years (2003, 2004 and 2005). In the latter 2 years, weed invader biomass decreased significantly with increasing biomass of sown species and their functional group richness, but not with number of species. However, no suppressive effect of species or functional group richness beyond that by increased biomass of residents was found. In fact, slight but significant positive partial effect of species richness was found, suggesting that the negative effect of the same amount of resident biomass on invaders is stronger when the biomass is composed of fewer species. The negative relationship between the number of functional groups of residents and invader biomass suggested that better coverage of functional trait space could be a mechanism promoting the resistance to invasion. In Addition, species composition of invaders were significantly related to initial composition of sown residents. 3aaboveground biomass 3afield experimentation 3aforbs 3agrasses 3agrasslands 3alegumes 3amanual weed control 3aplant communities 3aspecies diversity 3aweeds1 aLepš, Jan0 tPlant ecology.g2008 Oct., v. 198, no. 2 p.253-263dSpringer Netherlandsx1385-02377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-008-9401-6 7aarticle03126naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092040001800123072001700141072001700158072001700175100001300192245013900205300001800344520147600362650000901838650001801847650001701865650001601882650001401898650002601912650001401938650002101952650002201973650002601995650002802021650001302049650001702062650002102079650002102100650002302121650001002144650002302154653002102177700001502198700001802213700001902231700001302250700001502263773012102278852000902399856008102408930003302489945002502522946001302547655001202560IND4436996120221122004911.0100514e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443699612DNAL7 a10.2527/jas.2009-25972doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aYu, Y.H.10aPorcine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ mediates the lipolytic effects of dietary fish oil to reduce body fat deposition  ap. 2009-2018.  aPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ promotes fatty acid catabolism and energy expenditure in skeletal muscle and adipose tissues. A ligand for PPARδ is required to activate PPARδ function. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potential ligands for PPARδ activation. The current experiment was designed to determine the potential for PUFA, particularly from dietary fish oil, to activate porcine PPARδ in vivo. Transgenic mice were generated to overexpress porcine PPARδ in the adipose tissue. Mice were fed a high-saturated fat (13% beef tallow), or high-unsaturated fat (13% fish oil) diet, or a diet containing 4 mg/kg of a PPARδ ligand (L165041) for 4 mo. Compared with beef tallow feeding, fish oil feeding reduced fat mass and decreased (P < 0.05) plasma triacylglycerol and FFA concentrations in the transgenic mice. Adipose tissue expression of genes involved in adipogenesis (i.e., lipoprotein lipase and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein) was decreased in transgenic mice fed fish oil or the PPARδ ligand. In the same mice, expression of the lipolytic gene, hormone-sensitive lipase was increased (P < 0.05). Fish oil feeding also stimulated expression of genes participating in fatty acid oxidation in the liver of transgenic mice compared with wild-type mice. Overall, these results indicate that PUFA may serve as natural and effective regulators of lipid catabolism in vivo and many of these effects may be generated from activation of PPARδ. 3amice 3aanimal models 3afeed rations 3adietary fat 3afish oils 3atranscription factors 3areceptors 3alipid metabolism 3aenergy metabolism 3asaturated fatty acids 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3abody fat 3ablood lipids 3atriacylglycerols 3afree fatty acids 3atransgenic animals 3aliver 3alipid peroxidation 0alipid catabolism1 aWang, P.H.1 aCheng, W.T.K.1 aMersmann, H.J.1 aWu, S.C.1 aDing, S.T.0 tJournal of animal science.g2010 June, v. 88, no. 6 p.2009-2018dAmerican Society of Animal Sciencex0021-88127nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2009-25973Available from publisher's Web site  a20100807b20100903c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/07/12  aOther US 7aarticle02124naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245014100133300001600274500002400290520062400314650001500938650001400953650001300967650003100980650001601011650002001027650002501047650001401072650002201086650002001108651001201128653001201140653001901152700001701171700002401188700002301212700001901235700001501254700002401269773012601293852000901419856016901428930003301597945001301630946001101643655001201654IND2268217720221122005022.0010405e20000615ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226821772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuomundsdottir, S.10aMeasures applied to control Renibacterium salmoninarum infection in Atlantic salmon: a retrospective study of two sea ranches in Iceland  ap. 193-203.  aIncludes references  aThis study describes the success of broodstock culling in controlling Renibacterium salmoninarum infection on two sea ranches in Iceland.

The number of species flying in the same area has been estimated wherever possible, and the degree of faunal similarity at different sites. The number of species increases as one proceeds north from 50–100 to 100–150, and the fauna is separable into two groups. The difference in faunal composition and diversity is related to the southern boundary of the rain forest. The comparative poorness of the butterfly fauna in tropical Africa compared to tropical South America is discussed, with reference to the parallel difference in the bird faunas of the two continents. 3abirds 3abutterflies 3afauna 3aflight 3arain forests 3arivers 3atropics 3aDemocratic Republic of the Congo 3aSouth America0 tBiological journal of the Linnean Society.g1978 Sept., v. 10, no. 3 p.349-360dPublished for the Linnean Society of London by Blackwell [etc.]wJournal:jnl1847x0024-40667nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8312.1978.tb00021.x  aDNAL 7aarticle02968naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010300123300001800226500007500244500002400319520173300343650001702076650002502093650001402118650001302132650001302145653001902158653002802177700002002205700002002225700001502245700001902260700001602279773015302295852000902448856005402457930003302511945001302544946001302557655001202570IND2279255620221121223018.0010410e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227925562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Q.10aRice bioinformatocs.

Several attributes such as small genome size, diploid nature, transformability, and establishment of genetic and molecular resources make it a tractable organism for plant biologists. With an estimated genome size of 430 Mb (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991), it is feasible to obtain the complete genome sequence of rice using current technologies. An international effort has been established and is in the process of sequencing O. sativa spp. japonica var "Nipponbare" using a bacterial artificial chromosome/P1 artificial chromosome shotgun sequencing strategy. Annotation of the rice genome is performed using prediction-based and homology-based searches to identify genes. Annotation tools such as optimized gene prediction programs are being developed for rice to improve the quality of annotation. Resources are also being developed to leverage the rice genome sequence to partial genome projects such as expressed sequence tag projects, thereby maximizing the output from the rice genome project. To provide a low level of annotation for rice genomic sequences, we have aligned all rice bacterial artificial chromosome/P1 artificial chromosome sequences with The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Indices that are a set of nonredundant transcripts that are generated from nine public plant expressed sequence tag projects (rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, barley, Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, and barrel medic). In addition, we have used data from The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Indices and the Arabidopsis and Rice Genome Projects to identify putative orthologues and paralogues among these nine genomes. 3aOryza sativa 3anucleotide sequences 3adatabases 3aInternet 3agenomics 0agenetic models 0amolecular sequence data1 aQuackenbush, J.1 aSultana, Razia.1 aPertea, M.1 aSalzberg, S.L.1 aBuell, C.R.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Mar., v. 125, no. 3 p.1166-1174dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02517naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001600142245016500158300001600323520109400339650002001433650001901453650001901472650001901491650001901510650001601529650001101545650001501556650001901571650003701590650001301627650002401640650001901664650001301683650002101696700001501717773010701732852000901839856008201848856008201930930003302012945001302045946001302058655001202071IND2058761620221121222946.0970802e199705  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205876162DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29003942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTabak, H.H.10aProtocol for determining bioavailability and biokinetics of organic pollutants in dispersed, compacted and intact soil systems to enhance in situ bioremediation  ap. 330-339.  aThe development of effective in situ and on-site bioremediation technologies can facilitate the cleanup of chemically-contaminated soil sites. Knowledge of biodegradation kinetics and the bioavailability of organic pollutants can facilitate decisions on the efficacy of in situ and on-site bioremediation of contaminated soils and determine the attainable treatment end-points. Two kinds of compounds have been studied: (1) phenol and alkyl phenols, which represent hydrophilic compounds, exhibiting high water solubility and moderate to low soil partitioning; and (2) polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which are hydrophobic compounds with low water solubility and exhibit significant partitioning in soil organic carbon. Representative data are given for phenol and naphthalene. The results provide support for a systematic multi-level protocol using soil slurry, wafer and porous tube or column reactors to determine the biokinetic parameters for toxic organic pollutants. Insights into bioremediation rates of soil contaminants in compact soil systems can be attained using the protocol. 3abioavailability 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3anaphthalene 3aphenol 3apollutants 3apolluted soils 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aslurries 3asoil organic carbon 3asoil pollution 3atoxicity 3awater solubility1 aGovind, R.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1997 May, v. 18, no. 5 p.330-339x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.29003943Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle01685naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005900126300001600185520070900201650001200910650002000922650001700942650001100959650002500970650002200995650001301017650000901030650001601039651001801055653001501073653001001088653001801098700001601116773009901132852000901231930003301240945001301273946001301286655001201299IND2195917620221121165608.0981209e199805  iau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219591762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLence, S.H.14aThe forward-looking competitive firm under uncertainty  ap. 303-312.  aUnder realistic circumstances, forward-looking risk-averse firms will produce more than risk-neutral firms, and a mean-preserving spread of the price distribution will increase risk-averse firms' production.

This study rationalizes previously unexplained real-world behavior such as the spreading of sales over time and short-run production (or storage) at an expected loss.

In surveys and reports, farmers have indicated several changes caused by the pandemic that impact their businesses, such as increase in local food demand, reduction in on-farm labor, and limitations on hosting on-farm visits with customers. The MUE StrikeForce project team, a U.S. Department of Agriculture strategic initiative, continued to serve farmers by developing alternative educational opportunities that incorporated social distancing and other preventative actions, and were of immediate use to farmers in a crisis. Several of the educational approaches, including video conferencing, online teaching, digital recordings, video repositories, social media communications, pick up and drop off locations, and the use of multiple online viewing platforms such as Zoom recordings have proven to be effective in helping farmers sustain their businesses and have substantially increased access to programming across the state. The convenience of accessing education and learning opportunities online also appealed to more participants. Overall, online educational delivery was positively received by producers, demonstrating the efficacy of digital learning when paired with offline resources and support from the StrikeForce project team. After the pandemic ends, MUE will continue to implement these approaches. Nevertheless, the traditional Extension approach of one-on-one consulting and farm visits cannot be completely replaced by online educational programming. The pandemic has highlighted inequities faced by many rural Missouri farmers that lack dependable internet or cell phone network access, and had no access to StrikeForce programming when face-to-face visits were paused. 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aInternet 3aUSDA 3aagriculture 3acommunity development 3aeducation 3afarms 3alabor 3amobile telephones 3apandemic 3aspecialty crops 3aMissouri1 aMillsap, James Curtis1 aByers, Patrick1 aGundel, Jamie1 aPerregoy, Katherine1 aLake, Amy1 aDenkler, Sarah1 aMeusch, Eric1 aBurton, David0 tJournal of agriculture, food systems, and community development.g2021, v. 10, no.

In the present work, the genetic variability and relationship among six native ovine breeds from the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula were analyzed using eleven microsatellite markers. Additionally, assessment of the intra-population diversity of the Latxa breed was based on morphologically established varieties and types. Results from this study emphasize the importance of population structure within the Latxa breed and, in this sense, genetic data suggest a new classification of Latxa subpopulations. Multivariate analyzes performed made apparent branch differentiation among Latxa, Carranzana and Sasi Ardi breeds belonging to the churro branch and the Navarra, Rasa Aragonesa and Castellana breeds classified in the entrefino group. Large diversity within the churro branch in comparison to the more homogenous entrefino sheep was evident using neutral information based on molecular markers. These results, together with historical and morphological data, lead us to suggest the independent origin of the two groups from different migration events, followed by a highly differentiated demographic and reproductive history of the churro and entrefino branches. This study is an example of the usefulness of DNA variation analyzes applied to livestock for the assessment of the ethnological history of closely-related populations. 3aDNA 3aRasa Aragonesa 3agenetic markers 3agenetic variation 3amicrosatellite repeats 3apopulation structure 3asheep 3aIberian Peninsula1 aIriondo, M.1 aJudgo, B.M.1 aMazón, L.I.1 aAguirre, A.1 aVicario, A.1 aEstonba, A.0 tSmall ruminant research.g2004 May, v. 52, no. 3 p.195-202dElsevier Sciencex0921-44887nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2003.07.0043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02268naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100001400142245012200156300001600278520102200294650001801316650001201334650001501346650001101361650001201372650001201384650001301396650001301409650001201422700001401434700001401448700001401462700001501476700001501491773010801506852000901614856008201623856008201705930003301787945001301820946001301833655001201846IND2058848420221121051050.0970806e199704  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205884842DNAL7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29003782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, I.Y.10aProduction of curdlan using sucrose or sugar cane molasses by two-step fed-batch cultivation of Agrobacterium species  ap. 255-259.  aMaltose and sucrose were efficient carbon sources for the production of curdlan by a strain of Agrobacterium sp. A two-step, fed-batch operation was designed in which biomass was first produced, followed by curdlan production which was stimulated by nitrogen limitation. There exists an optimal timing for nitrogen limitation for curdlan production in the two-step, fed-batch operation. Maximum curdlan production (60 g L-1) was obtained from sucrose with a productivity of 0.2 g L-1 h-1 when nitrogen was limited at a cell concentration of 16.0 g L-1. It was also noted that the curdlan yield from sucrose was as high as 0.45 g curdlan g-1 sucrose, and the highest specific production rate was 1.0 g curdlan g-1 cells h-1 right after nitrogen limitation. Of particular importance was the use of molasses as a cheap carbon source to produce curdlan in the two-step, fed-batch cultivation. As high as 42 g L-1 of curdlan with a yield of 0.35 g curdlan g-1 total sugar was obtained after 120 h of fed-batch cultivation. 3aAgrobacterium 3abiomass 3acane sugar 3acarbon 3acurdlan 3amaltose 3amolasses 3anitrogen 3asucrose1 aSeo, W.T.1 aKim, G.J.1 aKim, M.K.1 aPark, C.S.1 aPark, Y.H.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1997 Apr., v. 18, no. 4 p.255-259x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.29003783Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03087naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002700111040001800138100001900156245010600175300001600281500002400297520124000321650002201561650001601583650001601599650001801615650001501633650001401648650002001662650001001682650001401692650001001706650001101716650001301727650001001740650002501750650002601775650002501801650002801826650002701854650002901881650005001910650005101960650006302011650004802074650001902122650006202141700001402203700001302217700001302230700001602243700001802259773013402277852000902411856007702420655001202497IND4420361820221121032936.0090508s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442036182DNAL7 a187671412pmid7 a10.1002/tox.204352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Lin-Song10aEffect of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate on the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings  ap. 296-303.  aIncludes references  aAlthough many studies describe ionic liquids (ILs) as potentially greener solvents, few studies address their relationship with the environment. Recent researches suggest that some ILs have toxicity. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([C₄mim][BF₄]) was reported to have the lowest toxicity among ILs. In this work, we studied the toxicity of this IL on wheat seedlings. It was shown that wheat germination was reduced to 38.0% in the presence of 4.4 mmol/L [C₄mim][BF₄] compared with 100% germination for the control. Similarly, the root and shoot length of wheat seedlings decreased with increasing concentrations of [C₄mim][BF₄]. The activity of amylase increased in shoots and roots, but it decreased significantly in germinating seeds when the [C₄mim][BF₄] concentration exceeded 1.8 mmol/L. Peroxidase (POD) activity and soluble protein content in shoots treated with [C₄mim][BF₄] changed similarly, but chlorophyll content tended to decrease with increasing concentration of [C₄mim][BF₄], except for at 1.8 mmol/L. Thus, [C₄mim][BF₄] at the concentration of 0.9 mmol/L or more was toxic to wheat seedlings. Some remedial measures are suggested to deal with IL pollution in the environment. 3aTriticum aestivum 3achlorophyll 3agermination 3aionic liquids 3aperoxidase 3apollution 3aprotein content 3aroots 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3atoxicity 3awheat 2aAmylasesxmetabolism 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aImidazolesxtoxicity 2aIonic Liquidsxtoxicity 2aPeroxidasexmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxanalysis 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPlant Shootsxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aSeedlingsxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development. 2aSeedsxchemistryxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aToxicity Tests 2aTriticumxdrug effectsxenzymologyxgrowth & development.1 aWang, Lin1 aWang, Li1 aWang, Ge1 aLi, Zhao-Hu1 aWang, Jian-Ji0 tEnvironmental toxicology.g2009 June, v. 24, no. 3 p.296-303dWiley Subscription Services, Inc., A Wiley Companyx1520-40817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/tox.204353Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03508naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002500162245018800187300001600375500002400391520120300415650002501618650002101643650001201664650001001676650001001686650002801696650001801724650001101742650003401753650001801787650001901805650001801824650002801842650001901870650002401889650001201913650003701925650005501962650004802017650005302065650003602118650003002154650005202184650002602236650004602262650003102308650003102339650004202370650003802412650004102450700002102491700001902512700002902531700002702560700003002587700003202617773010502649852000902754856008302763655001202846IND4461518420221121032901.0110818s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446151842DNAL7 a217518512pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-10-10-02482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRossi, Franco Rubén14aThe Sesquiterpene Botrydial Produced by Botrytis cinerea Induces the Hypersensitive Response on Plant Tissues and Its Action Is Modulated by Salicylic Acid and Jasmonic Acid Signaling  ap. 888-896.  aIncludes references  aBotrytis cinerea, as a necrotrophic fungus, kills host tissues and feeds on the remains. This fungus is able to induce the hypersensitive response (HR) on its hosts, thus taking advantage on the host's defense machinery for generating necrotic tissues. However, the identity of HR effectors produced by B. cinerea is not clear. The aim of this work was to determine whether botrydial, a phytotoxic sesquiterpene produced by B. cinerea, is able to induce the HR on plant hosts, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model. Botrydial induced the expression of the HR marker HSR3, callose deposition, and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and phenolic compounds. Botrydial also induced the expression of PR1 and PDF1.2, two pathogenesis-related proteins involved in defense responses regulated by salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), respectively. A. thaliana and tobacco plants defective in SA signaling were more resistant to botrydial than wild-type plants, as opposed to A. thaliana plants defective in JA signaling, which were more sensitive. It can be concluded that botrydial induces the HR on its hosts and its effects are modulated by host signaling pathways mediated by SA and JA. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aBotrytis cinerea 3acallose 3afungi 3ahosts 3ahypersensitive response 3ajasmonic acid 3amodels 3apathogenesis-related proteins 3aphytotoxicity 3aplant response 3aplant tissues 3areactive oxygen species 3asalicylic acid 3asignal transduction 3atobacco 2aAldehydesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBridged Bicyclo Compoundsxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aBotrytisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCyclopentanesxmetabolism 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxdrug effects 2aOxylipinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effects 2aSalicylic Acidxmetabolism 2aSesquiterpenesxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aSignal Transductionxdrug effects 2aTobaccoxdrug effectsxmicrobiology.1 aGárriz, Andrés1 aMarina, María1 aRomero, Fernando Matías1 aGonzalez, María Elisa1 aCollado, González Isidro1 aPieckenstain, Fernando Luis0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.888-896dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-10-10-02483Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03798naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014600127300001600273500013200289500002400421500001500445520233500460650001602795650001402811650002302825650001702848650003702865650001202902650001902914650001902933650001402952650002102966650001102987653002502998700002003023700001703043700001903060773012203079852000903201856008503210930003303295945001303328946001103341655001203352IND2268194920221121033019.0010405e200011  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226819492DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAulakh, M.S.10aMethane transport capacity of rice plants.

However, a rapid and accurate method to study the CH4 transport capacity (MTC) of rice plants is not available. We developed a gas sampling and analytical device based on a closed two-compartment chamber technique and analyzed the enrichment of the CH4 mixing ratio inside the shoot compartment of cylindrical cuvettes enclosing individual rice plants under ambient conditions. The computer-controlled analytical system consists of a gas chromatograph (GC) and a pressure-controlled autosampler for eight cuvettes (seven for plants and one for CH4-calibration gas). The system automates closure and opening of plant cuvettes using pneumatic pressure, air sample collection and injection into the GC, and CH4 analysis. It minimizes sources of error during air sampling by continuously mixing headspace air of each cuvette, maintaining pressure and composition of the headspace inside the cuvettes, purging the dead volumes between the sampler induction tube and GC, and running a reference CH4-calibration gas sample in each cycle. Tests showed that the automated system is a useful tool for accurate sampling of headspace air of cylindrical cuvettes enclosing individual rice plants and enables rapid and accurate fully automated analysis of CH4 in the headspace air samples. A linear relationship was obtained between CH4 transported by rice plants of two cultivars (IR72, a high-yielding dwarf, and Dular, a traditional tall cultivar) and concentration of CH4 up to 7,500 ppm used for purging the nutrient culture solution surrounding the roots in the root compartment of the chamber. Further increase in CH4 emission by shoots was not observed at 10,000 ppm CH4 concentration in the root compartment of the chamber. The MTC of IR72 was measured at six development stages; it was lowest at seedling stage, increasing gradually until panicle initiation. There was no further change at flowering, but a marked decrease at maturity was noted. These results suggest that the plants have 45-246% greater potential to transport CH4 than the highest CH4 emission rates reported under field conditions, and plants would not emit CH4 at early growth and at a reduced rate close to ripening. 3arhizosphere 3aflowering 3amethane production 3aOryza sativa 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3amethane 3aclimate change 3amaturity stage 3aemissions 3aapplication rate 3ashoots 0adevelopmental stages1 aBodenbender, J.1 aWassmann, R.1 aRennenberg, H.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2000 Nov., v. 58, no. 1/3 p.357-366dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02510naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245006700160300001600227500002400243520139600267650002301663650001201686650001401698650002801712650001401740650001901754650000901773650002701782700001601809700001201825700001601837700001801853700001401871700002701885773011801912852000902030856008502039655001202124IND4461509320110818000000.0110818s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446150932DNAL7 a10.1017/S00218596100010612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCastro, P.10aIdentification of chickpea cultivars by microsatellite markers  ap. 451-460.  aIncludes references  aCharacterization of plant varieties is traditionally based on phenotypic observation. However, some varieties have very similar morphological characteristics, which make it difficult to distinguish between them. The present study employed 15 microsatellite markers distributed across all linkage groups (LG) of the chickpea genetic map to characterize 32 commercial chickpea cultivars and determine the usefulness of these markers for cultivar identification. These markers showed a high level of polymorphism; a total of 154 different alleles were detected, with a mean of 10·3 alleles per locus. The polymorphic information content (PIC) value ranged from 0·455 to 0·897. All the markers, with the exception of TA130, TA135 and TA144, were considered to be informative (PIC>0·7), indicating their potential usefulness for cultivar identification. A subset of markers (TA186, TA200, TA106, TA113, TA117 and TA30) was sufficient to identify all the cultivars studied. In order to confirm their discriminatory power, 16 unreleased chickpea cultivars (V1-V16) were screened and all of them presented different patterns. Therefore, these microsatellites can be regarded as a reference set for chickpea cultivar identification and their profiles can be used as a DNA fingerprint for each registered cultivar, avoiding redundancy of identical cultivars as well as to protect breeders' rights. 3aDNA fingerprinting 3aalleles 3achickpeas 3acultivar identification 3acultivars 3alinkage groups 3aloci 3amicrosatellite repeats1 aMillán, T.1 aGil, J.1 aMérida, J.1 aGarcía, M.L.1 aRubio, J.1 aFernádez-Romero, M.D.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2011 Aug., v. 149, no. 4 p.451-460dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596100010613Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01744naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179100001400196245013000210300001400340520030900354650002300663650001100686650001600697650001900713650001700732650001900749650002300768650003000791650001900821650002300840650002800863650001800891650001400909650001600923650002000939700001400959700001500973700001300988773008601001852000901087856008501096930003301181945002501214946001101239655001201250IND4436845920221121012034.0100510s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443684592DNAL7 a10.1080/095831509034195382doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

A Scanning Electron Microscope was employed to study effects of the drying process on meat fiber structure. We found that freeze-drying produced a porous material with excellent rehydration properties. Air-drying produced samples with less porosity and poorer rehydration. We concluded that porosity was the primary factor in rehydration potential and surface area and pore size distribution was less important. 3achicken meat 3afreeze drying 3ashear strength 3acolor 3adensity 3asurface area 3arehydration 3aair drying 3aporosity 0apore size1 aSingh, R.P.0 tJournal of food science.g1991 , v. 56, no. 3 p.611-615x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb05341.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02339naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001100110245015100121300001600272500002400288500001500312520093500327650000801262650001401270650001401284650001601298650003301314650001301347650002701360650001301387650001801400650001301418653002001431653001601451700001401467700001801481700001801499700001501517773012601532852000901658856016901667930003301836945001301869946001101882655001201893IND2268218320221120202132.0010405e20000615ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226821832DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Q.10aEffects of ultraviolet irradiation on genetical inactivation and morphological structure on sperm of the Japanese scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis  ap. 233-242.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aEffects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation on genetic inactivation and morphological structure of sperms were examined in the scallop, Patinopecten yessoensis. Haploid gynogenesis of the scallop was successfully induced by 50-60 s UV irradiation of 720 microwatts cm(-2)s(-1). The fertilization rate apparently decreased with increasing irradiation time, and the development of the eggs fertilized with the genetically inactivated sperms terminated before reaching the D-shaped larvae stage. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed clear destruction of the sperm acrosome and flagellum in the UV-irradiated sperms. As the duration of UV irradiation increased, the acrosome of sperms tended to suffer greater damage, until the sperms eventually lost their flagella. Abnormalities in these structures have appeared to account, at least in part, for the decline of the fertilization rate of eggs inseminated with UV-irradiated sperms. 3aova 3afecundity 3aflagellum 3agynogenesis 3afertilization (reproduction) 3aduration 3aanatomy and morphology 3aacrosome 3aembryogenesis 3ascallops 0acell structures 0aspermatozoa1 aOsada, M.1 aKashihara, M.1 aHirohashi, K.1 aKijima, A.0 tAquaculture.g2000 June 15, , no. 3/4 p.233-242dElsevier Pub.

A diffusible factor (DF) has been reported to regulate xanthomonadin biosynthesis. In this study, DF was purified from bacterial culture supernatants using a combination of solvent extraction, flash chromatography, and high-performance liquid chromatography. Mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses resolved the DF chemical structure as 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), which was further confirmed by synthetic 3-HBA. Significantly, bioassay and in silico analysis suggest that DF production is widely conserved in a range of bacterial species. Analysis of DF derivatives established the hydroxyl group and its position as the key structural features for the role of DF in xanthomonadin biosynthesis. In addition, we showed that DF is also associated with bacterial survival, H2O2 resistance, and systemic invasion. Furthermore, evidence was also presented that DF and diffusible signaling factor have overlapping functions in modulation of bacterial survival, H2O2 resistance, and virulence. Utilization of different mechanisms to modulate similar virulence traits may provide X. campestris pv. campestris with plasticity in response to various environmental cues. 3aXanthomonas campestris pv. campestris 3aantioxidant activity 3abioassays 3abiosynthesis 3acell viability 3achemical structure 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahydrogen peroxide 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3avirulence 2aAnisolesxmetabolism 2aAntioxidantsxmetabolismxpharmacology. 2aBrassicaxmicrobiology 2aHydrogen Peroxide 2aHydroxybenzoatesxmetabolism 2aMutation 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aRaphanusxmicrobiology 2aSTAT1 Transcription Factor 2aTime Factors 2aXanthomonas campestrisxcytologyxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aWu, Ji'en1 aZhou, Lian1 aYang, Fan1 aHe, Yong-Qiang1 aJiang, Bo-Le1 aBai, Linquan1 aXu, Yuquan1 aDeng, Zixin1 aTang, Ji-Liang1 aZhang, Lian-Hui0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.948-957dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-02-11-00313Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03007naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144100002200162245010700184300001600291500002400307520141300331650002301744650002501767650001301792650002601805650001501831650002301846650001001869650001801879650002401897650001301921650002401934650003901958650005901997650002702056650002302083650002302106650005002129650002802179650002102207650001402228650001702242700002602259700001902285773010502304852000902409856008302418655001202501IND4461519120221120181836.0110818s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446151912DNAL7 a215010872pmid7 a10.1094/MPMI-03-11-00502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollier, Sarah M.10aCell Death Mediated by the N-Terminal Domains of a Unique and Highly Conserved Class of NB-LRR Protein  ap. 918-931.  aIncludes references  aPlant genomes encode large numbers of nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins, many of which are active in pathogen detection and defense response induction. NB-LRR proteins fall into two broad classes: those with a Toll and interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain at their N-terminus and those with a coiled-coil (CC) domain at the N-terminus. Within CC-NB-LRR-encoding genes, one basal clade is distinguished by having CC domains resembling the Arabidopsis thaliana RPW8 protein, which we refer to as CCR domains. Here, we show that CCR-NB-LRR-encoding genes are present in the genomes of all higher plants surveyed, and that they comprise two distinct subgroups: one typified by the Nicotiana benthamiana N-required gene 1 (NRG1) protein and the other typified by the Arabidopsis activated disease resistance gene 1 (ADR1) protein. We further report that, in contrast to CC-NB-LRR proteins, the CCR domains of both NRG1- and ADR1-like proteins are sufficient for the induction of defense responses, and that this activity appears to be SGT1-independent. Additionally, we report the apparent absence of both NRG1 homologs and TIR-NB-LRR-encoding genes from the dicot Aquilegia coerulea and the dicotyledonous order Lamiales as well as from monocotyledonous species. This strong correlation in occurrence is suggestive of a functional relationship between these two classes of NB-LRR proteins. 3aAquilegia coerulea 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aLamiales 3aNicotiana benthamiana 3acell death 3adisease resistance 3agenes 3ainterleukin-1 3amicrobial detection 3aproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Deathxphysiology 2aCloning, Molecular 2aConserved Sequence 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxphysiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMultigene Family 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Leaves1 aHamel, Louis-Philippe1 aMoffett, Peter0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.918-931dAPS Pressx0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-03-11-00503Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02923naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003200110040001800142072001700160072001700177072001700194072001700211100001200228245008200240300001600322500017600338520107600514650002701590650001301617650001901630650001001649650001201659650002101671650001301692650002201705650002501727650003201752650002301784650002601807650004801833650001301881650003901894653003101933700001501964700001701979700001701996773010802013852000902121856008202130856009802212930003302310945001302343946001302356655001202369IND2070284720221120164828.0980430e199708  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207028472DNAL7 a93660942pmid7 a10.1038/sj.jim.29004402doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The entire gene, including pre-, pro- and mature protein regions,was cloned with Pker, its own promoter, P43, the vegetative growth promoter, or the combination of P43-Pker into plasmid pUB18. Transformation of the protease-deficient strain B. subtilis DB104 with these plasmids generated transformant strains FDB-3, FDB-108 and FDB-29 respectively. All transformants expressed active keratinase in both feather and LB media, in contrast to PWD-1, in which kerA was repressed when grown in LB medium. With P43-Pker upstream of kerA, FDB-29 displayed the highest activity in feather medium. Production of keratinase in PWD-1 and transformants was further characterized when glucose or casamino acids were supplemented into the feather medium. These studies help understand the regulation of kerA expression and, in the long run, can help strain development and medium conditioning for the production of this industrially important keratinase. 3aBacillus licheniformis 3abacteria 3acasamino acids 3agenes 3aglucose 3agrowth promotion 3aplasmids 3avegetative growth 2aBacillusxenzymology 2aBacillus subtilisxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aPlasmids 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 0afeather-degrading bacteria1 aWong, S.L.1 aMiller, E.S.1 aShih, J.C.H.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1997 Aug., v. 19, no. 2 p.134-138x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sj.jim.29004403Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110314b20110402c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02076naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100002300156245008600179300001600265520111500281650002201396650001201418650001501430650001601445650001601461650001401477700001801491700001801509773018101527856005701708852000901765655001201774IND60626389220221120161154.0181220e197709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062638922DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8312.1977.tb00271.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVANE-WRIGHT, R.

Eighty per cent of Hypolimnas species belong to one or other of the first three categories. About 60% of the species show evidence of mimicry, some 40% being mimetic in both sexes. In the Oriental region the great majority of mimetic species within the genus are modelled on Euptoea, whilst those of the Afrotropical region are mostly modelled on Amauris. The host plants recorded for the genus strongly suggest that the Urticaceae are primitive for the group, but eleven other families of flowering plants are recorded as hosts. The apparent non-utilization of Urticaceae by H. misippus (L.), the most widespread species of the group, is discussed in terms of its possible ecological and phylogenetic relationships with H. bolina (L.). A check-list of butterflies feeding on Ipomoea (a host plant for both H. bolina and H. misippus), and on other Convolvulaceae, is included. 3aHypolimnas bolina 3aIpomoea 3aUrticaceae 3abutterflies 3ahost plants 3aphylogeny1 aACKERY, P.

The incidence and severity of gaping were significantly reduced with earlier filleting. The differences became even more pronounced as the fillets were stored. Fillet yield, water binding capacity and fillet weight loss did not differ among the experimental groups, but there was a positive effect of pre-rigor filleting on visual colour.

A new technique using survey-grade global positioning system (GPS) technology was developed to precisely measure the paddock spatial area coverage, diversity and distribution of dairy cattle urine patches in grazed paddocks over time. A 4-year study was conducted on the Lincoln University Dairy Farm (LUDF), Canterbury, New Zealand, from 2003 to 2007. Twelve field plots, each 100 m2 in area, were established on typical grazing areas of the farm. All urine and dung deposits within the plots were visually identified, the pasture response area (radius) measured and position marked with survey-grade GPS. The plots were grazed as part of the normal grazing rotation of the farm and urine and dung deposits measured at 12-week intervals. The data were collated using spatial (GIS) software and an assessment of annual urine patch coverage and spatial distribution was made. Grazing intensities ranged from 17 645 to 30 295 cow grazing h/ha/yr. Mean annual areas of urine patches ranged from 0·34 to 0·40 m2 (4-year mean 0·37+/-0·009 m2), with small but significant variation between years and seasons. Mean annual urine patch numbers were 6240±124 patches/ha/yr. The mean proportional area coverage for a single sampling event or season was 0·058 and the mean proportional annual urine patch coverage was 0·232±0·0071. There was a strong linear relationship between annual cow grazing h/ha and urine patch numbers/ha (R2=0·69) and also annual urine patch area coverage (R2=0·77). Within the stocking densities observed in this study, an annual increase of 10 000 cow grazing h/ha increased urine patch numbers by 1800 urine patches/ha/yr and annual urine patch area coverage by 0·07. This study presents new quantitative data on urine patch size, numbers and the spatial coverage of patches on a temporal basis. 3astocking rate 3aurine 3anitrogen 3apastures 3agrazing 3afarms 3amodels 3ageographic information systems 3adairy cattle 3afeces 3amethodology 3adairy farming 3acows 3acomputer software 3aglobal positioning systems 3aNew Zealand 0anew methods1 aCameron, K.C.1 aDi, H.J.1 aFertsak, U.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2011 Aug., v. 149, no. 4 p.473-485dCambridge University Pressx0021-85967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00218596100010123Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03655naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011800128300001600246500002400262500001500286520219000301650002002491650001802511650001002529650001602539650002202555650002602577650002002603650001802623650001902641650002402660650002402684650002102708650001702729650001302746653002102759653001102780653001102791700002202802773012602824852000902950856016902959930003303128945001303161946001103174655001203185IND2290403720221120130448.0010411e20010315ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229040372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGaylord, T.G.10aDietary protein and energy modifications to maximize compensatory growth of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus)  ap. 337-348.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA feeding trial was conducted to evaluate influences of dietary protein and energy modifications as well as indispensable amino acid supplementation on channel catfish growth and body composition during compensatory growth. Four diets were formulated to contain 32% or 37% crude protein and were maintained isocaloric at an estimated digestible energy (DE) level of 3.0 or 3.6 kcal/g; a fifth diet was formulated to be equal to the diet containing 32% crude protein and 3.0 kcal DE/g but with the addition of an indispensable amino acid supplement at 5% of diet. Each of the five experimental diets was fed to channel catfish initially weighing 17 g for 6 weeks using either satiate feeding (control) or not feeding for 3 days then feeding to apparent satiation for the next 11 days in three cycles. Weight gain of channel catfish was significantly (P < 0.05) affected by dietary treatment with a dietary energy level of 3.6 kcal DE/g enhancing weight gain. Cumulative weight gain also was increased in fish fed diets containing 37% crude protein compared to those fed diets containing 32% protein or the diet supplemented with amino acids. Compensatory growth was observed in response to the restricted feeding regime. Feed consumption was affected by dietary protein level and feeding regime. Fish fed diets containing amino acid supplementation and 37% protein reduced cumulative feed consumption compared to fish fed the diets with 32% protein. Fish on the restricted feeding regime had reduced feed consumption compared to satiate fed fish. Feed efficiency was improved in fish fed the high-energy diets and those fed the diet with 37% protein. Fish on the restricted feeding regime also had improved cumulative feed efficiency compared to fish fed daily to apparent satiation. Hepatosomatic index at the end of the experiment was altered by feeding regime, while intraperitoneal fat ratio was elevated by feeding higher dietary energy. Composition of liver and muscle was only slightly altered by dietary treatment. Therefore, the restricted feeding regime was capable of inducing elevated growth rates during refeeding but the dietary manipulations did not augment growth rates. 3adietary protein 3aenergy intake 3aliver 3abody weight 3adigestible energy 3aessential amino acids 3aliveweight gain 3acrude protein 3aprotein intake 3acompensatory growth 3aIctalurus punctatus 3afeed supplements 3afish feeding 3abody fat 0abody composition 0agrowth 0aratios1 aGatlin, D.M.

The highest weight gain was for fish fed the diet supplemented with 3.4 mg pyridoxine/kg, followed by fish fed the diets with 6.5, 27.2, 13.5 and 1.7 mg pyridoxine/kg, and the lowest in fish fed the unsupplemented control diet. Patterns of feed efficiency ratio (FER) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) were similar to those of the weight gain. Survival of fish fed the control and pyridoxine-supplemented diets were 45% and 80% to 100%, respectively. Pyridoxine deficiency signs such as anorexia, lethargy, pale body colour, tetany, convulsions and haemorrhages in intestine and kidney were observed in fish fed the pyridoxine-free diet. Anaemia in pyridoxine deficient fish was characterized by pale livers, spleens and gills. Fish fed 3.4 mg pyridoxine/kg, showed higher erythrocyte number (RBC), haemoglobin (Hb) and haematocrit (Ht) and lower mean carpuscular volume (MCV) than those fish fed the other diets. The maximum liver pyridoxine content and alanine aminotransferase (AAT) activity were observed in fish fed the 3.4 mg pyridoxine/kg diet. The associated liver pyridoxine content and AAT activity for maximum growth ranged from 3.24 to 4.65 microgram/g tissue and 2.45 to 3.50 mol pyruvate X 10(6)/mg liver(.)h, respectively. Broken-line regression analysis showed that the optimum dietary pyridoxine requirement for maximum growth of Heteropneustes fossilis under these experimental conditions was 3.21 mg/kg diet. 3aapplication rate 3avolume 3aHeteropneustes fossilis 3anutrient excess 3afeed conversion 3aalanine transaminase 3apyridoxine 3adeficiency diseases 3aliveweight gain 3aerythrocytes 3ahematocrit 3anutrient requirements 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin supplements 3aenzyme activity 3afish feeding 3amortality 0aphysiology 0asymptoms 0aprotein efficiency ratio 0anutrition0 tAquaculture.g2001 Mar. 15, , no. 3/4 p.327-335dElsevier Pub.

A comparative analysis was investigated between six strains from extensive aquaculture in two French regions (Dombes and Forez) and five strains from the Czech Republic stemming from artificial selection and maintained in the Research Center of Vodnany. Observed heterozygosity from allozyme data varied from 0.003 to 0.029 for French strains and was significantly lower than that observed for Czech strains, which varied from 0.026 to 0.058. The genetic variability of microsatellites for the whole data set was considerably higher than that for allozymes. The mean number of alleles per microsatellite locus was higher for French strains than for Czech strains (respectively, 6.2 and 4.2). Microsatellites are generally considered to be selectively neutral and the reduction of microsatellite allelic diversity in Czech strains could be related to a possible population bottleneck associated with breeding practice. However, the patterns of genetic variation for the two types of marker are possibly biased by the limited number of sampled individuals and must be confirmed in the future by more extensive studies. Significant differentiation between the strains was shown using F statistics, whatever the tested groupings, and no obvious difference was detected between relationships inferred with the two types of genetic markers. A neighbour-joining analysis of genetic distances (chord distance of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards [Am. J. Hum. Genet 19 (1967) 233.]) between strains showed that the topologies of the trees for microsatellites and allozymes were globally congruent. However, a more pronounced discrimination between the strains of the two countries was detected by the microsatellite markers which appeared more suitable to infer the effect of the geographical separation of the ancestral strains or different culture histories. 3acarp 3agenetic variation 3aallozymes 3amicrosatellite repeats 3agenetic markers 3aheterozygosity 3afish culture 3aalleles 3aloci 3ageographical variation 3aintensive forestry 3aFrance 3aCzech Republic 0aextensive production1 aLaRoche, J.1 aDurand, J.D.1 aBouvet, Y.0 tAquaculture.g2001 Mar. 15, , no. 3/4 p.291-301dElsevier Pub.

We describe a new resistance from S. sparsipilum which possesses the same phenotype and specificity as Nctbr and is controlled by a dominant gene designated Ncspl. Ncspl maps on potato chromosome IV close or allelic to Nytbr. The helper component proteinase (HC-Pro) cistron of PVY was shown to control necrotic reactions and resistance elicitation in plants carrying Ncspl, Nctbr, and Nytbr. However, inductions of necrosis and of resistance to the systemic virus movement in plants carrying Ncspl reside in different regions of the HC-Pro cistron. Also, genomic determinants outside the HC-Pro cistron are involved in the systemic movement of PVY after induction of necroses on inoculated leaves of plants carrying Nytbr. These results suggest that the Nytbr resistance may have been involved in the recent emergence of PVY isolates with a recombination breakpoint near the junction of HC-Pro and P3 cistrons in potato crops. Therefore, this emergence could constitute one of the rare examples of resistance breakdown by a virus which was caused by recombination instead of by successive accumulation of nucleotide substitutions. 3adominant genes 3aphenotype 3achromosomes 3anecrosis 3aproteinases 3aSolanum tuberosum 3apotatoes 3agenotype 3aviruses 3aPotato virus Y 3ahypersensitive response 3aleaves 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aChimeraxgenetics 2aChromosome Mapping 2aChromosomes, Plantxgenetics 2aCysteine Endopeptidasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aGenes 2aGenes, Dominant 2aGenes, Plant 2aPeptide Hydrolasesxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Diseasesxgeneticsxvirology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aPotyvirusxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombination, Genetic 2aSequence Alignment 2aSolanumxgeneticsxmetabolismxvirology. 2aViral Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0acrops1 aCaromel, Bernard1 aJohansen, Elisabeth1 aSimon, Vincent1 aChauvin, Laura1 aJacquot, Emmanuel1 aKerlan, Camille1 aLefebvre, Véronique.0 tMolecular plant-microbe interactions.g2011 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.787-797dAPS PresswJournal:jnl43555x0894-02827nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-10-10-02463Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02628naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010600129300001600235500010400251520128300355650001901638650001901657650001601676650001201692650001801704650002601722650001501748650001301763650001401776650001501790650002201805650001001827651001901837651001901856700001801875700001701893700001601910773010601926852000902032856008202041930003302123945001302156946001302169655001202182IND2058040920221120121247.0970627e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205804092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPfiffner, S.M.10aEffects of nutrient dosing on subsurface methanotrophic populations and trichloroethylene degradation  ap. 204-212.  aIn the special topical issue: Bioremediation / edited by F.K. Pfaender, J.M. Suflita and C.H. Ward.  aIn in situ bioremediation demonstration at the Savannah River Site in Aiken, South Carolina, trichloroethylene-degrading microorganisms were stimulated by delivering nutrients to the TCE-contaminated subsurface via horizontal injection wells. Microbial and chemical monitoring of groundwater from 12 vertical wells was used to examine the effects of methane and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) dosing on the methanotrophic populations and or the potential of the subsurface microbial communities to degrade TCE. Densities of methanotrophs increased 3-5 orders of magnitude during the methane- and nutrient-injection phases; this increase coincided with the higher methane levels observed in the monitoring wells. TCE degradation capacity, although not directly tied to methane concentration, responded to the methane injection, and responded more dramatically to the multiple-nutrient injection. These results support the crucial role of methane, nitrogen, and phosphorus as amended nutrients in TCE bioremediation. The enhancing effects of nutrient dosing on microbial abundance and degradative potentials, coupled with increased chloride concentrations, provided multiple lines of evidence substantiating the effectiveness of this integrated in situ bioremediation process. 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3agroundwater 3amethane 3amethanotrophs 3amicrobial communities 3amonitoring 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3atrichloroethylene 3awells 3aSavannah River 3aSouth Carolina1 aPalumbo, A.V.1 aPhelps, T.J.1 aHazen, T.C.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1997 , v. 18, no. 2/3 p.204-212x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050601b00000000c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle03931naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245005000171300001200221500015100233520224000384650001802624650001502642650001402657650001202671650001002683650001702693650001402710650001502724650001002739650002502749650001202774650001902786650001302805650001302818650002802831650002302859650001402882650002402896650002302920650001902943650001402962650000902976650001502985650002103000650001303021650001103034650001703045650001803062650001803080651001103098651002803109773014103137856005403278852000903332655001203341IND60589527520221120110900.0180223e20171030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058952752DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1176.12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOs, E.

Southern countries with a warmer and drier climate are especially looking to enough quantity to increase production while north western European countries have to face the quality aspects of discharge water emitting to the environment. As a consequence both want to recirculate the nutrient solution in soilless cultivation, but facing different problems. For incoming water the sodium concentration should be as low as possible to avoid accumulation and, consequently, discharge. Discharge water contains nutrients (nitrates, phosphates) and plant protection products (PPPs) which pollute surface water realizing non-natural ecosystems in ditches and canals. The concentration of PPPs often appeared to be too high for quality surface water standards, it led to legislation to purify the discharge water by 95% in 2018. On the other hand it was already said that, as a consequence of European legislation, discharge of nitrogen should go down to almost zero in 2027. Preliminary results of emission free cultivation will be shown. System development took mainly place in crops as leafy vegetables, strawberries and chrysanthemums with roughly more than 10-15 plants m-2. Nutrient film technique (NFT) in various trough shapes, deep flow technique (DFT) with floating panels for lettuce and herbs often in combination with mechanisation and automation make a revival. Research emphasises on knowledge of the microbial flora in the recirculating water and resilience against pathogens. All to avoid expensive disinfection of the nutrient solution (more volume in recirculation). Slowly systems for outside are being developed facing other challenges (precipitation, frost), but for reason of nitrogen emission to ground and surface water. On a small scale urban farming on roofs of buildings are designed. As design mostly comes from industrial approach, economics are not always clear. Within substrates the strong position of stone wool remains, but organic waste flows are treated to be used as a sustainable substrate, partly to replace peat. One is looking to a way to use organic fertilizer, instead of inorganic ones, to come closer to certified organic farming. 3aChrysanthemum 3aautomation 3abuildings 3aclimate 3acrops 3adisinfection 3aeconomics 3aecosystems 3aherbs 3alaws and regulations 3alettuce 3amicroorganisms 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrient film technique 3anutrient solutions 3anutrients 3aorganic fertilizers 3aorganic production 3aorganic wastes 3apathogens 3apeat 3aphosphates 3aplant protection 3arockwool 3asodium 3astrawberries 3asurface water 3aurban farming 3aEurope 3aWestern European region0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 30, , no. 1176 p.1-8dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1176.1  aDNAL 7aarticle03730naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120072001700138072001700155072001700172072001700189072001700206100002100223245012800244300001600372500002300388500001500411520206600426650002802492650001602520650001702536650002602553650001902579650002202598650001802620650001802638650002502656650001902681650002002700650001602720650002402736650002702760650002602787651003002813653002902843653002202872700002002894700002202914773007202936852000903008856007803017930003303095945002503128946001103153655001203164IND4436834220221120110844.0100510e201003  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443683422DNAL7 a10.5558/tfc86234-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aThiffaul, Nelson10aSilviculture and planted species interact to influence reforestation success on a Kalmia-dominated site – a 15-year study  ap. 234-242.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aSuccessful regeneration following harvesting or natural disturbance is a fundamental prerequisite for sustainable forest management. However, some regenerating stands have poor juvenile growth rates, which compromise sustainable management objectives. In particular, the presence of some ericaceous species that proliferate after forest disturbance, such as Kalmia angustifolia, can slow succession of boreal stands to the point that ecosystem retrogression is induced. We used data from a silvicultural field trial established in central Newfoundland to evaluate how various combinations of silvicultural treatments (trench scarification, herbicide application, fertilization at planting) influenced growth of three conifer species planted on a Kalmia-dominated cutover. Ground-level diameter (GLD), height, diameter at breast height (DBH), and percent Kalmia cover were assessed at the end of 15 growing seasons after planting. We detected several interactions between silvicultural treatments and planted conifer species. Globally, height and estimates of foliar biomass of all conifer species responded positively to scarification. Fifteen-year height in both scarified and unscarified treatments was in the order Picea mariana < Pinus banksiana < Larix laricina. Black spruce and jack pine height increased when Kalmia was controlled with herbicide, but height of tamarack was not. The use of herbicide significantly increased 15-year GLD and volume index of all three conifer species, but only black spruce responded positively to fertilization at planting. Our results confirm that species-specific responses to silvicultural treatments are to be expected when managing Kalmia-dominated sites. Although chemical vegetation management has great silvicultural potential, our results suggest that mechanical site preparation can also be effective in promoting early conifer seedling growth that leads to rapid canopy closure. It is anticipated that canopy closure will lead to exclusion of Kalmia later in the rotation through natural successional pathways. 3asilvicultural practices 3atree growth 3aweed control 3along term experiments 3aboreal forests 3aforest succession 3areforestation 3aPicea mariana 3asustainable forestry 3aLarix laricina 3aPinus banksiana 3awoody weeds 3aKalmia angustifolia 3aecological restoration 3acrop-weed competition 3aNewfoundland and Labrador 0aecological retrogression 0aforest management1 aTitus, Brian D.1 aMoroni, Martin T.0 tForestry chronicle.g2010 , v. 86, no. 2 p.234-242x0015-75467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5558/tfc86234-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100722b20100807c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/06/12  aNon-US 7aarticle02848naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196100001500213245012600228300001300354500001500367520111400382650002301496650001701519650001701536650002701553650003001580650002701610650002301637650002301660650001601683650002101699650002401720650001101744650001901755650001101774650001401785650001401799650002301813650002101836651002101857653001601878653001801894653003001912700001801942700001801960700002001978773008501998852000902083856008502092930003302177945002502210946001102235655001202246IND4436844720221123034227.0100510s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443684472DNAL7 a10.1080/095831509033057372doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

In order to find an effective biocontrol agent against this pest, we determined the effectiveness of entomopathogenic fungi against D. micans. Virulence of nine highly pathogenic strains including Beauveria bassiana (2), Beauveria cf. bassiana (2), Metarhizium anisopliae (2), Metarhizium sp. (1), Isaria fumosorosea (1) and Evlachovaea sp. (1) was evaluated on D. micans larvae and adults under laboratory conditions. Mortality values for both larvae and adults ranged from 83 to 100% and from 23 to 100%, respectively. Larvae were more susceptible to fungi than adults (P<0.05). Based on screening tests, B. cf. bassiana isolate KTU-53 was found the most effective isolate. LC50 values were calculated as 1.7710(4) and 2.6510(4) conidia mL-1 for isolate KTU-53 against larvae and adults, respectively. Consequently, B. cf. bassiana isolate KTU-53 appears to be the most promising microbial control agent for biocontrol of D. micans. 3aIsaria fumosorosea 3ainsect pests 3aforest trees 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abiological control agents 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3aBeauveria bassiana 3astrain differences 3aplant pests 3ainoculum density 3aDendroctonus micans 3alarvae 3ainsect control 3aimagos 3avirulence 3amortality 3abiological control 3aPicea orientalis 3aTurkey (country) 0aEvlachovaea 0aadult insects 0aPaecilomyces fumosoroseus1 aDemir, Ismail1 aTanyeli, Elif1 aDemirbag, Zihni0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2010, v. 20, no. 1-2 p.3-11x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831509033057373Available from publisher's Web site  a20100722b20100807c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle04058naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245014500127300001600272500013200288500002400420500001500444520239300459650001402852650001402866650002302880650001702903650002602920650003702946650001102983650001202994650001703006650002003023650002803043650001203071650002103083650001003104650001203114653001403126653002503140653001303165653002103178700002003199700001703219700001903236773012203255852000903377856008503386930003303471945001303504946001103517655001203528IND2268195020221123030438.0010405e200011  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226819502DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAulakh, M.S.10aMethane transport capacity of rice plants.

Neue.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aOf the total methane (CH4) emitted from a rice field during the growing season, 60-90% is emitted through the rice plants. We determined the methane transport capacity (MTC) of rice plants at different physiological growth stages using an automatic measuring system under greenhouse conditions. A total of 12 cultivars (10 inbred varieties and 2 hybrids) were studied in sets of two experiments and was distinguished into three groups according to the patterns of MTC development. MTC is generally increasing from seedling stage to panicle initiation (PI), but differs in the development from PI to maturity. While the hybrid showed a gradual increase in MTC, the inbred cultivars showed either minor changes in MTC or a drastic decrease from flowering to maturity. Among tall cultivars, Dular showed the highest MTC, followed by B40; the lowest MTC was found in Intan. High-yielding dwarf cultivars showed MTC in the descending order of IR72 > IR52 > IR64 > PSBRc 20. New plant type cultivars showed very low MTC with IR65600 exhibiting the smallest MTC at PI, flowering, and maturity. Hybrids (Magat and APHR 2) showed the largest MTC that continued to increase with plant growth. The MTC patterns were attributed to growth parameters and the development of morphological characteristics of the aerenchyma. These results suggest that in tall, dwarf, and NPT cultivars, increase in root or aboveground biomass during initial growth determines a corresponding increase in MTC. Once aerenchyma has fully developed, further increase in plant biomass would not influence MTC. However, in the case of hybrids, a positive relationship of MTC with root + shoot biomass (r = 0.672, p greater than or equal to 0.05) and a total plant biomass including grain (r = 0.849, p greater than or equal to 0.01) indicate continuous development of aerenchyma with plant growth, resulting in enhanced MTC. In all cultivars, tiller number, but not height, was linearly related to MTC, indicating that the number of outlets/channels rather than plant size/biomass determines the transport of CH4. These results clearly demonstrate that rice cultivars differ significantly in MTC. Therefore, the use of high-yielding cultivars with low MTC (for example, PSBRc 20, IR65598, and IR65600) could be an economically feasible, environmentally sound, and promising approach to mitigate CH4 emissions from rice fields. 3aemissions 3aflowering 3amethane production 3aOryza sativa 3aplant characteristics 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aheight 3amethane 3ainbred lines 3adwarf cultivars 3ahigh-yielding varieties 3atillers 3aplant morphology 3aroots 3abiomass 0acultivars 0adevelopmental stages 0amaturity 0aplant physiology1 aBodenbender, J.1 aWassmann, R.1 aRennenberg, H.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2000 Nov., v. 58, no. 1/3 p.367-375dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02697naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245015400172300001600326500010800342520129800450650001701748650002401765650002501789650001601814650002101830650000901851650001701860650001501877650002301892650001701915650001101932650001201943650001601955651001001971651002501981700001602006700001602022700001602038773014502054856005502199852000902254655001202263IND60589526920221123030425.0180223e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058952692DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1173.662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIngrassia, M.10aConsumer preferences for fig fruit (Ficus carica L.) quality attributes and postharvest storage at low temperature by in-store survey and focus group  ap. 383-388.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Fig held  August 31-September 3, 2015 Napoli, Italy  aFig (Ficus carica L.) is cultivated mainly in southern Italy and in several countries of the Mediterranean area. According to official statistics the quantities of fresh fig placed on domestic market are low, though the home consumption is known to be relatively high in summer. The objective of this study was to discover consumers' preferences for sensory, quality attributes of fresh fig and primary drivers of liking, in order to enhance fruit marketing value. An in-store consumer test and two focus groups were carried out to assess preferences in regards to fresh figs after 3 and 7 days of storage at low temperature: the selected sensory, intrinsic and extrinsic attributes were ranked by consumers. Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient was applied. Results demonstrate that intrinsic and extrinsic attributes of fig are not the key drivers of liking, contrarily the sensory attributes are. Sensory qualities of fruit are the main drivers for purchasing. Consumers' acceptance after 7 days of storage was good. Values of correlations between in-store evaluations and of focus group ones demonstrate the effectiveness of the storage at low temperature. These results may be important for future improvements in postharvest research and marketing actions in regards to consumers. 3aFicus carica 3aconsumer acceptance 3aconsumer preferences 3acorrelation 3adomestic markets 3afigs 3afocus groups 3apurchasing 3asensory properties 3astorage time 3asummer 3asurveys 3atemperature 3aItaly 3aMediterranean region1 aChironi, S.1 aAllegra, A.1 aSortino, G.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 20, , no. 1173 p.383-388dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1173.66  aDNAL 7aarticle03082naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245007100130300001600201500013200217500002400349520150500373650003201878650001601910650001701926650001401943650002201957650001801979650001501997650002002012650002602032650000902058650001502067650001202082650001402094650002302108651001002131653002002141653001302161700002002174700001502194700002102209700001902230700001602249700001402265773012202279852000902401856008502410930003302495945001302528946001102541655001202552IND2268195120221123012146.0010405e200011  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND226819512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSethunathan, N.10aMethane production, oxidation, and emission from Indian rice soils  ap. 377-388.  aIn the special issue: Methane emissions from major rice ecosystems in Asia / edited by R. Wassmann, R.S. Lantin, and H.U. Neue.  aIncludes references  aExperiments were conducted to investigate methane (CH4) production, oxidation, and emission from flooded rice soils. Incorporation of green manure (Sesbania rostrata) into rice fields led to a several-fold increase in CH4 emission. A stimulatory effect of organic sources on CH4 production in soil samples was noticed even under nonflooded conditions. Addition of rice straw at 1% (w/w) to nonflooded soil samples held at -1.5 MPa effected a 230-fold increase in CH4 production over that in corresponding unamended soil samples at 35 d, as compared with a threefold increase in rice straw-amended soil over that in unamended soil under flooded conditions. In a study involving two experimental field sites differing in water regimes but planted to the same rice cultivar (cv Gayatri) and fertilized with prilled urea at 60 kg N ha-1, the field plots with deep submergence of around 30 cm (site I) emitted distinctly more CH4 than did the plots with continuous water depth of 3-6 cm (site II). Likewise, in another incubation study, CH4 production in flooded soil samples increased with a progressive increase in standing water column from 5 mm to 20 mm. Application of carbamate insecticide, carbofuran, at 2 kg ai ha-1 to rice fields retarded CH4 emission through enhanced CH4 oxidation. Hexachlorocyclohexane was found to inhibit CH4 emission. The results suggest the need for extensive research efforts to develop technologies with dual objective of environmental protection and crop productivity. 3agas production (biological) 3apaddy soils 3aOryza sativa 3aoxidation 3aSesbania rostrata 3agreen manures 3arice straw 3asoil amendments 3afield experimentation 3aurea 3acarbofuran 3amethane 3aemissions 3amethane production 3aIndia 0adeep water rice 0aflooding1 aKumaraswamy, S.1 aRath, A.K.1 aRamakrishnan, B.1 aSatpathy, S.N.1 aAdhya, T.K.1 aRao, V.R.0 tNutrient cycling in agroecosystems.g2000 Nov., v. 58, no. 1/3 p.377-388dKluwer Academic Publishersx1385-13147nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.wkap.nl/kapis/CGI-BIN/WORLD/jrnltoc.htm?1385-13143Tables of contents  a20010601b20010612c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02758naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072001700145072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213100004000230245014600270300001600416500001500432520098900447650001701436650001801453650001401471650002101485650002301506650003001529650002701559650001101586650002101597650001101618650001801629650002401647650002301671651001101694651002101705651001401726653001901740653001801759653002601777700003001803700002901833700002801862700002701890773008801917852000902005856008502014930003302099945002502132946001102157655001202168IND4436846220221123012251.0100510s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443684622DNAL7 a10.1080/095831509034287112doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

(Melastomataceae), a neotropical invasive weed in forest ecosystems in French Polynesia and Hawaii and a threat in Australia, where it was also introduced. A study on the reproductive performance of D. smithi under laboratory conditions through life expectancy and fertility tables is presented. Results indicated that this psyllid has a high reproductive capacity (R(0)>1 and r(m) >0) and a short life cycle (46-47 days) and can have up to nine generations per year. The critical period of its life cycle is during the nymphal stage which is clearly inadequate for field introductions. The best age for introducing D. smithi against M. calvescens is the 4th day of the adult stage. D. smithi is easily mass-reared and has a short life cycle and a high reproductive capacity, which are desirable characteristics for a biological control agent. 3aweed control 3aanimal growth 3aPsyllidae 3aanimal fertility 3aMiconia calvescens 3abiological control agents 3alife cycle (organisms) 3anymphs 3ainvasive species 3aimagos 3anoxious weeds 3ainsect reproduction 3abiological control 3aHawaii 3aFrench Polynesia 3aAustralia 0ainsect biology 0aadult insects 0aDiclidophlebia smithi1 aPicanco, Marcelo Coutinho1 aBarreto, Robert Weingart1 aSilva, Nilson Rodrigues1 aCampos, Mateus Ribeiro0 tBiocontrol science and technology.g2010, v. 20, no. 1-2 p.107-116x0958-31577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/095831509034287113Available from publisher's Web site  a20100722b20100807c00000000  aINDd9CTe2010/06/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02315naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001400154245006400168300001600232500010800248520112700356650001701483650002001500650001401520650001601534650000901550650002201559650001301581650001501594650001701609650001901626650001701645650001401662650001101676650001101687650001001698773014501708856005501853852000901908655001201917IND60589526820221121032833.0180223e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058952682DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1173.652doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAksoy, U.14aThe dried fig management and the potential for new products  ap. 377-382.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Fig held  August 31-September 3, 2015 Napoli, Italy  aThe edible fig, Ficus carica L., is one the oldest species domesticated by mankind. It is well adapted to the Mediterranean conditions and can be found dispersed in natural flora. As its nutritional and pharmaceutical properties are unfolded by research work, the demand is growing. The fig tree with its diverse horticultural properties offers fresh fruit in the spring and summer and dried fruit or processed products throughout the year. The fig fruit bears significant varietal differences. The fruiting behavior is different in breba bearing cultivars compared to the 'Smyrna' type cultivars. The fruit composition may differ significantly among cultivars as well as between pollinated and non-pollinated fruit of the same cultivar. Selecting the fig cultivars that fit best to the ecological conditions and address the consumer demand and harvesting at right maturity stage are the base lines for a profitable production. Fig fruit can be utilized as deep-frozen or processed for different purposes. The overall world market for dried figs is enlarging however the demand is always for safe and high quality produce. 3aFicus carica 3aconsumer demand 3acultivars 3adried fruit 3afigs 3afruit composition 3afruiting 3aharvesting 3ahorticulture 3amaturity stage 3anew products 3araw fruit 3aspring 3asummer 3atrees0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 20, , no. 1173 p.377-382dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1173.65  aDNAL 7aarticle04624naa a2200997 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001700150245013000167300001600297500002400313500001500337506007600352520159800428506003702026650002502063650001602088650001002104650002602114650001902140650001502159650001402174650001902188650001602207650002002223650001002243650002202253650001302275650001202288650001502300650000902315650000902324650002002333650001602353650001502369650002202384650003602406650004202442650002302484650001602507650003902523650003002562650003002592650002602622650002002648650002102668650003002689650003802719650002602757650001302783650002902796650003602825650002902861650002402890650003902914650002802953650004002981650003603021653002303057653001703080653001503097653001303112653001403125653002903139653001803168653002603186700001703212700001403229700001403243700001903257700001403276700001803290700001503308700001703323773015203340852000903492856005403501930003303555945001303588946001303601655001203614IND2332420220221207125149.0030506e200209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233242022DNAL7 a122265212pmid7 aPMC1665742pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaluška, F.10aF-actin-dependent endocytosis of cell wall pectins in meristematic root cells.

In plants, formation of large intracellular compartments in response to BFA treatment is a unique feature of some, but not all, cells. Here, we have analyzed assembly and distribution of BFA compartments in development- and tissue-specific contexts of growing maize (Zea mays) root apices. Surprisingly, these unique compartments formed only in meristematic cells of the root body. On the other hand, BFA compartments were absent from secretory cells of root cap periphery, metaxylem cells, and most elongating cells, all of which are active in exocytosis. We report that cell wall pectin epitopes counting rhamnogalacturonan II dimers cross-linked by borate diol diester, partially esterified (up to 40%) homogalacturonan pectins, and (1 to 4)-beta-D-galactan side chains of rhamnogalacturonan I were internalized into BFA compartments. In contrast, Golgi-derived secretory (esterified up to 80%) homogalacturonan pectins localized to the cytoplasm in control cells and did not accumulate within characteristic BFA compartments. Latrunculin B-mediated depolymerization of F-actin inhibited internalization and accumulation of cell wall pectins within intracellular BFA compartments. Importantly, cold treatment and protoplasting prevented internalization of wall pectins into root cells upon BFA treatment. These observations suggest that cell wall pectins of meristematic maize root cells undergo rapid endocytosis in an F-actin-dependent manner.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adevelopmental stages 3aendocytosis 3aroots 3aendoplasmic reticulum 3aplant proteins 3acell walls 3ameristems 3amicrofilaments 3abrefeldin A 3aplasma membrane 3aactin 3aplant development 3aZea mays 3apectins 3aexocytosis 3acorn 3acold 3aGolgi apparatus 3aprotoplasts 3afood crops 3aprotein synthesis 3achemical constituents of plants 2aADP-Ribosylation Factor 1xmetabolism 2aActinsxmetabolism 2aBiomarkers. 2aBiological Transportxdrug effects 2aBrefeldin Axpharmacology 2aCell Membranexmetabolism 2aCell Wallxmetabolism 2aCells, Cultured 2aCold Temperature 2aEndocytosisxdrug effects 2aEndoplasmic Reticulumxmetabolism 2aEndosomesxmetabolism 2aEpitopes 2aGibberellinsxmetabolism 2aMeristemxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aPectinsxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aProtoplastsxmetabolism 2aZea maysxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2atrans-Golgi Networkxmetabolism 0asecretory granules 0acell biology 0ainhibition 0alactones 0acytoplasm 0azea mays cv. careca s230 0aplant anatomy 0acell compartmentation1 aHlavacka, A.1 aSamaj, J.1 aPalme, K.1 aRobinson, D.G.1 aMatoh, T.1 aMcCurdy, D.W.1 aMenzel, D.1 aVolkmann, D.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Sept., v. 130, no. 1 p.422-431dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US 7aarticle02989naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001600149245005300165300001800218500007500236500002400311500001500335506007600350520119700426506003701623650001401660650001101674650001201685650002201697650001601719650002401735650001801759650003001777650002801807650001401835650003501849650003401884650003601918650002401954650005101978653002802029653001602057653002502073700001702098700001802115700001502133773015302148852000902301856005402310930003302364945001302397946001302410655001202423IND2279257020221207125250.0010410e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227925702DNAL7 a112441102pmid7 aPMC656092pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLisch, D.R.10aMutator transposase is widespread in the grasses  ap. 1293-1303.  aIn the Special Issue: The Grasses: A Collective Model Genetics System.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough the Mutator (Mu) system is well characterized in maize (Zea mays), very little is known about this highly mutagenic system of transposons in other grasses. Mutator is regulated by the MuDR class of elements, which encodes two genes, one of which, mudrA, has similarityto a number of bacterial transposases. Experiments in our laboratory, as well as database searches, demonstrate that mudrA sequences are ubiquitous and diverse in the grasses. In several species it is clear that multiple paralogous elements can be present in a single genome. In some species such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa), mudrA-similar sequences are represented in cDNA databases, suggesting the presence of active Mu transposon systems in these species. Further, in rice and in sorghum, mudrA-like genes are flanked by long terminal inverted repeats, as well as the short host sequence direct repeats diagnostic of insertion. Thus, there is ample evidence that systems related to Mu in maize are at least potentially active in a wide variety of grasses. However, the mudrB gene, though important for Mu activity in maize, is not necessarily a component of Mu elements in other grasses.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aphylogeny 3aclones 3aPoaceae 3agenetic variation 3atransposons 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPoaceaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTransposasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0amolecular sequence data 0atranslation 0anucleotide sequences1 aFreeling, M.1 aLangham, R.J.1 aChoy, M.Y.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Mar., v. 125, no. 3 p.1293-1303dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle04072naa a2200817 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196072001700213072001700230100001900247245012700266300001600393500001500409520170600424650002502130650001902155650001702174650001002191650002502201650002302226650002102249650001002270650001902280650001802299650002302317650001302340650002202353650001302375650001102388650003902399650001302438650002102451650002502472650002002497650002602517650001202543650001302555650002302568650003102591650002102622650001402643650004502657650002902702650002802731650002802759651001102787653002002798653001002818653001102828653002602839653002902865653003002894700002402924700002302948700001902971700001802990773007303008852000903081856008303090930003303173945002503206946001103231655001203242IND4436520420221123012248.0100505e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443652042DNAL7 a202151202pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpq0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aHermle, Sandra10aComponent respiration, ecosystem respiration and net primary production of a mature black spruce forest in northern Quebec  ap. 527-540.  a2019-12-04  aWe measured respiratory fluxes of carbon dioxide by aboveground tree components and soil respiration with chambers in 2005 and scaled up these measurements over space and time to estimate annual ecosystem respiration (R(e)) at a mature black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) ecosystem in Quebec, Canada. We estimated periodic annual net primary production (NPP) for this ecosystem also. R(e) was estimated at 10.32 Mg C ha–1 year–1; heterotrophic respiration (R(h)) accounted for 52% of R(e) and autotrophic respiration (R(a)) accounted for the remainder. We estimated NPP at 3.02 Mg C ha–1 year–1, including production of bryophyte biomass but not including shrub NPP. We used these estimates of carbon fluxes to calculate a carbon use efficiency [CUE = NPP/(NPP + R(a))] of 0.38. This estimate of CUE is similar to those reported for other boreal forest ecosystems and it is lower than the value frequently used in global studies. Based on the estimate of R(h) being greater than the estimate of NPP, the ecosystem was determined to emit approximately 2.38 Mg C ha–1 year–1 to the atmosphere in 2005. Estimates of gross primary production (GPP = NPP + R(a)) and R(e) differed substantially from estimates of these fluxes derived from eddy covariance measurements during 2005 at this site. The ecological estimates of GPP and R(e) were substantially greater than those estimated for eddy covariance measurements. Applying a correction for lack of energy balance closure to eddy covariance estimates reduces differences with ecological estimates. We reviewed possible sources of systematic error in ecological estimates and discuss other possible explanations for these discrepancies. 3aprimary productivity 3aboreal forests 3agas exchange 3atrees 3acarbon sequestration 3aseasonal variation 3asoil respiration 3aroots 3acarbon dioxide 3aPicea mariana 3aconiferous forests 3abiometry 3aforest ecosystems 3aconifers 3aleaves 3asoil-plant-atmosphere interactions 3abranches 3acell respiration 3aglobal carbon budget 3aenergy transfer 2aAutotrophic Processes 2aBiomass 2aBiometry 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Dioxidexmetabolism 2aCell Respiration 2aEcosystem 2aPiceaxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxmetabolism 2aPlant Stemsxmetabolism 0aQuebec 0aeddy covariance 0astems 0aefflux 0acarbon use efficiency 0aautrotrophic respiration 0aheterotrophic respiration1 aLavigne, Michael B.1 aBernier, Pierre Y.1 aBergeron, Onil1 aParé, David.0 tTree physiology.g2010 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.527-540x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpq0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20100511b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02591naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245012300181300001600304520107800320650003001398650002801428650003101456650001701487650001001504650001201514650001701526650001001543650001201553650002501565650000901590650002901599650001101628650000701639650001601646650001501662650002001677650001201697650001701709650001401726650001101740700001901751700002301770773014701793852000901940856009201949930003302041946001102074655001202085IND4415878820221123001131.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441587882DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01846.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAminigo, Ebiokpo Rebecca10aBiochemical composition and storage stability of a yogurt-like product from African yam bean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa)  ap. 560-566.  aThe biochemical and storage properties of African yam bean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa) yoghurt-like product were evaluated. Milk extracted from the bean flour using hot water was supplemented with 4% milk protein concentrate (MPC), 0.15% dairy calcium (DC) and 0.5% gelatine (G) (singly or in combination). The milk was fermented with Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp bulgaricus at 43 °C for 3-5 h. Supplemented African yam bean (AYB) yoghurts had a gel-like consistency unlike the control (unsupplemented) sample. Total solids, protein, fat, ash, lactic acid bacterial count, lightness (L-value) and viscosity were improved by supplementation. Riboflavin and antioxidants were reduced; macroelements and thiamine were increased by 0.71-15.6% and 16.7%, respectively, because of fermentation. The stability of the product during storage at 4 °C was improved by supplementation and stirring. The pH of the supplemented product ranged from 4.45 to 4.54 and microbial counts from 2.6 x 10⁶ to 1.6 x 10⁸ during storage for not more than 3 weeks. 3aLactobacillus delbrueckii 3aSphenostylis stenocarpa 3aStreptococcus thermophilus 3aantioxidants 3abeans 3acalcium 3afermentation 3aflour 3agelatin 3alactic acid bacteria 3amilk 3amilk protein concentrate 3amixing 3apH 3aplate count 3ariboflavin 3astorage quality 3athiamin 3atotal solids 3aviscosity 3ayogurt1 aMetzger, Lloyd1 aLehtola, Peggy Sue0 tInternational journal of food science & technology.g2009 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.560-566dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0950-54237nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2008.01846.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02935naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002200152245008100174300001600255520158700271650002101858650001701879650001201896650001101908650001101919650002301930650000901953650002401962650001001986650001701996650001302013651001702026653002102043653001802064653001402082653002102096653002002117700001802137700002402155700002302179773011802202852000902320856009202329930003302421946001102454655001202465IND4415881020221123001139.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441588102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01754.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArchibald, Sally.10aWhat limits fire? An examination of drivers of burnt area in Southern Africa  ap. 613-630.  aThe factors controlling the extent of fire in Africa south of the equator were investigated using moderate resolution (500 m) satellite-derived burned area maps and spatial data on the environmental factors thought to affect burnt area. A random forest regression tree procedure was used to determine the relative importance of each factor in explaining the burned area fraction and to address hypotheses concerned with human and climatic influences on the drivers of burnt area. The model explained 68% of the variance in burnt area. Tree cover, rainfall in the previous 2 years, and rainfall seasonality were the most important predictors. Human activities - represented by grazing, roads per unit area, population density, and cultivation fraction - were also shown to affect burnt area, but only in parts of the continent with specific climatic conditions, and often in ways counter to the prevailing wisdom that more human activity leads to more fire. The analysis found no indication that ignitions were limiting total burnt area on the continent, and most of the spatial variation was due to variation in fuel load and moisture. Split conditions from the regression tree identified (i) low rainfall regions, where fire is rare; (ii) regions where fire is under human control; and (iii) higher rainfall regions where burnt area is determined by rainfall seasonality. This study provides insights into the physical, climatic, and human drivers of fire and their relative importance across southern Africa, and represents the beginnings of a predictive framework for burnt area. 3aclimatic factors 3afuel loading 3agrazing 3ahumans 3amodels 3apopulation density 3arain 3aregression analysis 3aroads 3aspatial data 3avariance 3aSouth Africa 0aclimatic control 0ahuman control 0aignitions 0apredictive model 0aregression tree1 aROY, DAVID P.1 avanWILGEN, BRIAN W.1 aScholes, Robert J.0 tGlobal change biology.g2009 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.613-630dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01754.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02932naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002100152245007300173300001600246520161300262650001801875650001101893650001001904650001201914650001901926650002301945650002201968650001101990650001602001650001902017650000902036651001102045653001402056653000902070653001902079653001402098653000802112653001402120653001302134700002202147700001802169773011802187852000902305856009202314930003302406946001102439655001202450IND4415882020221122225031.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441588202DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01733.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCALVERT, ANNA M.10aCross-scale environmental influences on migratory stopover behaviour  ap. 744-759.  aMigratory species may be especially sensitive to climate change because their lifecycles are affected by dynamic ecological processes operating at global spatial scales. Insight into environmental effects upon en route decisions by migrants can therefore be a critical first step toward assessing their vulnerability to future climatic shifts. We extracted behaviour-related parameters from a recent formulation of multistate mark-recapture models, and used them to evaluate the importance of variation in local weather and broad-scale climate to decisions made by autumn passerine migrants at a coastal stopover site in Atlantic Canada. We found dramatic interannual fluctuations in the proportion of migrants that were transient (departing within a day of arrival), with annual average values ranging from 24% to 96% over the years 1996-2007. However, the relationships of stopover behaviour (transience and departure probability) to local weather (wind and precipitation) and to regional climatic fluctuations were similar across three distinct species groups and for birds of different fuel-loads, indicating the potential for both immediate (day-to-day) and long-term environmental influences (spanning several seasons). This cross-scale approach contributes valuable information toward the conservation of migrants in the face of a changing climate by (i) quantifying environmental influences on stopover behaviour in broad temporal and geographic contexts, and (ii) demonstrating largely parallel interannual variation in stopover site-use among birds with contrasting migratory timing and strategies. 3aPasseriformes 3aautumn 3abirds 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3amigratory behavior 3amigratory species 3amodels 3aprobability 3astopover sites 3awind 3aCanada 0adeparture 0aENSO 0amark-recapture 0amigration 0aNAO 0apasserine 0astopover1 aTAYLOR, PHILIP D.1 aWALDE, SANDRA0 tGlobal change biology.g2009 Mar., v. 15, no. 3 p.744-759dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1354-10137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01733.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01973naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002300161245012100184300001800305500002400323520076300347650002601110650001701136650002501153650001101178650002901189650001701218650002401235650003801259650002001297650002101317650002201338650007401360773007401434852000901508856008201517655001201599IND4461532320221122213548.0110819s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446153232DNAL7 a216744342pmid7 a10.1055/s-0031-12799782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliva, Maria Julia10aSharing the benefits of biodiversity: A new international protocol and its implications for research and development  ap. 1221-1227.  aIncludes references  aEquitable sharing of the benefits of biodiversity is one of the main objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Yet understanding of the CBD rules and principles on access and benefit sharing, as well as how they apply to biodiversity-based research and development remains limited. In October 2010, the CBD adopted additional rules on access and benefit sharing. These rules - known as the Nagoya Protocol - provide clarification on several important issues, including the applicability of access and benefit sharing to research on biochemical compounds and processes. As a result, the Nagoya Protocol constitutes an important opportunity for institutions, organizations, and companies committed to ethical practices regarding biodiversity. 3abiochemical compounds 3abiodiversity 3abusiness enterprises 3aethics 3aresearch and development 2aBiodiversity 2aBiological Products 2aConservation of Natural Resources 2aDecision Making 2aInternationality 2aPlantsxchemistry 2aResearchxlegislation & jurisprudencexorganization & administration.0 tPlanta medica.g2011 July, v. 77, no. 11 p.1221-1227x0032-09437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-12799783Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02849naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111040001800133100001500151245005700166300001600223500002400239506007600263520093000339506003701269650002501306650001201331650002301343650001901366650000801385650002501393650002001418650002501438650003601463650001101499650002601510650001801536650003201554650003201586650003301618650002001651650001801671650002801689650001301717650002601730653002301756653001101779653001201790653001401802653002801816700001701844700001901861700001501880700001601895700001501911773015101926852000902077856005402086930003302140945001302173946001302186655001202199IND2332424720221207114830.0030506e200206  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233242472DNAL7 a120680902pmid7 aPMC15402302pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJander, G.10aArabidopsis map-based cloning in the post-genome era  ap. 440-450.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMap-based cloning is an iterative approach that identifies the underlying genetic cause of a mutant phenotype. The major strength of this approach is the ability to tap into a nearly unlimited resource of natural and induced genetic variationwithout prior assumptions or knowledge of specific genes. One begins with an interesting mutant and allows plant biology to reveal what gene or genes are involved. Three major advances in the past 2 years have made map-based cloning in Arabidopsis fairly routine: sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome, the availability of more than 50,000 markers in the Cereon Arabidopsis Polymorphism Collection, and improvements in the methods used for detecting DNA polymorphisms. Here, we describe the Cereon Collection and show how it can be used in a generic approach to mutation mapping in Arabidopsis. We present the map-based cloning of the VTC2 gene as a specific example of this approach.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3amutants 3achromosome mapping 3aplant proteins 3aDNA 3agenetic polymorphism 3agenetic markers 3anucleotide sequences 3achemical constituents of plants 3agenome 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aChromosome Mappingxmethods 2aCloning, Molecularxmethods 2aGenetic Complementation Test 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenome, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aPolymorphism, Genetic 0aliterature reviews 0atiming 0acloning 0avtc2 gene 0amolecular sequence data1 aNorris, S.R.1 aRounsley, S.D.1 aBush, D.F.1 aLevin, I.M.1 aLast, R.L.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 June, v. 129, no. 2 p.440-450dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050421b20050501c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US 7aarticle02864naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245013800134300001400272500018900286500002400475520139900499650002301898650001801921650001601939650001801955650002101973650001301994650002302007650002202030650001702052650002002069650001402089650001102103650002402114700001502138700001702153700002202170700001802192773013802210852000902348856008502357655001202442IND4461532820221122112037.0110819s2011    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446153282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartinez-Medina, A.10aHormonal signalling of the Trichoderma harzianum-induced resistance to Fusarium oxysporum and growth promotion effect in melon plants  ap. 61-67.  aPaper presented at the Fifth International Symposium on Seed, Transplant and Stand Establishment of Horticultural Crops, held September 27 - October 1, 2009, Murcia and Almeria, Spain.  aIncludes references  aTrichoderma ssp. have shown to induce systemic resistance to a variety of plant pathogens and to promote plant growth through fungal interactions with phytohormonal signalling. Changes in the concentration of SA, JA, IAA, Ze and ACC in shoots of melon plants grown in seedling nurseries, as a result of inoculation with T. harzianum as well as their implications on basal resistance against Fusarium wilt and growth promotion effect has been studied. Additionally, the changes in the concentration of SA and JA in melon plants, as consequence of the complex interaction between the plant, T. harzianum and F. oxysporum were investigated. T. harzianum mediated increases on Ze, IAA and ACC concentration as well as in the related- defence hormones SA and JA. F. oxysporum infection is mediated by a SA, and JA dependent response. In the two-way-interactions (T. harzianum-F. oxysporum), an attenuation on the SA dependent response mediated by the pathogen infection was observed. The present study shows the ability of T. harzianum to interfere with the hormonal balance involved in biotic stress, plant defence and plant development. The mechanisms involved in the control of Fusarium wilt by T. harzianum in melon plants, seem to be related not only to the induction of plant resistance, but also to the capacity of T. harzianum to attenuate the SA-dependent response mediated by the pathogen. 3aFusarium oxysporum 3aFusarium wilt 3aTrichoderma 3abiotic stress 3agrowth promotion 3ahormones 3aindole acetic acid 3aplant development 3aplant growth 3aplant pathogens 3aseedlings 3ashoots 3avarietal resistance1 aRoldan, A.1 aAlbacete, A.1 aPerez-Alfocea, F.1 aPascual, J.A.0 tActa horticulturae.g2011 June, , no. 898 p.61-67dInternational Society for Horticultural SciencewJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/898/898_6.htm3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle04682naa a2200841 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001800150245012600168300001600294500002400310500001500334506007600349520204300425506003702468650001602505650002102521650001202542650002202554650001102576650001902587650001502606650001902621650001202640650001302652650001602665650001502681650001302696650001202709650001802721650001802739650001702757650001902774650002502793650001402818650001302832650003602845650002102881650003602902650002802938650005402966650002803020650002303048650003203071650002903103650001803132650002303150650004003173650004103213650002403254650002703278650003003305650002403335650003103359650004503390650002403435653001103459653002703470653001003497653002803507700001903535773015203554852000903706856005403715930003303769945001303802946001303815655001203828IND2332419120221207103655.0030506e200209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233241912DNAL7 a122265142pmid7 aPMC1665672pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwender, J.10aProbing in vivo metabolism by stable isotope labeling of storage lipids and proteins in developing Brassica napus embryos  ap. 347-361.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDeveloping embryos of Brassica napus accumulate both triacylglycerols and proteins as major storage reserves. To evaluate metabolic fluxes during embryo development, we have established conditions for stable isotope labeling of cultured embryos under steady-state conditions. Sucrose supplied via the endosperm is considered to be the main carbon and energy source for seed metabolism. However, in addition to 220 to 270 mM carbohydrates (sucrose, glucose, and fructose), analysis of endosperm liquid revealed up to 70 mM amino acids as well as 6 to 15 mM malic acid. Therefore, a labeling approach with multiple carbon sources is a precondition to quantitatively reflect fluxes of central carbon metabolism in developing embryos. Mid-cotyledon stage B. napus embryos were dissected from plants and cultured for 15 d on a complex liquid medium containing 13C-labeled carbohydrates. The 13C enrichment of fatty acids and amino acids (after hydrolysis of the seed proteins) was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Analysis of 13C isotope isomers of labeled fatty acids and plastid-derived amino acids indicated that direct glycolysis provides at least 90% of precursors of plastid acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Unlabeled amino acids, when added to the growth medium, did not reduce incorporation of 13C label into plastid-formed fatty acids, but substantially diluted 13C label in seed protein. Approximately 30% of carbon in seed protein was derived from exogenous amino acids and as a consequence, the use of amino acids as a carbon source may have significant influence on the total carbon and energy balance in seed metabolism. 13C label in the terminal acetate units of C20 and C22 fatty acids that derive from cytosolic acetyl-CoA was also significantly diluted by unlabeled amino acids. We conclude that cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Malic acid in the growth medium did not dilute 13C label incorporation into fatty acids or proteins and can be ruled out as a source of carbon for the major storage components of B. napus embryos.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3afatty acids 3aisotope labeling 3acytosol 3aacetyl coenzyme A 3acarbon 3aBrassica napus 3amalic acid 3aplant proteins 3aglucose 3aisotopes 3aamino acids 3aglycolysis 3afructose 3asucrose 3aoilseed crops 3aculture media 3abiosynthesis 3aembryo (plant) 3abiochemical pathways 3aendosperm 3aplastids 3achemical constituents of plants 3aseed development 2aAcetyl Coenzyme Axbiosynthesis 2aAmino Acidsxmetabolism 2aBrassica napusxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aCarbohydrate Metabolism 2aCarbonxmetabolism 2aCarbon Isotopesxmetabolism 2aChloroplastsxmetabolism 2aCulture Media 2aCulture Techniques 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aGlucosexmetabolism 2aGlycolysisxphysiology 2aIsotope Labelingxmethods 2aMalatesxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSeedsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSucrosexmetabolism 0alipids 0aplant storage proteins 0aseeds 0aorganic acids and salts1 aOhlrogge, J.B.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Sept., v. 130, no. 1 p.347-361dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US 7aarticle02529naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009400127300001600221500010400237520124800341650002501589650001301614650001201627650001901639650001901658650002001677650002601697650002101723650002201744650001601766650001301782650001401795650001101809650001401820700001701834773010601851852000901957856008201966930003302048945001302081946001302094655001202107IND2058039320221122061124.0970627e199702  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205803932DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, L.P.10aBiodegradation of aromatic compounds under mixed oxygen/denitrifying conditions: a review  ap. 116-130.  aIn the special topical issue: Bioremediation / edited by F.K. Pfaender, J.M. Suflita and C.H. Ward.  aBioremediation of aromatic hydrocarbons in groundwater and sediments is often limited by dissolved oxygen. Many aromatic hydrocarbons degrade very slowly or not at all under anaerobic conditions. Nitrate is a good alternative electron acceptor to oxygen, and denitrifying bacteria are commonly found in the subsurface and in association with contaminated aquifer materials. Providing both nitrate and microaerophilic levels of oxygen may result in oxidation of the stable benzene rings in aromatic contaminants and allow for the intermediates of this oxidation to degrade via denitrification. The effects of using mixed electron acceptors on biodegradation of subsurface contaminants is unclear. Below some critical oxygen threshold, aerobic biodegradation is inhibited, however high levels of oxygen inhibit denitrification. The mechanisms which regulate electron transfer to oxygen and nitrate are complex. This review: 1) describes the factors which may affect the utilization of oxygen and nitrate as dual electron acceptors during biodegradation; 2) summarizes the incidence of dual use of nitrate and oxygen (aerobic denitrification); and 3) presents evidence of the effectiveness of bioremediation under mixed oxygen/nitrate conditions. 3aanaerobic conditions 3aaquifers 3abenzene 3abiodegradation 3abioremediation 3adenitrification 3adenitrifying bacteria 3adissolved oxygen 3aelectron transfer 3agroundwater 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aoxygen 3asediments1 aBouwer, E.J.0 tJournal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology.g1997 , v. 18, no. 2/3 p.116-130x1367-54357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.link.springer.de/link/service/journals/10295/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02341naa a2200493 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024001800097040001800115100001700133245013600150300001600286300002400302500001500326520100600341650000801347650001001355650001501365650001401380650001201394650001301406650001301419650001001432650002101442650002001463650002601483650001601509650001101525650001101536650002301547650002401570653001701594653002101611653001601632700001401648700001601662773009601678852000901774939003301783945000801816946001101824655001201835991615024680742620221122050045.0910618e199003  xx ||||fo|||||||||||eng||7 aFNI910017022DNAL7 a23698872pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarrow, J.S.10aComparison of estimates of fat-free mass in normal and obese women from measurements of body potassium, body water and body density  ap. 213-217.  ap. 213-217. charts.  a2019-12-05  aThe relation between the estimates of fat-free mass (FFM) obtained from measurements of density, total body potassium and water was investigated in 104 women with Quetelet's Index between 19.9 and 49.7 kg/m2, body weight between 42.3 and 133.5 kg. The mean difference between the estimates based on water and potassium, previously reported as 2.2 kg or 4.4 per cent, was found to be independent of Quetelet's Index. The mean difference (s.e.m.) between the estimates of FFM based on density, compared with the average values from water and potassium, was found to be +7.0 (1.0), +6.3 (0.7) and +7.4 (1.1) kg in the ranges of Quetelet's Index 19.9-30.0, 30.1-40.0, and 40.1-49.7, respectively. The relative independence on Quetelet's Index of the difference between the estimates based on density compared with (water + potassium) is consistent with the idea that tissues of a higher density (ie, skin and bone) make up a larger proportion of the fat-free body weight in thin subjects than in fat ones. 3amen 3awomen 3abody water 3apotassium 3aobesity 3aaccuracy 3abody fat 2aAdult 2aBody Composition 2aBody Mass Index 2aBody Waterxanalysis. 2aBody Weight 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aObesityxdiagnosis 2aPotassiumxanalysis 0abody density 0abody composition 0amethodology1 aGarby, L.1 aLammert, O.0 tEuropean journal of clinical nutrition.g1990 Mar., v. 44, no. 3 p.213-217x0954-30077nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aFNC  aNon-US 7aarticle03039naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100001800154245009800172300001600270500010800286520173400394650001102128650001502139650001702154650002102171650001102192650001602203650000902219650001102228650001302239650003302252650001802285650005202303650001402355650001202369651002102381700001802402773014502420856005502565852000902620655001202629IND60589525020221122045953.0180223e20171020xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058952502DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1173.482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYorgancı, S.10aTransmission of fig mosaic disease agents to fig 'Sarılop' by Aceria ficus in Aydın, Turkey  ap. 279-284.  aPaper presented at the V International Symposium on Fig held  August 31-September 3, 2015 Napoli, Italy  aFig (Ficus carica) which leaves showing typical fig mosaic symptoms is infected by many different viruses. Fig mosaic diseases are transmitted by graft and vectors in nature. Fig leaf mottle associated virus 1,2 - FLMaV1,2; Fig mosaic virus - FMV; Fig mosaic associated virus 1,2 - FMaV-1,2; Fig badnavirus 1-FBV-1 are most common seen on fig orchard in Turkey. It is known that Fig mosaic virus (FMV) is transmitted by Aceria ficus but the other fig viruses transmission is unknown. In this study, we planned that transmission Fig mosaic viruses by Aceria ficus. Firstly, infected figs 'Sarılop' by A. ficus and healhty fig seedlings were analysed by One-step RT-PCR using 12 set of specific primers of the fig mosaic viruses. FLMaV-1, FMV and FaMV-1 was detected on donor (infected) figs whereas no amplification was detected on healthy fig seedlings. Donor fig leaves were cut under a stereo-microscope into small pieces. Every small pieces of fig leaves whıch have 10 adult A. ficus were transferred onto healthy fig seedlings. Transmission trials were performed on every two replications in two years. Eriophyid mites-exposed seedlings were checked weekly and observed symptoms. After transmission, fig seedlings leaves showed small leaf deformations, vein bandings yellowish spots after 20-60 days. Eriophyid mites-exposed seedlings and control plants were analyzed by One-step RT-PCR using 12 set of specific primers. FMV and FMaV-1 were determined by RT-PCR on the transmitted plant whereas no amplification was detected on control plants. According to these results, A. ficus appears to be able to transmit FMV and FMaV-1, but wasn't transmitted FLMaV-1 from ınfected fig 'Sarılop' to fig seedling in Aydın, Turkey. 3aAceria 3aBadnavirus 3aFicus carica 3aFig mosaic virus 3aadults 3adeformation 3afigs 3aleaves 3aorchards 3aplant diseases and disorders 3aplant viruses 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aseedlings 3aviruses 3aTurkey (country)1 aAcıkgöz, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 20, , no. 1173 p.279-284dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1173.48  aDNAL 7aarticle03127naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245017400126300001500300500002400315500001500339520151900354650001601873650002501889650002101914650001601935650001001951650001601961650001701977650001301994650002602007650001202033650001402045650001102059650002102070650001502091650001402106650001802120650002002138650001702158653002002175700002002195700002002215700001502235773012402250852000902374856016902383930003302552945001302585946001102598655001202609IND2290470920221122042415.0010414e20010201ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229047092DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRefstie, S.10aLong-term protein and lipid growth of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fed diets with partial replacement of fish meal by soy protein products at medium or high lipid level  ap. 91-106.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThis study investigated long-term effects on nutrient digestibility and protein and lipid growth of soy protein and lipid levels used in commercial grower diets for Atlantic salmon. Two series of extruded diets were formulated to contain either 45% protein and 32% lipid (medium fat) or 40% protein and 39% lipid (high fat). Each series consisted of six diets in which a soy protein source partially replaced low-temperature (LT) dried fish meal (FM): FM only (control), soy protein concentrate (SPC, 30% of crude protein, CP); SPC added 0.2% DL-methionine (30% of CP, SPC + met); dehulled, defatted soybean meal (HP-SBM, 20% of CP); full-fat (FF) SBM (10% of CP), and; defatted SBM (10% of CP). Each diet was fed to triplicate groups of 0.56-kg salmon kept in sea pens. The experiment lasted 235 days, during which the salmon reached 2.5 to 2.8 kg. Growth was slower in the FM-control and HP-SBM treatments than in the other treatments. The HP-SBM diet induced enteritis in the distal intestine of the salmon and, at day 215, the apparent digestibilities of nitrogen, lipid and energy were lower in the HP-SBM treatments than in all other treatments. Except a slightly reduced muscle protein concentration in the HP-SBM treatment, no effects of dietary soy were detected on final body composition. Salmon fed the high-fat diets reached on average 122 g higher final weight than those fed the medium-fat diets; however, 91 g of this was in the form of lipid, and corresponded with enlarged deposits of visible fat. 3aSalmo salar 3aprotein concentrates 3aapplication rate 3adietary fat 3afeeds 3asoy protein 3asoybean meal 3anitrogen 3anutrient availability 3amuscles 3afish meal 3alipids 3abody composition 3amethionine 3aenteritis 3adigestibility 3aprotein content 3afish feeding 0adietary protein1 aStorebakken, T.1 aBaeverfjord, G.1 aRoem, A.J.0 tAquaculture.g2001 Feb. 1, , no. 1/2 p.91-106dElsevier Pub.

Golay 1st-Der and wavelet package transform (WPT), were used before the data were analyzed with chemometrics methods of partial least square (PLS). Spectral data sets as the logarithms of the reflectance reciprocal were analyzed to build a best model for predicting the sugar content and acidity of yogurt. A model using preprocessing of WPT with a correlation coefficient of 0.91 and 0.90, a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.36 and 0.04 showed an excellent prediction performance to sugar content and acidity. S. Golay smoothing with MSC was also finer, combined with the calibration and validation results. S. Golay 1st-Der was the worse preprocessing method in this experiment. In the paper, a multivariate calibration method of principal component artificial neural network (PC-ANN) was also established. In PC-ANN models, the scores of the principal components were chosen as the input nodes for the input layer of ANN. After adjusting the number of input nodes (principal components), hidden nodes, as well as learning rate and momentum of the network, a model with a correlation coefficient of 0.92 and 0.91, a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.33 and 0.04 showed an excellent prediction performance on sugar content and acidity. At the same time, the sensitive wavelengths corresponding to the sugar content and acidity of yogurt were proposed on the basis of regression coefficients by PLS. 3afrozen yogurt 3afood analysis 3anondestructive methods 3asugar content 3aacidity 3aacids 3aneural networks 3aprincipal component analysis 3aleast squares 3aspectral analysis 3amodel validation1 aHe, Y.1 aFeng, S.0 tFood research international.g2007 Aug., v. 40, no. 7 p.835-841dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2007.01.0143Available from publisher's Web site  a20080502b20080606c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle01483naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245011100128300001600239520066700255650001600922650001400938650001000952650001600962653001800978653001700996700001701013700001801030773008001048852000901128939003301137946001101170655001201181IND9305148220221121223054.0930831s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930514822DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBengtsson, E.10aConcentration polarization during the enrichment of aroma compounds from a water solution by pervaportaion  ap. 399-407.  aPervaporation has proved to be an interesting technique for the recovery and enrichment of aroma compounds from very dilute solutions. In order to study the mass transfer, a 0.5-ppm solution of butyl butyrate, an important aroma compound present in, for example, apple juice, was pervaporated at different circulation velocities along a PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane) membrane. The permeation of butyl butyrate increased with increasing Reynolds number, demonstrating an influence of concentration polarization. In order to minimize the effect of the polarized layer and to improve the mass transfer, optimization of the feed-circulation velocity is very important. 3aapple juice 3asolutions 3aodors 3aevaporation 0aconcentration 0apolarization1 aTragardh, G.1 aHallstrom, B.0 tJournal of food engineering.g1993, v. 19, no. 4 p.399-407x0260-87747nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02981naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001800171245010900189300001600298520120700314650001701521650001901538650001501557650001601572650001701588650001001605650002201615650001401637650001101651650001101662650001501673650001701688650003001705650002101735650002401756650002301780650005201803650005201855650002701907653001501934653002301949653001801972700002301990700002002013700001702033700002002050700001802070700002202088700002102110773011502131852000902246856009202255930003302347946001102380655001202391IND4415886220221121205246.0090206e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441588622DNAL7 a192208672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00472.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZara, Giacomo10aOxygen is required to restore flor strain viability and lipid biosynthesis under fermentative conditions  ap. 217-225.  aTo further elucidate the biosynthesis of lipids in flor strains under fermentative conditions, the transcription levels of the lipid biosynthetic genes ACS1, ACS2, ACC1, OLE1, ERG1, ERG11, ARE1 and ARE2, as well as the lipid composition and cell viability of a flor strain were compared with that of a non-flor strain during hypoxic and aerobic fermentations in the absence of lipid nutrients. While no significant differences in transcription levels or lipid compositions were observed between the two strains when oxygen was not limiting, significant differences were seen during hypoxic fermentation. In this last condition, the flor strain, in spite of higher levels of transcription of hypoxic genes, lost the abilities to desaturate fatty acids and complete ergosterol biosynthesis, and showed a dramatic loss of viability. In contrast, the non-flor strain, which showed lower transcription levels, was able to reach a balanced lipid composition and maintained a higher cell viability. One possible explanation is that the flor strain requires a higher amount of oxygen than the non-flor strain in order to carry out the oxygen-dependent steps of lipid biosynthesis under fermentative conditions. 3abiosynthesis 3acell viability 3aergosterol 3afatty acids 3afermentation 3agenes 3alipid composition 3anutrients 3aoxygen 3ayeasts 2aAerobiosis 2aAnaerobiosis 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aLipid Metabolism 2aMicrobial Viability 2aOxygenxmetabolism 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aflor yeast 0alipid biosynthesis 0areal-time PCR1 aAngelozzi, Daniele1 aBelviso, Simona1 aBardi, Laura1 aGoffrini, Paola1 aLodi, Tiziana1 aBudroni, Marilena1 aMannazzu, Ilaria0 tFEMS yeast research.g2009 Mar., v. 9, no. 2 p.217-225dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2008.00472.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02367naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100001600176245008300192300001600275500002400291500001500315520086400330650001601194650001101210650002301221650001201244650001801256650001401274650001601288650002201304650002301326650002101349650001401370653000901384653001501393653002601408653000901434700001401443700001801457700001601475773019101491852000901682856008901691930003301780945002501813946001101838655001201849IND4398380920221121205329.0071203e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439838092DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2007.03.0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ100 0aQ400 0aQ5001 aBayarri, S.10aInfluence of texture on the temporal perception of sweetness of gelled systems  ap. 900-908.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe aim of this work was to study how the texture of two hydrocolloid gelled systems with different mechanical properties -- kappa-carrageenan and gellan gum -- sweetened with two sweeteners with different sweetening power -- sucrose and aspartame -- influence the temporal perception of sweetness using a time-intensity test. The results show that the different aspects of temporal perception of sweetness of hydrocolloid gels were related to their mechanical properties in different ways. Maximum sweetness intensity was closely related to the amount of deformation required to break the network and with its resistance to deformation. Meanwhile resistance to rupture was also an important factor influencing the variation in the rate of intensity decrease. The time needed to reach maximum sweetness intensity was only dependent on sweetener concentration. 3adeformation 3asweets 3asensory evaluation 3asucrose 3ahydrocolloids 3aaspartame 3acarrageenan 3ataste sensitivity 3amodulus of rupture 3acarrageenan gels 3asweetness 0agums 0agellan gum 0amechanical properties 0agels1 aRivas, I.1 aIzquierdo, L.1 aCostell, E.0 tFood research international.g2007 Aug., v. 40, no. 7 p.900-908dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2007.03.0033Available from publisher's Web site  a20080502b20080606c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle02931naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167100002500176245009400201300001600295500002400311500001500335520126200350650002401612650001701636650001901653650001601672650001501688650002501703650001801728650002101746650001701767650002801784650001601812650002401828650001801852650002501870650002801895650003501923650002001958653001701978700001801995700001802013773019102031852000902222856008902231930003302320945002502353946001102378655001202389IND4398380820221121205237.0071203e200708  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439838082DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2007.03.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ105 0aQ115 0aQ4051 aDel Pozo-Insfran, D.10aInactivation of polyphenol oxidase in muscadine grape juice by dense phase-CO2 processing  ap. 894-899.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe effect of dense phase-CO2 processing (DP-CO2) on polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, polyphenolic and antioxidant changes in muscadine grape juice under different processing pressures (27.6, 38.3, and 48.3 MPa) and CO2 concentrations (0, 7.5, and 15%) were measured. Subsequently two DP-CO2 conditions (48.3 MPa at 0 or 15% CO2) were evaluated for polyphenolic and antioxidant changes during storage (4 °C, four weeks). Pressure alone was responsible for a 40% decrease in PPO activity that resulted in 16-40% polyphenolic and antioxidant losses. Increasing CO2 from 0 to 7.5% was responsible for an additional 35% decrease in enzyme activity and a two-fold greater polyphenolic retention. However, insignificant changes in PPO activity or polyphenolic retention were observed when CO2 was increased to 15%. During storage, juices with residual PPO activity following processing resulted in greater polyphenolic (8- to 10-fold) and antioxidant capacity (four-fold) degradation compared to control juices with no PPO activity. This study demonstrated that partial PPO inactivation can be obtained by DP-CO2 and that CO2 level was the primary variable influencing PPO activity and polyphenolics and antioxidant capacity retention in muscadine grape juice. 3aenzyme inactivation 3aanthocyanins 3acarbon dioxide 3apolyphenols 3ashelf life 3afood nutrient losses 3afree radicals 3acatechol oxidase 3afood storage 3afree radical scavengers 3agrape juice 3aoxidative stability 3arefrigeration 3aantioxidant activity 3ahigh pressure treatment 3adense nonaqueous phase liquids 3aenzyme activity 0aantioxidants1 aBalaban, M.O.1 aTalcott, S.T.0 tFood research international.g2007 Aug., v. 40, no. 7 p.894-899dPublished on behalf of the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology by Elsevier Applied Sciencex0963-99697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2007.03.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20080502b20080606c00000000  aINDdPNNe2008/05/02  aNon-US 7aarticle05150naa a2200997 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111040001800132100001300150245010500163300001600268500002400284500001500308506007600323520189100399506003702290650001402327650001102341650002602352650001202378650001302390650002002403650001902423650002502442650002002467650002502487650001802512650001602530650001302546650002502559650002002584650001902604650004902623650001302672650001402685650002502699650003602724650004202760650002402802650002802826650003902854650002502893650003002918650003602948650002202984650003103006650004403037650003803081650005103119650003103170650002803201650002803229650002803257650003103285650001303316650002003329650007403349650005503423650003403478650002303512650003603535650002603571650002503597653001503622653001703637653002803654653001703682653002903699653001603728653002103744653001903765653003603784700001203820700002003832700001403852773015203866852000904018856005404027930003304081945001304114946001304127655001204140IND2332417520221207120746.0030506e200209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233241752DNAL7 a122265052pmid7 aPMC1665582pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, D.10aBiochemical characterization of the Arabidopsis protein kinase SOS2 that functions in salt tolerance  ap. 256-264.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe Arabidopsis Salt Overly Sensitive 2 (SOS2) gene encodes a serine/threonine (Thr) protein kinase that has been shown to be a critical component of the salt stress signaling pathway. SOS2 contains a sucrose-non-fermenting protein kinase 1/AMP-activated protein kinase-like N-terminal catalytic domain with an activation loop and a unique C-terminal regulatory domain with an FISL motif that binds to the calcium sensor Salt Overly Sensitive 3. In this study, we examined some of the biochemical properties of the SOS2 in vitro. To determine its biochemical properties, we expressed and isolated a number of active and inactive SOS2 mutants as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. Three constitutively active mutants, SOS2T168D, SOS2T168DdeltaF, and SOS2T168Ddelta308, were obtained previously, which contain either the Thr-168 to aspartic acid (Asp) mutation in the activation loop or combine the activation loop mutation with removal of the FISL motif or the entire regulatory domain. These active mutants exhibited a preference for Mn2+ relative to Mg2+ and could not use GTP as phosphate donor for either substrate phosphorylation or autophosphorylation. The three enzymes had similar peptide substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. Salt overly sensitive 3 had little effect on the activity of the activation loop mutant SOS2T168D, either in the presence or absence of calcium. The active mutant SOS2T168Ddelta308 could not transphosphorylate an inactive protein (SOS2K40N), which indicates an intramolecular reaction mechanism of SOS2 autophosphorylation. Interestingly, SOS2 could be activated not only by the Thr-168 to Asp mutation but also by a serine-156 or tyrosine-175 to Asp mutation within the activation loop. Our results provide insights into the regulation and biochemical properties of SOS2 and the SOS2 subfamily of protein kinases.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3amanganese 3aserine 3asubstrate specificity 3acations 3apeptides 3aphosphorylation 3aplant proteins 3arecombinant proteins 3agene expression 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aaspartic acid 3amutagenesis 3atyrosine 3aamino acid sequences 3aenzyme activity 3asalt tolerance 3anon-specific serine/threonine protein kinase 3akinetics 3amagnesium 3anucleotide sequences 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aArabidopsisxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aArabidopsis Proteins 2aAspartic Acidxmetabolism 2aCations, Divalentxpharmacology 2aEnzyme Activation 2aEscherichia colixgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlutathione Transferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMagnesiumxpharmacology 2aManganesexpharmacology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aMutation 2aPhosphorylation 2aProtein Serine-Threonine Kinasesxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSerinexmetabolism 2aSignal Transductionxphysiology 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTyrosinexmetabolism 0asubstrates 0apurification 0amolecular sequence data 0asos3 protein 0aarabidopsis sos2 protein 0afisl domain 0adivalent cations 0acalcium sensor 0asalt overly sensitive 2 protein1 aGuo, Y.1 aJagendorf, A.T.1 aZhu, J.K.0 tPlant physiology.g2002 Sept., v. 130, no. 1 p.256-264dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdRSC  aOther US 7aarticle03060naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196100002600213245013800239300001600377500001500393520140800408650001601816650001401832650001701846650001301863650002201876650002301898650001201921650001301933650001701946650003401963650001101997650003502008650003202043650003902075650003902114650002202153653001002175653002702185653002202212700002002234700001802254773007302272852000902345856008302354930003302437945002502470946001102495655001202506IND4436519720221121161141.0100505e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443651972DNAL7 a201473372pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpq0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

The effects of rootstock and scion age on vegetative growth, foliar morphology and reproductive development were assessed over 7 years after grafting. Vegetative growth potential declines with meristem maturation, but the high growth potential of J meristems on J rootstock cannot be expressed when J scions are grafted on MA and OG rootstock. Branch density decreases with meristem maturation. The tendency for high J branch density is expressed across all rootstock ages, but is minimally expressed on MA rootstock where elongation of terminal shoots is significantly greater than on OG rootstock. Both needle width and leaf mass area increase with meristem maturation and increasing tree size. Reproductive competence is mainly a function of meristem maturity, and rootstock had little effect on strobilus development, although the more fecund rootstocks did promote some flowering on J scions. Developmental decline in height growth does not appear to be a function of decreased meristem vigour, but reduced terminal long shoot elongation and decreased apical control in OG trees will reduce height growth. 3atree growth 3aflowering 3aforest trees 3atree age 3avegetative growth 3aplant reproduction 3adensity 3abranches 3aPicea rubens 3arootstock-scion relationships 3ashoots 2aMeristemxgrowth & development 2aPiceaxgrowth & development 2aPlant Leavesxgrowth & development 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & development 2aTreesxphysiology 0astems 0agrowth and development 0agrafting (plants)1 aDay, Michael E.1 aSchatz, Jason0 tTree physiology.g2010 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.459-468x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpq0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20100511b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle03916naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003300111040001800144072001700162072001700179072001700196100002100213245012300234300001600357500001500373520178300388650001302171650001902184650000802203650002002211650002202231650002102253650002302274650002002297650001002317650002402327650002102351650002002372650001102392650002502403650002302428650002502451650002102476650002302497650002202520650004002542650002402582650002502606650001602631653001502647653002702662653003402689653002802723653002402751700001602775700001902791700002302810700002202833700001602855700003002871700002202901700002502923773007302948852000903021856008303030930003303113945002503146946001103171655001203182IND4436519620221121161121.0100505e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443651962DNAL7 a201903452pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/tpq0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Beurré Bosc) grown in close proximity to spatially separated undifferentiated homologous (pear) or heterologous (quince; Cydonia oblonga Mill., East Malling clone C) cells in its neighboring environment. After a 7-day co-culture period, the presence of heterologous cells produced negative effects on the pear callus, whose relative weight increase and adenylate energy charge decreased by 30 and 24%, respectively. Such behavior was associated with a higher O2 consumption rate (+125%) which did not seem to be coupled to adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Analyses of alternative oxidase and enzymatic activities involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxification strongly suggested that the higher O2 consumption rate, measured in the pear callus grown in the heterologous combination, may probably be ascribed to extra-respiratory activities. These, in turn, might contribute to generate metabolic scenarios where ROS-induced oxidative stresses may have the upper hand. The increase in the levels of 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive metabolites, considered as diagnostic indicators of ROS-induced lipid peroxidation, seemed to confirm this hypothesis. Moreover, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression levels of a few senescence-associated genes were higher in the pear callus grown in the heterologous combination than in the homologous one. Taken as a whole, physiological and molecular data strongly suggest that undifferentiated cells belonging to a pear graft-incompatible quince clone may induce an early senescence-like status in a closely co-cultured pear callus. 3aethylene 3aPyrus communis 3aRNA 3aCydonia oblonga 3acomplementary DNA 3aoxidative stress 3aoxygen consumption 3agene expression 3acells 3agraft compatibility 3ain vitro studies 3aenzyme activity 3acallus 2aCellular Senescence. 2aCell Proliferation 2aCoculture Techniques 2aOxidative Stress 2aOxygen Consumption 2aPyrusxmetabolism 2aReactive Oxygen Speciesxmetabolism 2aReceptor Cross-Talk 2aRosaceaexmetabolism 2aTransplants 0asenescence 0aundifferentiated cells 0arootstock-scion relationships 0aadenylate energy charge 0aalternative oxidase1 aEspen, Luca1 aFedeli, Chiara1 aLancilli, Clarissa1 aMusacchi, Stefano1 aSerra, Sara1 aSansavini, S.q(Silviero)1 aCocucci, Maurizio1 aSacchi, Gian Attilio0 tTree physiology.g2010 Apr., v. 30, no. 4 p.450-458x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpq0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20100511b20100605c00000000  aINDdLYNe2010/05/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02446naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002500152245007600177300001600253500002400269520138400293650003001677650001201707650002301719650001001742650001201752650001001764650002201774650001201796650001401808650001401822650001201836650000901848700002201857773009201879852000901971856009201980655001202072IND4419218620221121103844.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441921862DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01625.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSnekser, Jennifer L.10aSex Differences in Retrieval Behavior by the Biparental Convict Cichlid  ap. 457-464.  aIncludes references  aBiparental species occasionally demonstrate a division of roles in which parents perform sex-typical tasks, with females offering direct care and spending the majority of their time with the offspring while males are more indirect in their care, providing the majority of defense against potential brood predators. To examine the flexibility in the sex-typical roles shown by convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata), we displaced non-swimming young at three different distances from the nest and then analyzed the retrieval behaviors of each parent. Retrieval of altricial young is a behavior commonly used to measure parental care in mammalian studies, but has rarely been used in other taxa. We found sex differences in retrieval behavior: on average, females retrieved young close to the nest and males retrieved young far from the nest. This difference in parental contribution suggests a division of labor with sex-specific roles. Sex differences may be due to proximity to young and/or apparent risk of offspring predation. Additionally, we found that latency to first retrieval and total time spent retrieving young remained consistent across the various displacement distances, suggesting that retrieval is an essential parental behavior. Additionally, we include observations of wriggler retrieval by parents in a natural population of Costa Rican convict cichlids. 3aAmatitlania nigrofasciata 3afemales 3agender differences 3amales 3amammals 3anests 3aparental behavior 3aparents 3apredation 3apredators 3aprogeny 3arisk1 aItzkowitz, Murray0 tEthology.g2009 May, v. 115, no. 5 p.457-464dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-16137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0310.2009.01625.x3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03899naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001900149245014700168300001800315500007500333500002400408500001500432506007600447520181200523506003702335650001702372650001302389650002102402650001702423650001202440650002202452650001402474650002902488650002002517650001902537650002302556650001002579650003602589650001202625650001702637650002802654650001402682650002702696650004302723650003002766650001802796650001002814650002302824653001002847653002302857653001002880653002502890653002802915700001902943773015302962852000903115856005403124930003303178945001303211946001303224655001203237IND2279257620221207124549.0010410e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227925762DNAL7 a112441162pmid7 aPMC656152pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSelinger, D.A.10aB-Bolivia, an allele of the maize b1 gene with variable expression, contains a high copy retrotransposon-related sequence immediately upstream  ap. 1363-1379.  aIn the Special Issue: The Grasses: A Collective Model Genetics System.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe maize (Zea mays) b1 gene encodes a transcription factor that regulates the anthocyanin pigment pathway. Of the b1 alleles with distinct tissue-specific expression, B-Peru and B-Bolivia are the only alleles that confer seed pigmentation. B-Bolivia produces variable and weaker seed expression but darker, more regular plant expression relative to B-Peru. Our experiments demonstrated that B-Bolivia is not expressed in the seed when transmitted through the male. When transmitted through the female the proportion of kernels pigmented and the intensity of pigment varied. Molecular characterization of B-Bolivia demonstrated that it shares the first 530 bp of the upstream region with B-Peru, a region sufficient for seed expression. Immediately upstream of 530 bp, B-Bolivia is completely divergent from B-Peru. These sequences share sequence similarity to retrotransposons. Transient expression assays of various promoter constructs identified a 33-bp region in B-Bolivia that can account for the reduced aleurone pigment amounts (40%) observed with B-Bolivia relative to B-Peru. Transgenic plants carrying the B-Bolivia promoter proximal region produced pigmented seeds. Similar to native B-Bolivia, some transgene loci are variably expressed in seeds. In contrast to native B-Bolivia, the transgene loci are expressed in seeds when transmitted through both the male and female. Some transgenic lines produced pigment in vegetative tissues, but the tissue-specificity was different from B-Bolivia, suggesting the introduced sequences do not contain the B-Bolivia plant-specific regulatory sequences. We hypothesize that the chromatin context of the B-Bolivia allele controls its epigenetic seed expression properties, which could be influenced by the adjacent highly repeated retrotransposon sequence.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aanthocyanins 3aZea mays 3aretrotransposons 3abiosynthesis 3aalleles 3atransgenic plants 3aphylogeny 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3aaleurone layer 3achromosome mapping 3acolor 3achemical constituents of plants 2aAlleles 2aGenes, Plant 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aPigmentationxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRetroelements 2aSeeds 2aZea maysxgenetics 0aseeds 0agenetic regulation 0agenes 0anucleotide sequences 0amolecular sequence data1 aChandler, V.L.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Mar., v. 125, no. 3 p.1363-1379dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03511naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002000111040001800131100001500149245011000164300001800274500007500292500002400367506007600391520183000467506003702297650002002334650001602354650001802370650002202388650002002410650001802430650002002448650001602468650003002484650002202514650004302536650003002579650001502609700001502624700001602639700001902655700002702674700001702701773015302718852000902871856005402880930003302934945001302967946001302980655001202993IND2279257520221207120115.0010410e200103  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND227925752DNAL7 a112441152pmid7 aPMC656142pmcid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKoprek, T.10aTransposon-mediated single-copy gene delivery leads to increased transgene expression stability in barley  ap. 1354-1362.  aIn the Special Issue: The Grasses: A Collective Model Genetics System.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aInstability of transgene expression in plants is often associated with complex multicopy patterns of transgene integration at the same locus, as well as position effects due to random integration. Based on maize transposable elements Activator (Ac) and Dissociation (Ds), we developed a method to generate large numbers of transgenic barley (Hordeum vulgare var Golden Promise) plants, each carrying a single transgene copy at different locations. Plants expressing Ac transposase (AcTPase) were crossed with plants containing one or more copies of bar, a selectable herbicide (Basta) resistance gene, located between inverted-repeat Ds ends (Ds-bar). F1 plants were self-pollinated and the F2 generation was analyzed to identify plants segregating for transposed Ds-bar elements. Of Ds-bar transpositions, 25% were in unlinked sites that segregated from vector sequences, other Ds-bar copies, and the AcTPase gene, resulting in numerous single-copy Ds-bar plants carrying the transgene at different locations. Transgene expression in F2 plants with transposed Ds-bar was 100% stable, whereas only 23% of F2 plants carrying Ds-bar at the original site expressed the transgene product stably. In F3 and F4 populations, transgene expression in 81.5% of plants from progeny of F2 plants with single-copy, transposed Ds-bar remained completely stable. Analysis of the integration site in single-copy plants showed that transposed Ds-bar inserted into single- or low-copy regions of the genome, whereas silenced Ds-bar elements at their original location were inserted into redundant or highly repetitive genomic regions. Methylation of the non-transposed transgene and its promoter, as well as a higher condensation of the chromatin around the original integration site, was associated with plants exhibiting transgene silencing.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aHordeum vulgare 3atransposons 3agene transfer 3atransgenic plants 3agene expression 2aBase Sequence 2aDNA Methylation 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA Transposable Elements 2aHordeumxgenetics 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgenetics 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aTransgenes1 aRangel, S.1 aMcElroy, D.1 aLouwerse, J.D.1 aWilliams-Carrier, R.E.1 aLemaux, P.G.0 tPlant physiology.g2001 Mar., v. 125, no. 3 p.1354-1362dAmerican Society of Plant PhysiologistsaPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.plantphysiol.org/3electronic resource  a20050129b20050130c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03859naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001100153245010500164300001400269500015100283520211200434650003402546650003802580650003502618650003702653650001902690650002102709650002302730650001502753650001502768650001002783650001102793650001902804650001802823650001102841650001802852650001602870650001602886650001202902650001202914650002602926650002002952650001302972650001902985650002203004650001603026650002203042650002103064651001403085773014303099856005403242852000903296655001203305IND60589528120221121070221.0180223e20171030xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058952812DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1176.52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, J.10aIntegrated vertical aeroponic farming systems for vegetable production in space limited environments  ap. 25-36.  aPaper presented at the ICESC2015: Hydroponics and Aquaponics at the Gold Coast held July 5 – July 8, 2015, Jupiter’s Gold Coast, QLD Australia  aA growing population generates tremendous demand for food, especially of vegetables, in space limited cities such as Singapore. Rooftop and vertical farms integrated with various technologies, such as hydroponics and aquaponics, have been commercialized over the past few years in Singapore. However, to compensate for the lack of land space and an increasing population, Singapore needs to develop its own unique effective farming system that will be independent of eventual climate changes. Using aeroponic systems, our previous studies showed that cooling the root-zone (RZ) could produce all types of vegetables throughout the year. Currently, we have expanded Singapore's urban farming technology by successfully developing an LED-integrated vertical aeroponic farming (VAF) system that can be used both indoors and in greenhouses, for vegetable production. Other than providing sufficient and uniform light intensity to the plants, the factor key to the success of this VAF system is the provision of a low energy input engineering solution - the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) - to enhance photosynthesis and maximise crop productivity. Our self-designed LED integrated VAF systems have been used to successfully grow lettuce (Lactuca sativa), Chinese broccoli (Brassica alboglabra), Nai Bai (Brassica chinensis), mizuna (Brassica juncea var. japonica) and culinary herbs, such as red and green Chinese basil (Perilla frutescens), and sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum). Experiments have also been carried out to identify optimal combinations, durations, and intensities of LED lighting for maximal vegetable production. Our results showed that all vegetables grown under LED lighting exhibited higher photosynthetic capacities, enhanced productivity, and higher crop rotation. However, we have also found that optimal growth conditions are species-dependent. In conclusion, although there are various vegetable farming strategies for space limited environments, extensive use of our LED integrated VAF systems would diminish our reliance on vegetable imports and enhance food security in Singapore. 3aBrassica juncea var. japonica 3aBrassica oleracea var. alboglabra 3aBrassica rapa subsp. chinensis 3aBrassica rapa subsp. nipposinica 3aLactuca sativa 3aOcimum basilicum 3aPerilla frutescens 3aaeroponics 3aaquaponics 3abasil 3acities 3aclimate change 3acrop rotation 3aenergy 3afood security 3agreenhouses 3ahydroponics 3aimports 3alettuce 3alight emitting diodes 3alight intensity 3alighting 3aphotosynthesis 3apopulation growth 3arhizosphere 3avegetable growing 3avertical farming 3aSingapore0 tActa horticulturae.g2017 Oct. 30, , no. 1176 p.25-36dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1176.5  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245011900125300001400244500002400258520131600282650002201598650001501620650002201635650000801657650001101665650001601676650002601692653001101718653001601729653001101745700001501756700002601771773012301797852000901920856016901929930003302098945001302131946001102144655001202155IND2290470520221120074806.0010414e20010201ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND229047052DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeitao, A.10aNegative correlation between aneuploidy and growth in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas: ten years of evidence  ap. 39-48.  aIncludes references  aThis study unites previous and new observations that chromosome loss in somatic cells of juveniles of the Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is associated with reduced growth rate. New data were obtained from four hatchery-produced progenies. Within each progeny, oysters of identical age were sampled and classified as fast-growing or slow-growing according to their shell length, or live weight. Chromosome numbers were individually scored from 30 randomly chosen metaphases from gill tissue. Although the diploid chromosome number in C. gigas is 2N = 20, hypodiploid cells of 2N = 19, 18 or 17 were observed in all progenies. The difference in percentage of aneuploidy between fast- and slow-growing oysters ranged from 5% to 22% and was highly significant. In one progeny, a highly significant negative correlation (R2 = 0.58) was observed between individual level of aneuploidy and growth performances individually recorded under common controlled conditions. The consistency of the negative relationship between growth rate and aneuploidy was obvious in all populations studied between 1988 and 1999. However, when comparing aneuploidy between fast- and slow-growing oysters, two different groups of populations can be clearly distinguished. The question remains to determine the cause of these differences. 3aCrassostrea gigas 3aaneuploidy 3achromosome number 3aage 3alength 3abody weight 3along term experiments 0ashells 0agrowth rate 0agrowth1 aBoudry, P.1 aThiriot-Quievreux, C.0 tAquaculture.g2001 Feb. 1, , no. 1/2 p.39-48dElsevier Pub.

Their flavin-binding domains all have the same structural motif, the 8-fold beta/alpha-barrel domain, which is also present in a large number of other enzymes. FMN is bound in a similar fashion in all three enzymes. The binding site is at the carboxyl-terminal end of the eight beta-strands of the barrel where the active site is invariably found in this type of domain structure. The similarity of the structures of glycolate oxidase and flavocytochrome extends to the loop regions and even outside the beta/alpha-barrels with a root mean square deviation of 0.93 angstrom for 311 superimposed C alpha-atoms and with a sequence identity of 37%. A detailed analysis of their active sites shows, however, that the orientation of FMN is significantly different in the two structures due to different conformations of residues in the end of strand one. Thus, in flavocytochrome b2 a hydrogen bond is formed between the FMN N-5 position and the main chain amide of Ala-198, while in glycolate oxidase, the ring system is tilted away from the strand, creating a pocket on the re-side of the FMN ring where a water molecule is bound. Model building shows that this site could accommodate the hydroperoxide moiety of a FMN-4a-hydroperoxide intermediate. Thus, in the course of evolution, a few mutations in, and close to, the active sites have fine tuned these enzymes to exert their specific functions as an oxidase or transferase, respectively. 3a(S)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase 3aevolution 3aSpinacia oleracea 3aamino acid sequences 3acytochrome b 3atrimethylamine 2aAlcohol Oxidoreductasesxgenetics 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenasexgenetics 2aL-Lactate Dehydrogenase (Cytochrome) 2aModels, Molecular 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymology 2aSequence Alignment 2aSequence Homology, Nucleic Acid 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 2aVegetablesxgenetics 0aamino acid sequence homology 0aoxidoreductases 0a(s)-2-hydroxy-acid oxidase 0abinding1 aBranden, C.I.1 aMathews, F.S.1 aLederer, F.0 tJournal of biological chemistry.g1991 Feb. 15, v. 266, no. 5 p.3198-3207x0021-92587nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02658naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127072000900145072000900154072000900163100002000172245017300192300001800365500002400383520109800407650001401505650002301519650001701542650002001559650002601579650002301605650002401628650002101652650002401673650002601697650002701723650002401750650002001774650001101794650000901805653002401814700002001838700002801858773010301886852000901989856008501998930003302083945002502116946001102141655001202152IND4441302020221121060057.0100813e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444130202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10530-010-9697-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aM310 0aP010 0aM0011 aZambrano, Luis 10aFood web overlap among native axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum) and two exotic fishes: carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) in Xochimilco, Mexico City  ap. 3061-3069.  aIncludes references  aTwo exotic fishes, common carp (Cyprinus carpio) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), were introduced more than 20 years ago into Xochimilco for aquaculture, and now dominate the system in terms of biomass and numbers. Over this same period, wild populations of the microendemic axolotl salamander (Ambystoma mexicanum) have been dramatically reduced, and it currently persists in isolated areas of this aquatic system, which is situated at the edge of Mexico City. In this study, we examine potential trophic interactions and niche overlap among two exotic fishes: carp and tilapia, and the native axolotl. Axolotl had more diverse diets and a higher trophic position compared to the exotics. Stable isotope analysis revealed substantial trophic niche overlap among axolotl and the exotics. The two exotics occupied a larger niche area than the axolotl, suggesting higher levels of omnivory and diet specialization. Current exotic fish removal efforts will further our understanding of interactions between the axolotl and exotic species, and are expected to benefit axolotl recovery efforts. 3aAmbystoma 3aindigenous species 3awild animals 3aCyprinus carpio 3aOreochromis niloticus 3aintroduced species 3aaquatic environment 3ainvasive species 3apopulation dynamics 3atrophic relationships 3aecological competition 3afeeding preferences 3astable isotopes 3aniches 3adiet 0aAmbystoma mexicanum1 aValiente, Elsa 1 aVander Zanden, M.

Early growth and survival of seahorses were significantly greater when fed copepod nauplii. Copepod nauplii were well digested by juvenile seahorses whereas Artemia nauplii were not. Fatty acid requirements of seahorses could not be determined. The addition of UV water sterilisation improved seahorse survival.

The scenario begins with the potential co-facilitation between the European earthworm Lumbricus terrestris and European buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica. Once introduced, European buckthorn has served as the overwintering host for two important invasive crop pests, oat crown rust, Puccinea coronata and the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines. The spread of R. cathartica itself may have been aided by seed dispersal by the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris, and the presence of L. terrestris has likely facilitated the invasion of Bipalium adventitium, an Asian predatory flatworm that specializes on earthworms. Beyond this, the soybean aphid is consumed by a number of introduced species, including the lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, the ground beetle Agonum muelleri and the parasitoid Aphelinus certus. We hypothesize that the presence of soybean aphid increases regional abundances of these species. We discuss both the evidence for this multi-species invasional meltdown scenario and potential implications of meltdown dynamics for invasive species management. The particular management issues that we discuss are: (1) opportunities for managing multiple invasive species simultaneously by targeting facilitator species, and (2) implications of meltdown dynamics for biological control introductions against the soybean aphid. 3aAgonum 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3awoody weeds 3asoil ecology 3aPuccinia coronata 3abiological control agents 3aseed dispersal 3aHarmonia axyridis 3aplant pests 3apredatory arthropods 3aAphelinus 3ainvasive species 3aecological invasion 3aAphis glycines 3ainsect pests 3aSturnus vulgaris 3aintroduced species 3aearthworms 3avertebrate pests 3aRhamnus cathartica 3aoverwintering 3aLumbricus terrestris 3aPlanaria 3aNorth America 0apredators 0aBipalium adventitium 0aAphelinus certus 0ainvasional meltdown 0aAgonum muelleri1 aFrelich, Lee E. 1 aLandis, Douglas A. 1 aHopper, Keith R. 1 aHoelmer, Kim A. 1 aSezen, Zeynep 1 aAsplen, Mark K. 1 aWu, Kongming 0 tBiological invasions.g2010 Sept., v. 12, no. 9 p.2913-2931dSpringer Netherlandsx1387-35477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-010-9736-53Available from publisher's Web site  a20101123b20101204c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/10/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01681naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002000154245011000174300001900284520071500303650002001018650001401038650001101052650001001063650001101073650003101084700002301115773008001138852000901218856009401227939003301321946001301354655001201367IND9203092720221121035943.0920518e199112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920309272DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb08638.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarraquio, V.L.10aSodium caseinate from skim milk powder by extrusion processing: physicochemical and functional properties  ap. 1552- 1561.  aSodium caseinate produced on a pilot-plant-scale directly from skim milk powder (SMP) with two-step extrusion process was compared to a commercial product and a sodium caseinate prepared from commercial acid casein by extrusion-processing.

Both prime and spawning-condition salmon had 1-octen-3-one, 1,5-octadien-3-one, 1-octen-3-ol, 1,5-octadien-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, and 2,5-octadien-1-ol which contributed distinct and characteristic plant-like aromas to the fish. Mote pronounced aromas of spawning-conditions almon were attributed to greater concentrations of the 8-carbon compounds in combination with occurrence of (E)-2-nonenal, (E)-2,(Z)-6-nonadienal, 6-nonen-1-ol, and 3,6-nonadien-1-ol which added sweet, cucumber- or melon-like aroma notes. The 9-carbon compounds may have resulted from biochemical regulation of physiologically active lipid-derived substances which activate mucus secretion in salmon approaching sexual maturity. 3amarine environment 3asalmon 3alakes 3amaturity stage 3abody composition 3avolatile compounds 3aaromatic compounds 3aPacific Ocean 3aGreat Lakes region1 aLindsay, R.C.1 aStuiber, D.A.0 tJournal of food science.g1991 , v. 56, no. 6 p.1576- 1585x0022-11477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2621.1991.tb08644.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01547naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009100125300001600216520077700232650001801009650001601027650001601043650002201059650001801081650001001099700001501109773008001124852000901204939003301213946001101246655001201257IND9305147720221121024615.0930831s1993    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930514772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTong, C.H.10aMicrowave heating of baked dough products with simultaneous heat and moisture transfer  ap. 319-339.  aBy using the Crank-Nicolson finite-difference method, a computer model to predict temperatures and moisture contents during microwave heating was developed.

Animal models were successfully established and characterized by conventional HA and HI antigen tests. Pathological changes in the thymus, bursa of Fabricius and spleen were observed through microscopic examination. Changes in T lymphocyte subsets and lymphocyte apoptosis were detected by flow cytometry. Effects on the production of anti-Newcastle disease antibodies were examined through the β-trace method. Viruses isolated from infected chickens were confirmed to be H9N2 influenza virus. Immune organ indexes decreased significantly 7 and 14 days after broiler chickens were infected with virus. Microscopic examination showed degeneration in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius and congestive organization in the spleen. Flow cytometry results showed a significant decrease in the numbers of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, as well as the CD4⁺/CD8⁺ ratio, compared with controls. Annexin V-FITC/PI double-staining showed that the H9N2 virus promoted the middle and late periods in lymphocyte apoptosis. Anti-NDV antibody titres in infected chickens decreased compared with the control group. All the results showed that H9N2 virus can cause severe immune suppression and immune organ damage in broiler chickens and lead to significant reduction in the effectiveness of Newcastle disease vaccine. 3aInfluenza A virus 3aNewcastle disease 3aT-lymphocytes 3aanimal models 3aantibodies 3aantigen detection 3aapoptosis 3abroiler chickens 3abursa of Fabricius 3aflow cytometry 3ainfluenza 3aspleen 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aChina1 aYouxiang, D.0 tTransboundary and emerging diseases.g2011 Apr., v. 58, no. 2 p.145-151dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1865-16747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1865-1682.2010.01192.x 7aarticle02778naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010000166300001400266500002400280520158400304650001701888650002401905650001501929650001401944650002201958650002301980650001102003650001602014650002602030653002302056653002202079653003002101653003702131653002902168653003602197773009002233852000902323856004802332655001202380IND4446875020221120023021.0101224e201101  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444687502DNAL7 a10.1007/s10144-010-0253-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUtsumi, Shunsuke10aEco-evolutionary dynamics in herbivorous insect communities mediated by induced plant responses  ap. 23-34.  aIncludes references  aIt is increasingly recognized that the ecology of communities and evolution of species within communities are interdependent, and researchers have been paying attention to this rapidly emerging field of research, i.e., through studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics. Most of the studies on eco-evolutionary dynamics have been concerned with direct trophic interactions. However, community ecologists have shown that trait-mediated indirect effects play an important role in shaping the structure of natural communities. In particular, in terrestrial plant-insect systems, indirect effects mediated through herbivore-induced plant responses are common and have a great impact on the structure of herbivore communities. This review describes eco-evolutionary dynamics in herbivorous insect communities, and specifically focuses on the key role of herbivore-induced plant responses in eco-evolutionary dynamics. First, I review studies on the evolution of herbivore traits relevant to plant induction and discuss evolution in a community context mediated by induced plant responses. Second, I highlight how intraspecific genetic variation or evolution in herbivore traits can influence herbivore community structure. Finally, I propose the hypothetical model that induced plant responses supports eco-evolutionary feedback in herbivore communities. In this review, I argue that the application of the indirect interaction web approaches into studies on eco-evolutionary will provide profound insights into understanding of mechanisms of the generation and maintenance of biodiversity. 3abiodiversity 3acommunity structure 3aecologists 3aevolution 3agenetic variation 3ainsect communities 3amodels 3aresearchers 3atrophic relationships 0aCommunity genetics 0aDiffuse selection 0aEco-evolutionary feedback 0aHerbivore-induced plant response 0aIndirect interaction web 0aTrait-mediated indirect effects0 tPopulation ecology.g2011 Jan., v. 53, no. 1 p.23-34dSpringer Japanx1438-38967nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-010-0253-2 7aarticle03475naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100002200171245012500193300001600318500002400334500001500358520169000373650002202063650001502085650001402100650001702114650002402131650001602155650003102171650003902202650001402241650002002255650001502275650001002290650002302300650002002323650001102343650006602354650003402420650001102454650000902465650001602474650002102490650003002511650001602541651001902557651003402576653000902610700002102619700001802640700002102658700002102679773010902700852000902809856005502818655001202873IND4434815420221117161352.0100402s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443481542DNAL7 a204469962pmid7 a10.1111/j.1748-0361.2010.00271.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeis, Kristina E.10aAssociations of Rural Residence With Timing of HIV Diagnosis and Stage of Disease at Diagnosis, South Carolina 2001-2005  ap. 105-112.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aContext: Rural areas in the southern United States face many challenges, including limited access to health care services and stigma, which may lead to later HIV diagnosis among rural residents. Purpose: To investigate the associations of rural residence with timing of HIV diagnosis and stage of disease at diagnosis. Methods: Timing of HIV diagnosis was categorized as a diagnosis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome within 1 year of a first positive HIV test or HIV-only. Stage of disease was based on initial CD4+ T-cell count taken within 1 year of diagnosis. County of residence at HIV diagnosis was classified as urban if the population of the largest city was at least 25,000; it was classified as rural otherwise. Logistic regression was used to analyze timing of HIV diagnosis, and analysis of covariance was used to analyze stage of disease. Findings: From 2001 to 2005, 4,137 individuals were diagnosed with HIV infection. Of these, 1,129 (27%) were rural and 3,008 (73%) were urban residents. Among rural residents, 533 (47%) were diagnosed late, compared with 1,258 (42%) urban residents. Rural residents were significantly more likely to be diagnosed late (OR 1.19 [95% CI, 1.02-1.38]). Rural residence was associated with lower initial CD4+ T-cell count in crude analysis (P= .01) but not after adjustment (P > .05). Conclusions: Rural residence is a risk factor for late HIV diagnosis. This may lead to reduced treatment response to antiretroviral medications, increased morbidity and mortality, and greater HIV transmission risks among rural residents. New testing strategies are needed that address challenges to HIV testing and diagnosis specific to rural areas. 3adisease diagnosis 3acovariance 3amorbidity 3arisk factors 3aregression analysis 3arural areas 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aacquired immunodeficiency syndrome 3amortality 3ahealth services 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aDatabases, Factual 2aEarly Diagnosis 2aFemale 2aHIV Seropositivityxdiagnosisxepidemiologyxphysiopathology. 2aHealth Services Accessibility 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aRural Population 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aYoung Adult 3aSouth Carolina 0aSouth Carolinaxepidemiology. 0arisk1 aLiese, Angela D.1 aHussey, James1 aGibson, James J.1 aDuffus, Wayne A.0 tJournal of rural health.g2010 Spring, v. 26, no. 2 p.105-112dBlackwell Publishing Incx0890-765X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1748-0361.2010.00271.x 7aarticle03059naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002200161245011700183300001600300500002400316520129000340650001901630650003101649650001501680650001301695650002501708650002101733650001301754650002201767650002101789650001701810650001801827650001901845650001101864650003001875650002101905650001601926650002001942650003101962650002501993650002202018650002802040650001702068650001102085650002902096650002102125650003202146650003502178700002202213700002002235700001802255700001902273773011102292852000902403856004502412655001202457IND4416754120221117161309.0090220e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441675412DNAL7 a189856542pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2007005092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReichardt, Nicole10aCharacterization of high molecular weight coffee fractions and their fermentation by human intestinal microbiota  ap. 287-299.  aIncludes references  aTo investigate the structure and fermentability of high Mr components of coffee brews by human gut bacteria Arabica coffee samples of three different degrees of roast (light, medium, and dark) were used for drip brew preparations and fractionation by ultrafiltration with different Mr cut-offs.

Galactomannans and arabinogalactans were the main polysaccharides and made up between one-fourth and one-half of the respective coffee fraction. After 24 h of incubation with a human fecal suspension the polysaccharides of all fractions were extensively degraded. A decrease in the absorbance values at 405 and 280 nm, respectively, indicated that also chemically noncharacterized UV-active components such as Maillard reaction products, had been partially degraded or modified by the human gut bacteria. The remainder after 24 h of fermentation still showed antioxidant activity. Bacterial cells belonging to the Bacteroides-Prevotella group increased 2- to 40-fold during fermentation depending on the Mr range of the fraction and the degree of roast. The production of high amounts of acetate and propionate is in accordance with a role of these bacteria in the degradation of high Mr components from coffee. 3aCoffea arabica 3aMaillard reaction products 3aabsorbance 3aacetates 3aantioxidant activity 3aarabinogalactans 3abacteria 3acoffee (beverage) 3adigestive system 3afermentation 3afractionation 3agalactomannans 3ahumans 3aintestinal microorganisms 3amolecular weight 3apropionates 3aultrafiltration 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBacteriaxmetabolism 2aCoffeexchemistry 2aFatty Acidsxmetabolism 2aFermentation 2aHumans 2aIntestinesxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Weight 2aPolysaccharidesxmetabolism 2aSpectrophotometry, Ultraviolet1 aGniechwitz, Diana1 aSteinhart, Hans1 aBunzel, Mirko1 aBlaut, Michael0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2009 Feb., v. 53, no. 2 p.287-299dWiley-VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200700509 7aarticle03327naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245012800160300001400288500002400302520166800326650001901994650002102013650001102034650002202045650002202067650001902089650002202108650001802130650001302148650002102161650002102182650001502203650001602218650001602234650001702250650001202267650001702279650001802296650001102314651001002325653002302335653002402358653002202382653003302404653002402437653003202461700001702493700001702510700001802527700001902545700002102564773009502585852000902680856004802689655001202737IND4440381720221117161318.0100723e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444038172DNAL7 a10.1007/s11104-010-0321-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHu, Ya-Lin10aResponses of soil chemical and biological properties to nitrogen addition in a Dahurian larch plantation in Northeast China  ap. 81-92.  aIncludes references  aSoil microbial properties play a key role in belowground ecosystem functioning, but are not well understood in forest ecosystems under nitrogen (N) enrichment. In this study, soil samples from 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers were collected from a Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii Rupr.) plantation in Northeast China after six consecutive years of N addition to examine changes in soil pH, nutrient concentrations, and microbial biomass and activities. Nitrogen addition significantly decreased soil pH and total phosphorus, but had little effect on soil total organic carbon (TOC) and total N (TN) concentrations. The NO ₃ ⁻ -N concentrations in the two soil layers under N addition were significantly higher than that in the control, while NH ₄ ⁺ -N concentrations were not different. After six years of N addition, potential net N mineralization and nitrification rates were dramatically increased. Nitrogen addition decreased microbial biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN), and MBC/TOC and MBN/TN in the 0-10 cm soil layer, but MBC/MBN was increased by 67% in the 0-10 cm soil layer. Soil basal respiration, microbial metabolic quotient (qCO₂), and β-glucosidase, urease, acid phosphomonoesterase and nitrate reductase activities in the two soil layers showed little change after six years of N addition. However, soil protease and dehydrogenase activities in the 0-10 cm layer were 41% and 54% lower in the N addition treatment than in the control, respectively. Collectively, our results suggest that in the mid-term N addition leads to a decline in soil quality in larch plantations, and that different soil enzymes show differentiated responses to N addition. 3aLarix gmelinii 3aacid phosphatase 3acarbon 3aforest ecosystems 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3anitrate reductase 3anitrification 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3anutrient content 3aphosphorus 3aplantations 3aproteinases 3asoil enzymes 3asoil pH 3asoil quality 3asoil sampling 3aurease 3aChina 0aEnzymatic activity 0aLarix gmelinii Rupr 0aMicrobial biomass 0aMicrobial metabolic quotient 0aNitrogen enrichment 0aTemperate plantation forest1 aZeng, De-Hui1 aLiu, Yun-Xia1 aZhang, Yu-Lan1 aChen, Zhen-Hua1 aWang, Zheng-Quan0 tPlant and soil.g2010 Aug., v. 333, no. 1-2 p.81-92dSpringer Netherlandsx0032-079X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-010-0321-6 7aarticle02654naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100004400145245008200189300001600271500002400287520118900311650001301500650001701513650001301530650000901543650002601552650002201578650001401600650001201614650001901626650001401645650002601659650002401685650002401709653002901733653002001762653003501782653001501817700003601832700001501868700002101883700003401904700003201938700001701970773011601987852000902103856004802112655001202160IND4401542820221123025333.0080217e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440154282DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-007-9230-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPinheiro de Carvalho, Miguel Ângelo A.10aEvaluation of the maize (Zea mays L.) diversity on the Archipelago of Madeira  ap. 221-233.  aIncludes references  aThe variability of 43 open-pollinated populations of maize (Zea mays L.), representing a wide range of ecological conditions on the Archipelago of Madeira, was evaluated based on the morphological and reproductive traits. Individual data of 41 traits related to earliness, plant and tassel structure and the shape of the ear and grain were analysed using multivariate analysis. The populations belonging to two major maize varieties were grouped into four groups by their degree of dissimilarity, based on discriminant analysis. The dissimilarity of these groups was confirmed by the values of the Tukey test. The racial rank of these groups was proposed and a brief description of the maize landraces was presented. This work represents the first morphological characterization and analysis of diversity of maize germplasm for the Archipelago of Madeira where the traditional agricultural practices are still keeping this Portuguese region free from corn hybrids. The description of the Madeiran corn landraces allows us to preserve the existing corn biodiversity and could be used for their registration as conservation landraces or for conservation and breeding proposes worldwide. 3aZea mays 3abiodiversity 3abreeding 3acorn 3adiscriminant analysis 3aearly development 3agermplasm 3ahybrids 3ainflorescences 3alandraces 3amultivariate analysis 3areproductive traits 3atraditional farming 0aLandraces identification 0aMaize germplasm 0aMorphological characterization 0aZea mays L1 aGanança, José Filipe Teixeira1 aAbreu, Ivo1 aSousa, Nélia F.1 ados Santos, Teresa M.

Two types of laboratory experiments, i.e., choice and no choice feeding, were performed using only adult male and female specimens of the spiders. No choice test showed that each of the three hunting spiders readily consumed larvae and nymphs of rice pests offered. Female hunting spiders consumed more prey compared to male hunting spiders. Results of choice feeding test indicated that L. terrestris and P. birmanica preferred nymphs of rice insect pests while O. javanus preferred larvae of rice insect pests. Results of direct observations showed that in August, dipterous insects were the most numerous rice pests consumed by L. terrestris, P. birmanica and O. javanus, comprising over 56.3, 38 and 48% of their respective diets. In contrast, in September, the proportion of dipterous insects decreased dramatically and hoppers become the most numerous pests, comprising over 50, 51 and 41% of all prey and spiders consumed by L. terrestris, P. birmanica and O. javanus, respectively. In October, aquatic Heteroptera were frequently observed in their diets. Predatory potential of these hunting spiders differed statistically in the laboratory as well as in the field. It is concluded from the results of present project that studied species of spiders could successfully be used to control insect pests of rice ecosystems. 3aHeteroptera 3aLycosa 3aOxyopes 3aPardosa 3achoice feeding 3adiet 3aecosystems 3ainsect larvae 3ainsect pests 3amales 3anymphs 3apest control 3arice1 aButt, Abida0 tJournal of pest science.g2009 Aug., v. 82, no. 3 p.217-225dSpringer-Verlagx1612-47587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10340-008-0242-9 7aarticle03666naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245011600160300001600276500002400292500001500316520237500331650001302706650001102719650001302730650001802743650001002761650001102771650001002782650000902792650002202801650002202823650002902845650002202874650001002896650001702906650001202923650002602935650001202961651001602973653001202989700002203001700001903023773008503042852000903127856004803136655001203184IND4401841420221123025518.0080223e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440184142DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-007-9111-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGimmi, Urs10aReconstructing Anthropogenic Disturbance Regimes in Forest Ecosystems: A Case Study from the Swiss Rhone Valley  ap. 113-124.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAnthropogenic disturbances of forest ecosystems are increasingly recognized as fundamental ecological processes with important long-term implications for biogeochemical cycles and vegetation patterns. This article aims at reconstructing the extent and intensity of the two most common types of traditional forest uses--forest litter collecting and wood pasture--in the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais) by (i) identifying the spatiotemporal patterns, and (ii) modeling the biomass removal through these practices. Detailed information on agricultural practices and socio-economic context were essential to develop reliable estimates of anthropogenic disturbance regimes. In the Valais, predominately goats and sheep grazed in the forests. The intensity of grazing was a function of the number of grazing animals and the available grazing area. Forest litter was used as bedding for farm animals during the winter. Key factors determining the intensity of litter collecting were the number of animal units, the amount of available substitute products (straw), and the area where litter raking could be practiced. The results show that wood pasture and forest litter collecting were practiced on a significant proportion of the forested landscape in the Valais up to the second half of the 20th century. Until the implementation of forest management plans in the 1930s, almost half of the forests in the study area were affected by wood pasture and/or forest litter collecting. The regulations in the management plans led to an essential reduction of the area available for these traditional practices but likewise to an increased pressure on the remaining areas. The results suggest that the notion of a slow but steady disappearance of traditional non-timber forest uses and the associated effects on forest ecosystems is oversimplified. Quantitative reconstructions of biomass output resulting from these practices confirm the importance of traditional non-timber forest uses for ecosystem development in this region. Furthermore, it is very likely that similar effects have been widespread throughout regions with similar natural and socio-economic context, for example, throughout a significant proportion of the European Alps. This study underlines the importance of environmental history for ecological sciences as well as for forest management and conservation planning. 3aplanning 3awinter 3apastures 3aforest litter 3agoats 3amodels 3asheep 3awood 3aforest management 3aforest ecosystems 3aanthropogenic activities 3agrazing intensity 3astraw 3acase studies 3abiomass 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aforests 3aAlps region 0agrazing1 aBürgi, Matthias.1 aStuber, Martin0 tEcosystems.g2008 Feb., v. 11, no. 1 p.113-124dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-007-9111-2 7aarticle02799naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002500145245012100170300001600291500002400307500001500331520155900346650001001905650001101915650001701926650001701943650001101960650001901971650001601990650001402006650001302020650001202033650002702045650001702072651001002089653001602099653002302115700001802138700001902156700002602175773009502201852000902296856004802305655001202353IND4407072020221123025524.0080620e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440707202DNAL7 a10.1007/s10750-008-9408-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-González, C.10aDam function rules based on brown trout flow requirements: design of environmental flow regimes in regulated streams  ap. 253-262.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe operation of small hydroelectric dams built on mountain streams induce changes in stream flow regimes that are manifested not only in the intensity of flow events, but also in the variability and frequency of high- and low-flow episodes. Former studies have shown the influence of flow variability upon the dynamics of a resident brown trout population, especially that related to the stream flow regime during spawning, incubation and emerging periods. As these life-stages are known to determine the population dynamics in further ages, stream flow variability appears to be a major influence on the regulation of a wild brown trout population. Thus, mean flow discharge should not be the only parameter taken into account when establishing ecological flow regimes to support rehabilitation of degraded trout populations in mountain streams. Ecological stream flow regime characteristics are proposed as a basis for the design of environmental flow regimes in mountain reaches downstream of hydroelectric or water supply dams. Case studies were conducted in a high mountain basin in Central Spain (River Tormes) for a period of 5 years showing that relationship between duration and frequency of high and low flow episodes during egg incubation could be linked to young-of-the-year recruitment and quantified in terms of flow management units. Duration and frequency of flow discharges could be manipulated so as to create favourable hydrological conditions for restoring sustainable populations of brown trout in rivers affected by flow regulation 3atrout 3abasins 3awater supply 3aSalmo trutta 3arivers 3aegg incubation 3astream flow 3amountains 3aspawning 3astreams 3adesign for environment 3acase studies 3aSpain 0arecruitment 0asustainable design1 aGortázar, J.1 aBaeza Sanz, D.1 aGarcía de Jalón, D.0 tHydrobiologia.g2008 Sept., v. 609, no. 1 p.253-262dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9408-y 7aarticle03183naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100002200181245013700203300001800340500002400358506007600382520161000458506003702068650001402105650002302119650002502142650001902167650002302186650001102209650005202220650001602272650001702288700001902305700001902324700002102343700001902364700001802383700001602401700002402417700001802441700001602459773013702475852000902612856008002621655001202701IND4445988320221207113932.0101203e20101215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444598832DNAL7 a10.1128/AEM.01863-102doi7 aPMC30082442pmcid7 a209526412pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKamimura, Naofumi10aCharacterization of the Protocatechuate 4,5-Cleavage Pathway Operon in Comamonas sp.

Disruption of pmdB and pmdD in E6, which code for the β subunit of PCA 4,5-dioxygenase and 2-pyrone-4,6-dicarboxylate (PDC) hydrolase, respectively, resulted in a growth defect on PCA, indicating that these genes are essential for the growth of E6 on PCA. On the other hand, inactivation of pmdBII did not affect the growth of E6 on PCA. Disruption of pmdK, which is related to a 4-hydroxybenzoate/PCA transporter of Pseudomonas putida, resulted in growth retardation on PCA. The insertional inactivation of orf1 in E6, whose deduced amino acid sequence has no similarity with proteins of known function, led to the complete loss of growth on PCA and the accumulation of PDC and 4-oxalomesaconate (OMA) from PCA. These results indicated the involvement of orf1 in the PCA45 pathway, and this gene, designated pmdU, was suggested to code for OMA tautomerase. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis suggested that the pmdUKEFDABC genes constitute an operon. The transcription start site of the pmd operon was mapped at 167 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon of pmdU. The pmd promoter activity was enhanced 20-fold when the cells were grown in the presence of PCA. Inducers of the pmd operon were found to be PCA and PDC, but PDC was the more effective inducer.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aComamonas 3aPseudomonas putida 3aamino acid sequences 3aaromatic acids 3agrowth retardation 3aoperon 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3astart codon 3atransporters1 aAoyama, Taichi1 aYoshida, Rieko1 aTakahashi, Kenji1 aKasai, Daisuke1 aAbe, Tomokuni1 aMase, Kohei1 aKatayama, Yoshihiro1 aFukuda, Masao1 aMasai, Eiji0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2010 Dec. 15, v. 76, no. 24 p.8093-8101dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01863-103Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03345naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001700171245011500188300001600303500002400319520133600343650003801679650002201717650001801739650001401757650002501771650001401796650001901810650002001829650002001849650001401869650006101883650002801944650003701972650006802009650002202077650008502099650003802184650006702222650003502289650004202324650003002366650003602396650004302432700001602475700001402491700002102505700002002526700001702546700001902563773012102582852000902703856005502712655001202767IND4439012120221122221157.0100625e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443901212DNAL7 a205909912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00961.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Chun-Yan10aStarch Synthesis and Programmed Cell Death during Endosperm Development in Triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack)  ap. 602-615.  aIncludes references  aTriticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack) grains synthesize and accumulate starch as their main energy source. Starch accumulation rate and synthesis activities of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, soluble starch synthases, granule-bound starch synthase and starch-branching enzyme showed similar pattern of unimodal curves during endosperm development. There was no significant difference in activity of the starch granule-bound protein isolated from total and separated starch granules at different developmental stages after anthesis in triticale. Evans Blue staining and analysis of DNA fragmentation indicated that cells of triticale endosperm undergo programmed cell death during its development. Dead cells within the endosperm were detected at 6 d post anthesis (DPA), and evidence of DNA fragmentation was first observed at 21 DPA. The period between initial detection of PCD to its rapid increase overlapped with the key stages of rapid starch accumulation during endosperm development. Cell death occurred stochastically throughout the whole endosperm, meanwhile, the activities of starch biosynthetic enzymes and the starch accumulation rate decreased in the late stages of grain filling. These results suggested that the timing and progression of PCD in triticale endosperm may interfere with starch synthesis and accumulation. 3a1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme 3aDNA fragmentation 3aTriticosecale 3aapoptosis 3adevelopmental stages 3aendosperm 3afilling period 3astarch granules 3astarch synthase 3atriticale 2a1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzymexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAmylopectinxmetabolism 2aApoptosisxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aEdible Grainxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aDNA Fragmentation 2aEndospermxcytologyxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolismxultrastructure. 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGlucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMicroscopy, Electron, Scanning 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aStarchxbiosynthesisxgenetics. 2aStarch Synthasexgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aLi, Weihua.1 aLi, Cheng1 aGaudet, Denis A.1 aLaroche, André1 aCao, Lian-Pu1 aLu, Zhen-Xiang0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2010 July, v. 52, no. 7 p.602-615dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00961.x 7aarticle02434naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245008700168300001600255500002400271520148100295650001101776650001901787650002101806650001901827650000701846650001501853650000901868650001501877650001501892700001901907773011301926852000902039856004802048655001202096IND4442894120221122185008.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444289412DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-010-0325-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Paul N.

In an incubation experiment with five contrasting soils, lime and gypsum showed potential as source measures to decrease P loss risk, as assessed by water extractions. Soils were incubated with lime to achieve a target pH of 6.5 and with gypsum at equivalent Ca rates for 108 days. P was added (17 kg P ha⁻¹) as KH₂PO₄ in solution. Gypsum appears to have greater potential as a source measure, decreasing molybdate-reactive P (RP) solubility by 14-56% and organic P (OP) by 10-53% across all soils. RP and Ca may have precipitated or co-sorbed, and OP may have been stabilised in organic matter complexes due to the bridging effect of Ca and the flocculating effect of increased ionic strength. Greater effectiveness of gypsum may be due to its higher solubility and the fact that it increases Ca concentrations without increasing pH. Lime decreased RP solubility in two soils (by 4% and 20%) but increased solubility in two and had no effect in a third. The overall effect of lime may depend on several competing effects of raised pH and Ca concentration that may vary in importance depending on soil characteristics such as base cation and P status. For the highest P status soil, both lime and gypsum were effective, decreasing RP solubility by 4% and 15%, respectively. Targeted treatment of high P soils may be an effective and economical strategy to minimise P losses. 3agypsum 3aionic strength 3alosses from soil 3aorganic matter 3apH 3aphosphorus 3arisk 3asoil water 3asolubility1 aStevens, R.

Differentiation of olive floral buds during winter is strictly related to flowering during spring and finally to fruit production during autumn-winter. In order to determine which are the developmental events in differentiating olive floral buds we studied in four olive cultivars “Amfissis”, “Kalamon”, “Manzanillo” and “Chalkidikis” the anatomical progress of the ontogeny using median longitudinal sections of floral buds (cutting odd nodes), in weekly intervals from early February (initiation of differentiation) to mid-April (one week after floral bud burst) keeping the cultivars under the same environmental conditions. At the same time, we determined the changes in their water extractable proteins, as an index of the meristematic activity. At the beginning of differentiation, floral buds consisted of the apical and one pair of developed (odd) axillary meristems which were covered with the corresponding bracts. Floral buds showed a slow gradual enlargement in all cultivars. The sequence of the developmental events (initiation of intense mitotic activity in the apical and the first axillary meristems, initiation of mitotic activity in the second axillary meristem, development of the third pair of bracts (except from cv. Chalkidikis), appearance of mitotic activity in the third axillary meristem, swelling of apical and axillary meristems and appearance of primordial whorls) are presented comparatively. All cultivars showed similar ontogenetic trends but there were temporal differences in the initiation, the progress and the completion of the process. Cv. Amfissis initiated differentiation one week later compared to the other cultivars, also delaying the development of the second and the third axillary meristems. On the other hand, cvs. Kalamon and Chalkidikis delayed one week to complete the process when compared to cvs. Amfissis and Manzanillo. Changes in the water extractable protein concentrations seemed to show a pulse-like profile in all cultivars appearing in three periods, each one starting with relatively high levels of protein and tending to decrease gradually. These patterns are assumed to be related to a periodicity in the mitotic activity in floral buds. Cv. Chalkidikis appeared to have a lower level of protein concentration than “Amfissis”, “Kalamon” and “Manzanillo” and this was paralleled by lack of a third axillary meristem development in the floral buds of this cultivar. 3aOlea europaea 3aapical meristems 3abracts 3abuds 3acultivars 3adiet 3aenvironmental factors 3aflowering 3afruit trees 3afruiting 3aolive oil 3aolives 3aperiodicity 3aproteins 3aspring 3atemporal variation 3awater 3awinter1 aAndreadis, Evagelos1 aBouranis, Dimitris L.0 tFlora.g2010 Sept., v. 205, no. 9 p.599-607dG.

Hypotheses aiming to explain observed patterns of richness are numerous, and none is universal. In this study, we use tapeworm parasites of elasmobranch fishes to examine the phylogenetic and environmental influences on the variation in species richness for this specific system. Tapeworms are the most diverse group of helminths to infect elasmobranchs. Elasmobranchs are cosmopolitan in distribution and their tapeworm parasites are remarkably host specific; therefore, making this an ideal system in which to examine global patterns in species diversity. Here, we 1) quantify the tapeworm richness in elasmobranch fishes, 2) identify the host features correlated with tapeworm richness, and 3) determine whether tapeworm richness follows a latitudinal gradient. The individual and combined effects of host size, factors associated with water temperatures (influenced by latitude and depth), host habitat, and type of elasmobranch (shark or batoid) on measures of species diversity were assessed using general linear models. These analyses included tapeworm host records for 317 different elasmobranch species (124 species were included in our analyses) and were conducted with and without taking into account phylogenetic relationships between host species. Since sharks and batoids differ substantially in body form, analyses were repeated for each host subset. On average, batoids harboured significantly more tapeworm species than shark hosts. Tapeworm richness in sharks was influenced by median depth, whereas no predictor variable included in our models could adequately account for interspecific variation in tapeworm richness in batoid hosts. The taxonomic diversity of tapeworm assemblages of sharks and batoids was influenced by median depth and median latitude, respectively. When the influence of host phylogeny is accounted for, larger hosts harbour a greater tapeworm richness, whereas hosts exploiting wider latitudinal ranges harbour more taxonomically distinct tapeworm assemblages. Species richness and taxonomic diversity of tapeworm assemblages in elasmobranch fishes are influenced by different evolutionary pressures, including host phylogenetic relationships, space constraints and geographical area. Our results suggest that ca 3600 tapeworm species have yet to be described from elasmobranch fishes. 3ainterspecific variation 3alinear models 3ahosts 3aphylogeny 3atapeworms 3awater temperature 3alatitude 3aspecies diversity 3ahabitats 3asharks 0aspecies differences1 aPoulin, Robert0 tEcography.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 5 p.866-877dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0906-75907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2010.06169.x 7aarticle01426naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008000126300001800206520063800224650001700862650001200879650001800891650001700909653002100926700001500947700001400962773008000976852000901056930003301065945001301098946001301111655001201124IND2322080020221122005415.0010718e200012  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232208002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRolfe, L.A.14aThe effect of processing conditions on the quality of extruded catfish feed  ap. 1737-1743.  aA catfish feed was extruded to determine how particle size, moisture content, and screw speed effect the degree of starch gelatinization, water stability, and pellet durability.

Modeled predictions were acceptable for practical application. 3asurface irrigation 3aspatial variation 0ainfiltration1 aFekersillassie, D.1 aBoldt, A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2000 , v. 43, no. 6 p.1643-1649x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20010903b20010910c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle03655naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011700126300001800243500002300261520266000284650001102944650002602955650001802981650001402999650002003013650002203033650001003055650002303065650001503088651001103103653001603114773009703130852000903227930003303236945001303269946001103282655001203293IND2046129920221121235044.0950519e199408  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204612992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJobidon, R.10aLight threshold for optimal black spruce (Picea mariana) seedling growth and development under brush competition  ap. 1624-1635.  aSummary in French.  aLight threshold is suggested as a method for quantifying brush competition in black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) plantations and predicting losses in tree growth as measured by the relative growth rate (RGR). The severity of the competing vegetation (expressed in terms of density and height) around 300 planted tree seedlings, and the growth status of the seedlings (expressed in terms of total height and current height growth increment), were analyzed simultaneously with multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), with one level of light quantity (photosynthetically active radiation) reaching the upper one-half of the tree seedlings as the predictor variable. This study showed that it is possible to establish a competitive status based on light interception, thus allowing a grouping of seedlings with similar growth characteristics and severity of competition. Canonical analysis showed that 60% of full sunlight reaching the upper one half of spruce seedlings can be defined as a threshold to significantly discriminate between stressed and unstressed tree seedlings, based on the above-mentioned variables and also based on spruce basal stem diameter. For spruce total height, current height increment, and basal stem diameter, significant differences were found between plots above and below this threshold, averaging 18.5, 44.7, and 23.2%, respectively. Measuring the intensity of light reaching the upper one half of the spruce seedlings also significantly explains spruce relative growth rates, expressed in terms of height growth increment and basal stem diameter growth increment over the following two growing seasons. The light threshold used in the MANOVA and the ANOVA showed significant differences between plots above and below the threshold, averaging 70 and 58% for spruce height and basal stem diameter RGRs, respectively. Instead of measuring competing vegetation variables and relative height of a crop species to infer light interception, this study demonstrated that a direct measure of light attenuation at the tree seedling level can be used to assess the competitive status and predict losses in tree growth for the period of time required by the seedlings to emerge from the vegetation cover. Moreover, this study demonstrated that canonical relations, rather than linear relations, explain the pattern of competition for light between young spruce seedlings and brushlike vegetation. The light threshold suggested in this study has potential for assessing interspecific competition problems in young black spruce plantations and is proposed as a tool to support a containment strategy of vegetation management. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPicea mariana 3aseedlings 3aseedling growth 3aplant competition 3alight 3aforest plantations 3ashrublands 3aQuebec 0agrowth rate0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1994 Aug., v. 24, no. 8 p.1624-1635x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02242naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008400128300001800212500002300230520116200253650002901415650002801444650002501472650002301497650001401520650001901534650002301553650001701576650002201593700002401615700001601639700002001655700001701675773009801692852000901790930003301799945001301832946001101845655001201856IND2045979720221121235100.0950510e199412  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204597972DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLemcoff, J.H.10aOsmotic adjustment and its use as a selection criterion in Eucalyptus seedlings  ap. 2402-2408.  aSummary in French.  aOsmotic adjustment was studied in 6-month-old seedlings of Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh., Eucalyptus tereticornis Smith, Eucalyptus viminalis Labill., and Eucalyptus grandis Hill ex Maiden. Because osmotic adjustment is related to water-stress tolerance, it can be used as a selection criterion of material adapted to drought. Half of the individuals of each species were submitted gradually to water stress, while the rest were maintained in soil at field capacity. Twenty-five days later the effect of stress on the development of osmotic adjustment was analyzed. All species had adjusted osmotically. The lowest osmotic adjustment was observed in E. camaldulensis and E. grandis (14.1% and 15.2%, respectively). Eucalyptus viminalis and E. tereticornis had values of 32.3% and 41.9%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that species differ significantly in their extent of osmotic adjustment under drought stress, and that it is possible to use this inductive plant feature as one of the criteria to select, during early developmental stages, Eucalyptus genotypes adapted to drought-prone environments. Some phyloyenetic considerations are presented. 3aEucalyptus camaldulensis 3aEucalyptus tereticornis 3aEucalyptus viminalis 3aEucalyptus grandis 3aseedlings 3aosmoregulation 3aselection criteria 3awater stress 3adrought tolerance1 aGuarnaschelli, A.B.1 aGarau, A.M.1 aBAscialli, M.E.1 aGhersa, C.M.0 tCanadian journal of forest research =.g1994 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.2402-2408x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle03117naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001700236500002300253500001500276520199700291650001302288650001802301650002402319650002402343650001102367650001102378650003702389650002102426650001702447651001602464653002602480653001102506700001502517773012102532852000902653930003302662945001302695946001102708655001202719IND2045978020221121223748.0950510e199412  onc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204597802DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMullin, T.J.10aGenetic parameters and age-age correlations in a clonally replicated test of black spruce after 10 years  ap. 23302341.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-05  aHeight growth at 10 years from striking was assessed for clonally replicated full-sib black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) families tested at three locations in central Nova Scotia. Variance components were interpreted according to an additive-dominance-epistasis genetic model and used to derive comparative estimates of gain from various selection and deployment strategies. Field performance at 5 and 10 years was compared with that of the original ortets and families growing in a 25-week greenhouse study, by means of phenotypic and genetic correlation, and rank-change analyses. Between age 5 and 10, the additive portion of the total genetic variance for height decreased from 66 to 38%, while the dominance portion increased from less than 3 to 13%, and the epistatic portion from 31 to almost 49%. As a consequence, narrow-sense heritability estimates were lower at age 10 and gain estimates also decreased, particularly for those strategies that capture gain primarily from additive effects. Although correlations between field performance and early growth measurements were generally poor, the strongest were found at the half-sib level; full-sib correlations were somewhat weaker and those between clone means and early ortet performance were small and not statistically significant. The strongest age-age correlations were those that involved family mean seedling weight in the greenhouse. Family rankings based on early oven-dry biomass production also showed the most consistent agreement with ranking after 5 and 10 years of field testing, although the analyses suggest that effective early selection is probably limited to culling the worst 25% of the families based on biomass. Genotype-environment interactions were statistically significant, although these were limited to only 2% of the phenotypic variance in height growth; furthermore, strong genetic correlations between environments suggested that these interactions have little impact on selection efficiency. 3atree age 3aPicea mariana 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic correlation 3aheight 3aclones 3agenotype-environment interaction 3agenetic variance 3aheritability 3aNova Scotia 0aplant characteristics 0agrowth1 aPark, Y.S.0 tCanadian journal of forest research.g1994 Dec., v. 24, no. 12 p.23302341-23302341wJournal:jnl2003x0045-50677nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdJYB  aNon-US 7aarticle02852naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092024002200127024001900149040001800168100001600186245009900202300001800301506007600319520132700395506003701722650003601759650002601795650002501821650001401846650002001860650001401880650000901894650001701903650001001920650001101930650001001941650002601951650000901977653001901986653001502005653002302020700001602043700001802059773014302077852000902220856008502229930003302314946001102347655001202358IND4414427520221207113933.0090102e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441442752DNAL7 a10.1007/s00018-008-8587-z2doi7 aPMC27923352pmcid7 a190117512pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson, B.10aMedium- and short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase gene and protein familiesbThe MDR superfamily  ap. 3879-3894.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe MDR superfamily with ~350-residue subunits contains the classical liver alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), quinone reductase, leukotriene B4 dehydrogenase and many more forms. ADH is a dimeric zinc metalloprotein and occurs as five different classes in humans, resulting from gene duplications during vertebrate evolution, the first one traced to ~500 MYA (million years ago) from an ancestral formaldehyde dehydrogenase line. Like many duplications at that time, it correlates with enzymogenesis of new activities, contributing to conditions for emergence of vertebrate land life from osseous fish. The speed of changes correlates with function, as do differential evolutionary patterns in separate segments. Subsequent recognitions now define at least 40 human MDR members in the Uniprot database (corresponding to 25 genes when excluding close homologues), and in all species at least 10888 entries. Overall, variability is large, but like for many dehydrogenases, subdivided into constant and variable forms, corresponding to household and emerging enzyme activities, respectively. This review covers basic facts and describes eight large MDR families and nine smaller families. Combined, they have specific substrates in metabolic pathways, some with wide substrate specificity, and several with little known functions.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3abiochemical pathways 3adatabases 3aenzyme activity 3aevolution 3afish 3aformaldehyde 3agenes 3ahumans 3aliver 3asubstrate specificity 3azinc 0aDehydrogenases 0areductases 0aenzyme superfamily1 aHedlund, J.1 aJörnvall, H.0 tCellular and molecular life sciences.g2008 Dec., v. 65, no. 24 p.3879-3894dBasel : Birkhäuser-VerlagwJournal:jnl55291x1420-682X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00018-008-8587-z3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090105b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03408naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011900182300001600301520144400317650001301761650002801774650001001802650001201812650000901824650001801833650001401851650001201865650001701877650002001894650001801914650002901932650001001961650001001971650001801981650001201999650003402011650003402045650002202079650001102101650002402112650002402136650000902160650002102169650002902190650002202219651001402241651001102255651001002266651001602276651001702292651001002309653001902319653002902338653001902367700001702386700001802403700002202421773012902443852000902572856008502581930003302666946001102699655001202710IND4414396720221121170336.0090102e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441439672DNAL7 a191150892pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-008-9172-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMenjo, D.

This study evaluated age at first calving (AFC), survival to age at first calving, and survival to four years of age using survival analyses techniques, in Holstein-Friesian cattle on four dairy farms in Kenya. The heritability estimate obtained for AFC was 0.15 ± 0.06 for an average AFC of 1058 days. Animals sired by New Zealand and Australian born bulls had the earliest average AFC (907 days). On average, 25% of all the heifers born were culled prior to attaining a first calving, while 34% were culled prior to four years of age. Though the highest proportion of losses was due to unspecified reasons, the relative risk of being culled was highest when an animal had a specific disease, and the first 60 days of life were the most critical for survival. Daughters of sires from South-Africa and Israel tended to have better survival rates than those sired by bulls originating from other regions. Unfavourable selection towards animals sired by Kenyan born bulls was evident. The economic implications of the high rate of early mortality need to be evaluated in order to assist livestock producers make informed decisions on choice of sires for breeding. 3aHolstein 3aartificial insemination 3abulls 3acalving 3acows 3adairy farming 3adaughters 3aheifers 3aheritability 3amilk production 3arelative risk 3areproductive performance 3asemen 3asires 3asurvival rate 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aCattlexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aDairyingxmethods 2aFemale 2aFertilityxgenetics 2aLactationxgenetics 2aMale 2aMilkxsecretion. 2aReproductionxphysiology 2aSurvival Analysis 3aAustralia 3aIsrael 3aKenya 3aNew Zealand 3aSouth Africa 0aKenya 0aEarly survival 0aHolstein-Friesian cattle 0aImported semen1 aBebe, B.

T.gondii is a major zoonotic agent which infects up to one-third of the world population. Toxoplasmosis in neonates and immunocompromised patients can lead to severe disease and death. A cross- sectional parasitological and serological survey with latex agglutination test (LAT) to detect anti-T. gondii antibodies was conducted on 100 serum samples collected from stray cats in five urban areas of Sari, Northern Iran, from April to November 2004. Classification by age, sex, weight, season and region was made. Results analyzed according to specific variables. The overall prevalence of T. gondii IgG antibodies (LAT titre >=1:1) were found in 40 of 100(40%) of stray cats, with regional variations. Overall 16 of 100(16%) of stray cats had diagnostically significant antibody titres (LAT >= 1:64). Prevalence was significantly higher in adult cats (1.5-3.0 kg, 54.5% of 66) than in juvenile cats and kittens (<=1.4 kg, 11.8% of 34) and higher in female stray cats (44.4% of 72) than in male stray cats (28.6% of 28). Toxoplasma seroprevalence was highest in the season of spring (22.4%). There was a significant difference in the prevalence of infection relative to host age and weight (P < 0.05). No significant difference was found between the prevalence of infection relative to host gender, urban sites and season (P > 0.05). Prevalence of T. gondii oocyst was also analyzed by a routine coprological method in 100 cats. T. gondii oocysts were not found in any faecal samples analyzed. Only 2 out of 100 smear preparations of intestinal mucosa showed trophozoites of T. gondii. 3aToxoplasma gondii 3acats 3aIran 0aLAT1 aDaryani, Ahmad1 aNasrolahei, Mohtaram1 aZiapour, Seyyed Peyman0 tTropical animal health and production.g2009 Feb., v. 41, no. 2 p.183-187dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0049-47477nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-008-9173-y3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02928naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001600162245015500178300001600333520138100349650002701730650001901757650001001776650002301786650001301809650002001822650001001842650001101852650001001863650001201873650003301885650002501918650003401943650001301977650001101990650001702001650000902018650002402027650004202051651001502093651001502108653001902123700001802142773008602160852000902246856008402255930003302339945001302372946001302385655001202398IND2195966820221121033401.0981214e199805  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219596682DNAL7 a96155412pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.3.2392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGerry, A.C.10aResponse of male Culicoides variipennis sonorensis (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) to carbon dioxide and observations of mating behavior on and near cattle  ap. 239-244.  aThe response of male Culicoides variipennis sonorensis Wirth & Jones to carbon dioxide (CO2) was examined at a dairy in the Chino Basin of southern California. Males were collected using CDC-type suction traps (no light) during 6 evenings in September and October 1995 when C. v. sonorensis were abundant. Traps were baited with 1.8 kg of dry ice, 200-350 nulliparous females, or nothing. Greater than 8 times as many males were captured in CO2-baited suction traps than in either female-baited or unbaited traps. Female-baited and unbaited traps did not differ in the number of males captured. Observations of mating behavior near and on a host calf were made at a nearby dairy. Males swarmed 1-2 m downwind (east) of a restrained calf and 0.3-1.0 m above ground level. Males were also observed coupled with blood-feeding females on the calf venter (especially umbilicus and teats). Virgin female C. v. sonorensis were captured in CO2-baited suction traps and by aspiration while they were engorging on the venter of a tethered calf. There appear to be at least two mating strategies in this species: mating presumably may occur near hosts in male swarms as well as stenogamously on the venter of the host. These mating strategies may serve as prezygotic reproductive isolating mechanisms between closely related and sometimes sympatric members of the C. variipennis complex. 3aCulicoides variipennis 3acarbon dioxide 3abaits 3ainsect attractants 3aswarming 3amating behavior 3ahosts 3acattle 3amales 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Dioxidexpharmacology 2aCattlexparasitology 2aCeratopogonidaexdrug effects 2aDairying 2aFemale 2aInsemination 2aMale 2aSex Characteristics 2aSexual Behavior, Animalxdrug effects 3aCalifornia 0aCalifornia 0aon-host mating1 aMullens, B.A.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 May, v. 35, no. 3 p.239-244x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.3.2393Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02987naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072000900110072000900119072000900128100001500137245009400152300001600246500002400262520168600286650001801972650002301990650002202013650002602035650000902061650002602070650002702096650001302123650001602136651001402152651001602166653001302182653001702195700001802212700001602230700001602246773009602262852000902358856009302367930003302460945001302493946001102506655001202517IND2330695320221121033404.0030131e200105  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233069532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0aK200 0aF300 0aK0011 aTurner, J.10aSite variation in Pinus radiata plantations and implications for site specific management  ap. 249-282.  aIncludes references  a685,000 ha of Pinus radiata (D. Don) plantations in Australia were categorized using a matrix of mean annual rainfall, rainfall regime and Parent Rock Code from a Technical Soil Classification. Data were obtained from a number of different organizations which in total managed nearly all the Australian P. radiata plantations. The selected characteristics were those which could be obtained at an acceptable level of confidence from all sources. Such a characterization of plantation sites provided a system for utilization of technical information and extrapolation of research results and also a basis for the development of Site Specific Management systems. Analysis of the information indicated the high degree of variability of environments in which plantations have been established within Australia and also the distinctive nature of individual regions. Such differences between areas make extension of silvicultural and related information difficult from one area to another without appropriate validation. A broad comparison with 1.26 million hectares of P. radiata plantations in New Zealand indicated only a small overlap of areas of site types between Australia and New Zealand. Assumptions derived in one location on the sites, characteristics, models and/or genotypes would require significant testing before confident application could be undertaken to another area. The value of a Site Specific Management system for research planning and application of research and operational results was demonstrated from analysis of a series of experimental trials assessing application of fertilizer after thinning and from evaluation of soil carbon in P. radiata plantations. 3aPinus radiata 3aforest plantations 3aspatial variation 3aprecision agriculture 3arain 3asoil parent materials 3ageographical variation 3aresearch 3afertilizers 3aAustralia 3aNew Zealand 0athinning 0asite factors1 aLambert, M.J.1 aHopmans, P.1 aMcGrath, J.0 tNew forests.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 3 p.249-282dKluwer Academic Publishersx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0169-4286/contents3Available from publisher's Web site  a20110816b20110902c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01984naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245011700123300001400240500002400254500001500278520091200293650002401205650002401229650002501253651001101278653002201289653001101311653001801322773016301340852000901503856007701512930003301589945001301622946001101635655001201646IND2330695820221121033338.0030131e200104  ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233069582DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXy, C.Y.10aStatistical analysis of parameters and residuals of a conceptual water balance model--methodology and case study  ap. 75-92.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aStatistical analysis of parameters and residuals of conceptual hydrological models has received little effort in the hydrological research, certainly by orders of magnitude less than on many other problems like development and comparison of automatic calibration methods, optimisation algorithms, etc. Much more work is required than is presently undertaken to investigate the properties of model residuals. There is a need of an easily understandable and applicable statistical analysis scheme. In this article, a procedure is presented through which two basic issues of model evaluation are accounted for. First, different techniques used for parameter analysis are discussed. Second, methodology of residual analysis is discussed and the general behaviours of residuals are examined. To illustrate the procedure, a simple water balance model was applied to the Stabbybacken River Basin in central Sweden. 3amathematical models 3awatershed hydrology 3astatistical analysis 3aSweden 0aconceptual models 0amodels 0awater balance0 tWater resources management.g2001 Apr., v. 15, no. 2 p.75-92dKluwer Academic PublishersaWater resources management (Dordrecht, Netherlands)x0920-47417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0920-4741/contents3electronic resource  a20030401b20030408c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02754naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245009100131300001600222520163300238650001301871650001901884650001201903650001101915650001201926650001101938650001801949650003601967650002202003650002102025650002502046650001502071651001202086700002002098700001802118700002002136700001602156773009402172852000902266930003302275945001302308946001102321655001202332IND2334651820221121033334.0031120e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233465182DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoreheier, P.V.10aUtilization of nitrogen- and mineral-rich vascular forage plants by reindeer in winter  ap. 151-160.  aThe marginal winter pastures of reindeer and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in Arctic and sub-Arctic areas are assumed to be nitrogen- and mineral-poor. Reindeer eat a mixed diet consisting of nitrogen-deficient lichens and a wide variety of vascular plants in winter. Some reindeer populations manage to maintain carcass mass outside the growing season and very little is known about the ability of reindeer to utilize vascular plants in this season. The chemical composition and in vitro digestibility of 17 species of vascular forage plants and one species of moss collected mid-winter from beneath the snow at an inland winter pasture in northern Norway were determined. Wintergreen parts of graminoids had a high content of crude protein (0.072-0.108 g/kg dry matter (DM)) and water-soluble carbohydrates (0.098-0.167 g/kg DM) and were highly digestible (50-65% IVDMD) compared with the withered parts of the plants (27-53% IVDMD). The digestibility of both shrubs and graminoids was inversely related to content of cellulose and lignin, but positively correlated with increasing contents of water-soluble carbohydrates. Shrubs were relatively calcium-rich (3.6-6.1 g/kg DM) while wintergreen graminoids contained up to 10.0 g/kg DM of potassium, 1.5 g/kg DM magnesium and 2.1 g/kg DM phosphorus. The present study demonstrates that the wintergreen parts of several species of vascular plants are nutritious, containing high levels of nitrogen and minerals, and that they are highly digestible to reindeer in winter. Vascular plants may, therefore, be more important to reindeer and caribou in winter than previously realized. 3areindeer 3aanimal feeding 3agrazing 3aforage 3aPoaceae 3ashrubs 3adigestibility 3achemical constituents of plants 3aforage evaluation 3anitrogen content 3anutrient utilization 3acold zones 3aFinland1 aMathiesen, S.D.1 aTyler, N.J.C.1 aSchjelderup, I.1 aOlsen, M.A.0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2002 Sept., v. 139, no. pt.2 p.151-160x0021-85967nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02657naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245009400144300001600238520112700254650001401381650002301395650001601418650002301434650001901457650000901476650002401485650001201509650003301521650003201554650002801586650002601614650002201640650000901662650005801671650002301729650002501752650001801777650003601795650000901831650002501840650002401865653001101889653001901900700001301919700001701932773012301949852000902072939003302081946001302114655001202127IND9301776220221121033347.0930325e199301  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND930177622DNAL7 a84240902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, C.D.10aManganese metabolism in rats: an improved methodology for assessing gut endogenous losses  ap. 103-108.  aManganese homeostasis is believed to be maintained by excretion of excess absorbed manganese through the gut, but the extent of endogenous gut losses of manganese has not been quantitated. We developed a model with rats to quantitate endogenous gut losses of manganese in which the parenterally administered isotope was distributed like fed isotope. Intraportally injected 54Mn complexed to albumin distributed in tissues like the fed isotope, but carrier-free 54Mn injected intraperitoneally, intravenously, or intraportally, or 54Mn complexed to transferrin and injected intraportally did not. Thus, manganese appears to be complexed to albumin or an albumin-like protein when it leaves the intestine. A mathematical model of manganese metabolism in rats fed 54Mn was developed using the SAAM and CONSAM computer programs. It was determined that the liver, not the pancreas, was the major source of endogenous gut losses of manganese. Young, growing rats fed 45 micrograms of Mn/g diet were calculated to absorb 8.2% of their manganese intake and then to lose 37% of the absorbed manganese through gut endogenous losses. 3amanganese 3amineral metabolism 3ahomeostasis 3anutrient transport 3aanimal tissues 3arats 3amathematical models 2aAnimals 2aDigestive Systemxmetabolism 2aInjections, Intraperitoneal 2aInjections, Intravenous 2aIntestinal Absorption 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aManganesexadministration & dosagexpharmacokinetics. 2aModels, Biological 2aPancreasxmetabolism 2aPortal System 2aRadioisotope Dilution Technique 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aTissue Distribution 0alosses 0amineral excess1 aZech, L.1 aGreger, J.L.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1993 Jan., v. 202, no. 1 p.103-108x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01540naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245010000129300001300229520073400242650002600976650001301002650001301015650002201028653001501050653001401065700001601079773007501095852000901170930003301179945001301212946001301225655001201238IND2326746320221121002509.0020426e200101  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSidahmed, M.M.10aSimulation of spray dispersal and deposition from a forestry airblast sprayer.

The simulation was compared to turbulent jet theory and validated with data collected from a small centrifugal fan and a commercial forestry airblast sprayer. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) schemes were employed. The measured axial and transverse velocity profiles agreed well with the 3D free jet models from FLUENT and turbulent jet theory. However, FLUENT was superior to turbulent jet theory in predicting asymmetric velocity profiles. The 2D approximations of a round jet using FLUENT and turbulent jet theory were not satisfactory. 3aair-assisted sprayers 3aspraying 3aair flow 3asimulation models 0adeposition 0adispersal1 aBrown, R.B.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2001 , v. 44, no. 1 p.5-10x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02470naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245010400126300001400230520159900244650001601843650001301859650001401872650002301886650002201909650001301931650002101944700001701965700001801982773007602000852000902076930003302085945001302118946001302131655001202144IND2326746720221121002416.0020426e200101  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232674672DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrift, T.E.10aMass flow measurement of granular materials in aerial application. 2. Experimental model validation  ap. 27-34.  aA system was developed to measure the mass flow of granular fertilizer material in aerial spreader ducts. The flow process was regarded as the sequential passage of clusters containing multiple particles with varying diameters. An optical sensor was used to measure the cluster lengths on the fly. In a low-density flow regime, the diameter of each particle could be measured individually (this is called the "single-particle approach"). After conversion to a volume of a sphere and multiplication by the true material density, the mass flow could be computed. In a high-density mass flow regime (called the "mass flow approach"), particles form clusters, and cluster lengths would be measured instead of particle diameters. The first step in performing mass flow measurement was to develop a reconstruction algorithm that estimates the number of particles in a cluster from the measured cluster length. This algorithm, called the Exponential Estimator, was developed using simulation and is reported in Part 1. This article, Part 2, describes the use of the mass flow sensor as well as the reconstruction algorithm to assess the accuracy of the complete system. Tests were carried out under laboratory conditions, using mass flows of spherical particles as well as urea fertilizer under varying flow velocities and densities. The mass flow of identical spherical particles of 4.45 mm diameter was measured with an accuracy of 3%, even under high-density flow conditions. For granular fertilizer, the flow was measured with an accuracy of 2% for high-density flows and 4% for low-density flows. 3afertilizers 3agranules 3amass flow 3aaerial application 3asimulation models 3aaccuracy 3acluster analysis1 aWalker, J.T.1 aHofstee, J.W.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2001 , v. 44, no. 1 p.27-34x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01995naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014600129300001600275520118500291650000901476653002401485653002801509653001801537700001601555773007801571852000901649930003301658945001301691946001301704655001201717IND2321105420221120215637.0010518e200005  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232110542DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMontross, M.D.10aSimulated performance of conventional high-temperature drying, dryeration, and combination drying of shelled corn with automatic conditioning  ap. 691-699.  aCombination drying, based on computer simulation, was evaluated as an alternative drying technique to traditional high-temperature drying and dryeration. Simulation models of high-temperature crossflow drying and in-bin drying and conditioning were used to evaluate the performance of conventional crossflow drying and full-heat crossflow drying followed by dryeration or natural-air drying for Indianapolis, Indiana, and Des Moines, Iowa. Energy costs from propane, electricity, moisture shrink below the market moisture content, and dry matter loss were estimated to find the total average drying cost over 29 years. Dryeration and combination drying reduced the total drying cost by approximately 10% compared to conventional drying and cooling within the dryer at current economic conditions. The greatest benefit was an increase of 72 and 159% in drying capacity when dryeration and combination drying were used instead of conventional drying and cooling within the dryer, respectively. However, the economic return of combination drying could be improved by the development of natural-air drying techniques or controllers that would limit the predicted moisture shrink loss. 3acorn 0acomputer simulation 0ahigh temperature drying 0ashelled maize1 aMaier, D.E.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2000 , v. 43, no. 3 p.691-699x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01789naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001200162245015300174300001600327500001500343520051800358650002100876650001200897650001400909650002700923650001600950650001200966650002800978650005501006651001301061651001301074653001301087700001401100700001401114773008701128852000901215856008401224930003301308945001301341946001301354655001201367IND2163774120221120211456.0980901e199711  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216377412DNAL7 a94391122pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/34.6.5992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLux, E.10aDamalinia (Tricholipeurus) zaganseeri, n. sp.

The nests were divided into 4 groups: nests without eggs, nests with eggs, nests with nestlings, and nests just after fledging. The average percentage of infested nests increased from the nests without eggs to the nests after fledging (at 20% in both years of investigation), and the increase of mite abundance was exponential. Presence of nestlings in the nests stimulated intensive reproduction of parasitic mites. An increasing infestation intensity in nests was observed during the host breeding period. The 2 mite species exhibited similar age structure patterns in the nests of all the groups and during the entire penduline tit breeding period as well. A decrease in the proportion of adult mites (mainly females) and an increase of nymphs (above all of protonymphs) occurred at the time of fledging and at the end of host breeding period. The percentage of the ovigerous females increased in the individual nests, but decreased during the breeding period of penduline tit. The quantitative parameters of D. hirundinis populations in the highly infested nests depended on the individual nidification and nidobiology of the host, whereas the qualitative parameters (age structure) of these populations depended more on abiotic factors and life strategy of the ectoparasite. 3aOrnithonyssus sylviarum 3awild birds 3aage structure 3atemporal variation 3ahost-parasite relationships 3anesting 3abreeding season 2aAnimals 2aBird Diseasesxparasitology 2aBirdsxparasitology 2aBreeding 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMite Infestationsxparasitologyxveterinary. 2aMitesxphysiology 0ainfestation 0abirds' nests 0adermanyssus hirundinis 0aremiz pendulinus0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1997 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.609-614x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/34.6.6093Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02599naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001500162245010400177300001600281500001500297520126800312650002201580650001101602650001101613650001801624650000901642650001801651650001001669650001201679650003201691650001101723650001101734650002201745650000901767653000901776653001701785653001501802653001301817700002001830700001601850773008701866852000901953856008401962930003302046945001302079946001302092655001202105IND2163776220221120211616.0980901e199711  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216377622DNAL7 a94391162pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/34.6.6242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChou, J.T.10aEvaluation of commercial insect repellents on human skin against Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae)  ap. 624-630.  a2019-12-04  aAn olfactometer was used to evaluate the efficacy of selected commercial insect repellent products against Aedes aegypti (L.). A comparison of 12 commercial repellent products was made on human skin. The products tested included 2 natural oil insect repellent formulations (Buzz Away and Green Ban) containing plant extracts, 2 proprietary products (Skin-So-Soft lotion and bath oil), and 8 commercial deet preparations in various concentrations and forms of spray, aerosol, stick, cream, and lotion. Behavioral responses and time to probe were determined in triplicate using 10 female mosquito challenges per replicate for each product. Generally, products with higher concentrations of deet were found to have longer repellence times. OFF spray and Muskol lotion offered the longest repellence times. However, there was no significant difference in time for mosquitoes to probe among the formulations. Skin-So-Soft lotion and bath oil were not as effective as deet in repelling Ae. aegypti. Natural oil insect repellent formulations offered essentially no repellency against Ae. aegypti. This is a simple and reproducible method to evaluate the efficacy of insect repellents and is recommended for preliminary screening of new insect repellents or formulations. 3ainsect repellents 3ahumans 3adosage 3aAedes aegypti 3adeet 3aolfactometers 2aAedes 2aAnimals 2aEvaluation Studies as Topic 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aInsect Repellents 2aSkin 0askin 0aformulations 0arepellency 0aefficacy1 aRossignol, P.A.1 aAyres, J.W.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1997 Nov., v. 34, no. 6 p.624-630x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/34.6.6243Available from publisher's Web site  a19981001b19981008c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02208naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001700162245009900179300001600278520079500294650001401089650001901103650001601122650001701138650002001155650002401175650002201199650001201221650002601233650002101259650001101280650000901291650002301300650002801323653001701351653002601368653002601394653001901420700001901439700001701458773008701475852000901562856008401571930003301655945001301688946001301701655001201714IND2163778820221120211650.0980901e199711  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND216377882DNAL7 a94391182pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/34.6.6442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnyabe, D.Y.10aFeeding and mating strategies in anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae): theoretical modeling approach  ap. 644-650.  aThe effects of various ecological factors, such as the probability of finding mates and hosts and of successfully obtaining a blood meal, on the mating and feeding strategies of domestic female anopheline mosquitoes was investigated using theoretical models.

The aim of this experiment was to identify the role of water level and nutrient availability on plant zonation in the plain. Growth and root morphology of three perennial emergent macrophyte species were investigated by growing in two water levels (0.1 and 10.0 cm, relative to soil surface) and in two levels of nutrient supply (0 and 0.5 g slow-release fertilizer per container). In the plain, Carex lasiocarpa typically occurs at low elevations, Glyceria spiculosa at medial elevations, and Deyeuxia angustifolia at high elevations. The relative growth rate was the highest in C. lasiocarpa and the lowest in D. angustifolia in the 10.0-cm water level. Among the three species, only total biomass of D. angustifolia was affected by water level, and decreased with increasing water level. High nutrient supply led to increased total biomass in C. lasiocarpa and G. spiculosa. High water level led to an increased root diameter in G. spiculosa and a decreased root length in C. lasiocarpa. In the 10.0-cm water level, low nutrient supply led to thinner roots in D. angustifolia, but resulted in an increased specific root length (SRL) in C. lasiocarpa and root diameter in G. spiculosa. Water-level effect on root porosity was only observed in G. spiculosa, and nutrient amendment did not influence root porosity in all the species. These data indicate that both nutrient and water level are important factors regulating plant distribution pattern in the Sanjiang Plain, because both C. lasiocarpa and G. spiculosa are relatively sensitive to nutrient supply whereas D. angustifolia is sensitive to water level. 3aCalamagrostis 3aCarex lasiocarpa 3aGlyceria 3abiomass 3acontainers 3amarshes 3anutrient availability 3anutrient content 3aporosity 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aslow-release fertilizers 3aChina1 aXie, Yonghong0 tHydrobiologia.g2009 May, v. 624, no. 1 p.151-160dSpringer Netherlandsx0018-81587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10750-008-9689-1 7aarticle03003naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009000127300001600217520184700233650001102080650001802091650002102109650002002130650002202150650001302172650002002185650002302205650002102228650002502249650001502274650002602289650002002315650001502335650002102350700001702371700001802388700001702406773007802423852000902501930003302510945001302543946001302556655001202569IND2326753120221120202314.0020426e200103  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232675312DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, B.L.10aResponse of seven crops and two soils to application of beef cattle feedyard effluent  ap. 309-315.  aA greenhouse experiment was conducted to evaluate yield and nutrient uptake following land application of beef cattle feedyard effluent. Effluent from a large commercial feedyard was applied to seven crops planted in 210 pots containing Pullman clay loam (PCL) or Amarillo fine sandy loam (AFSL). The crops evaluated were forage sorghum, wheat, corn silage, alfalfa, bromegrass, bermudagrass, and Jose tall wheatgrass. Each crop and soil type received five effluent application treatments representing 0%, 25%, 50%, 100%, and 200% of the annual crop nitrogen requirement and about 0%, 20%, 40%, 80%, and 160% of the annual crop phosphorus requirement over the growing period, which ranged from 4 to 12 months. Dry matter yield increased with increasing application rates for all crops except alfalfa in the AFSL, with minimal differences in dry matter yield for the PCL. For the PCL, all crops except corn silage had foliage crude protein concentrations equal to or greater than published values. For the AFSL, forage sorghum, wheat, and corn silage had foliage crude protein concentrations less than typical. In the PCL at the highest application rate, phosphorus uptake rates in the foliage were wheat (16 kg/ha), alfalfa (36 kg/ha), bromegrass (41 kg/ha), Jose tall wheatgrass (37 kg/ha), forage sorghum (47 kg/ha), corn silage (57 kg/ha), and bermudagrass (112 kg/ha). In the AFSL at the highest application rate, phosphorus uptake rates in the foliage were wheat (10 kg/ha), bromegrass (12 kg/ha), alfalfa (17 kg/ha), forage sorghum (17 kg/ha), Jose tall wheatgrass (20 kg/ha), corn silage (22 kg/ha), and bermudagrass (41 kg/ha). Soil characteristics including electrical conductivity and sodium were generally higher after application of effluent for both soil types, although the changes were more pronounced in the AFSL than the PCL. 3acattle 3acattle manure 3aland application 3aSorghum bicolor 3aTriticum aestivum 3aZea mays 3aMedicago sativa 3aBromus catharticus 3aCynodon dactylon 3aThinopyrum elongatum 3aloam soils 3anutrient requirements 3anutrient uptake 3acrop yield 3aapplication rate1 aParker, D.B.1 aSweeten, J.M.1 aRobinson, C.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2001 , v. 44, no. 2 p.309-315x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20020602b20020610c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01380naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245005700127300001600184520056100200650001900761650001600780650002000796650001500816650000900831650002000840700001700860700001400877700001700891773007800908852000900986930003300995945001301028946001301041655001201054IND2326754520221120202315.0020426e200103  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232675452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCasasent, D.10aDetection and segmentation of items in X-ray imagery  ap. 337-345.  aProcessing of real-time X-ray images of randomly oriented and touching pistachio nuts for product inspection is considered.

Cows were treated about 1 wk prepartum, and serial blood and milk samples were taken from these and similar prepartum control cows over a 3-wk period. Plasma growth hormone concentrations in the bST-treated group reached a peak 2 d after administration and then declined linearly to control concentrations over a 14-d period. Plasma Ca was unaffected by bST treatment 1 d prior to parturition, on the day of parturition, and at 1 and 6 to 9 d postpartum. Plasma P was higher, and plasma Mg was lower, in the bST-treated group on the day of parturition and 1 d postpartum. Concentrations of Ca, P, Mg, and protein in milk were lower in bST-treated cows than in controls at parturition. Milk production of the bST-treated and control groups was similar when measured at d 6 to 9 postpartum. Concentrations of parathyroid hormone-related protein in milk were substantial at parturition and remained high thereafter, although at parturition the concentration in the milk of the bST-treated group was lower than that of the control group. 3adairy cows 3aproteins 3ahormone secretion 3asomatotropin 3acalcium 3amilk composition 3acalving 3amagnesium 3aparathyroid hormone 3ablood plasma 3aphosphorus 3amilk fever 2aAnimals 2aCalciumxbloodxmetabolism. 2aCattlexmetabolism 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexbloodxpharmacology. 2aLabor, Obstetric 2aMagnesiumxbloodxmetabolism. 2aMilkxmetabolism 2aMineralsxbloodxmetabolism. 2aParathyroid Hormone-Related Protein 2aPhosphorusxbloodxmetabolism. 2aPregnancy 2aProteinsxmetabolism 0ahypocalcemia 0acontrolled release1 aLeaver, D.D.1 aMartin, T.J.1 aSelleck, K.1 aClarke, I.J.1 aMoate, P.J.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 Aug., v. 77, no. 8 p.2242-2248x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03199naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245012100146300001800267500001500285520137000300650001501670650002201685650002601707650002001733650001801753650001901771650001701790650001801807650002101825650001901846650001401865650002001879650002301899650001201922650001101934650003201945650001101977650005901988650002902047650002802076650004102104650005002145650001902195650006502214650004502279653002202324653002302346653001102369700001602380700001702396700002002413773008402433852000902517930003302526945001302559946001302572655001202585IND2042823420221120184427.0941025e199408  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204282342DNAL7 a79628482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcClary, D.G.14aThe effects of a sustained-release recombinant bovine somatotropin (somidobove) on udder health for a full lactation  ap. 2261-2271.  a2019-12-05  aThe lactational effect of somidobove (recombinant bST) injections on dairy cows in a full lactation was measured in 193 primiparous and 159 multiparous Holsteins. Experimental animals, distributed across six study sites, were administered a sustained-release formulation of somidobove by subcutaneous injection every 28 d beginning 36 to 49 DIM. Randomization at each site determined which of the following somidobove treatments cows received: 0 mg (control), 160 mg (primiparous only), 320 mg, 640 mg, or 960 mg (multiparous only). In addition to lactation response, cows on study were monitored for mastitis. Clinical mastitis was detected by examination of quarter foremilk at each milking. Milk from 300 of 352 cows was monitored for new IMI by routine collection and culture of duplicate quarter milk samples. Somatic cell counts were conducted on individual composite milk samples collected weekly throughout the experiment. No evidence existed of an association between somidobove administration and the incidence or duration of clinical mastitis. Furthermore, somidobove administration was not associated with an increase in new IMI or prevalence of infection by common mastitis pathogens or pathogen groups. Somatic cell counts were low in all treatment groups, but a dose-related trend was found for increased SCC in both primiparous and multiparous cows. 3adairy cows 3acoliform bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3alactation stage 3adose response 3audder quarters 3asomatotropin 3aStreptococcus 3alactation number 3amammary glands 3aincidence 3abovine mastitis 3asomatic cell count 2aAnimals 2aCattle 2aDelayed-Action Preparations 2aFemale 2aGrowth Hormonexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aInjections, Subcutaneous 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aMammary Glands, Animalxdrug effects 2aMastitis, Bovinexepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aMilkxcytology 2aRecombinant Proteinsxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aStaphylococcusxisolation & purification 0alatent infections 0acontrolled release 0audders1 aGreen, H.B.1 aBasson, R.P.1 aNickerson, S.C.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 Aug., v. 77, no. 8 p.2261-2271x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02537naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245012400126300001800250500001500268520146900283650001501752650002501767650001601792650002801808650001501836650002601851650002301877650001101900653001901911653001601930700001801946700002001964700001501984773008401999852000902083930003302092945001302125946001302138655001202151IND2042824420221120175302.0941025e199408  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204282442DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPantoja, J.10aEffects of fat saturation and source of fiber on site of nutrient digestion and milk production by lactating dairy cows  ap. 2341-2356.  a2019-12-05  aSix primiparous cannulated cows were assigned to six treatments in a 6 X 6 Latin square design to evaluate the effects of degree of fat saturation and amount and source of effective fiber on site of nutrient digestion and milk production. Cows were fed for ad libitum intake a control diet with no added fat or diets with 5% added fat from saturated tallow, tallow, or animal-vegetable fat; the diets with animal-vegetable fat had 40% forage, 40% forage plus 20% soyhulls, or 60% forage. Ruminal acetate:propionate was higher when soyhulls replaced forage NDF because of the higher digestibility of soyhulls in the rumen and total tract. Ruminal digestion of NDF was decreased as unsaturation of fat increased. True and apparent efficiencies of bacterial protein synthesis were increased as fat unsaturation increased, probably because of reduced recycling of microbial N in the rumen. The digestibility of fatty acids in the small intestine was higher in cows fed no fat than in those fed fat and was reduced as fat unsaturation decreased, primarily because of the saturated tallow. Dry matter intake was decreased 14% by increased fat unsaturation. All fat supplements depressed milk protein percentage. Production of 4% FCM tended to decrease linearly as unsaturation of fat increased. In diets with 5% added fat, a degree of saturation between saturated tallow and tallow (iodine values of 18 and 62) appears to be optimum for fatty acid digestibility and DMI. 3adairy cows 3avolatile fatty acids 3adietary fat 3aunsaturated fatty acids 3aplant fats 3asaturated fatty acids 3aad libitum feeding 3atallow 0arumen contents 0afatty acids1 aFirkins, J.L.1 aEastridge, M.L.1 aHull, B.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 Aug., v. 77, no. 8 p.2341-2356x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle03205naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010800146300001800254500001500272520166800287650001501955650001401970650001801984650001702002650001602019650002602035650002402061650001802085650002802103650001502131650001102146650001602157650001202173650002302185650001402208650001102222650000902233650004002242650001102282650001802293650001102311650002602322650001602348650002402364650003602388653001602424653001502440700002002455773008402475852000902559930003302568945001302601946001302614655001202627IND2042824620221120175222.0941025e199408  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204282462DNAL7 a79628572pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFirkins, J.L.10aAssessment of the effects of iodine value on fatty acid digestibility, feed intake, and milk production  ap. 2357-2366.  a2019-12-05  aData were pooled from 11 studies evaluating supplemental fat sources differing primarily in degree of saturation (tallow, animal-vegetable fat, vegetable oil, and hydrogenated fats). Data were standardized as proportions of the respective controls to reduce variation among individual studies and were subjected to stepwise multiple regression against the iodine value of fats, the percentage increases of total fatty acids in diets above the respective controls, or the ratio of total C(16) to C(18) fatty acids in fats (only for hydrogenated fats). Increased iodine value (increasing unsaturation) of fats increased apparent fatty acid digestibility, especially as iodine value increased from 11 to 27. For partially hydrogenated fat sources, as the ratio of C(16) to C(18) fatty acids increased, digestibility also increased, especially with increasing iodine value (positive interaction). Beneficial effects of higher C(16):C(18) ratio were reduced as amount of added fat increased (negative interaction). Dry matter intake and FCM production decreased as iodine value increased, perhaps because of inhibition of fiber digestion or metabolic regulation of DMI. Milk protein percentage depression averaged .2 percentage units for most fats. However, as partially hydrogenated fat sources became more saturated, milk protein depression appeared to be less evident; increased ratio of C(16):C(18) of fatty acids appeared to increase milk protein percentage. Despite the lower apparent digestibility of fatty acids of hydrogenated fats, increased milk production and percentages of fat and protein appeared to make them more economical than more unsaturated fats. 3adairy cows 3apalm oils 3aprofitability 3aiodine value 3afeed intake 3asaturated fatty acids 3amilk fat percentage 3adigestibility 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3atallow 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aFats 2aFatty Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aFemale 2aHydrogenation 2aIodine 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMathematics 2aRegression Analysis 2aStructure-Activity Relationship 0afatty acids 0adry matter1 aEastridge, M.L.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 Aug., v. 77, no. 8 p.2357-2366x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle01561naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245004200123300001600165520076700181650001800948650001700966650002000983650001201003650001001015650001801025650001701043700001401060700001501074773007801089852000901167930003301176945001301209946001301222655001201235IND2202154720221120175127.0000105e199905  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220215472DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Q.10aColor evaluation of red pepper powder  ap. 749-752.  aRed color, particle size, and moisture content are important quality attributes of red pepper (Capsicum annuum) powder.

The velocity head effect caused by the velocity change was a factor in determining the permeate flux and became more significant with increasing liquid flow rate. Two-phase flow generated by introducing air bubbles into the cheese whey solutions successfully improved the permeate flux of cross flow microfiltration. The permeate flux increased approximately 50% with only 5% air.

Samples of scab-infected hard red spring-wheat were collected from west-central and northwest Minnesota after harvest in 1994 and 1995. Half of each sample was passed over a gravity table twice to remove as many of the scab-infected kernels as possible. Carbon dioxide evolution from cleaned and uncleaned samples was then used to determine dry matter loss during storage at 16, 18, and 20% moisture (wet basis) and 20 degrees C. Several quality factors and U.S. grade number were determined before and after storage, and the time required to reach 0.5% dry matter loss was determined. The storage time to reach 0.5% dry matter changed from -1.6% to +43.3% for samples that had been cleaned to remove scab-infected kernels compared to samples that had not been cleaned. There was no consistent trend in levels of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) during storage of 1994 wheat, but in most cases, there were significant increases in the levels of DON during storage of 1995 wheat. In all cases, DON levels were lower after storage tests in samples that had been cleaned on the gravity table compared to samples that had not been cleaned. wheat stored at 16% moisture deteriorated at a much slower rate than would be expected for corn (Zea mays) stored under similar conditions, and a wheat variety that is somewhat resistant to the fungi that cause scab deteriorated more slowly than varieties that are susceptible to scab fungi. There were large, unexplained differences in storability for wheat grown in the two years of the study. In both years, however the 0.5% dry matter loss criterion that is used to determine allowable storage time for corn seemed to be too high for use with wheat. 3awheat 3avarieties 3aFusarium 3aplant pathogenic fungi 3adeoxynivalenol 3astorage 3aduration 3afood safety 0astorage losses 0aallowable storage time1 aNg, H.F.1 aMeronuck, R.A.1 aMorey, R.V.1 aGupta, P.1 aLang, J.P.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1999 , v. 42, no. 3 p.733-742x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01633naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005900126300001600185520081800201650001401019650001101033650001301044650002701057650001201084650001301096650001501109700001601124700002101140773007801161852000901239930003301248945001301281946001301294655001201307IND2202154320221120164416.0000105e199905  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220215432DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aReyes, M.R.10aTesting of a multislot divisor fabricated from plastic  ap. 721-723.  aA multislot divisor is a device that divides water flow into equal parts, with one part collected in a tank. The USDA Handbook 224 contains plans for construction of multislot divisors fabricated from steel. With minor modifications, multislot divisors were fabricated from plastic. Performance tests were conducted on plastic and metal multislot divisors. Test results showed that plastic can be used as an alternative to steel without jeopardizing the multislot divisor's accuracy in equally dividing flow. However, four years after field installation, more than half of our plastic multislot divisor and plastic tank set-ups needed repairs. We recommend, therefore, the use of metal instead of plastic multislot divisors, unless strong attachments of plastic multislot divisors with plastic tanks are designed. 3aequipment 3adesign 3aplastics 3aconstruction materials 3atesting 3aaccuracy 3adurability1 aGayle, G.A.1 aRaczkowski, C.W.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1999 , v. 42, no. 3 p.721-723x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02426naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245008600132300001600218520155400234650002101788650001301809650001801822650001601840650002101856650002201877650002201899700001701921700001601938773007801954852000902032930003302041945001302074946001302087655001202100IND2202386620221120164411.0000204e199907  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220238662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadramootoo, C.A.10aSimulating nitrogen dynamics under water table management systems with DRAINMOD-N  ap. 965-973.  aThere is increasing interest in water table management to control nitrate leaching in eastern Canada. However, little is known about the impacts of this practice in the region. DRAINMOD-N, a recently developed drainage water quality model, offers the potential to evaluate nitrate leaching. The model was validated by comparing simulated results with measurements of water table depth, drain flow, cumulative nitrate leaching, and cumulative denitrification, from conventional drainage and subirrigation field plots planted to corn. Replicated plots of 15 m x 75 m were either under conventional free drainage or subirrigation at a weir setting of 0.5 m below the soil surface. DRAINMOD-N predicted water table depth to within a range of +/- 160 to 210 mm, drain flow to within +/- 2 mm/d and nitrate leaching to within +/- 8 kg N/ha, DRAINMOD-N models denitnfication using first order kinetics. This did not accurately describe field measurements of cumulative denitrification, as by day of year 270 cumulative denitrification was underestimated by 64 to 83%. Therefore, the model was modified by replacing the original denitrification function with the Michaelis-Menten relationship, which simulates denitrification as a first order process when nitrate is limiting and as a zero order process for non-limiting nitrate. This modification had little effect (< 2%) on the modified model's prediction of nitrate leaching. For cumulative denitrification, however the prediction error with the modified model was of 23 to 60% less than with DRAINMOD-N. 3anitrate nitrogen 3aleaching 3awater quality 3awater table 3awater management 3asimulation models 3apollution control1 aKaluli, J.W.1 aDodds, G.T.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1999 , v. 42, no. 4 p.965-973x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01684naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008300126300001600209520076300225650001200988650001601000650001401016653001601030653001501046653002401061653002001085653003001105700001701135700001701152700001901169773007801188852000901266930003301275945001301308946001301321655001201334IND2202383720221120164225.0000204e199907  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220238372DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKraus, T.J.10aLeachate conductivity as an index for quantifying level of forage conditioning  ap. 847-852.  aA method based upon measuring the conductivity of the leachate (LC) from mechanically conditioned forage was evaluated and used as an index for quantifying the extent of mechanical damage caused by various mechanical treatments.

The sensor was under study as a noninvasive tool for determining the fat content of beef cattle and carcasses. A conformal mapping performed on a radial cross-section of the probe greatly simplified the analysis by eliminating field singularities at the edges of the conductors and correcting large disparities in the sizes of the elements. This coordinate tranformation required a modification of the stiffness formula used in the finite element analysis. Capacitance values with estimated errors under 0.015% were obtained with a mesh of under 2,000 nodes. These values were used to identify deficiencies in an equation, developed from experimental data, relating the probe output to tissue thicknesses and dielectric constants. Theoretical capacitance values were needed because experimental error was hindering the development of this equation. The information in this article will be of use to other researchers who are performing axially symmetric finite element analyses or who are interested in dielectric constant measurements on layered materials. 3athickness 3afinite element analysis 3ameat 3ainstrumentation 3atesting 3acapacitance 3anondestructive methods 0asensors 0adielectric constant1 aGroff, G.P.1 aRaper, R.L.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1999 , v. 42, no. 3 p.819-826x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02209naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245011700126300001600243520113000259650001701389650000901406650001201415650001101427650000901438650001301447650001101460650001301471650001201484650001401496650001801510651001101528653002401539653002401563700001601587700001901603700001901622773007801641852000901719930003301728945001301761946001301774655001201787IND2202385320221120155752.0000204e199907  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220238532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatos, A.T.10aRetardation factors and the dispersion-diffusion coefficients of Zn, Cd, Cu, Pb, in soils from Vicosa-MG, Brazil  ap. 903-910.  aA mixed solution, composed by 700 microgram mL(-1) of Zn, 20 microgram mL(-1) of Cd, 200 microgram mL(-1) of Cu, and 300 microgram mL(-1) of Pb, was used to obtain the Breakthrough Curves (BTCs) of the displacement of these metals in soil columns under steady-state water flow conditions.

The non-limed A horizon of the Oxisol had calculated values of dispersion-diffusion coefficients higher than 301.94 x 10(-4) m(2) h(-1) for all studied metals. The solution of the transport of sorbed solutes equation, assuming a purely dispersive system, was adequate for simulation of mobility of metals in limed and non-limed soil studied. 3aheavy metals 3azinc 3acadmium 3acopper 3alead 3aleaching 3aliming 3aUltisols 3aOxisols 3aequations 3asoil horizons 3aBrazil 0atransport processes 0abreakthrough curves1 aCosta, L.M.1 aFontes, M.P.F.1 aMartinez, M.A.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g1999 , v. 42, no. 4 p.903-910x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02981naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001700159245009600176300001600272520168600288650001801974650002201992650002702014650002502041650002502066650002102091650002002112650001802132650001002150650002802160650001402188653002802202653001902230700002002249700001902269773011102288852000902399856008002408930003302488945001302521946001302534655001202547IND2036187020221120155738.0931209e199209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203618702DNAL7 a166529712pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.1.3742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTurano, F.J.10aIdentification and expression of a cDNA clone encoding aspartate aminotransferase in carrot  ap. 374-381.  aA full-length cDNA clone encoding aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) has been identified from a carrot root cDNA library. Degenerate oligo primers were synthesized from the known amino acid sequence of AAT form I from carrot (Daucus carota L. cv Danvers). These primers were utilized in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a portion of a carrot AAT gene from first strand cDNA synthesized from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from 5-d-old cell suspension cultures. The resulting 750-bp fragment was cloned, mapped, and sequenced. The cloned fragment, mpAAT1, was used as a probe to identify a full-length cDNA clone in a library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from carrot roots. A 1.52-kb full-length clone, AAT7, was isolated and sequenced. AAT7 has 54% nucleotide identity with both the mouse cytoplasmic and mitochondrial AAT genes. The deduced amino acid sequence has 52 and 53% identity with the deduced amino acid sequences of mouse cytoplasmic and mitochondrial AAT genes, respectively. Further analysis of the sequence data suggests that AAT7 encodes a cytoplasmic form of carrot AAT; the evidence includes the (a) absence of a transit or signal sequence, (b) lack of "m-residues," or invariant mitochondrial residues, in the carrot AAT sequence, and (c) high degree of sequence similarity with the amino acid sequence previously obtained for form I of carrot, a cytoplasmic isoenzyme. High- and low-stringency hybridizations to Southern blots of carrot nuclear DNA with AAT7 show that AAT is part of a small multigene family. Northern blot analysis of AAT7 suggests that AAT is expressed throughout cell culture up to 7 d and is highly expressed in roots but not in leaves. 3aDaucus carota 3acomplementary DNA 3aaspartate transaminase 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3amultigene family 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 3aroots 3acell suspension culture 3acytoplasm 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/m926601 aWeisemann, J.M.1 aMatthews, B.F.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 100, no. 1 p.374-381aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.1.3743Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02822naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245009800161300001500259520152400274650001401798650001501812650002301827650001301850650001901863650001701882650001101899650002201910650001901932650001101951650001901962650002401981650001202005651001002017653002602027700001902053700001902072700002302091773012402114852000902238856008502247930003302332946001102365655001202376IND4411342920221120155826.0081010e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441134292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00374-008-0318-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahía, J. 10aMicrobial biomass and C mineralization in agricultural soils as affected by atrazine addition  ap. 99-105.  aThis study examines the effects of atrazine on both microbial biomass C and C mineralization dynamics in two contrasting agricultural soils (organic C, texture, and atrazine application history) located at Galicia (NW Spain). Atrazine was added to soils, a Humic Cambisol (H) and a Gleyic Cambisol (G), at a recommended agronomic dose and C mineralization (CO₂ evolved), and microbial biomass measurements were made in non-treated and atrazine-treated samples at different time intervals during a 12-week aerobic incubation. The cumulative curves of CO₂-C evolved over time fit the simple first-order kinetic model [Ct = Co (1 - e ⁻kt )], whose kinetic parameters were quantified. Differences in these parameters were observed between the two soils studied; the G soil, with a higher content in organic matter and microbial biomass C and lower atrazine application history, exhibited higher values of the total C mineralization and the potentially mineralizable labile C pool than those for the H soil. The addition of atrazine modified the kinetic parameters and increased notably the C mineralized; by the end of the incubation the cumulative CO₂-C values were 33-41% higher than those in the corresponding non-added soils. In contrast, a variable effect or even no effect was observed on the soil microbial biomass following atrazine addition. The data clearly showed that atrazine application at normal agricultural rates may have important implications in the C cycling of these two contrasting acid soils. 3aCambisols 3aacid soils 3aagricultural soils 3aatrazine 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon sinks 3acobalt 3amicrobial biomass 3amineralization 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3asoil microorganisms 3atexture 3aSpain 0aCarbon mineralization1 aCabaneiro, A. 1 aCarballas, T. 1 aDíaz-Raviña, M. 0 tBiology and fertility of soils.g2008 Oct., v. 45, no. 1 p.99-105dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0178-27627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00374-008-0318-y3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03121naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001500159245013000174300001600304520189700320650003002217650001102247650001502258650002002273650001702293650002102310650001802331650002902349653001802378653002302396653002802419700001702447773011102464852000902575856008002584930003302664945001302697946001302710655001202723IND2036184820221120151351.0931209e199209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203618482DNAL7 a166529632pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.1.3192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, K.L.10aIn vivo competition between plastocyanin and a copper-dependent regulator of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cytochrome C6 gene  ap. 319-326.  aThe Chlamydomonas reinhardtii gene encoding cytochrome C6 (Cyt C6) is transcriptionally repressed by cupric ions. In quantitating the level of expression of this gene as a function of cupric ions available per cell, we find that transformed Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cells that accumulate high levels of plastocyanin (a type I copper protein) have a higher sensory threshold for copper-dependent repression of the Cyt C6 gene than do untransformed, otherwise isogenic, cells that are plastocyanin-deficient. Also, in wild-type cells, the extent to which the gene is expressed at any given ratio of copper/cell is exactly correlated with the predicted deficiency (at this level of copper) in the organism's capacity to synthesize holoplastocyanin. These results support a simple model in which the sensory threshold for transcriptional repression of the Cyt C6 gene is determined by direct competition for intracellular copper ions between a copper-binding regulator of this gene and plastocyanin. Thus, the organism is able to maintain a constant amount of Cyt C6 plus plastocyanin per Photosystem 1. With the use of in vitro-generated Cyt C6-encoding transcripts as a standard for the quantitation of cellular Cyt C6 mRNA levels, we estimate that whereas copper-deficient wild-type cells maintain approximately 1 X 10(2) to 4 X 10(2) Cyt C6-specific transcripts per cell, copper-supplemented cells contain, on average, less than one Cyt C6-encoding mRNA. Thus, repression of the Cyt C6 gene by copper ions is essentially 100%, making it unlikely that Cyt C6 has any essential metabolic function in copper-supplemented cells. We find also that the steady-state levels of several transcripts, including those for Cyt C6, are influenced by cell density, so that cells harvested at low density contain several-fold as many copies of a particular message as cells harvested near stationary phase. 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3acopper 3ametal ions 3agene expression 3acytochrome c 3abinding proteins 3amessenger RNA 3atranscription (genetics) 0aplastocyanins 0agenetic regulation 0acopper binding proteins1 aMerchant, S.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 100, no. 1 p.319-326aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.1.3193Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03120naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010600145300001600251500031600267520149900583650002502082650002002107650001002127650003002137650003002167650001802197650001102215650002402226650002202250650002002272650000902292650001302301650001602314650002602330650003402356650005202390700001202442700001702454773012302471852000902594930003302603945001302636946001302649655001202662IND2058324020221120125419.0970710e199704  mau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205832402DNAL7 a91115282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin, K.R.10aHuman lipoproteins as a vehicle for the delivery of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol to HepG2 cells  ap. 367-373.  aA preliminary report of this work was presented at Experimental Biology '96, April 14-17, 1996, Washington, D.C. (Failla, M.L., Martin, K.R., Loo, G. Comparison of micelles and human lipoproteins as vehicles for delivery of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol to HepG2 human liver cells. FASEB J. 10:A242, 1996).  aHighly differentiated human cell lines represent a useful in vitro model for the study of carotenoid uptake, metabolism, and function. Carotenoids are usually introduced into tissue culture media either in organic solvents or as micelles, whereas carotenoids are localized in lipoproteins in vivo. Initially, the stability of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol in micelles and human lipoproteins under standard tissue culture conditions was compared. Recovery of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol was 27% +/- 2% and 73% +/- 2%, respectively, after overnight incubation of micellar beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol in serum-free medium without cells. This marked loss of beta-carotene was attenuated by inclusion of alpha-tocopherol in micelles. In contrast, recovery of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol was 88%-95% when medium containing the total lipoprotein fraction isolated from beta-carotene supplemented individuals was incubated overnight without cells. Cellular accumulation of beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol from medium containing total lipoproteins (1 mg/ml) was proportional to their concentrations in the lipoprotein fraction (r = 0.94 for beta-carotene and 0.74 for alpha-tocopherol). Cells exhibited similar capability of acquiring beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol from medium containing either low- or high-density lipoproteins. These data show that lipoproteins represent a stable vehicle for delivery of beta-carotein and alpha-tocopherol to HepG2 human liver cells. 3anutrition physiology 3ahuman nutrition 2aAdult 2aCarcinoma, Hepatocellular 2aCulture Media, Serum-Free 2aDrug Carriers 2aHumans 2aLipoproteinsxblood 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aLiver Neoplasms 2aMale 2aMicelles 2aMiddle Aged 2aTumor Cells, Cultured 2aVitamin Exbloodxmetabolism. 2abeta Carotenexbloodxmetabolismxpharmacology.1 aLoo, G.1 aFailla, M.L.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1997 Apr., v. 214, no. 4 p.367-373x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19970801b19970807c00000000  aINDdGK1  aOther US 7aarticle02348naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245009200148300001800240500001500258520102600273650002201299650001201321650001601333650002801349650001101377650002201388650002201410650001001432650001201442650001601454650001601470650004401486650001101530650002101541650002401562650002401586653001701610653001101627653002001638653002501658700001901683773008401702852000901786930003301795945001301828946001301841655001201854IND2041728020221120125435.0940831e199406  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204172802DNAL7 a80834272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeinrichs, A.J.10aStandards of weight and height for Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, and Milking Shorthorn heifers  ap. 1676-1681.  a2019-12-05  aTo develop a modern appraisal of growth for Ayrshire, Brown Swiss, and Milking Shorthorn dairy heifers, data on heart girth and height at withers were collected from 1279 Ayrshire heifers (33 herds), 1819 Brown Swiss heifers (46 herds), and 565 Milking Shorthorn heifers (20 herds), ages 1 to 25 mo, in herds located throughout the US.

LTi cells express the nuclear hormone receptor RORγt, which also directs the expression of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 in T cells. We show here that LTi cells are part of a larger family of proinflammatory RORγt⁺ innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) that differentiate from distinct fetal liver RORγt⁺ precursors. The fate of RORγt⁺ ILCs is determined by mouse age, and after birth, favors the generation of cells involved in intestinal homeostasis and defense. Contrary to RORγt⁺ T cells, however, RORγt⁺ ILCs develop in the absence of microbiota. Our study indicates that RORγt⁺ ILCs evolve to preempt intestinal colonization by microbial symbionts. 3aT-lymphocytes 3ahomeostasis 3ahormone receptors 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3aliver 3amice 3amicroorganisms 3astromal cells 3asymbionts1 aCherrier, Marie1 aLochner, Matthias1 aSatoh-Takayama, Naoko1 aFehling, Hans Jörg1 aLanga, Francina1 aDi Santo, James P.1 aEberl, Gérard0 tScience.g2010 Oct. 29, v. 330, no. 6004 p.665-669dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11945973Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle02198naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002100184245008400205300001600289506007600305520091800381506003701299650001201336650001101348650002501359650001401384650002501398650001101423650002501434650001101459700002201470700002401492700002101516700002101537773012501558852000901683856008301692946001301775655001201788IND4444280520221207113945.0101029e20101029xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444428052DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11977852doi7 aPMC30034332pmcid7 a210306592pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDerdowski, Aaron12aA Size Threshold Limits Prion Transmission and Establishes Phenotypic Diversity  ap. 680-683.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAccording to the prion hypothesis, atypical phenotypes arise when a prion protein adopts an alternative conformation and persist when that form assembles into self-replicating aggregates. Amyloid formation in vitro provides a model for this protein-misfolding pathway, but the mechanism by which this process interacts with the cellular environment to produce transmissible phenotypes is poorly understood. Using the yeast prion Sup35/[PSI⁺], we found that protein conformation determined the size distribution of aggregates through its interactions with a molecular chaperone. Shifts in this range created variations in aggregate abundance among cells because of a size threshold for transmission, and this heterogeneity, along with aggregate growth and fragmentation, induced age-dependent fluctuations in phenotype. Thus, prion conformations may specify phenotypes as population averages in a dynamic system.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aamyloid 3amodels 3amolecular chaperones 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aprions 3aprotein conformation 3ayeasts1 aSindi, Suzanne S.1 aKlaips, Courtney L.1 aDiSalvo, Susanne1 aSerio, Tricia R.0 tScience.g2010 Oct. 29, v. 330, no. 6004 p.680-683dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11977853Available from publisher's Web site  aOther US 7aarticle03050naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009200146300001800238500001500256520128700271650001501558650001201573650001001585650002501595650001701620650001601637650001001653650001401663650002501677650001201702650001601714650000701730650001601737650002401753650001801777650002801795650001501823650001901838650001201857650002301869650006601892650001801958650002801976650002502004650003802029650001102067650001702078650003102095650002802126650002102154650002002175650002802195653000802223700001702231773008402248852000902332930003302341945001302374946001302387655001202400IND2041727120221120112012.0940831e199406  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204172712DNAL7 a80834182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBatajoo, K.K.10aImpact of nonfiber carbohydrate on intake, digestion, and milk production by dairy cows  ap. 1580-1588.  a2019-12-05  aFour concentrations of dietary nonfiber carbohydrate (42, 36, 30, and 24%) were evaluated using eight multiparous Holstein cows (662 kg of BW; 63 DIM) in replicated 4 X 4 Latin squares with 28-d periods. Shelled corn and soybean meal were partially replaced with wheat middlings, dried brewers grains, and soy hulls to formulate 36, 30, and 24% nonfiber carbohydrate diets. Decreasing dietary nonfiber carbohydrate decreased DMI, did not affect actual or fat-corrected milk production, increased milk fat percentage, and decreased milk protein percentage and production. Apparent total tract DM and OM digestibilities were highest for 36% and lowest for 24% nonfiber carbohydrate diets. Digestibility of NDF was lowest for the 42% nonfiber carbohydrate diet. Ruminal pH and acetate:propionate increased, and total VFA concentrations decreased, as dietary nonfiber carbohydrate decreased. Ruminal degradation of alfalfa hay DM and NDF were higher for low nonfiber carbohydrate diets. Significant depression of DMI (.9 to 1.8 kg/d) coincided with dietary nonfiber carbohydrate concentration at or below 30%. Results indicate that diets for cows producing 40 kg/d should contain more than 30% nonfiber carbohydrate and suggest little benefit of 42 over 36% nonfiber carbohydrate diets. 3adairy cows 3aammonia 3arumen 3avolatile fatty acids 3aconcentrates 3abody weight 3awheat 3amiddlings 3adietary carbohydrate 3aalfalfa 3aalfalfa hay 3apH 3afeed intake 3amilk fat percentage 3adigestibility 3amilk protein percentage 3amilk yield 3abrewers grains 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aDietary Carbohydratesxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aDietary Fiber 2aDigestionxdrug effects 2aEatingxdrug effects 2aFatty Acids, Volatilexmetabolism 2aFemale 2aFermentation 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactationxdrug effects 2aLipidsxanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aMilk Proteinsxanalysis 0ahay1 aShaver, R.D.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.1580-1588x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02602naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001500128245007000143300001800213500001500231520139800246650001501644650001901659650001401678650001401692650001301706650001901719650001201738650002101750650002301771650001101794650001401805650003201819650001701851653002201868653002801890653001201918653001501930700001701945700001801962773008401980852000902064930003302073945001302106946001302119655001202132IND2041726620221120112007.0940831e199406  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204172662DNAL7 a80834132pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHady, P.J.10aFrequency and precision of body condition scoring in dairy cattle  ap. 1543-1547.  a2019-12-05  aThe objectives of this project were 1) to determine whether mean body condition scores for 30-d lactation and dry period intervals can be utilized to appraise body condition changes in a herd and 2) to determine the precision of the mean body condition score for 30-d lactation and dry period intervals. Cows in a commercial dairy herd were visually scored for body condition on a five-point scale in increments of .25. Dry period intervals were based on expected calving date; lactation intervals were calculated from the calving date for each cow. The first objective was accomplished by comparison of mean body condition scores for the 30-d lactation and dry period intervals. A Student's t test was used to test for differences between adjacent means for body condition score. Mean body condition scores for each 30-d lactation and dry period interval can be used to detect changes in body condition across stages of lactation and the dry period. The precision of the mean body condition score for each 30-d lactation and dry period interval was determined. Precision (or significance) was 95, 90, and 80%. Significance was 95% for all but one of the lactation and dry period intervals, indicating that mean body condition scores for a given interval are significant and precise. Body condition scoring may provide useful management information with the procedures developed in this study. 3adairy cows 3abody condition 3afrequency 3alactation 3aaccuracy 2aAdipose Tissue 2aAnimals 2aBody Composition 2aCattlexphysiology 2aFemale 2aLactation 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aTime Factors 0alivestock numbers 0arepresentative sampling 0ascoring 0adry period1 aDomecq, J.J.1 aKaneene, J.B.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 June, v. 77, no. 6 p.1543-1547x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941004b19941021c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02664naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245009800142300001400240500001500254520153300269650002001802650002301822650001101845650001301856650001501869650000901884650001201893650002801905650001101933650005201944653001201996653002502008700001702033700001502050773012102065852000902186930003302195945001302228946001302241655001202254IND2051088420221120100815.0960502e199601  mau|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND205108842DNAL7 a85946192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKacew, S.10aBioavailability of bound pesticide residues and potential toxicologic consequences--an update  ap. 62-68.  a2019-12-05  aThe growing demand for enhanced food productivity to meet the needs of the global population has led farmers to use sophisticated agricultural technology in which pesticides play a crucial role. Pesticide use has a positive and dramatic impact on agricultural production through protection of crops against insects, pests, and disease, but every effort must be made to ensure that application is safe and, more importantly, to assure safety for human and environmental health. Since our initial review (1), global usage of pesticides has increased and knowledge regarding the biological significance of bound pesticide residues has expanded. The fact that more reports are appearing in the literature signifies an increased awareness of the presence of bound pesticide residues and indicates that a greater number of scientists are attempting to establish the potential toxicologic consequences of this pesticide residue traction. Rico (2), in a review in 1990, concluded that covalently bound residues in edible animal tissues were not carcinogenic, were not readily bioavailable, and hence produced little, it any, adverse effects. Whether this conclusion is applicable to the presence and consequences of bound pesticide residues in plants and food commodities remains unanswered. Thus, the aim of this updated review is not simply to list studies on bioavailability of bound pesticide residues in grains subsequent to the review in 1992 (1) but also to establish the toxicological impact of this chemical traction on health. 3abioavailability 3apesticide residues 3agrains 3atoxicity 3apesticides 3arats 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aHumans 2aPesticide Residuesxpharmacokineticsxtoxicity. 0abinding 0aHealth and Pathology1 aAkhtar, M.H.1 aKhan, S.U.0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1996 Jan., v. 211, no. 1 p.62-68x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a19960605b19960611c00000000  aINDdGHK  aOther US 7aarticle02444naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245003900127300001600166500001500182520147200197650002101669650001501690650002601705651001201731653001201743653001101755653001901766700001601785700001901801700001701820700001501837700001601852700001801868700001401886773007801900852000901978930003301987945001302020946001302033655001202046IND2327926220221120084909.0020709e200107  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232792622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVellidis, G.14aThe peanut yield monitoring system  ap. 775-785.  a2019-12-05  aThe most essential component of precision farming is the yield monitor, a sensor or group of sensors installed on harvesting equipment that dynamically measure spatial yield variability. Yield maps, which are produced using data from yield monitors, are extremely useful in providing the farmer a color-coded visual image clearly showing the variability of yield across a field. University of Georgia scientists recently completed development work on PYMS, the Peanut Yield Monitoring System. PYMS uses load cells for instantaneous load measurements of harvested peanuts and has proven to be accurate to between 2% and 3% on a trailer-load basis and to approximately 1% on a field basis when using data collected during combine operation. PYMS data are accurate to around 1% on a basket-load basis when using data collected under static conditions. The instantaneous accuracy of PYMS was calculated to be 700 kg/ha. Basing management decisions on the yield of individual pixels of PYMS yield maps is not realistic. The strength of PYMS is in differentiating yield trends and evaluating management practices. The system was extensively and successfully field-tested over a 3-year period and evaluated by 11 users during 1999, all of whom were able to use the resulting yield maps to evaluate current management practices or to develop future management plans. The University of Georgia has submitted a patent application for PYMS, and the technology has been licensed. 3aArachis hypogaea 3acrop yield 3aprecision agriculture 3aGeorgia 0asensors 0atrends 0ayield monitors1 aPerry, C.D.1 aDurrence, J.S.1 aThomas, D.L.1 aHill, R.W.1 aKvien, C.K.1 aHamrita, T.K.1 aRains, G.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2001 , v. 44, no. 4 p.775-785x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle01960naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245004600130300001600176520116700192650001601359650001301375650001801388653002101406653001801427653002201445700001701467700001601484773007801500852000901578930003301587945001301620946001301633655001201646IND2327926120221120084834.0020709e200107  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232792612DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuyghebaert, B.10aFlow rate quality of new flat fan nozzles  ap. 769-773.  aManufacturers of spraying nozzles have established manufacturing tolerances to guarantee the quality of their products.

A survey carried out among three manufacturers made it possible to determine the manufacturing tolerances and limits that manufacturers impose upon themselves. The flow rates of 1565 new nozzles collected on the market from these manufacturers were measured on a device developed for this study. Different statistical tests assessed the performances and characteristics of the products. The quality standards announced by the manufacturers were not checked for every nozzle. On average, 20% of the new nozzles exceeded the manufacturing tolerances. The average flow rate of the nozzle sets equaled the nominal flow rate. In practice, the probability distribution of the flow rate of new nozzles should be normal. The dispersion of the new nozzle flow rates was slightly higher than the theoretical one.

However, the proper evaluation of surface resistance to vapor exchange (r(s)) has been a limiting factor for using the model to directly estimate daily ET for other crops. A popular approach to quantify r(s), referred to as canopy resistance (r(c)), is based on single-leaf resistance (r(L)) and leaf area index (LAI) but does not account for non-stomatal contributions ("excess resistance") to r(s) such as leaf boundary layer resistance and aerodynamic resistance within the canopy. Field measurements of ET, r(L), and LAI for full-canopy conditions were used to develop an empirical crop height and LAI-dependent relation to estimate excess resistance (r(o)). An alternative r(s) term was defined as r(o) + r(c) and used in conjunction with an aerodynamic resistance term (r(a)) calculated from the top of the canopy. Using climatic data collected over corn and potato canopies, three variations of daily P-M ET were compared: PM-1, which used the r(s) definition including excess resistance (r(s) = r(o) + r(c)), r(a) calculated from the top of the canopy, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and solar irradiance (Rs) functions to adjust r(L). PM-2, which was essentially identical to PM-1 with no VPD or Rs adjustment to r(L). PM-3, which used 'standard' r(s) (r(S) = r(c)) and r(a) (based on a zero-plane displacement height approximately 2/3 of crop height) calculations with VPD and Rs adjustments to r(L). All three methods of P-M ET were compared with daily crop ET measurements made with a Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) system. For corn, the results of this study suggested significant resistance to vapor transfer in excess of the r(c) used in standard calculations of daily ET with the P-M equation. This behavior was not seen with the calculation of daily ET for potatoes. The direct application of the standard P-M equation to estimate daily corn ET (i.e., PM-3) is not recommended because excess resistance not accounted for by this model will often lead to substantial ET overestimation. However, estimation of excess resistance based on canopy features was not found satisfactory (i.e., PM-1 and PM-2). 3acanopy 3astomatal conductance 3aevapotranspiration 3aZea mays 3aSolanum tuberosum 3acrops 3amathematical models 0apenman-monteith equation1 aStockle, C.O.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2001 , v. 44, no. 4 p.797-805x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20020903b20020909c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02133naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092024003400110040001800144100001800162245008100180300001600261500001500277520068000292650002900972650003501001650001901036650002201055650001501077650001701092650001401109650001201123650002501135650002301160650001901183650001201202650001101214650001001225653001301235653001301248653001501261700001601276700001801292700001901310700001701329700001801346773008701364852000901451856008401460930003301544945001301577946001301590655001201603IND2180732220221120072608.0981030e199803  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218073222DNAL7 a95385742pmid7 a10.1093/jmedent/35.2.1432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMistrello, G.10aDot immunobinding assay for detection of mite antigens in house-dust samples  ap. 143-147.  a2019-12-04  aA new test was developed specifically to detect mite antigens in house-dust. It uses a nitrocellulose dipstick spotted with specific antimite antibodies that act as a capture matrix; the same antibodies act as a detecting reagent when conjugated with colloidal dye particles. Aclotest is a 1-step assay, where a spotted dipstick is placed in a tube containing the detecting reagent and the house-dust sample. No instrumentation or previous extraction procedure of the sample is required, and the test response is visible as a colored spot, after 1 h incubation. The sensitivity and specificity of the new test were compared with those of Acarex and Der pl/Der fl ELISA tests. 3aDermatophagoides farinae 3aDermatophagoides pteronyssinus 3aimmunoblotting 3aantigen detection 3adust mites 3aimmunoassays 3aallergens 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Specificity 2aAntigensxanalysis 2aDustxanalysis 2aHousing 2aHumans 2aMites 0aaclotest 0aantigens 0ahouse dust1 aGentili, M.1 aRoncarolo, D.1 aAntoniotti, P.1 aOttoboni, F.1 aFalagiani, P.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g1998 Mar., v. 35, no. 2 p.143-147x0022-25857nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jmedent/35.2.1433Available from publisher's Web site  a19981201b19981208c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02242naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245010600123300001600229500001500245520128700260650001301547650001401560650001401574650002101588650002501609650002501634650001701659650002401676651001301700653001901713773009401732852000901826930003301835945001301868946001101881655001201892IND2334652020221120061941.0031120e200209  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233465202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaye, T.10aGenotypic and phenotypic variability in Vernonia galamensis germplasm collected from eastern Ethiopia  ap. 161-168.  a2019-12-05  aEthiopia is the centre of origin and diversity of Vernonia galamensis, which is a new potential industrial oilseed crop. Seeds of Vernonia are rich in vernolic acid, a naturally epoxidized fatty acid with unique chemical (epoxy) and physical (low viscosity) properties. Vernolic acid is a useful raw material for manufacturing paints and coatings. No effort has been made so far in Ethiopia or elsewhere to improve this plant. Therefore, an experiment was conducted in three contrasting agroclimatic zones (Alemaya, Harar and Babile) using eight accessions to assess the genotypic (GCV) and phenotypic (PCV) coefficients of variation, to estimate broad sense heritability (h2B) and genetic advance (GA) as a per cent of the mean for 17 pheno-morphic and agronomic traits. Considering GCV, h2B and GA (as per cent of the mean) simultaneously as the best estimators of the amount of advance expected from selection, secondary head number (28.90, 0.90 and 56.60), secondary branch number (13.90, 0.67 and 51.97), and seed number per head (15.97, 0.72 and 27.92) gave the highest values at Alemaya, Harar and Babile, respectively. This shows that a satisfactory selection program for improvement of these characters is possible in V. galamensis var. ethiopica at each specific location. 3aVernonia 3aequations 3aoil crops 3aagronomic traits 3astatistical analysis 3aphenotypic variation 3aheritability 3agermplasm screening 3aEthiopia 0aplant breeding0 tJournal of agricultural science.g2002 Sept., v. 139, no. pt.2 p.161-168x0021-85967nnas  aDNAL  a20031208b00000000c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02708naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001200110245012000122300001500242500002400257520155000281650002401831651001201855651001901867700001801886700001701904700001701921700002001938700001801958700001601976773008701992852000902079856009002088856011102178930003302289945001302322946001102335655001202346IND2330683920221120062002.0030131e20020610ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233068392DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, G.12aA comparison of the watershed hydrology of coastal forested wetlands and the mountainous uplands in the Southern US  ap. 92-104.  aIncludes references  aHydrology plays a critical role in wetland development and ecosystem structure and functions. Hydrologic responses to forest management and climate change are diverse in the Southern United States due to topographic and climatic differences. This paper presents a comparison study on long-term hydrologic characteristics (long-term seasonal runoff patterns, water balances, storm flow patterns) of three watersheds in the southern US. These three watersheds represent three types of forest ecosystems commonly found in the lower Atlantic coastal plain and the Appalachian upland mountains. Compared to the warm, flat, and shallow groundwater dominated pine flatwoods on the coast, the inland upland watershed was found to have significantly higher water yield, Precipitation/Hamon's potential evapotranspiration ratio (1.9 for upland vs 1.4 and 0.9 for wetlands), and runoff/precipitation ratio (0.53 +/- 0.092 for upland vs 0.30 +/- 0.079 and 0.13 +/- 0.094 for wetlands). Streamflow from flatwoods watersheds generally are discontinuous most of the years while the upland watershed showed continuous flows in most years. Stormflow peaks in a cypress-pine flatwoods system were smaller than that in the upland watershed for most cases, but exceptions occurred under extreme wet conditions. Our study concludes that climate is the most important factor in determining the watershed water balances in the southern US. Topography effects streamflow patterns and stormflow peaks and volume, and is the key to wetland development in the southern US. 3awatershed hydrology 3aFlorida 3aNorth Carolina1 aMcnulty, S.G.1 aAmatya, D.M.1 aSkaggs, R.W.1 aSwift, L.W.

First, stock plants and cuttings were measured for psiW at predawn (04:00 a.m.) and early morning (09:00 a.m.). Cuttings were then severed, wrapped in wet paper towels, and placed in insulated containers for 2 or 7 h at approximately 30 degrees C or for 21 h in cold storage (4 degrees C). Water potentials of cuttings were measured at the end of each storage period. Second, effects of initial water stress on rooting performance of cuttings were tested by withholding water from dormant (winter) and succulent (summer) cuttings for varying periods of time. After each drying treatment, psiW was measured on a sample of cuttings and the remainder of the cuttings were transferred to a greenhouse with intermittent mist for 12 weeks. Storage of cuttings for long periods (7 to 21 h) of time under low vapor pressure deficit conditions resulted in less negative water potentials of the cuttings. Dormant cuttings rooted at higher percentages, even after being exposed to lower values of psiW. The lower values of psiW in dormant cuttings could be attributed to higher ambient vapor pressure deficit during the drying phase. Results suggest that subjecting cuttings to moderate water stress for a short period of time does not adversely affect the rooting of cuttings. Cutting water potentials below -1.7 MPa appeared to reduce rooting of succulent cuttings and water potentials below -2.0 MPa affected rooting in dormant cuttings. 3aPinus taeda 3astems 3aplant-water relations 3awater stress 3arooting 3avapor pressure 3adormancy 3aplant cuttings 3avegetative propagation 3awater potential 3awater vapor 0ahandling1 aGoldfarb, B.0 tNew forests.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 3 p.217-230dKluwer Academic Publishersx0169-42867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://www.kluweronline.com/issn/0169-4286/contents3electronic resource  a20050118b20050130c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02342naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001400160245011500174300001800289500001500307520094600322650002401268650001601292650002501308650001301333650001801346650002001364650001801384650001601402650002201418650001901440650002501459650002301484653001901507653001601526653001001542653001501552700001701567700001501584773011201599852000901711856008101720930003301801945001301834946001301847655001201860IND2036244420221120044338.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203624442DNAL7 a166532042pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.18272doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPitto, L.10aRole of the leader sequence during thermal repression of translation in maize, tobacco, and carrot protoplasts  ap. 1827-1833.  a2019-12-04  aThe 5'-untranslated leader of maize (Zea mays) heat-shock protein (hsp) 70 mRNA is required for translational competence during heat shock in protoplasts. When the beta-glucuronidase gene was used as a reporter mRNA, expression at elevated temperatures increased more than 10-fold when the hsp70 leader constituted the 5'-untranslated region. The hsp70 leader did not affect the physical half-life of the mRNA and, therefore, does not function at the level of transcript stability. The maize hsp70 leader was required to escape thermal repression in both maize and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) but was less effective in carrot. In addition, mRNAs containing the tobacco mosaic virus untranslated leader were also efficiently translated during heat shock, data suggesting that the presence of the tobacco mosaic virus untranslated leader sequence enables the transcript to escape the translational repression that occurs during thermal stress. 3aheat shock proteins 3aprotoplasts 3aTobacco mosaic virus 3aZea mays 3amessenger RNA 3arecombinant DNA 3aDaucus carota 3aheat stress 3aNicotiana tabacum 3areporter genes 3anucleotide sequences 3abeta-glucuronidase 0aomega sequence 0atranslation 0agenes 0ainhibition1 aGallie, D.R.1 aWalbot, V.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1827-1833aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.18273Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02713naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001900160245007800179300001800257500001500275520130700290650002401597650001801621650001401639650001601653650002201669650002101691650002501712650002001737650001601757650002101773650001201794650001001806653000901816653002301825653001901848653002801867653002501895653001601920700002201936773011201958852000902070856008102079930003302160945001302193946001302206655001202219IND2036239920221120044200.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203623992DNAL7 a166531952pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.17642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFelsheim, R.F.10aStructure and expression of a heat-shock protein 83 gene of Pharbitis nil  ap. 1764-1771.  a2019-12-04  aFour cDNA clones representing mRNAs whose levels were affected by a photoperiod that induces flowering in Pharbitis nil were isolated by a differential hybridization screening procedure. The level of mRNAs represented by three clones (12L, 15L, and 17L) increased following a photoperiod that induces flowering and that represented by the fourth clone (clone 27) increased under conditions in which flowering was inhibited. DNA sequence analysis showed that one cDNA, clone 17L, is homologous to members of the 83- to 90-kD heat-shock protein (hsp) gene family. The corresponding gene, hsp83A, was isolated and its DNA sequence was determined. hsp83A encodes a protein that exhibits 70% amino acid identity with Drosophila melanogaster HSP83. The P. nil hsp83A gene contains two introns within the coding region. hsp83A mRNA was not detectable in cotyledons of plants grown in continuous light, but its level increased transiently following a 14-h dark period and reached a maximum 2 h after the lights were turned on. A dramatic increase in the level of hsp83A mRNA was also found 2 h after an end-of-day dark treatment. Genomic Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the P. nil hsp83-90 gene family consists of at least six members, one of which appears to be constitutively expressed in the light. 3aheat shock proteins 3amessenger RNA 3aflowering 3aIpomoea nil 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aphotoperiod 3amultigene family 3aintrons 3alight 0adark 0agenetic regulation 0agenbank/m99431 0amolecular sequence data 0anucleotide sequences 0ahsp83a gene1 aDas, A.q(Apurba)0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1764-1771aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.17643Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02754naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245009500176300001800271500001500289520116200304650002401466650001801490650001601508650002201524650002101546650001501567650002501582650002001607650001601627650001601643650002101659650002101680650001001701653002401711653002801735653002301763653001601786653001901802653001901821653001601840653002501856700001901881700001701900700002201917773011201939852000902051856008102060930003302141945001302174946001302187655001202200IND2036240020221120044252.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203624002DNAL7 a166531962pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.17722doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrishna, P.10aStructure and light-induced expression of a small heat-shock protein gene of Pharbitis nil  ap. 1772-1779.  a2019-12-04  aTo isolate genes that are regulated by a photoperiod that promotes flowering in Pharbitis nil, cDNA library representing mRNA of induced cotyledons was screened by differential hybridization. The DNA sequence of one cDNA clone isolated by this approach, clone 12L, showed homology to plant small heat-shock protein (hsp) genes. P. nil genomic clones hybridizing to clone 12L were isolated, and the DNA sequences of two P. nil small hsp (shsp) genes, shsp-1 and shsp-2, were determined. The derived amino acid sequences of shsp-1 and shsp-2 showed maximum homology to the 17.9-kD soybean hsp, a member of the class 11 cytoplasmic hsps found in plants. A study of the expression of shsp-1 and shsp-genes 2 by RNase protection assay indicated that shsp-1 is induced by photoperiod, by light treatment of dark-grown P. nil seedlings, and by heat shock, and that shsp-2 is induced only by heat shock. Analysis of the sequences of the nontranscribed region indicates that both genes contain multiple heat-shock elements. The shsp-1 gene, in addition, contains sequences homologous to the GT-1-binding site, which may play a role in its light-regulated expression. 3aheat shock proteins 3amessenger RNA 3aIpomoea nil 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3acotyledons 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aheat stress 3aphotoperiod 3amultigene family 3apromoter regions 3alight 0aheat shock elements 0amolecular sequence data 0agenetic regulation 0ashsp-2 gene 0agenbank/m99430 0agenbank/m99429 0ashsp-1 gene 0anucleotide sequences1 aFelsheim, R.F.1 aLarkin, J.C.1 aDas, A.q(Apurba)0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1772-1779aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.17723Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02193naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245012100130300001800251520127700269650001601546650002001562650001201582650002101594650001901615650002301634650001801657650001801675653002201693773008401715852000901799930003301808945001301841946001301854655001201867IND2042342820221120035817.0940929e199407  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204234282DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhittaker, W.G.10aDairy herd improvement: meeting the information needs of the dairy industry through a totally integrated cooperative  ap. 1992-1998.  aThe New Zealand dairy industry comprises 2.5 million dairy cows milked in 14,600 herds. Dairy herd improvement has been restructured over the past 8 yr into a single legal entity operating as a farmer cooperative company. The cooperative encompasses the national milk records operations; a single dairy records processing center with an associated national animal database; the development, management, and calculation of sire and cow evaluations; and the deployment of scientific and technical resources for research and development of products and services. Also included is 1) the operation of the country's largest progeny-testing program, an artificial breeding, semen, and inseminating service commanding 80% of the artificial insemination market, and 2) the management of the industry's farm extension service. The extension service and the marginal cost of developing and operating sire and cow evaluations are funded through an industry grant. All other operations, including farm management information, are fully funded by users. The totally integrated operation allows cost-effective utilization of personnel, facilities, and equipment.

However, in some cases the impact on longevity may depend on the quality of the energy source. In Drosophila, restriction of dietary yeast yields considerable lifespan extension whereas isocaloric restriction of dietary sugar yields only modest extension, indicating that other diet-responsive pathways can modify lifespan in this species. In rodents, restricting intake of a single amino acid - methionine - extends lifespan. Here we show that dietary methionine can modify lifespan in adult female, non-virgin Oregon-R strain Drosophila fed a chemically defined media. Compared to a diet containing 0.135% methionine and 15% glucose, high dietary methionine (0.405%) shortened maximum lifespan by 2.33% from 86 to 84 days and mean lifespan by 9.55% from 71.7 to 64.9 days. Further restriction of methionine to 0.045% did not extend maximum lifespan and shortened mean lifespan by 1.95% from 71.1 to 70.3 days. Restricting glucose from 15% to 5% while holding methionine at a concentration of 0.135%, modestly extended maximum lifespan by 5.8% from 86 to 91 days, without extending mean lifespan. All these diet-induced changes were highly significant (log-rank p < 0.0001). Notably, all four diets resulted in considerably longer life spans than those typically reported for flies fed conventional yeast and sugar based diets. Such defined diets can be used to identify lifespan-modifying pathways and specific gene-nutrient interactions in Drosophila. 3ademography 3adietary restriction 3aDrosophila 3alongevity 3amethionine 3amortality 3anutrition 0aaging 0aamino acid 0acaloric restriction1 aFrench, Emily E. 1 aRoberts, Jessica F. 1 aSelhub, Jacob 1 aOrdovas, J.

Most current wind erosion methods predict average annual or seasonal erosion amounts, and only very approximate estimates of suspended dust emissions are available. A project in the Columbia Plateau of eastern Washington State was initiated to develop an empirical method to estimate dust emissions for this region. Field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and laboratory analyses were combined to provide an empirical wind erosion equation and a related vertical flux dust emission model. While based on measured data, the model has not been independently verified. When combined with a transport-dispersion model and calibrated, estimates of downwind particulate concentrations compared reasonably with those measured. 3awind erosion 3aagricultural land 3aemissions 0adust1 aChandler, D.1 aStetler, L.1 aLamb, B.1 aClaiborn, C.1 aLee, B.H.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2000 , v. 43, no. 3 p.623-630x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle03412naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001500160245013000175300001800305500001500323520208300338650002502421650001502446650001702461650001702478650001502495650001902510650001202529650001902541650001602560650001102576653003602587653001902623700001702642700002502659700002102684773011202705852000902817856008102826930003302907945001302940946001302953655001202966IND2036240320221120035920.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203624032DNAL7 a166531992pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.17962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRock, C.D.14aThe aba mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. has reduced chlorophyll fluorescence yields and reduced thylakoid stacking  ap. 1796-1801.  a2019-12-04  aIt has been shown that the aba mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. is impaired in epoxy-carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulates the epoxy-carotenoid precursor, zeaxanthin (C.D. Rock, J.A.D. Zeevaart [1991] Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 88: 7496-7499). In addition to providing conclusive evidence for the indirect pathway of abscisic acid biosynthesis from epoxy-carotenoids, the aba mutation offers a powerful means to study the function of xanthophylls (oxygenated carotenoids) in photosynthesis. We measured in vivo the chlorophyll (Chl) fluorescence parameters Fo (initial), Fm (maximum), Fv (variable = Fm - Fo), and t1/2 (half-rise time of fluorescence induction) of wild-type (WT) and three allelic aba mutants. The mutant genotypes had significantly lower Fo and Fm values relative to those of WT. The Fv/Fm ratio and t1/2, which are parameters affected by photochemical efficiency, photosystem II (PSII), and plastoquinone pool sizes, were similar in the aba alleles and WT. Because the aba genotypes accumulate high levels of zeaxanthin, which is involved in nonphotochemical quenching of Chl fluorescence, we propose that the reduced fluorescence yields in the aba genotypes are a consequence of the accumulated zeaxanthin. Measurement of PSII oxygen evolution rates in isolated thylakoid membranes of WT and aba-4 confirmed that quantum efficiency was not altered in aba-4 but indicated that the mutant had reduced PsII activity in vitro. Electron microscopy revealed an abnormal chloroplast ultrastructure in the aba plants: the mutants had significantly fewer thylakoid lamellae per granum stack but significantly more grana per chloroplast, as well as more chloroplasts per cell than WT. Immunoblot analysis established that aba-4 had normal levels of the Chl a/b-binding core polypeptide of PSII (CP29) and the PSII light-harvesting Chl a/b-binding complex. These results provide evidence for the role of zeaxanthin in nonphotochemical fluorescence quenching and suggest involvement of epoxy-carotenoids and/or zeaxanthin in thylakoid stacking and PSII activity. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3athylakoids 3afluorescence 3agas exchange 3azeaxanthin 3aphotosystem II 3amutants 3aultrastructure 3achlorophyll 3aoxygen 0achlorophyll a/b binding protein 0aphotosynthesis1 aBowlby, N.R.1 aHoffmann-Benning, S.1 aZeevaart, J.A.D.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1796-1801aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.17963Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03715naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245010100146300001800247520201600265650001502281650001602296650002102312650002602333650001602359650001202375650001402387650002302401650001502424650001902439650000702458650001102465650003202476650001302508650001802521650001702539650004702556650001202603650002302615650003702638650001402675650001102689650001102700650002002711650002602731650005102757650001202808650005602820653002302876653001602899700001802915700001602933773008402949852000903033930003303042945001303075946001303088655001203101IND2042344420221120035917.0940929e199407  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204234442DNAL7 a79299652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSanchez, W.K.10aMacromineral nutrition by heat stress interactions in dairy cattle: review and original research  ap. 2051-2079.  aThis paper examines whether or not responses of dairy cattle to various dietary macromineral elements differed in hot weather compared with thermoneutral conditions. The consequences of heat stress and the interrelationships of macromineral elements on feed intake, digestive function, use of dietary buffers, mineral element uptake from the portal-drained viscera, perturbation of acid-base physiology and related mineral element nutrition, effects of dietary macromineral element concentrations on lactational performance as affected by season, and influence of mineral elements in drinking water are reviewed, and new research results are presented. Dietary mineral buffers aided in alleviation of the decline in DMI and milk yield induced by heat stress. New research results showed that portal plasma flow declined with heat stress or by restriction of DMI in a thermoneutral environment and that uptake of P from the portal-drained viscera by lactating cows was reduced 50% by heat stress compared with that of cows with the same DMI in a thermoneutral environment. Accelerated respiration rate caused respiratory alkalosis and apparently compensated metabolic acidosis, changing the demand for Na and K during heat stress. There is need to characterize more accurately the nyctohemeral pattern of acid-base physiology in the heat-stressed lactating dairy cow and to relate it to macromineral element needs. A large data set (n = 1444 cow period means) was used to compare milk yield and DMI responses to varying dietary concentrations of P, Na, K, Cl, Ca, Mg, and cation-anion difference in summer compared with those in winter. Interactions of dietary concentrations of Cl, Ca, and Mg with season on DMI and K, Ca, and Mg with season on 4% FCM yield were detected. Interactions of Na by Cl, Na by P, and Cl by P with season on DMI and of Cl by P with season on 4% FCM yield were detected. High concentrations of sulfate and chloride in drinking water jeopardized productivity of cows during hot weather. 3adairy cows 3aheat stress 3adietary minerals 3anutrient requirements 3afeed intake 3abuffers 3adigestion 3aseasonal variation 3amilk yield 3adrinking water 3apH 3aanions 3adietary mineral supplements 3asalinity 3awater quality 3asaline water 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseasesxphysiopathology 2aDigestion 2aEating 2aFemale 2aHot Temperature 2aLactationxphysiology 2aMineralsxadministration & dosagexmetabolism. 2aSeasons 2aStress, Physiologicalxphysiopathologyxveterinary. 0aliterature reviews 0aion balance1 aMcGuire, M.A.1 aBeede, D.K.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 July, v. 77, no. 7 p.2051-2079x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19941102b19941107c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02516naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001600160245018700176300001800363500001500381520121800396650001401614650001701628650001101645650001801656650001101674653001701685653001501702653002001717653002501737653001301762653002401775700001701799700001701816773011201833852000901945856008101954930003302035945001302068946001302081655001202094IND2036239320221120035845.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203623932DNAL7 a166531892pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.17242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoejima, H.10aChanges in cytokinin activities and mass spectrometric analysis of cytokinins in root exudates of rice plant (Oryza sativa L.). Comparison between cultivars nipponbare and akenohoshi  ap. 1724-1729.  a2019-12-04  aChanges in exudation rate and cytokinin activities in the exudates were measured in two varieties of rice (Oryza sativa L.), cv Nipponbare (a Japanese normal cultivar) and cv Akenohoshi (a high-yielding cultivar). The exudation rates of Akenohoshi, the leaves of which remained green for a longer time, were higher than those of Nipponbare after the booting stage. Cytokinin activities in the exudates of Akenohoshi were higher than those of Nipponbare during the ripening period. Cytokinins in the exudates collected during the middle of the ripening stage were analyzed with mass spectrometry using deuterium-labeled standards. trans-Zeatin, trans-ribosylzeatin, and N6-isopentenyladenosine were detected as free cytokinins, and zeatin was detected in the hydrolysates of highly polar fractions ("conjugated zeatin") in the exudates of both cultivars. Conjugated zeatin was the predominant cytokinin in both cultivars. Therefore, we suggest that conjugated zeatin is an important form of cytokinin during the ripening stage. The level of each of the cytokinins in Akenohoshi was higher than that in Nipponbare. Also, we discuss the correlation between the leaf senescence and cytokinin content in root exudates. 3acultivars 3aOryza sativa 3azeatin 3aroot exudates 3aleaves 0atrans-zeatin 0asenescence 0azeatin riboside 0aisopentenyladenosine 0aexudates 0atrans-ribosylzeatin1 aSugiyama, T.1 aIshihara, K.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1724-1729aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.17243Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle03092naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245009000171300001600261520134300277650001501620650001201635650001701647650001201664650001201676650002701688650001301715650001101728650001301739650001301752650001901765650001401784650001001798650001601808650001501824650000901839650001401848650001501862650001301877650001301890650001901903650001401922650001101936650001101947650001601958650002301974650001801997650001002015650000902025651002102034653002402055653002102079653001302100653001002113700001802123700001702141773013402158852000902292856008502301930003302386946001102419655001202430IND4411336120221120035818.0081010e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441133612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-007-0068-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTayfur, G.q(Gökmen)10aGroundwater quality and hydrogeochemical properties of Torbalı Region, Izmir, Turkey  ap. 157-169.  aThe large demand for drinking, irrigation and industrial water in the region of Torbalı (Izmir, Turkey) is supplied from groundwater sources. Almost every factory and farm has private wells that are drilled without permission. These cause the depletion of groundwater and limiting the usage of groundwater. This study investigates spatial and temporal change in groundwater quality, relationships between quality parameters, and sources of contamination in Torbalı region. For this purpose, samples were collected from 10 different sampling points chosen according to their geological and hydrogeological properties and location relative to factories, between October 2001 and July 2002. Various physical (pH, temperature, EC), chemical (calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, chloride, alkalinity, copper, chromium, cadmium, lead, zinc) and organic (nitrate, nitrite, ammonia, COD and cyanide) parameters were monitored. It was observed that the groundwater has bicarbonate alkalinity. Agricultural contamination was determined in the region, especially during the summer. Nitrite and ammonia concentrations were found to be above drinking water standard. Organic matter contamination was also investigated in the study area. COD concentrations were higher than the permissible limits during the summer months of the monitoring period. 3aalkalinity 3aammonia 3abicarbonates 3acadmium 3acalcium 3achemical oxygen demand 3achromium 3acopper 3acyanides 3adrinking 3adrinking water 3afactories 3afarms 3agroundwater 3airrigation 3alead 3amagnesium 3amonitoring 3anitrates 3anitrites 3aorganic matter 3apotassium 3asodium 3asummer 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3awater quality 3awells 3azinc 3aTurkey (country) 0aGroundwater quality 0aHydrogeochemical 0aTorbalı 0aIzmir1 aKirer, Tugba 1 aBaba, Alper 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2008 Nov., v. 146, no. 1-3 p.157-169dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-007-0068-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02928naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100002000160245006000180300001800240520145500258650002201713650002401735650003801759650002701797650002201824650002101846650002301867650002001890650001801910650001301928650001601941650001901957653001401976653001401990653003702004653003102041700001702072700002102089700001402110700002002124700001702144773011202161852000902273856008102282930003302363945001302396946001302409655001202422IND2036239420221120033553.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203623942DNAL7 a166531902pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.17302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaertlein, D.A.10aExpression of a bacterial ice nucleation gene in plants  ap. 1730-1736.  aWe have introduced an ice nucleation gene (inaZ) from Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae into Nicotiana tabacum, a freezing-sensitive species, and Solanum commersonii, a freezing-tolerant species. Transformants of both species showed increased ice nucleation activity over untransformed controls. The concentration of ice nuclei detected at -10.5 degrees C in 15 different primary transformants of S. commersonii varied by over 1000-fold, and the most active transformant contained over 100 ice nuclei/mg of tissue. The temperature of the warmest freezing event in plant samples of small mass was increased from approximately -12 degrees C in the untransformed controls to -4 degrees C in inaZ-expressing transformants. The threshold nucleation temperature of samples from transformed plants did not increase appreciably with the mass of the sample. The most abundant protein detected in transgenic plants using immunological probes specific to the inaZ protein exhibited a higher mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels than the inaZ protein from bacterial sources. However, some protein with a similar mobility to the inaZ protein could be detected. Although the warmest ice nucleation temperature detected in transgenic plants is lower than that conferred by this gene in P. syringae (-2 degrees C), our results demonstrate that the ice nucleation gene of P. syringae can be expressed in plant cells to produce functional ice nuclei. 3aNicotiana tabacum 3aSolanum commersonii 3aPseudomonas syringae pv. syringae 3agenetic transformation 3atransgenic plants 3astructural genes 3abacterial proteins 3agene expression 3agene transfer 3afreezing 3atemperature 3aice nucleation 0atolerance 0ainaz gene 0athreshold nucleation temperature 0aice nucleation temperature1 aLindow, S.E.1 aPanopoulos, N.J.1 aLee, S.P.1 aMindrinos, M.N.1 aChen, T.H.H.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1730-1736aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.17303Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle01720naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245007600145300001800221520063100239650001900870650002300889650001900912650002400931650002100955650001900976650004400995650002101039650001101060650003601071650002001107650001301127700001501140700001501155773008401170852000901254930003301263945001301296946001301309655001201322IND2042341420221117161021.0940929e199407  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204234142DNAL7 a79299542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiller, G.D.10aBenefits of the National Dairy Council to the dairy processing industry  ap. 1929-1932.  aThe National Dairy Council's and its affiliated units have had a vital role in presenting the nutritional qualities of US dairy products to a variety of audiences.

Because abscisic acid (ABA) mediates a variety of water-stress responses, we investigated the response of Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs to ABA. When wild-type root hairs were treated with ABA, they exhibited the water-stress response. The Arabidopsis mutants abi1 and abi2, which are insensitive to ABA at the seedling stage, did not display the root hair response. These data suggest that ABA may mediate the response of root hairs to water stress. The drought response of root hairs resulting in an inhibition of tip growth will provide an easy screen to select mutations that are insensitive to ABA and/or involved in tip growth. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aabscisic acid 3aroot hairs 3awater stress 3aplant morphology 3amutants1 aQuatrano, R.S.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 100, no. 1 p.216-218aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.1.2163Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02467naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008700126300001600213520146000229650001901689650003001708650001601738650001401754650001501768650002301783651001501806653001101821700001501832700001801847700001701865700001601882700001701898700002001915773007801935852000902013930003302022945001302055946001302068655001202081IND2321103620221123040129.0010518e200005  miu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232110362DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPlant, R.E.10aRelationships between remotely sensed reflectance data and cotton growth and yield  ap. 535-546.  aRemotely sensed electromagnetic reflectance data can provide at relatively low cost a set of detailed, spatially distributed data on plant growth and development. Vegetation indices based on algebraic combinations of different wavelength bands are especially useful in summarizing reflectance data. One of the most commonly used vegetation indices is the normalized difference vegetation index, or NDVI. The objective of this study was to determine whether measurements based on the NDVI could provide information useful for site-specific management of cotton. Aerial photographs were taken of replicated Acala cotton field experiments in California in which the treatment was water or nitrogen stress level. NDVI integrated over time showed a significant correlation with lint yield in those experiments in which there was a significant stress effect on yield. The spatiotemporal pattern of NDVI reflected stress factors and was approximately coincident with the onset of measurable water stress. NDVI tended to indicate the presence of nitrogen stress even in those cases where the stress did not result in a significant yield reduction. In a study of the correlation of NDVI with late season plant mapping indices NDVI was correlated with nodes above white flower and strongly correlated with nodes above cracked boll. An alternative vegetation index, the relative nitrogen vegetation index, was not better than NDVI as an indicator of nitrogen stress. 3aremote sensing 3aelectromagnetic radiation 3areflectance 3aGossypium 3acrop yield 3aaerial photography 3aCalifornia 0agrowth1 aMunk, D.S.1 aRoberts, B.R.1 aVargas, R.L.1 aRains, D.W.1 aTravis, R.L.1 aHutmacher, R.B.0 tTransactions of the ASAE.g2000 , v. 43, no. 3 p.535-546x0001-23517nnas  aDNAL  a20010702b20010710c00000000  aINDdRAE  aOther US 7aarticle02069naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100002100159245010100180300001600281500001500297520078600312650002201098650001801120650002301138650001501161650002001176650002601196650001401222650001301236650002401249650001101273650001801284653001301302653001801315700001501333700001601348773011101364852000901475856008001484930003301564945001301597946001301610655001201623IND2036172920221123030839.0931208e199209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203617292DNAL7 a166529392pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.1.1572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMartin-Nieto, J.10aBiphasic kinetic behavior of nitrate reductase from heterocystous, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria  ap. 157-163.  a2019-12-04  aNitrate reductase activity from filamentous, heterocyst-forming cyanobacteria showed a biphasic kinetic behavior with respect to nitrate as the variable substrate.

In contrast, among unicellular cyanobacteria, most representatives studied exhibited a monophasic, Michaelis-Menten kinetic pattern for nitrate reductase activity.

Our cultivars are suitable not only for industrial processing, but also for fresh consumption because of their pleasant flavour. Changes in the phytochemicals content of four sour cherry cultivars (âÃrdi jubileumâ, âÃrdi bÅtermÅ, âMaliga emlÃ©keâ, âKÃ¡ntorjÃ¡nosi 3â) were studied in 2008 and 2009. Considering the ripening stage, cherries were examined at three harvest times. Our aim was to optimize the time of harvest according to the antioxidant capacity, nutritional components and also the demands of the industry. Ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP), anthocyanin, polyphenol and water soluble dry matter content of fruits were investigated under laboratory conditions. According to the results of phytochemical composition, it can be stated that the year does not affect the antioxidant capacity. On the other hand quantitative differences were observed. For instance, we established that the optimal harvest time for industrial processing is between the second and third picking. By this time the ferric reducing/antioxidant power, anthocyanin, polyphenol and water-soluble dry matter content of cultivars were the highest. âÃrdi jubileumâ displayed best results with the highest values regarding ferric reducing/antioxidant power, anthocyanin as well as polyphenol content. 3aanthocyanins 3aharvest date 3acultivars 3anutrient content 3adry matter content 3afruits 3aprocessing technology 3aindustry 3aflavor 3aripening 3aantioxidant activity 3aPrunus cerasus 3aantioxidants 3acherries 0aphytochemicals1 aBujdoso, G.1 aToth, M.1 aSteger-Mate, M.1 aNotin, B.1 aKallay, E.1 aSzugyi, S.0 tActa horticulturae.g2014, , no. 1040 p.83-88dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1040/1040_10.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle02782naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245017100169300001400340500002400354520132200378650001501700650002901715650002201744650001901766650001801785650002401803650001001827650001601837650001101853650001201864650001401876650001901890650002001909650002101929650002301950650001501973650002501988650001902013650001302032650002102045700001602066700001802082700001802100773010602118852000902224856005502233655001202288IND4449201020221123030819.0110211e201103  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444920102DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2494.2010.00776.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFaverdin, P.10aGrazeIn: a model of herbage intake and milk production for grazing dairy cows. 1. Prediction of intake capacity, voluntary intake and milk production during lactation  ap. 29-44.  aIncludes references  aThe prediction of both food intake and milk production constitutes a major issue in ruminants. This article presents a model predicting voluntary dry matter intake and milk production by lactating cows fed indoors. This model, with an extension to predict herbage intake at grazing presented in a second article, is used in the Grazemore decision support system. The model is largely based on the INRA fill unit system, consisting of predicting separately the intake capacity of the cows and the fill value (ingestibility) of each feed. The intake capacity model considers potential milk production as a key component of voluntary feed intake. This potential milk production represents the energy requirement of the mammary gland, adjusted by protein supply when the protein availability is limiting. Actual milk production is predicted from the potential milk production and from the nutritional status of the cow. The law of response of milk production is a function of the difference between energy demand and actual energy intake, modulated by protein intake level. The simulation of experimental data from different feeding trials illustrates the performance of the model. This new model enables dynamic simulations of intake and milk production sensitive to feeding management during the whole lactation period. 3adairy cows 3adecision support systems 3adry matter intake 3adynamic models 3aenergy intake 3aenergy requirements 3afeeds 3afood intake 3aforage 3agrazing 3alactation 3amammary glands 3amilk production 3amodel validation 3anutritional status 3aprediction 3aproduction functions 3aprotein intake 3aproteins 3avoluntary intake1 aBaratte, C.1 aDelagarde, R.1 aPeyraud, J.L.0 tGrass and forage science.g2011 Mar., v. 66, no. 1 p.29-44dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0142-52427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2494.2010.00776.x 7aarticle03709naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001400128245015000142300001800292500001500310520191200325650001502237650001302252650001202265650002302277650001602300650002102316650001402337650001802351650001902369650001102388650001602399650001402415650002102429650001702450650002102467650002202488650001502510650002602525650004702551650001202598650001102610650001202621650002302633650005302656650003902709650000902748650001102757650003902768650003602807650003602843653000902879653001602888653001602904773008302920852000903003930003303012945001303045946001303058655001203071IND2041376120221122235151.0940810e199405  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204137612DNAL7 a80460832pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBlock, E.10aManipulation of dietary cation-anion difference on nutritionally related production diseases, productivity, and metabolic responses of dairy cows  ap. 1437-1450.  a2019-12-05  aDietary cation-anion difference has been defined as milliequivalents of (Na + K) - (Cl + S) per kilogram of DM and has a direct impact on blood acid-base metabolism. As this difference decreases, one or more of the following blood parameters change: increased H+, decreased HCO-3, and decreased pH. These changes are accompanied by reduced urinary HCO-3 excretion and pH as compensatory mechanisms. Although other minerals have an impact on acid-base metabolism, the four minerals used in dietary cation-anion difference have the greatest effect. Manipulation of acid-base balance can be used to manipulate other biological functions to benefit health and productivity of cows. Low cation-anion difference prepartum can mitigate hypocalcemia peripartum via increased urinary Ca, blood-ionized Ca, and responsiveness to Ca homeostatic hormones. These changes reduced the incidence of paresis and increased productivity by reducing the severity and length of hypocalcemia in all cows (periparturient), regardless of the occurrence of paresis. Reduced cation-anion differences prepartum have been related to a reduced severity of udder edema, likely related to increased renal loss of water and unchanged water intake. However, the effects on acid-base balance cannot be ruled out because of effects on biochemical and transport processes. Elevated cation-anion difference in lactation has been shown to increase DMI and production and to mitigate the effects of heat stress. Because production and heat stress are acidogenic, elevated cation-anion difference improves blood-buffering capacity to cope with H+. In heat stress, elevated water intake with elevated cation-anion difference cannot be ignored. Other diseases related to metabolic acid, such as laminitis and ketoacidosis, may be influenced by elevated cation-anion difference in lactation; however, research in these areas has not been forthcoming. 3adairy cows 3asulfates 3acalcium 3adisease prevention 3aparturition 3aactive transport 3achlorides 3aion transport 3arenal function 3asodium 3ahomeostasis 3apotassium 3afeed formulation 3ablood plasma 3adietary minerals 3aacid-base balance 3amilk fever 2aAcid-Base Equilibrium 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aAnions 2aCations 2aCattlexphysiology 2aCattle Diseasesxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aChloridesxadministration & dosage 2aDiet 2aFemale 2aPotassiumxadministration & dosage 2aSodiumxadministration & dosage 2aSulfurxadministration & dosage 0adiet 0aion balance 0arespiration0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1437-1450x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02859naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245014600148300001600294500001500310520120900325650002601534650001301560650001201573650001701585650002601602650002301628650001201651650002001663650001601683650002301699650001201722650004401734650003601778650004401814650002201858650002001880650003801900650004001938650004001978650001502018650002402033650002502057650001202082653001802094653001502112653001202127773012302139852000902262939003302271946001302304655001202317IND9201367120221122235137.0920310e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920136712DNAL7 a19097942pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAugustine, P.C.10aMonoclonal antibody produced against partially purified sporozoite antigen inhibits invasion of cells by sporozoites of avian Eimeria species  ap. 606-611.  a2019-12-05  aPrevious studies showed that molecules of in vitro-cultured primary turkey kidney cells bound to 23-, 40-, and 60- to 65-kDa antigens of sodium dodecyl sulfate-solubilized sporozoites of Eimeria adenoeides. Similar binding to antigens of three other species of avian Eimeria, E. tenella, E. acervulina, and E. meleagrimitis, is now reported. Strips containing the most avidly bound sporozoite antigen (approximately 40 kDa) were excised from the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels on which E. adenoeides antigens had been electrophoretically separated. The strips were homogenized and injected into mice to produce hybridoma cell lines. Twelve cell lines secreting monoclonal antibodies (McAb) that reacted with E. adenoeides sporozoites were detected. One of these McAb, H11C3, reacted with structures in the anterior tip of sporozoites of E. adenoeides and five other species of avian Eimeria. When included in the inoculation medium, this McAb significantly inhibited invasion of cultured kidney cells by sporozoites of E. adenoeides and E. tenella. In contrast, when the sporozoites were pretreated with McAb H11C3 and then washed free of the antibody, no inhibition of invasion was observed. 3aEimeria meleagrimitis 3aantigens 3aturkeys 3acell culture 3amonoclonal antibodies 3aEimeria acervulina 3akidneys 3aEimeria tenella 3asporozoites 3aEimeria adenoeides 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Monoclonalxtherapeutic use 2aAntigens, Protozoanximmunology 2aApicomplexaximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aBlotting, Western 2aCells, Cultured 2aCoccidiosisxprevention & control 2aEimeriaximmunologyxpathogenicity. 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHybridomas 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aKidneyxmicrobiology 2aTurkeys 0acell invasion 0ainhibition 0abinding0 tProceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.g1991 Oct., v. 198, no. 1 p.606-611x0037-97277nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02743naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001500159245010500174300001600279500001500295520162300310650001701933650003001950650003001980650001602010650001602026653001602042653001602058653002002074700001602094773011102110852000902221856008002230930003302310945001302343946001302356655001202369IND2036186720221122235150.0931209e199209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203618672DNAL7 a166529702pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.1.3672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTing, C.S.10aLimitations of the pulse-modulated technique for measuring the fluorescence characteristics of algae  ap. 367-373.  a2019-12-04  aPrecise measurements of the minimal fluorescence yield (Fo) and maximal fluorescence yield (Fm) of a dark-adapted sample are prerequisites for the quantification of other fluorescence parameters. The pulse amplitude-modulated chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM 101 Chlorophyll Fluorometer, Heinz Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) and saturating pulse technique have frequently been used in measuring Fo and Fm and in resolving the contributions of photochemical and nonphotochemical quenching to the total fluorescence yield. The extent to which instrument-dependent factors may affect the accurate measurement of Fo and Fm is addressed. It is shown that the increase in pulse amplitude-modulated measuring beam intensity at 1.6 and 100 kHz was nonlinear at higher light intensity settings. The implications of this for measurements of Fo (1.6 kHz) and Fm (100 kHz) are discussed. It is also demonstrated that underestimation of Fm may result due to saturation of the PAM 101 photodiode by scattered infrared light associated with intense light pulses. In addition, it is shown how sample-dependent factors may affect measurements of Fo and Fm in samples with low chlorophyll concentrations, in particular, dilute algal suspensions of Phaeodactylum tricornutum and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A technique is presented for the accurate measurement of Fm in algal suspensions < 8 micrograms chlorophyll a mL-1). The importance of examining the saturating pulse transient and Fm level as a function of the damping setting, pulse width, and pulse intensity, and in the presence of 3- (3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1, 1 dimethylurea is discussed. 3afluorescence 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aChlamydomonas reinhardtii 3ameasurement 3achlorophyll 0afluorometry 0afluorimetry 0aBacillariophyta1 aOwens, T.G.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 100, no. 1 p.367-373aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.1.3673Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02838naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001500159245009800174300001600272500001500288520167500303650001601978650002201994650001202016650001802028650002002046650002802066650001702094653001702111700001702128700001802145700001802163773011102181852000902292856008002301930003302381945001302414946001302427655001202440IND2036186220221122225606.0931209e199209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203618622DNAL7 a166529682pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.1.3522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirsch, T.10aPlant dihydroxyacetone phosphate reductases: Purification, characterization, and localization  ap. 352-359.  a2019-12-04  aA cytosolic form of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) reductase was purified 200,000-fold from spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) leaves to apparent electrophoretic homogeneity. The purification procedure included anion-exchange chromatography, gel filtration, hydrophobic chromatography, and dye-ligand chromatography on Green-A and Red-A agaroses. The enzyme, prepared in an overall yield of 14%, had a final specific activity of about 500, micromole of DHAP reduced min-1 mg-1 protein, a subunit molecular mass of 38 kD, and a native molecular mass of 75 kD. A chloroplastic isoform of DHAP reductase was separated from the cytosolic form by anion-exchange chromatography and partially purified 56,000 -old to a specific activity of 135 micromole min-1 mg-1 protein. Antibodies generated in rabbits against the cytosolic form did not crossreact with the chloroplastic isoform. The two reductases were specific for NADH and DHAP. Although they exhibited some dissimilarities, both isoforms were severely inhibited by higher molecular weight fatty acyl coenzyme A esters and phosphohydroxypyruvate and moderately inhibited by nucleotides. In contrast to previous reports, the partially purified chloroplastic enzyme was not stimulated by dithiothreitol or thioredoxin, nor was the purified cytosolic enzyme stimulated by fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. A third DHAP reductase isoform was isolated from spinach leaf peroxisomes that had been prepared by isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The peroxisomal DHAP reductase was sensitive to antibodies raised against the cytosolic enzyme and had a slightly smaller subunit molecular weight than the cytosolic isoform. 3aperoxisomes 3aSpinacia oleracea 3acytosol 3acytochemistry 3aenzyme activity 3aalcohol oxidoreductases 3achloroplasts 0apurification1 aGerber, D.W.1 aByerrum, R.U.1 aTolbert, N.E.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Sept., v. 100, no. 1 p.352-359aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.1.3523Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02361naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245011700147300001800264500001500282520109200297650001901389650002001408650003101428650001001459650002601469650001601495650003001511650001201541650001001553653002801563653002001591653003001611653001701641653001201658700001401670700001701684700001801701700001301719700001801732773009801750852000901848939003301857946001301890655001201903IND8803777720221122180907.0880906e198808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND880377772DNAL7 a163477162pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHayashida, S.10aIdentification and characteristics of actinomycetes useful for semicontinuous treatment of domestic animal feces  ap. 2058-2063.  a2019-12-04  aSelected strains of actinomycetes useful for practicing semicontinuous treatment of swine and poultry feces were indentified as Streptomyces antibioticus S-4, S. puniceus N-50-2, S. nigrifaciens N-9-3, Thermoactinomyces vulgaris HIR-60, and Thermomonospora viridis HIR-50. These five obligately aerobic strains grew preferably on nonsterilized fresh swine feces in 24 h without any additives. They assimilated offensive volatile fatty acids in the swine and poultry feces.

Strain HIR-50 grew most predominantly on both fresh swine and poultry feces at 50 to 55 degrees C and decomposed uric acid.

The actinomycete biofertilizer thus manufactured in 10 days was odorless and promotive of plant growth. 3aanimal manures 3awaste treatment 3aThermoactinomyces vulgaris 3afeces 3aStreptomyces puniceus 3atemperature 3aStreptomyces antibioticus 3apoultry 3aswine 0athermomonospora viridis 0aActinomycetales 0astreptomyces nigrifacines 0aStreptomyces 0aexcreta1 aNanri, N.1 aTeramoto, Y.1 aNishimoto, T.1 aOhta, K.1 aMiyaguchi, M.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g1988 Aug., v. 54, no. 8 p.2058-2063x0099-22407nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19880906c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03095naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111024003200140040001800172100001800190245015000208300001800358500002400376506002800400506003000428520139700458596004401855596008301899596004501982506003702027650001302064650002502077650001102102650002602113650002602139650001302165650001402178650001302192650002102205650001502226650002702241650001402268651002302282700001802305700002102323773013502344852000902479856007902488903002202567655001202589IND4410660320221207113846.0080926e200810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441066032DNAL7 a216323302pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.20071592doi7 a10.3732/ajb.20071592chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzales, Eva10aComparison of clonal diversity in mountain and Piedmont populations of Trillium cuneatum (Melanthiaceae-Trilliaceae), a forest understory species  ap. 1254-1261.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Access  aWiley License Information  aThe balance between clonal and sexual reproduction can vary widely among plant populations, and the extent of clonality may be influenced by the combined effects of historical land use and variation in environmental conditions. We investigated patterns of clonal spread in five Trillium cuneatum populations, two in the Appalachian Mountains characterized by mesic, cooler conditions, and three at lower elevations experiencing warmer, drier conditions and greater disturbance. Using a new measure of the genet effective number and innovative orthogonal contrast methods, we quantified genet structure, contrasting clonal growth in the mountains with that in the Piedmont. Asexual propagation was more common in the Piedmont, where 25% of the sampled ramets were clonally derived, but was much less frequent in the mountains (7% clonal replicates). Hierarchical partitioning of variation in genet diversity showed that the majority (75.8%) of the variation resulted from more vegetative replication in the Piedmont. Most of the remaining variation (21.6%) was attributable to differences between urban and rural Piedmont populations, and a small, statistically nonsignificant fraction of the variation (2.6%) was due to interpopulation differences within the mountains. Higher frequency of cloning may enhance both genetic and demographic population viability in fragmented Piedmont habitats.  cNSFdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100000001  cNew Jersey Agricultural Experiment Stationdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/100011133  cUSDAdhttps://doi.org/10.13039/1000001990 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aTrillium 3aasexual reproduction 3aclones 3aenvironmental factors 3ahabitat fragmentation 3aland use 3amountains 3apiedmont 3arural population 3aunderstory 3avegetative propagation 3aviability 3aAppalachian region1 aHamrick, J.L.1 aSmouse, Peter E.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2008 Oct., v. 95, no. 10 p.1254-1261dBotanical Society of AmericawJournal:jnl35737x0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.20071593Available from publisher's Web site  aVersion of Record 7aarticle02508naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245009100146300001800237520107500255650001101330650002101341650001601362650001201378650002301390650001701413650002301430650001101453650001501464650001001479650002801489650001101517650002101528650001301549650002301562650002201585650001101607650003101618650002301649650001601672650000901688650001601697650002201713650002101735700001501756700001401771700001801785773008301803852000901886930003301895945001301928946001301941655001201954IND2041368520221122141515.0940810e199405  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204136852DNAL7 a80460642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuinard, J.X.10aEffect of sugar and acid on the acceptability of frozen yogurt to a student population  ap. 1232-1238.  aOne hundred and forty-one college students tasted and rated on a nine-point hedonic scale their degree of liking for nine samples of vanilla frozen yogurt varying in sugar and lactic acid. Subjects were also asked to complete a questionnaire about consumption of frozen yogurt and other dairy products. Degree of liking differed significantly among samples, and the samples best liked were those with the lowest acidity, .23 to .29%, independent of sugar concentration. Degree of liking of frozen yogurt failed to correlate with dairy product consumption or hunger at the time of testing. No significant difference existed between male and female students for overall degree of liking of frozen yogurt or overall dairy product intake, yet the questionnaire revealed a significantly higher consumption of frozen yogurt among female students. The results of this study suggest that, for the student population tested, frozen yogurt should combine the sensory properties of ice cream (low acidity) with the nutritional properties of yogurt (low fat, active enzyme culture). 3ayogurt 3acollege students 3alactic acid 3aacidity 3asensory evaluation 3afood choices 3agender differences 3asugars 2aAdolescent 2aAdult 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFood Preferences 2aFreezing 2aFructosexanalysis 2aGlucosexanalysis 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aLactatesxanalysis 2aLactic Acid 2aMale 2aSex Factors 2aSucrosexanalysis 2aYogurtxanalysis1 aLittle, C.1 aMarty, C.1 aPalchak, T.R.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1232-1238x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19940907b19940913c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02216naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001700152245013300169300001600302500002400318520119600342650002301538650001201561650001701573650002801590650000901618650001601627700001601643700001701659700001901676700002001695773009901715852000901814856005501823655001201878IND4445663820221122111140.0101126e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444566382DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01772.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, L.‐Y.10aQTL analysis for heading date and yield traits using recombinant inbred lines of indica rice grown in different cropping seasons  ap. 676-682.  aIncludes references  aWith 1 figure and 4 tables ABSTRACT: Understanding the genetic control of heading date and yield traits has significant implications for rice improvement. A recombinant inbred population of the indica rice cross ‘Zhong 156'/‘Gumei 2' was grown with sowing date corresponding to the early, mid and late cropping in the Southern China rice growing region, respectively. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for heading date and six yield traits were determined with a linkage map consisting of 198 markers and spanning 1630.2 cM. Totally 42 QTLs were detected, of which 13 showed significant additive effects and additive‐by‐environment interaction effects, 28 showed significant additive effects only, and one displayed a significant effect in one trial only. QTLs showing major effects on yield traits were identified in the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 3 and 7, clustering with QTLs for heading date in coupling phase. Three more QTL clusters were detected, including two for yield traits and one for yield traits and heading date. In the utilization of potentially valuable QTLs for yield traits, their relationships with QTLs for heading date should be carefully considered. 3achromosome mapping 3aheading 3ainbred lines 3aquantitative trait loci 3arice 3asowing date1 aWu, J.‐L.1 aFan, Y.‐Y.1 aCheng, S.‐H.1 aZhuang, J.‐Y.0 tPlant breeding.g2010 Dec., v. 129, no. 6 p.676-682dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0179-95417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0523.2010.01772.x 7aarticle02818naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003100111040001800142100001800160245011500178300001800293500001500311520149900326650002101825650001801846650001401864650001401878650002801892650002201920650001401942650002001956650001601976650001601992650001102008650001102019653001702030653002202047653001102069700001902080773011202099852000902211856008102220930003302301945001302334946001302347655001202360IND2036246620221122111126.0931210e199212  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203624662DNAL7 a166532152pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.4.19012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKnauber, D.C.10aPhenotypic analysis of a dwarf wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with altered phytochrome-mediated growth responses  ap. 1901-1908.  a2019-12-04  aThe influence of the amount of red light relative to far red light (red/far red ratio) on leaf-sheath elongation, leaf length, tillering, assimilate partitioning to shoots and roots, and chlorophyll content in a dwarf wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Tibet Dwarf) and seven other dwarf and standard cultivars was determined. All cultivars tested showed far red-stimulated leaf and leaf-sheath elongation except Tibet Dwarf. Tibet Dwarf was also unresponsive to a brief end-of-day exposure to far red light, although the other cultivars exhibited increased leaf-sheath and leaf length. In these cultivars, the effects of an end-of-day 5-min far red exposure were reversible by a subsequent 5-min red light exposure. Shoot/root ratios were higher and tillering was suppressed by increased far red irradiance in all cultivars except Tibet Dwarf. In addition, Tibet Dwarf was less responsive to dark-induced leaf and leaf-sheath elongation (etiolation) and retained chlorophyll in dark-adapted leaves longer than control cultivars. Tibet Dwarf did not differ from the other cultivars in leaf chlorophyll content. Western blot analysis, using an antibody against phytochrome A, showed that dark-grown Tibet Dwarf shoots contained at least twice the amount of detectable phytochrome A protein present in the other wheat cultivars. These results, plus the short, thick-stemmed, dark-pigmented phenotype of Tibet Dwarf suggest the possibility of a mutation in the phytochrome/signal transduction pathway. 3aroot shoot ratio 3afar-red light 3aphenotype 3atillering 3adry matter partitioning 3aTriticum aestivum 3ared light 3adwarf cultivars 3aphytochrome 3achlorophyll 3aleaves 3ashoots 0aleaf sheaths 0aplant development 0agrowth1 aBanowetz, G.M.0 tPlant physiology.g1992 Dec., v. 100, no. 4 p.1901-1908aPlant physiology (Lancaster, Pa.)x0032-08897nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1104/pp.100.4.19013Available from publisher's Web site  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdMKS  aOther US 7aarticle02593naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245013000179300001800309500002400327520104100351650003001392650001201422650001001434650001401444650002001458650001301478650002701491650001201518650003401530650002501564650002301589650002001612650001301632650002801645650002701673650002401700650003101724650002701755700001801782700002401800700002501824700001701849700002101866700002101887773011001908852000902018856004802027655001202075IND4412144820221122111135.0081101e200811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441214482DNAL7 a187699032pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-008-0867-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, Huw10aMinimising inter-laboratory variation when constructing a unified molecular database of plant varieties in an allogamous crop  ap. 1335-1344.  aIncludes references  aThe construction of large-scale databases of molecular profiles of plant varieties for variety identification and diversity analyses is of considerable interest. When varieties of an allogamous species such as oilseed rape are analysed and described using molecular markers such as microsatellites, care is needed to represent the variety in a meaningful yet useful way. It is possible to characterise such heterogeneous genotypes by analysing bulked samples comprising more than one individual seed or plant, but this approach may result in complex microsatellite profiles. Intuitively it would be reasonable to represent a variety by the common 'major alleles' in a profile, but how to define these 'major alleles' remains problematic. This paper describes methods of analysing DNA microsatellite data that will allow independent and objective data production at a number of laboratories. Methods for establishing allele scoring rules (thresholding) are described and the effect of these rules on the utility of the data is discussed. 3aBrassica napus var. napus 3aalleles 3acrops 3adatabases 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3amicrosatellite repeats 2aAlleles 2aCrops, Agriculturalxgenetics 2aDNA, Plantxanalysis 2aDatabases, Genetic 2aGenetic Markers 2aGenotype 2aLaboratoriesxstandards 2aMicrosatellite Repeats 2aReference Standards 2aReproducibility of Results 2aSequence Analysis, DNA1 aBernole, Anne1 aJensen, Louise Bach1 aHorsnell, Richard A.1 aLaw, John R.1 aCooke, Robert J.1 aNorris, Carol E.0 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2008 Nov., v. 117, no. 8 p.1335-1344dSpringer-Verlagx0040-57527nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-008-0867-3 7aarticle02008naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009300126300001800219520119200237650001801429650001901447650002001466650002001486651001301506653001501519700002001534773008401554852000901638930003301647945001301680946001301693655001201706IND2040957720221122063950.0940721e199404  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204095772DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSpain, J.N.10aWhy Missouri dairy farms discontinue dairy herd improvement association testing programs  ap. 1141-1145.  aMissouri dairy producers who discontinued DHIA testing between May 1990 and July 1991 were surveyed by mail for a total of 148 herds. Forty-five complete surveys were returned. Seventy-five percent of respondents reported an average herd size between 26 and 75 cows. Participation in DHIA ranged from <1 to >20 yr. Reasons for discontinuing DHIA included poor service, cost, dispersal sale, replacement with other records, or no benefit received. Producers reporting poor service identified supervisor service or records processing center. Fifty-four percent of producers that had been on test >3 yr discontinued DHIA following dispersal sale. Producers indicated that DHIA was replaced using on-farm computers, handwritten records, or bulk tank shipped weights. When asked how records were used for management decisions, 87.5% used records for culling decisions, 55.0% used records for mastitis and nutrition management, and 42.5% used records for reproduction management. Forty percent of herds were on test <3 yr, suggesting that an opportunity exists for educational programs with new herds on DHIA. Supervisor training and performance were also factors in maintaining herds on test. 3adairy farming 3aquestionnaires 3amilk production 3adecision making 3aMissouri 0aevaluation1 aWitherspoon, M.0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 Apr., v. 77, no. 4 p.1141-1145x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02354naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245010600145300001800251520116400269650001501433650001201448650001301460650002201473650002101495650001201516650001301528650001101541650004501552650001301597650005001610650001101660650000901671650001101680650001401691651001801705651001801723653001501741773008401756852000901840930003301849945001301882946001301895655001201908IND2040957920221122063932.0940721e199404  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204095792DNAL7 a82010492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBerger, P.J.10aGenetic prediction for calving ease in the United States: data, models, and use by the dairy industry  ap. 1146-1153.  aDystocia of Holsteins has a major economic impact on the dairy cattle industry. Genetic evaluation of AI sires for calving ease is sponsored by the National Association of Animal Breeders. The AI organizations and dairy records processing centers collect data from herds that have progeny of AI bulls. Genetic predictions of merit for calving ease have been available for Holstein AI bulls in the US since 1978. A threshold model was implemented during 1988. The threshold model adjusts for the effects of herd-year, season, sex of calf, parity, and birth-year group of sire to predict the genetic merit of each sire for calving ease. Pedigree information from sires, sons, and grandsons is also included in the analysis to improve the reliability of genetic predictions for bulls that have pedigree data available. Each sire's genetic prediction for calving ease is reported as the expected percentage of difficult births of primiparous cows. National in scope, genetic predictions for calving ease are used internationally by breeders of dairy cattle to minimize the risk of difficult births of primiparous cows and to increase the use of AI for young cows. 3adairy cows 3acalving 3adystocia 3agenetic variation 3alactation number 2aAnimals 2aBreeding 2aCattle 2aCattle Diseasesxepidemiologyxgenetics. 2aDairying 2aDystociaxepidemiologyxgeneticsxveterinary. 2aFemale 2aMale 2aParity 2aPregnancy 3aUnited States 0aUnited States 0aevaluation0 tJournal of dairy science.g1994 Apr., v. 77, no. 4 p.1146-1153x0022-03027nnas  aDNAL  a19940802b19940811c00000000  aINDdJIT  aOther US 7aarticle02073naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001900110245014900129300001400278500016500292520078500457650002501242650001701267650002001284650002101304650002101325650001101346650002001357650001101377650001801388650002401406650002501430650001901455650001601474650001501490773013501505856005001640852000901690655001201699IND4486426620221122055136.0141110e20140623xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448642662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDesjardins, Y.10aEcological and physiological functions of fruits and vegetables bioactive molecules in plants and potential new mode of action in the human body  ap. 53-62.  aPaper presented at the Third International Symposium on Human Health Effects of Fruits and Vegetables - FAVHEALTH 2009 held October 18-21 2009, Avignon, France.  aFruits and vegetables (FAVs) consumption provides many benefits to health and they are known to prevent chronic diseases. The beneficial effects of FAV have been attributed to bioactive phytochemicals and especially to polyphenols, which display antioxidant activity in vitro. However, due to the poor bioavailability of these compounds and their negligible contribution to the antioxidant network of the body, new hypotheses are being proposed to explain their action. In this paper, we suggest that polyphenols are providing important cues on the quality of the diet consumed which trigger metabolic adaptation through specific gene expression induction. We also suggest that these molecules have pre-biotic effects in the gut and influence the immune system among other things. 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abioavailability 3achronic diseases 3adigestive system 3afruits 3agene expression 3ahumans 3aimmune system 3amechanism of action 3anutritional adequacy 3aphytochemicals 3apolyphenols 3avegetables0 tActa horticulturae.g2014, , no. 1040 p.53-62dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://www.actahort.org/books/1040/1040_6.htm  aDNAL 7aarticle03309naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002100111024003900132040001800171100002100189245009600210300001600306520154400322650001001866650000901876650002201885650004301907650005201950650002902002650005702031650001102088650006102099650003902160650004102199650004002240650003102280650001102311650000902322650001602331650003902347650002402386700001902410700001902429700002302448700001902471700002402490700001902514773009002533852000902623856008902632939003302721946001302754655001202767IND4370781420141222000000.0050529e200501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437078142DNAL7 a156349662pmid7 aPMC5401212pmcid7 a10.1128/JCM.43.1.163-167.20052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRovery, Clarisse10aPCR Detection of Bacteria on Cardiac Valves of Patients with Treated Bacterial Endocarditis  ap. 163-167.  aWe used broad-range PCR amplification and sequencing to detect and identify bacterial DNA in 156 valves of patients treated for infective endocarditis (IE). Bacterial DNA was found more frequently in patients who underwent valve replacement while on antibiotic treatment for IE (60%) than in patients who had completed antibiotic treatment for IE (37%; P = 0.02). We found specific bacterial DNA in valves removed from 11 of 30 patients who had completed antibiotic treatment for IE. Six had no histological evidence of IE. The presence of DNA was significantly correlated with the presence of histologic lesions (P = 0.001) and with the presence of bacteria detected by Gram staining (P < 0.001). Bartonella and streptococci were detected for much longer after antibiotic treatment by PCR than other species (P = 0.047 and 0.04, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were detected for much shorter periods (P = 0.02). The finding that bacterial DNA was more likely to be detected in valves of patients with active IE than in patients who had completed antibiotic treatment for IE shows that bacterial DNA is cleared slowly. There was no significant correlation between the duration of antibiotic therapy and the presence of bacterial DNA in valves. Since the persistence of bacterial DNA in valves does not necessarily indicate the persistence of viable bacteria, the detection of bacterial DNA in valves from IE patients should be interpreted with caution, in particular in those patients with a past history of treated IE. 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aBartonellaxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aEndocarditis, Bacterialxdrug therapyxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aGram-Positive Coccixgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aHeart Valve Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aHeart Valve Prosthesisxmicrobiology 2aHeart Valve Prosthesis Implantation 2aHeart Valvesxmicrobiology 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aProspective Studies1 aGreub, Gilbert1 aLepidi, Hubert1 aCasalta, Jean-Paul1 aHabib, Gilbert1 aCollart, Frédéric1 aRaoult, Didier0 tJournal of clinical microbiology.g2005 Jan., v. 43, no. 1 p.163-167x0095-11377nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.43.1.163-167.20053Available from publisher's Web site  a00000000b00000000c20111102  aOther US 7aarticle01629naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003000111040001800141100001600159245012300175300001600298520039900314650001600713650001800729650002300747650002900770650002000799650002600819650001300845650001000858650002300868653001500891700001600906700001900922700001900941773011100960852000901071856008001080930003301160945001301193946001301206655001201219IND2036193520221122055130.0931209e199209  mdu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203619352DNAL7 a166529932pmid7 a10.1104/pp.100.1.5252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoelzle, I.10aInduction of glutamine synthetase activity in nonnodulated roots of Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Pisum sativum  ap. 525-528.  aNitrate or ammonium fertilization significantly increased glutamine synthetase (GS) activity in nonnodulated roots of French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), soybean (Glycine max), and pea (Pisum sati- vum).

The total dietary fiber content of fresh avocado fruit of the Ettinger variety was 5.2 g/100 g. Approximately 75% was insoluble, and 25% soluble. The water-holding capacity of dry defatted avocado pulp was similar to that of cellulose, and trypsin inhibitors were not detected. The dietary and metabolic consequences of the avocado pulp were studied in male rats fed normal and hypercholesterolemic diets. Rats consumed semipurified diets containing either avocado pulp as the dietary fiber source or cellulose (control) with or without 10 g/kg cholesterol and 5 g/kg cholic acid. Food consumption and body weight gain were lower in rats fed avocado compared with those fed cellulose. Relative cecum weight was higher in avocado-fed rats. Plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels did not differ in rats fed diets without cholesterol, but plasma cholesterol was greater in avocado-fed than in cellulose-fed rats that consumed cholesterol. Regardless of dietary cholesterol, hepatic total fat levels, as evaluated histologically, but not directly, were lower in avocado-fed rats. These data suggest the presence of an appetite depressant in avocado and that avocado pulp interferes with hepatic fat metabolism. 3aavocados 3acholesterol 3acholic acid 3adietary fiber 3afiber content 3alipid metabolism 3apulp 3arats 3atrypsin inhibitors 3awater holding capacity 3aweight gain 2aAnimals 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCellulosexpharmacology 2aCholesterolxblood 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxpharmacology 2aDietary Fiberxpharmacology 2aFatsxantagonists & inhibitors 2aLiverxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aMale 2aPersea 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley 2aReference Values1 aWerman, Moshe J.1 aSabo, Edmond1 aNeeman, Ishak0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 July, v. 132, no. 7 p.2015-2018dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle04101naa a2200757 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002400129245009200153300001800245500002400263520172900287650003102016650002002047650002402067650001202091650001002103650002902113650002402142650002002166650002702186650002502213650001702238650002102255650001902276650001602295650001802311650001102329650001702340650001402357650002602371650001302397650001002410650001802420650001402438650004702452650001202499650006002511650003402571650002402605650000902629650004202638650004102680650003102721650003302752650005802785650003402843650003102877650004902908650004502957650001003002650001903012650003603031700002903067700002303096700002003119700002403139700001703163700002803180773011403208852000903322655001203331IND4467691120221121042411.0130506s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446769112DNAL7 a120976862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHontecillas, Raquel10aNutritional Regulation of Porcine Bacterial-Induced Colitis by Conjugated Linoleic Acid  ap. 2019-2027.  aIncludes references  aExcessive intake of saturated fatty acids and/or linoleic acid favors the induction of an array of lipid mediators and cytokines enhancing inflammatory responses. Conversely, dietary supplementation with (n-3) fatty acids or vitamin D ameliorates inflammation and autoimmune diseases. Although it was well accepted that conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) prevented diseases with a common inflammatory pathogenesis (i.e., cancer and atherosclerosis), no studies were available on the roles of CLA in mucosal inflammation. The present study was designed to investigate the anti-inflammatory actions and molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of colonic health by CLA. We hypothesized that colonic inflammation can be ameliorated by dietary CLA supplementation. To test this hypothesis, inflammation of the colonic mucosa was triggered by challenging pigs fed either soybean oil–supplemented or CLA-supplemented diets with an enteric bacterial pathogen (i.e., Brachyspira hyodysenteriae). Immunoregulatory cytokines and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) mRNA expression were assayed in colonic lymph nodes and colon of pigs. Colonic mucosal lesions and lymphocyte subset distribution were evaluated by histology and immunohistochemistry. Supplementation of CLA in the diet before the induction of colitis decreased mucosal damage; maintained cytokine profiles (i.e., interferon-γ and interleukin-10) and lymphocyte subset distributions (i.e., CD4+ and CD8+), resembling those of noninfected pigs; enhanced colonic expression of PPAR-γ; and attenuated growth failure. Therefore, CLA fed preventively before the onset of enteric disease attenuated inflammatory lesion development and growth failure. 3aBrachyspira hyodysenteriae 3aatherosclerosis 3aautoimmune diseases 3acolitis 3acolon 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3adietary supplements 3agene expression 3agrowth and development 3aimmunohistochemistry 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3alymph nodes 3amessenger RNA 3amucosa 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3asaturated fatty acids 3asoybeans 3aswine 3aswine feeding 3avitamin D 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aColitisxmicrobiologyxpathologyxprevention & control. 2aColonxmetabolismxpathology. 2aCytokinesxgenetics 2aDiet 2aDietary Fatsxadministration & dosage 2aFatty Acidsxadministration & dosage 2aGrowth Disordersxetiology 2aIntestinal Mucosaxpathology 2aLinoleic Acidxadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aLymphocyte Subsetsxpathology 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aReceptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclearxgenetics 2aSpirochaetales Infectionsxcomplications 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseases 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics1 aWannemeulher, Michael J.1 aZimmerman, Dean R.1 aHutto, David L.1 aWilson, Jennifer H.1 aAhn, Dong U.1 aBassaganya-Riera, Josep0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 July, v. 132, no. 7 p.2019-2027dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162100001700171245010400188300001600292500002400308500001500332520113000347650001401477650002201491650002001513650002801533650001701561650002301578650002001601650001601621650003001637650003001667650001101697650001901708650002301727650001001750650002601760650001401786651002101800653001301821653002001834653002901854653001401883700001601897700001701913700001701930700002101947773012201968852000902090856007702099930003302176945002502209946001102234655001202245IND4380781020221121042534.0060607e20060215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438078102DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ202 0aL1001 aAslantas, O.10aIsolation and characterization of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 from Turkish cattle  ap. 338-342.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe objective of this study was to collect rectal swabs from the cattle in a slaughterhouse located in Hatay (Turkey) immediately after slaughter for the isolation and characterization of verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 in each month during a 1-year period. The rectal swab samples were analyzed for the isolation of E. coli O157 through preenrichment, immunomagnetic separation and selective plating on CT-SMAC agar. E. coli O157 was isolated from 77 (13.6%) of the samples. The presence of E. coli O157 changed during a 1-year period, in that the occurrence of E. coli O157 was the highest in July and November and lowest in February. A total of 66 isolates out of 77 were seroytpe O157:H7 and 11 were serotype O157:NM. PCR analysis of E. coli O157 virulence genes revealed that all O157:H7/NM were positive for rbfO157, 74 positive for EhlyA, 72 positive for eaeA, 62 positive for vtx2, and 3 positive for both vtx1 and vtx2. It was presented by cytotoxicity tests that many of E. coli O157 isolates showed high cytotoxicity on Vero cells. All of the isolates containing EhlyA showed enterohaemolysin production. 3aslaughter 3aShiga-like toxins 3aslaughterhouses 3abacterial contamination 3acytotoxicity 3afood contamination 3aselective media 3abeef cattle 3aimmunomagnetic separation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3arectum 3afood pathogens 3aenrichment culture 3agenes 3aEscherichia coli O157 3avirulence 3aTurkey (country) 0ashedding 0avirulence genes 0aEscherichia coli O157:H7 0aisolation1 aErdogan, S.1 aCantekin, Z.1 aGulactı, I.1 aEvrendilek, G.A.0 tInternational journal of food microbiology.g2006 Feb. 15, v. 106, no. 3 p.338-342dElsevier Sciencex0168-16057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2005.08.0053electronic resource  a20060714b20060804c00000000  aINDdPNNe2006/07/14  aNon-US 7aarticle02867naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002200110245015200132300001800284500002400302520193900326650001402265650001802279650001102297650001402308650001202322650001702334650001602351651001402367700002402381700002502405773011402430852000902544655001202553IND4467692620221121042628.0130506s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446769262DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKwan, Laurinda L.10aLow Vitamin B-12 Intake and Status Are More Prevalent in Hispanic Older Adults of Caribbean Origin Than in Neighborhood-Matched Non-Hispanic Whites  ap. 2059-2064.  aIncludes references  aVitamin B-12 deficiency is a recognized problem among older adults, although vitamin B-12 status among differing ethnic groups remains unclear. We examined vitamin B-12 intake and status in a representative sample of elderly Hispanics of Caribbean origin (Puerto Rican and Dominican) and non-Hispanic whites. Dietary intake and plasma values were available for 347 Puerto Ricans, 102 Dominicans and 154 non-Hispanic whites (60–93 y). Relative to non-Hispanic whites, Hispanics had significantly lower vitamin B-12 intake and plasma concentrations; 17% of Hispanics and 10% of non-Hispanic whites had concentrations < 185 pmol/L (P < 0.05). Among Hispanics, log transformed vitamin B-12 intake was significantly associated with plasma concentration (β = 60 pmol/L per log unit vitamin B-12 intake, P < 0.002 for supplement users and β = 74 pmol/L per log unit vitamin B-12 intake, P < 0.01 for nonsupplement users). Intake and plasma concentrations were significantly associated among non-Hispanic whites only when supplement users were included (β = 95 pmol/L per log unit vitamin B-12 intake, P < 0.0001). Hispanic supplement users (18%) had higher plasma concentrations than did nonsupplement users (364 ± 17 and 297 ± 8 pmol/L, respectively, P < 0.001). For Hispanics, consumption of breakfast cereal > 4 times/wk compared to no cereal was protective against lower plasma concentrations (8 vs. 24% < 185 pmol/L, P < 0.01). Approximately 40% of both groups with plasma vitamin B-12 < 185 pmol/L had homocysteine > 14 μmol/L, relative to < 17% of those with B-12 > 185 pmol/L. The high prevalence of low vitamin B-12 status in elderly Hispanics appears largely attributed to inadequate intake. As in other populations, sources of unbound vitamin B-12 such as supplements and fortified cereal appear to be protective. Dietary intervention programs targeted to the Hispanic population should promote these vitamin B-12 sources. 3aHispanics 3aPuerto Ricans 3aWhites 3abreakfast 3aelderly 3ahomocysteine 3avitamin B12 3aCaribbean1 aBermudez, Odilia I.1 aTucker, Katherine L.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 July, v. 132, no. 7 p.2059-2064dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02660naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245013300133300001800266500002400284520141000308650002101718650003101739650001701770650001801787650001801805650002001823650001601843650002501859650001701884650001801901650002301919650000801942650002001950650003201970700002302002700002302025700002502048700002002073700002202093773011402115852000902229655001202238IND4466767620221121031331.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBruunsgaard, Helle10aLong-Term Combined Supplementations with α-Tocopherol and Vitamin C Have No Detectable Anti-Inflammatory Effects in Healthy Men  ap. 1170-1173.  aIncludes references  aInflammatory and oxidative stresses play a pivotal role in atherogenesis. Vitamin E and vitamin C are the two most important dietary antioxidants; moreover, vitamin E has anti-inflammatory effects. Combined supplementations with vitamin E and vitamin C twice daily for 3 y reduced lipid peroxidation and retarded the progression of common carotid atherosclerosis in healthy men in the Antioxidant Supplementation in Atherosclerosis Prevention (ASAP) study. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms that retarded the progression of atherosclerosis in the ASAP study, we investigated the effect of a combined intake of vitamin E and vitamin C on inflammatory markers in vivo. Circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and C reactive protein (CRP) were measured in 45- to 69-y-old men from the ASAP study with cholesterol >5.0 mmol/L before and after treatment with either placebo (n = 52) or a combined supplementation with 91 mg (136 iu) α-tocopherol and 250 mg of slow-release vitamin C twice a day (n = 55) for 3 y. Antioxidant treatment for 36 mo had no effect on circulating levels of TNF-α, IL-6 or CRP. In conclusion, long-term combined supplementations with α-tocopherol and vitamin C in reasonable doses have no detectable systemic anti-inflammatory effects in a healthy population of men with slight hypercholesterolemia and no overt signs of inflammation. 3aalpha-tocopherol 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3aatherogenesis 3aatherosclerosis 3acholesterol 3ahypercholesterolemia 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3alipid peroxidation 3amen 3anutrient intake 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aPoulsen, Henrik E.1 aPedersen, Bente K.1 aNyyssonen, Kristiina1 aKaikkonen, Jari1 aSalonen, Jukka T.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 133, no. 4 p.1170-1173dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02354naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014400183300001600327500002400343520065200367650002401019650001901043650002201062650001301084650001801097650001001115650001301125650001601138650000901154650001501163650001201178650003401190650002601224650002401250650001201274650004601286650004101332650003701373650002401410650002501434650001901459700002001478700001501498700001701513700001401530700001701544700001601561773012901577852000901706856008501715655001201800IND4407498920221121031518.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440749892DNAL7 a183891642pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-008-9394-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPolcaro, C.

Non-sterilized chipped contaminated wood was mixed at various ratios with wheat straw on which Pleurotus mycelia was grown. At 1:2 initial ratio contaminated wood:wheat straw, chemical analyses demonstrated an almost complete degradation of creosote oil components after 44 days, also confirmed by a significant reduction of ecotoxicity. Lower ratios, i.e. higher amount of contaminated wood, lower system efficiency, although a better creosote degradation was obtained by a stepped up wood addition. 3aPleurotus ostreatus 3abioremediation 3achemical analysis 3acreosote 3aecotoxicology 3afungi 3amycelium 3awheat straw 3awood 2aAlgorithms 2aAnimals 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aCarcinogensxanalysis 2aCreosotexchemistry 2aDaphnia 2aEnvironmental Restoration and Remediation 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aMyceliumxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aPleurotusxchemistry 2aWoodxanalysis1 aBrancaleoni, E.1 aDonati, E.1 aFrattoni, M.1 aGalli, E.1 aMigliore, L.1 aRapanà, P.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 Aug., v. 81, no. 2 p.180-184dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-008-9394-93Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02034naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245008600185300001600271500002400287520062900311650001300940650001100953650001400964650002800978650001401006650001301020650004901033650001201082650002401094650003201118650003301150650001901183650002101202650002201223650005201245650005801297700002201355773012901377852000901506856008501515655001201600IND4407498720221121021509.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440749872DNAL7 a185095822pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-008-9463-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGiusto, Anabella10aCopper Toxicity on Juveniles of Hyalella pseudoazteca González and Watling, 2003  ap. 169-173.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of this work is to evaluate the toxic effect of water and sediment contaminated with Cu²⁺ on the survival and growth of juveniles of Hyalella pseudoazteca.

This study was undertaken to determine whether the effect of leucine persists in a 10-d experiment. For this purpose, adult (9 mo) and old (21 mo) rats were fed a semiliquid 18.2 g/100 g protein standard diet during the 8-h dark period for 1 mo. Then, each group was given either a leucine-supplemented meal or an alanine-supplemented meal (as the control meal) for 1 h and the standard diet the rest of the feeding period. On d 10, rats were fed either no food (postabsorptive group) or the supplemented meal for 1 h. Muscle protein synthesis was assessed in vivo 90–120 min after meal distribution using the flooding dose method (1-13C phenylalanine). Leucinemia was similar in rats of both ages in the postabsorptive state. Postprandial plasma leucine concentrations were one- to twofold greater after the leucine meal than after the control meal. In the postabsorptive state, leucine supplementation did not modify the muscle protein synthesis rate in old rats but enhanced it to the postprandial rate in adult rats. As expected, muscle protein synthesis was stimulated by the control meal in adult rats but not in old rats. The leucine meal restored this stimulation in old rats but did not further stimulate muscle protein synthesis in adult rats. In conclusion, the beneficial effect of leucine supplementation on postprandial muscle protein anabolism persists for at least 10 d. The long-term utilization of leucine-rich diets may therefore limit muscle protein wasting during aging. 3adiet 3aelderly 3afoods 3aleucine 3amuscle protein 3aphenylalanine 3aprotein synthesis 3arats 3ascotophase 3awasting syndrome 2aAging 2aAmino Acidsxblood 2aAnimals 2aInsulinxblood 2aLeucinexadministration & dosage 2aMale 2aMuscle Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aPostprandial Period 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar1 aSornet, Claire1 aBayle, Gérard.1 aPrugnaud, Jacques1 aPouyet, Corinne1 aBalage, Michele1 aPapet, Isabelle1 aGrizard, Jean1 aDardevet, Dominique0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 Apr., v. 133, no. 4 p.1198-1205dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02549naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245014400181300001600325520123900341650002301580650002101603650001301624650001601637650001801653650002301671650002401694650001401718650004401732650002201776650003601798650002201834651001001856651001001866700001601876773007201892852000901964856008501973930003302058945001302091946001102104655001202115IND2321672220221121021527.0010621e200105  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232167222DNAL7 a113400482pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.7.4732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOliveras, I.10aMedium-term sap flux monitoring in a Scots pine stand: analysis of the operability of the heat dissipation method for hydrological purposes  ap. 473-480.  aThe operability of Granier-type heat dissipation sap flow meters for the medium-term monitoring of Scots pine transpiration was tested. Three sensors that had been working for 3 years were duplicated by inserting new sensors in the same trees. The new sensors operated simultaneously with the old sensors for 18 months. Analysis of the temporal patterns of thermal dissipation of the sensors showed a slight, but significant decrease in all sensors, indicating the conservation of sapwood thermal properties. Although there was a high correlation between sap flux densities registered by the old and new sensors, significant differences in sap flux densities between the duplicated sensors were detected. Such differences could not be attributed to tissue injury around the sensors or to loss of sensitivity of the old sensors, because two of the old sensors registered higher flux rates than the new sensors. No instrumental error to explain the sap flux differences was found. Because the new sensors were installed at some angular distance from the old sap flow meters to avoid thermal interferences, it was inferred that the observed sap flux differences between duplicate sensors were the result of an azimuthal sap flow pattern. 3ameters (equipment) 3aPinus sylvestris 3asap flow 3ameasurement 3aheat transfer 3aseasonal variation 3amathematical models 3aequations 2aBody Temperature Regulationxphysiology 2aPinusxphysiology 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 3aSpain 0aSpain1 aLlorens, P.0 tTree physiology.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 7 p.473-480x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.7.4733Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04307naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245014300180300001600323520261900339650002002958650001302978650002002991650002503011650002003036650001303056650002003069650002603089650002303115650001503138650002303153650002103176650002303197650001603220650004503236650002503281650000903306650004503315650001003360653001103370653001903381700001603400700001803416700001803434700001603452700002003468700001803488773007203506852000903578856008503587930003303672945001303705946001103718655001203729IND2321779120221121001437.0010628e200105  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232177912DNAL7 a113597092pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.8.5132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNeilsen, D.10aRemobilization and uptake of N by newly planted apple (Malus domestica) trees in response to irrigation method and timing of N application  ap. 513-521.  aEnvironmentally sound management of N in apple orchards requires that N supply meets demand. In 1997, newly planted apple trees (Malus domestica Borkh. var. Golden Delicious on M.9 rootstock) received daily applications of N for six weeks as Ca(15NO3)2 through a drip irrigation system at a concentration of 112 mg l-1 at 2-8, 5-11 or 8-14 weeks after planting. Irrigation water was applied either to meet estimated evaporative demand or at a fixed rate. In 1997, trees were harvested at 5, 8, 11 and 14 weeks after planting; and in 1998 at 3 weeks after full bloom. The amount of fertilizer N recovered was similar in trees in both irrigation treatments, but efficiency of fertilizer use was greater for trees receiving demand-controlled irrigation than fixed-rate irrigation. This was attributed to lower N inputs, greater retention time in the root zone and less N leaching in the demand-controlled irrigation treatments compared with fixed-rate irrigation treatments. Less fertilizer N was recovered by trees receiving an early application of N than a later application of N and this was related to the timing of N supply with respect to tree demand. Demand for root-supplied N was low until 11 weeks after planting, because early shoot and root growth was supported by N remobilized from woody tissue, which involved 55% of the total tree N content at planting. Rapid development of roots > 1 mm in diameter occurred between 11 and 14 weeks after planting, after remobilization ended, and was greater for trees receiving an early application of N than for trees receiving a later application of N. Late-season tree N demand was supplied by native soil N, and uptake and background soil solution N concentrations were higher for trees receiving demand-supplied irrigation compared with fixed-rate irrigation. Total annual N uptake by roots was unaffected by treatments and averaged 6-8 g tree-1. Nitrogen applications in 1997 affected growth and N partitioning in 1998. Trees receiving early applications of N had more flowers, spur leaves and bourse shoots than trees receiving later applications of N. Consequently, more N was remobilized into fruits in trees receiving early applications of N compared with fruits in trees receiving later applications of N. Demand for N in the young apple trees was low. Early season demand was met by remobilization from woody tissues and the timing of demand for root-supplied N probably depends on whether flowering occurs. Method of N delivery affected the efficiency of N use. We conclude that N demand can be met at soil solution N concentrations of around 20 mg l-1. 3aMalus domestica 3aorchards 3acrop production 3anitrogen fertilizers 3acalcium nitrate 3anitrogen 3anutrient uptake 3aquantitative analysis 3anutrient transport 3airrigation 3aseasonal variation 3aapplication rate 3aapplication timing 2aAgriculture 2aMalusxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aNitrogenxphysiology 2aSoil 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aWater 0agrowth 0ause efficiency1 aMillard, P.1 aHerbert, L.C.1 aNeilsen, G.H.1 aHogue, E.J.1 aParchomchuk, P.1 aZebarth, B.J.0 tTree physiology.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 8 p.513-521x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.8.5133Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03512naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245011900179300001600298500001500314520177600329650001202105650002202117650002602139650001202165650001202177650001802189650003602207650001102243650001202254650001502266650002302281650001202304650001302316650001302329650001202342650001002354650001102364650001202375650003002387650002502417650002802442650002802470650002302498650002202521651001502543651001502558653001802573653001402591653001002605700001502615700002102630773007202651852000902723856008502732930003302817945001302850946001102863655001202874IND2321779320221120235925.0010628e200105  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232177932DNAL7 a113597102pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.8.5232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarcia, H.10aDynamics of nonstructural carbohydrates and biomass yield in a fodder legume tree at different harvest intensities  ap. 523-531.  a2019-12-04  aTropical tree fodder is harvested by frequent prunings, and resprouting depends on nonstructural carbohydrate reserves in the remaining tree parts. We studied the effects of three pruning intensities (removal of all leaves and branches leaving 1 m of stem once a year (T-12), or every 6 months (T-6), and about 50% pruning every 2 months (P-2)) on regrowth and the dynamics of soluble sugars and starch in the legume tree Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp. growing under humid tropical conditions in Guadeloupe, Lesser Antilles. Carbohydrates were sampled in roots, stems and branches. Among pruned trees, trees in the T-6 harvest regime had the highest leaf fodder yield (0.73 kg tree-1 year-1). High litter loss reduced leaf yield of T-12 trees, but compared with the other treatments, T-12 trees produced the most branch biomass (3.43 kg tree-1). Among treatments, P-2 trees had an intermediate leaf fodder yield and the lowest branch production. Sucrose, glucose and fructose were the most common sugars in all biomass compartments. Mannose, pinitol and an unidentified cyclitol were relatively abundant in branches. Root sugar and starch concentrations were unaffected by harvest regime. There was a significant interactive effect of harvest intensity and regrowth time on stem sugar concentration. Stem starch concentration was highest in T-12 trees. After a year of fodder harvesting, whole-tree reserves of nonstructural carbohydrates were highest in T-12 trees; however, a larger proportion of reserves were located in roots and stems of T-6 and P-2 trees. These reserves, which were not lost in pruning and contributed to regrowth of G. sepium after pruning, may explain the relatively small effects of harvesting regime on soluble sugar and starch concentrations. 3apinitol 3aGliricidia sepium 3aquantitative analysis 3aglucose 3asucrose 3ahumid tropics 3achemical constituents of plants 3astarch 3amannose 3acrop yield 3aseasonal variation 3apruning 3afructose 3abranches 3abiomass 3aroots 3aleaves 2aBiomass 2aCarbohydratesxphysiology 2aFabaceaexphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aStarchxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 3aGuadeloupe 0aGuadeloupe 0afodder plants 0acyclitols 0astems1 aNygren, P.1 aDesfontaines, L.0 tTree physiology.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 8 p.523-531x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.8.5233Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle04138naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245014200179300001600321500001500337520228400352650001902636650001902655650001702674650002002691650002002711650002302731650001402754650003602768650001602804650001602820650001702836650001102853650001102864650003102875650003102906650006302937650006303000650004603063650002503109650004403134651001103178653001103189653001803200653001503218653003003233700001503263700001503278700002003293773007203313852000903385856008503394930003303479945001303512946001103525655001203536IND2321671020221120215414.0010621e200105  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232167102DNAL7 a113400442pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.7.4372doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStaudt, M.10aEffect of elevated CO2 on monoterpene emission of young Quercus ilex trees and its relation to structural and ecophysiological parameters  ap. 437-445.  a2019-12-04  aWe investigated growth, leaf monoterpene emission, gas exchange, leaf structure and leaf chemical composition of 1-year-old Quercus ilex L. seedlings grown in ambient (350 microliter l(-1)) and elevated (700 microliter l(-1)) CO2 concentrations ([CO2]). Monoterpene emission and gas exchange were determined at constant temperature and irradiance (25 degrees C and 1000 micromol m(-2) s(-1) of photosynthetically active radiation) at an assay [CO2] of 350 or 700 microliter l(-1). Measurements were made on intact shoots after the end of the growing season between mid-October and mid-February. On average, plants grown in elevated [CO2] had significantly increased foliage biomass (about 50%). Leaves in the elevated [CO2] treatment were significantly thicker and had significantly higher concentrations of cellulose and lignin and significantly lower concentrations of nitrogen and minerals than leaves in the ambient [CO2] treatment. Leaf dry matter density and leaf concentrations of starch, soluble sugars, lipids and hemi-cellulose were not significantly affected by growth in elevated [CO2]. Monoterpene emissions of seedlings were significantly increased by elevated [CO2] but were insensitive to short-term changes in assay [CO2]. On average, plants grown in elevated [CO2] had 1.8-fold higher monoterpene emissions irrespective of the assay [CO2]. Conversely, assay [CO2] rapidly affected photosynthetic rate, but there was no apparent long-term acclimation of photosynthesis to growth in elevated [CO2]. Regardless of growth [CO2], photosynthetic rates of all plants almost doubled when the assay [CO2] was switched from 350 to 700 microliter l(-1). At the same assay [CO2], mean photosynthetic rates of seedlings in the two growth CO2 treatments were similar. The percentage of assimilated carbon lost as monoterpenes was not significantly altered by CO2 enrichment. Leaf emission rates were correlated with leaf thickness, leaf concentrations of cellulose, lignin and nitrogen, and total plant leaf area. In all plants, monoterpene emissions strongly declined during the winter independently of CO2 treatment. The results are discussed in the context of the acquisition and allocation of resources by Q. ilex seedlings and evaluated in terms of emission predictions. 3acarbon dioxide 3amonoterpenoids 3agas exchange 3astress response 3alight intensity 3aseasonal variation 3aemissions 3achemical constituents of plants 3atemperature 3ameasurement 3aQuercus ilex 3aleaves 3ashoots 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxanatomy & histologyxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aQuercusxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aTerpenesxmetabolism 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 3aFrance 0agrowth 0aplant anatomy 0aregulation 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aJoffre, R.1 aRambal, S.1 aKesselmeier, J.0 tTree physiology.g2001 May, v. 21, no. 7 p.437-445x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.7.4373Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02186naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007000092040001800162100001800180245007700198300001600275500001500291520088600306650001101192650001701203650001901220650003901239650002301278650002001301651000901321651001801330653002901348653001101377653001901388653002101407653001601428653002901444700001901473773007201492852000901564856012001573930003301693945001301726946001301739655001201752IND2205943720221120204855.0000721e200004  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220594372DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(200021)16:2<253::AID-AGR8>3.0.CO;2-O2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOnunkwo, I.M.10aExport demand for U.S. pecans: impacts of U.S. export promotion programs  ap. 253-265.  a2019-12-04  aThe purpose of this study was to estimate the impact of the major factors affecting the export demand for U.S. pecans in Asia and the E.U. which together import about 27% of U.S. pecan exports. The primary objective pertained to the impacts of federal promotion programs on the foreign demand for U.S. pecans. Based on previous literature, a single-equation framework was specified for estimation of the pecan model. Based on promotion elasticities, impacts on pecan export revenue from promotion were evaluated. The returns per dollar of promotion expenditure for pecans were $6.45 for Asia and $6.75 for the E.U. Further, some spill-over benefits for pecan exports were detected from almond export promotion in Asia and walnut export promotion in the E.U. It appears that the U.S. pecan industry can benefit substantially from increased export promotion in both Asia and the E.U. 3apecans 3aelasticities 3aEuropean Union 3agovernmental programs and projects 3aeconometric models 3aeconomic impact 3aAsia 3aUnited States 0asingle equation analysis 0ademand 0aforeign demand 0aexport promotion 0aexpenditure 0aeuropean union countries1 aEpperson, J.E.0 tAgribusiness.g2000 Spring, v. 16, no. 2 p.253-265x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(200021)16:2<253::AID-AGR8>3.0.CO;2-O3Available from publisher's Web site  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03511naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245009900168300001600267500015600283500001500439520179500454650002502249650001002274650002202284650001302306650001102319650001702330650001802347650001202365650001702377650001702394650002302411650001602434650002002450650001702470650001902487650002502506650001902531650001002550650001302560650002602573650001702599651001002616653001602626700001802642700001402660700002202674700001802696700002302714773014402737856005502881852000902936655001202945IND4533908220221120204958.0160203e20150705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453390822DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1089.602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBartual, J.10aImproving Pomegranate Fruit Quality by Means of Watering Management in Semi-Arid Eastern Spain  ap. 431-436.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Pomegranate and Minor Mediterranean Fruits held Sept 20-24, 2013 Tai'an, Shandong Province, China  a2019-12-06  aIn semi-arid climate areas, where often pomegranate trees are cultivated, irrigation management is a powerful tool to manipulate tree water status and performance and fruit composition. A field irrigation trial was conducted over four seasons in a âMollar de Elcheâ pomegranate orchard in southeastern Spain. This paper will focus on the main positive effects that deficit irrigation had on fruit quality. Higher total soluble solids content in the juice and more reddish fruit peel coloration were observed at harvest and during cold storage at 5Â°C and 90-95% RH on pomegranates from deficit irrigation applied continuously during the entire growing season or only during ripening. On the other hand, higher juice anthocyanin content was obtained in fruit submitted to water restrictions during the linear phase of fruit growth. Timing of water stress is then an important factor to take into account for anthocyanin accumulation in skin and aril tissues. The results also suggest that colour formation in the peel and internal tissues have different metabolic pathways, opening up new research lines. In addition, fruit from well watered trees showed greater susceptibility to physiological disorders manifested after cold storage as peel pitting, blemishes and sinking, and to weight loss with respect to deficit irrigation samples. Weight loss increased with storage time and fruit from trees submitted to continuous deficit irrigation or water withholding only during ripening showed lower weight loss compared to the control treatment.

Therefore, it is necessary to support the trunks of the tree and its branches, especially when it has fruits. The common method used in orchards is to support the trunks and tie the branches during the first years of the treeâs life. The ties and supports require a lot of handwork. The growing fruits cause the branches to lean earthwards and to stick to each other. In this situation, the fruit is exposed to the sun and its quality is damaged and the fruit suffers from several damages: sunburns, scratches and damages from pests. The problems with this growing technique indeed lowers the quality and the quantity of the fruits and reduces the profitability. In order to overcome this fundamental problem of the method for growing pomegranates, I developed a system for continuous shaping and trellising, unique for pomegranate trees. 3abranches 3afruits 3aorchards 3apests 3apomegranates 3aprofitability 3atree trunk 3atrees0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 July 5, , no. 1089 p.427-430dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1089.59  aDNAL 7aarticle01965naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001600152245006600168300001600234500015600250520068300406650001501089650001101104650001401115650001201129650001501141650001501156650002201171650001001193650001301203650001701216650001201233650001001245700001701255700001801272700001501290700001301305700001701318773014401335856005501479852000901534655001201543IND4533905220221120174129.0160203e20150705xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND453390522DNAL7 a10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1089.302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYu, Lanling10aApplication Research of Pomegranate in Agro-Sightseeing Parks  ap. 243-246.  aPaper presented at the III International Symposium on Pomegranate and Minor Mediterranean Fruits held Sept 20-24, 2013 Tai'an, Shandong Province, China  aPomegranate has long been used as an ornamental plant but information regarding the cultural and genetic characteristics are not well understood.

New cultivars can provide crops over a longer period of time and therefore meet market demands better with quality fruits and larger harvests contributing to the development of the crop and increasing the world cultivated surface. There is a huge interest in this crop throughout the world especially for its potential to prevent illnesses. Industrialization of its fruit (juices, tubs of grains, dehydrated seeds, rind, etc.) has contributed to the increase of crop areas and a rise in farmersâ income. Other products being commercialized are extracts for manufacturing capsules, obtaining oils or for manufacturing cosmetic products. All these new products are becoming widely accepted among consumers and industrialists who see these species as a new market opportunity. The world surface dedicated to the cultivation of pomegranate trees is more than 300,000 ha and world production is probably higher than 3,000,000 t. The main production countries are India, Iran, Turkey, China, and the USA, where more than 76% of the world production is being produced. 3aarid zones 3acosmetics 3acrops 3acultivars 3afarmers 3afruit quality 3agrains 3ahuman health 3aincome 3aindustrialization 3ajuices 3amanufacturing 3anew markets 3anew products 3anew species 3anew variety 3aoils 3apomegranates 3aseeds 3atrees 3aChina 3aIndia 3aIran 3aTurkey (country) 3aUnited States1 aMartinez, J.

The addition of 20.7 micromolar indole-butyric acid (IBA) to the root induction medium did not significantly increase the rooting percentage (88%). Putrescine, spermidine, cyclohexylamine (CHA) and aminoguanidine (AG) enhanced rooting up to 100% (98.66% for AG), when applied during root induction in the absence of IBA, otherwise these compounds inhibited rooting, as did spermine and difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) + difluoromethylarginine (DFMA). The root induction phase was characterized by a temporary increase in endogenous free indole-acetic acid (IAA) and putrescine concentrations during root induction, whereas the root expression phase was characterized by increased peroxidase activity and low concentrations of polyamines. These changes were specifically associated with the rooting process and did not depend on the presence of exogenous IBA, because application of exogenous IBA enhanced the amount of IAA in the cuttings but did not affect rooting or the pattern of changes in polyamines and peroxidase. The effects of CHA, AG and DFMO + DFMA on endogenous concentrations of auxins and polyamines highlight the close relationship between the effects of IAA and putrescine in root induction and suggest that polyamine catabolism has an important role in root formation and elongation. 3aperoxidase 3adose response 3ain vitro culture 3aquantitative analysis 3adevelopmental stages 3aspermidine 3aspermine 3aindole butyric acid 3aputrescine 3aFraxinus angustifolia 3arooting 3achemical constituents of plants 3aenzyme activity 3aculture media 3aroots 3aindole acetic acid 3ashoots 2aBiogenic Polyaminesxphysiology 2aCyclohexylaminesxmetabolism 2aEflornithinexmetabolism 2aGuanidinesxmetabolism 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolismxphysiology. 2aIndolesxmetabolism 2aModels, Biological 2aOleaceaexphysiology 2aPeroxidasexphysiology 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPutrescinexphysiology 2aSpermidinexphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 0aaminoguanidine 0adifluoromethylarginine 0acyclohexylamine 0adifloromethylornithine 0aauxins1 aKevers, C.1 aGaspar, T.0 tTree physiology.g2001 July, v. 21, no. 10 p.655-663x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.10.6553Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03884naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001700166245021400183300001800397520194900415650002202364650002602386650001402412650001602426650002302442650002002465650002102485650001802506650002402524650001402548650001902562650003602581650002002617650003102637650002202668650003602690650004502726650004102771650004302812650005402855650002602909650001602935651001102951653003002962700001702992700002003009700001703029700001803046773007703064852000903141856008703150930003303237945001303270946001103283655001203294IND2323689020221120163626.0011025e200109  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232368902DNAL7 a115810182pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.15.11132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHobbie, E.A.10aFoliar nitrogen concentrations and natural abundance of 15N suggest nitrogen allocation patterns of Douglas-fir and mycorrhizal fungi during development in elevated carbon dioxide concentration and temperature  ap. 1113-1122.  aPseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco (Douglas-fir) seedlings were grown in a 2 x 2 factorial design in enclosed mesocosms at ambient temperature or 3.5 degrees C above ambient, and at ambient CO2 concentration ([CO2]) or 179 ppm above ambient. Two additional mesocosms were maintained as open controls. We measured the extent of mycorrhizal infection, foliar nitrogen (N) concentrations on both a weight basis (%N) and area basis (Narea), and foliar delta15N signatures (15N/14N ratios) from summer 1993 through summer 1997. Mycorrhizal fungi had colonized nearly all root tips across all treatments by spring 1994. Elevated [CO2] lowered foliar %N but did not affect N(area), whereas elevated temperature increased both foliar %N and N(area). Foliar delta15N was initially -1 per thousand and dropped by the final harvest to between -4 and -5 per thousand in the enclosed mesocosms, probably because of transfer of isotopically depleted N from mycorrhizal fungi. Based on the similarity in foliar delta15N among treatments, we conclude that mycorrhizal fungi had similar N allocation patterns across CO2 and temperature treatments. We combined isotopic and N(area) data for 1993-94 to calculate fluxes of N for second- and third-year needles. Yearly N influxes were higher in second-year needles than in third-year needles (about 160 and 50% of initial leaf N, respectively), indicating greater sink strength in the younger needles. Influxes of N in second-year needles increased in response to elevated temperature, suggesting increased N supply from soil relative to plant N demands. In the elevated temperature treatments, N effluxes from third-year needles were higher in seedlings in elevated [CO2] than in ambient [CO2], probably because of increased N allocation below ground. We conclude that N allocation patterns shifted in response to the elevated temperature and [CO2] treatments in the seedlings but not in their fungal symbionts. 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aPseudotsuga menziesii 3asymbiosis 3atemperature 3anutrient transport 3aconifer needles 3anitrogen content 3aradiolabeling 3amathematical models 3aequations 3acarbon dioxide 3achemical constituents of plants 3astress response 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aFungixphysiology 2aNitrogenxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aNitrogen Isotopesxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPseudotsugaxchemistryxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSymbiosisxphysiology 2aTemperature 3aOregon 0acarbon dioxide enrichment1 aOlszyk, D.M.1 aRygiewicz, P.T.1 aTingey, D.T.1 aJohnson, M.G.0 tTree physiology.g2001 Sept., v. 21, no. 15 p.1113-1122x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.15.11133Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02594naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002000164245007000184300001600254500002400270520105400294650002001348650002001368650001301388650002101401650001701422650001101439650001001450650001001460650001501470650001701485650001201502650001401514650002701528650001801555650002301573650001501596650000901611650001501620650002901635650003301664650002001697650004001717650003301757651001001790651001001800700002001810773012801830852000901958856008501967655001202052IND4407504420221120163817.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440750442DNAL7 a185063812pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-008-9426-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChoudhary, Amit10aPesticide Residues in Honey Samples from Himachal Pradesh (India)  ap. 417-422.  aIncludes references  aHoney, being a natural product manufactured by honey bees is considered to be free from any extraneous material. The over-reliance on pesticides caused several environmental problems including pesticide residues in food. This constitutes a potential risk for human health, because of their sub acute and chronic toxicity. Therefore this study was carried out to know the extent of pesticide residue in honey produced in the various parts of Himachal Pradesh. Among different pesticides analysed in honey; HCH and its isomers were the most frequently detected followed by DDT and its isomers. Of the studied synthetic pyrethroids, only cypermethrin was found in honey samples. Residues of organophosphates viz. acephate, chlorpyriphos, ethion and monocrotophos were not detected, however malathion's residue was found exceeding the MRL (5 ppb) proposed by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India. More over honey from natural vegetation contained lesser residues. It can be concluded that honey from Himachal Pradesh had low pesticide residues. 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aacephate 3achronic toxicity 3acypermethrin 3aethion 3afoods 3ahoney 3ahoney bees 3ahuman health 3aisomers 3amalathion 3amaximum residue limits 3amonocrotophos 3apesticide residues 3apyrethrins 3arisk 3avegetation 2aEnvironmental Monitoring 2aFood Contaminationxanalysis 2aHoneyxanalysis 2aHydrocarbons, Chlorinatedxanalysis 2aPesticide Residuesxanalysis 3aIndia 0aIndia1 aSharma, Duni C.0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 May, v. 80, no. 5 p.417-422dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-008-9426-53Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02549naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111040001800147100001900165245014900184300001600333520100600349650001301355650002001368650001101388650001101399650001601410650002601426650001401452650002101466650001601487650003601503650002001539650002801559650002601587650001001613650004101623650002401664650002201688651001101710653002201721653001601743653002701759700001901786773007401805852000901879856008601888930003301974945001302007946001102020655001202031IND2322877520221120123403.0010905e200107  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232287752DNAL7 a114470002pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.10.7012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalavasi, U.C.10aLeaf characteristics and chlorophyll concentration of Schyzolobium parahybum and Hymenaea stilbocarpa seedlings grown in different light regimes  ap. 701-703.  aLight in the understory of a forest varies not only with season and solar elevation but also with vegetation dynamics. Seedlings of Schyzolobium parahybum (Vell) Blake, a fast-growing pioneer species, and Hymenaea stilbocarpa L., a slow-growing shade-tolerant species, were grown in pots for 90 days in a forest canopy gap (full sunlight) or in semi-shade (about 44% of full sunlight) beneath the canopy of a secondary forest. Both sites were located in Itaguai, RJ State, Brazil. Subsequently, half the seedlings grown in the canopy gap were moved to semi-shade and half the seedlings grown in semi-shade were moved to the canopy gap. After a further 90 days, seedling dry weight, height, leaf area, specific leaf area, leaf area ratio and concentration of chlorophyll a and b were measured. In response to increased irradiance, Schyzolobium parahybum responded by producing more leaf area, whereas Hymenaea stilbocarpa responded by increasing leaf mass per unit area and chlorophyll a concentration. 3aHymenaea 3aseedling growth 3acanopy 3aleaves 3achlorophyll 3aquantitative analysis 3aleaf area 3aplant morphology 3ashade trees 3achemical constituents of plants 3apioneer species 2aCaesalpiniaxphysiology 2aChlorophyllxanalysis 2aLight 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aRosalesxphysiology 2aTreesxphysiology 3aBrazil 0alight penetration 0agrowth rate 0aschizolobium parahybum1 aMalavasi, M.M.0 tTree physiology.g2001 July, v. 21, no. 10 p.701-703x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.10.7013Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02207naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245015000182300001400332500002400346520065400370650001501024650001301039650001101052650002101063650001001084650001101094650001701105650002001122650004401142650001501186650001601201650005201217650002301269650006101292650004401353650005401397700001801451700001601469700001501485700001601500773012701516852000901643856008501652655001201737IND4407501520221120123156.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440750152DNAL7 a184214042pmid7 a10.1007/s00128-007-9298-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTian, Shengke10aPhytofiltration of Copper from Contaminated Water: Growth Response, Copper Uptake and Lignin Content in Elsholtzia splendens and Elsholtzia argyi  ap. 85-89.  aIncludes references  aPhytofiltration of Cu from water by Elsholtzia plants were investigated hydroponically. Both E. splendens and E. argyi could effectively clean up lower Cu contaminated water, probably attributed to their extremely high surface area of roots. The removal rate of Cu was concentration-dependent and showed a monotonic decline with time. At higher external Cu concentration, the growth of E. argyi has been considerably inhibited while E. splendens still grew normally. E. splendens has the greater capacity to absorb Cu to roots from water and translocate Cu from roots to shoots. Lignin in roots probably has no significant effect on immobilizing Cu. 3aElsholtzia 3acleaning 3alignin 3aphytoremediation 3aroots 3ashoots 3asurface area 3awater pollution 2aCopperxanalysisxmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aFiltration 2aHydroponics 2aLamiaceaexchemistryxdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aLigninxmetabolism 2aPlant Rootsxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSeedsxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aWater Pollutants, Chemicalxanalysisxmetabolism.1 aPeng, Hongyun1 aYang, Xiaoe1 aLu, Lingli1 aZhang, Ling0 tBulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology.g2008 July, v. 81, no. 1 p.85-89dSpringer-Verlagx0007-48617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00128-007-9298-03Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03791naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245011800180300001600298520232600314650001102640650002602651650001602677650001002693650001002703650001702713650002202730650001602752650002202768650002302790650002102813650001302834650004402847650005002891650004402941650002202985651001603007651001603023653001903039700001503058773007303073852000903146856008503155930003303240945001303273946001103286655001203297IND2321849920221120092445.0010702e200106  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232184992DNAL7 a113903002pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.9.5612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZweifel, R.10aDynamics of water storage in mature subalpine Picea abies: temporal and spatial patterns of change in stem radius  ap. 561-569.  aInternal water reserves in bark and foliage of trees contribute to transpiration (T) and play an essential role in optimizing water transport by buffering extreme peaks of water consumption. We examined patterns of stem shrinkage and their relationship to tree water dynamics. We measured fluctuations in root radius and stem radius at different stem heights, T of twigs at the top of the crown and sap flow velocities in stem sections of mature subalpine Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) trees over 2 years. The output of each sensor was coupled by physical functions to a mechanistic flow and storage model of tree water relations. The data verified the model-predicted lag in water storage depletion in response to the onset of transpiration and the lag increased with increasing distance from the crown periphery. Between the crown and stem base, the delay ranged from a few minutes to several hours, depending on microclimatic conditions and tree water status. Stem volume changes were proportional to the amount of water exchanged between the elastic tissues of the bark and the rigid xylem, indicating that the "peristaltic" wave of stem contraction along the flow path represented depletion of water stored in bark. On a daily basis, stems lost between 0.2 and 0.5% of their volume as a result of bark dehydration, corresponding to about 2 to 5 l of water. This water contributed directly to T. According to the model based on hydraulic principles, there are three main components underlying the dynamics of water storage depletion: flow resistance, storage capacities of needles and bark, and T of each tree section. The resistances and capacities were proportional to the response delay, whereas T in the lower parts of the tree was inversely proportional. The pattern of T within the crown depended on water intercepted by the branches. Because of these weather-dependent factors, there was no time constant for the response delay along the flow path. Nevertheless, the upper crown and the root section tended to have longer response delays per meter of flow path than the stem. The diurnal course of stem radius fluctuations represents the sum of all external and internal conditions affecting tree water relations; stem radius fluctuations, therefore, provide a sensitive measure of tree water status. 3aheight 3aplant characteristics 3aPicea abies 3astems 3aroots 3awater uptake 3anutrient reserves 3ameasurement 3adiurnal variation 3aseasonal variation 3aplant morphology 3adiameter 2aPiceaxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Stemsxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aWaterxphysiology 3aSwitzerland 0aSwitzerland 0awater transfer1 aHasler, R.0 tTree physiology.g2001 June, v. 21, no. 9 p.561-569x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.9.5613Available from publisher's Web site  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02449naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002300164245010300187300001600290500002400306520091200330650002301242650001201265650002001277650001801297650001001315650001001325650001001335650001201345650000701357650001701364650001701381650001001398650002301408650003501431650002801466650002901494650003101523650004701554700002901601700002301630700003701653700003401690700003001724773009501754852000901849856008501858655001201943IND4407522120221120092413.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440752212DNAL7 a184613832pmid7 a10.1007/s00284-008-9164-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWulff, Nelson Arno10aInfluence of Culture Medium pH on Growth, Aggregation, and Biofilm Formation of Xylella fastidiosa  ap. 127-132.  aIncludes references  aThe major feature of Xylella fastidiosa growing in its hosts, as well as in culture media, is its cellular aggregation and biofilm formation, leading to partial obstruction of the xylem causing water stress in the plant. We report that growth, aggregation, and biofilm formation of X. fastidiosa are influenced by the medium pH. We have verified that X. fastidiosa cell aggregation is reversibly inhibited by decreasing the medium pH from 6.6 to 6.4. Biofilm formation on glass walls was affected as well, and a concomitant decrease in cell multiplication was observed below pH 6.4. The manipulation of culture medium pH can be used as a tool for the cloning of X. fastidiosa strains isolated from plant hosts, because different strains can inhabit the same plant. Also, X. fastidiosa mutants produced by gene manipulation can be isolated from cell aggregates containing transformed and untransformed cells. 3aXylella fastidiosa 3abiofilm 3acell aggregates 3aculture media 3agenes 3aglass 3ahosts 3amutants 3apH 3aplant stress 3awater stress 3axylem 2aBacterial Adhesion 2aBiofilmsxgrowth & development 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aCulture Mediaxchemistry 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aXylellaxgrowth & developmentxphysiology.1 aMariano, Anelise Galdino1 aGaurivaud, Patrice1 ade Almeida Souza, Leonardo Cesar1 aVirgílio, Andrea Cassia Diez1 aMonteiro, Patrícia Brant0 tCurrent microbiology.g2008 Aug., v. 57, no. 2 p.127-132dSpringer-Verlagx0343-86517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-008-9164-23Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03370naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245011300182300001600295500002400311520142100335650002101756650001901777650001901796650001501815650001101830650001501841650000901856650001201865650001301877650001301890650001401903650001201917650001601929650002201945650001201967650002201979650002502001650002602026650004802052650002002100650001502120650001102135650002802146650002502174650000902199650001902208650002902227650004202256650002402298650003602322650002702358700001702385700001802402700001802420700001602438700001402454700001902468700001702487773008602504852000902590856008502599655001202684IND4407508920221120071844.0080704s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440750892DNAL7 a183696532pmid7 a10.1007/s00412-008-0155-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBailey, S.

One of the significant objectives in centromere research is to determine the complete repertoire of protein components that constitute the kinetochore. Here, we identify a novel centromere protein using a centromere-positive autoimmune serum from a patient with watermelon stomach disease. Western blot and screening of a lambda phage expression library revealed a 60-kDa protein, ZNF397. This protein belongs to the classical Cys₂His₂ group of the zinc-finger protein superfamily and contains two conserved domains: a leucine-rich SCAN domain and nine Cys₂His₂ zinc fingers. Bioinformatic analysis shows that ZNF397 is conserved in placental mammals. Stable GFP:ZNF397-expressing human cells show co-localisation of ZNF397 with the constitutive centromere protein CENP-A during interphase and early prophase. Deletion and domain-swap constructs indicate that the SCAN domain is necessary but not sufficient for centromere localisation. Gene-knockout studies in mice using the mouse orthologue (Zfp397) reveal that ZNF397 is a non-essential protein. These properties define ZNF397 as a member of a new class of interphase to early prophase-specific and SCAN domain-containing mammalian centromere protein. The possible role of this protein in transcription at the centromere is discussed. 3aWestern blotting 3abacteriophages 3abioinformatics 3achromatids 3ahumans 3ainterphase 3amice 3amitosis 3apatients 3aprophase 3ascreening 3astomach 3awatermelons 3azinc finger motif 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Western 2aCentromerexgenetics 2aComputational Biology 2aGastric Antral Vascular Ectasiaximmunology 2aGene Components 2aHeLa Cells 2aHumans 2aImmune Seraximmunology 2aInterphasexgenetics 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout 2aMicroscopy, Fluorescence 2aProtein Structure, Tertiaryxgenetics 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 2aZinc Fingersxgenetics1 aChang, S.

Elevated [CO2] had no significant effect on either stem height or diameter growth; however, both stem height and diameter growth were enhanced by the high nutrient supply rate, and these increases were stimulated by elevated [CO2]. Elevated [CO2] tended to increase the width of the annual xylem ring, the number of cells in a radial file spanning the ring, and tracheid lumen diameter, whereas it tended to reduce cell wall thickness, although there were no statistically significant CO2 effects on tracheid anatomy. Changes in tracheid cell morphology seemed to be dependent on changes in shoot elongation rates. 3acarbon dioxide 3agrowth rings 3adiameter 3atracheids 3astems 3athickness 3acell walls 3anutrient availability 3aplant characteristics 3aheight 3aLarix sibirica 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aLarixxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Stemsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aRussia 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0agrowth 0axylem 0awood anatomy1 aFunada, R.1 aMori, S.1 aMaruyama, Y.1 aAbaimov, A.P.1 aKayama, M.1 aKoike, T.0 tTree physiology.g2001 Oct., v. 21, no. 16 p.1223-1229x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.16.12233Available from publisher's Web site  a20020204b20020208c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03190naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245012900146300001600275500001500291520139000306650002101696650001601717650002101733650002501754650002001779650002901799650002501828650001201853650002001865650001101885650002101896650004601917650002101963650004201984650002102026650001302047650003202060650002002092650003002112650004802142650003702190650003602227653001702263653001702280653002302297653001502320653001402335653001402349653002702363700001502390700001602405700001902421773005802440852000902498930003302507945001302540946001102553655001202564IND2038880120221120044431.0940418s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203888012DNAL7 a82623722pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeinstein, M.10aMutants of the two-component regulatory protein FixJ of Rhizobium meliloti that have increased activity at the nifA promoter  ap. 145-152.  a2019-12-05  aFixL and FixJ belong to a two-component regulatory system in Rhizobium meliloti that induces the expression of numerous nitrogen-fixation genes during symbiosis with alfalfa. FixJ is a positive activator required for transcription of the regulatory genes nifA and fixK, while FixL is an oxygen-binding hemoprotein capable of regulating the phosphorylation status of both itself and FixJ, in response to oxygen availability. In this study, we isolated four FixJ mutants that display increased activity at the nifA promoter (PnifA) in Escherichia coli. All four mutants possess amino acid changes in a domain of FixJ that is conserved in other response regulator proteins, and all exhibit increased activity at PnifA in R. meliloti that is dependent on the presence of FixL. One of the mutant proteins, while less efficient at accepting phosphate from a truncated derivative of FixL (FixL*), nevertheless has a phosphorylated form that is more stable than the phosphorylated form of wild-type (wt) FixJ and is more resistant to the phosphatase activity of FixL*. The wt FixJ-phosphate was found to have a half-life of approximately 4 h, which makes it an unusually long-lived response regulator protein. The exceptional stability of wt FixJ-phosphate and the altered phosphorylation properties observed for the mutant are discussed in relation to signal transduction in the FixLJ system. 3astructural genes 3amutagenesis 3aEnsifer meliloti 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3atranscription (genetics) 3aDNA-binding proteins 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3aoxygen 3apromoter regions 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEscherichia coli 2aGene Expression Regulation, Bacterial 2aGenes, Bacterial 2aMutation 2aNitrogen Fixationxgenetics 2aPhosphorylation 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aRecombinant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSinorhizobium melilotixgenetics 2aTranscription Factorsxgenetics 0afixj protein 0afixl protein 0agenetic regulation 0aregulation 0afixk gene 0anifa gene 0aSinorhizobium meliloti1 aLois, A.F.1 aDitta, G.S.1 aHelinski, D.R.0 tGene.g1993, v. 134, no. 2 p.145-152x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940504b19940511c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02057naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245005900131300002000190500002400210520116100234650002001395650001601415650002301431650000901454650002101463650002101484650001101505650001401516650001501530650002201545650000901567650001501576773011901591852000901710655001201719IND4467666020221123043341.0130430s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446766602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoung, Vernon R.10aIntroduction to the 2nd Amino Acid Assessment Workshop  ap. 2015S-2020S.  aIncludes references  aThe proportions of amino acids in diets typical of human populations usually differ from the proportions in which they are required, although adverse effects due to such differences are not common. However, there is little systematic information about the adverse effects and the pathophysiological mechanisms of excessive intakes of single or mixtures of amino acids in human subjects. To promote the safe and effective application of amino acids in clinical nutrition and for health promotion it is necessary to establish a sound scientific basis for evaluating their efficacy and safety under various conditions of use. Hence, a series of Amino Acid Assessment Workshops (AAAW) are being organized to bring together experts in amino acid nutrition, metabolism, cell and molecular biology, toxicology and regulation/policy with the eventual purpose of establishing a paradigm for the characterization of risks associated with the ingestion of specific intakes of amino acids by humans. In this introductory paper I summarize the major issues arising at the 1st AAAW, held in Tokyo June, 2001, and provide an introductory context to the present, 2nd AAAW. 3aadverse effects 3aamino acids 3aclinical nutrition 3adiet 3ahealth promotion 3ahuman population 3ahumans 3aingestion 3ametabolism 3amolecular biology 3arisk 3atoxicology0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 June, v. 133, no. 6S-I p.2015S-2020SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02405naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002400110245006900134300002000203500002400223520155200247650001601799650002401815650001401839650001701853650001301870650001401883650001801897650000901915650002001924650001901944773011901963852000902082655001202091IND4467666220221123043205.0130430s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446766622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodricks, Joseph V.10aApproaches to risk assessment for macronutrients and amino acids  ap. 2025S-2030S.  aIncludes references  aRisk assessment is a well-established framework for organizing and evaluating diverse, and sometimes conflicting information, to assess the likelihood that agents in the environment may harm human health under known or expected conditions of exposure. Risk assessments are used by regulatory and public health officials to guide judgments and actions regarding the need for risk reduction and the appropriate means to achieve it. These judgments and actions are called risk management, and are guided by law, historical precedent and public health, economic and social concerns. Those in the nutrition community who have been called upon to make recommendations regarding adequate nutrient intakes have long been engaged in the practice of risk assessment. That is, they have assessed the harmful health effects of inadequate intakes and defined intakes likely to avoid such harm. During the past decade attention has turned to the potential health risks of excessive nutrient and nutritional supplement intakes. A recent study released by a committee of the Institute of Medicine illustrates the difficulties in deriving risk-based upper levels of intake for nutrients and nutritional supplements. Amino acids were the subject of extensive discussions by this committee, but in no case was an upper level of intake recommended. It is clear that the extent of scientific investigation of the harmful effects of amino acids has been highly uneven, and that significant questions remain regarding the appropriate methodologies to study such effects. 3aamino acids 3adietary supplements 3aeconomics 3ahuman health 3amedicine 3anutrients 3apublic health 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3arisk reduction0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 June, v. 133, no. 6S-I p.2025S-2030SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245004500131300002000176500002400196520180800220650002002028650001202048650001402060650001702074650002102091650001402112650001102126650001502137650001202152650001002164650002002174650002002194650002202214650001602236650001302252650001602265650002402281650002002305650001302325700002102338773011902359852000902478655001202487IND4467666620221123022103.0130430s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446766662DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKadowaki, Motoni10aAmino acids as regulators of proteolysis  ap. 2052S-2056S.  aIncludes references  aProteolysis, as well as protein synthesis, is a major process that contributes to the body protein turnover. Despite the huge variety of proteases in the body, there are very few proteolytic systems contributing to the complete hydrolysis of proteins to amino acids. The autophagic-lysosomal pathway is responsible for bulk proteolysis, whereas the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a significant role in the fine control of the degradation of specific proteins. Both systems can produce free amino acids as a final product, but only the autophagy system is physiologically controlled by plasma amino acids. Recently, the study of amino acids as regulators of macromolecular turnover has been focused on for their signal transduction mechanism. In autophagic proteolysis, several amino acids have a direct regulatory potential: Leu, Gln, Tyr, Phe, Pro, Met, Trp and His in the liver, and Leu in the skeletal muscle. These amino acids are recognized at the plasma membrane, indicating the possible existence of an amino acid receptor/sensor for their recognition and subsequent intracellular signaling. Another line of evidence has emerged that protein kinase cascades such as mTOR, Erk, eIF2alpha α etc. may be involved in the regulation of autophagy, and that amino acids, in combination with insulin, may exert their effects through these pathways. From the viewpoint of amino acid safety, the contribution of proteolysis to possible adverse effects caused by excessive amino acid intake is not clear. At present, there is one report that excess glutamine at 10-fold the plasma level has an abnormal inhibitory effect on hepatic proteolysis, due to a lysosomotropic toxicity of ammonia derived from glutamine degradation. Whether this may lead to an adverse effect in humans remains to be clarified. 3aadverse effects 3aammonia 3aautophagy 3abody protein 3afree amino acids 3aglutamine 3ahumans 3ahydrolysis 3ainsulin 3aliver 3aplasma membrane 3aprotein kinases 3aprotein synthesis 3aproteinases 3aproteins 3aproteolysis 3asignal transduction 3askeletal muscle 3atoxicity1 aKanazawa, Takumi0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 June, v. 133, no. 6S-I p.2052S-2056SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245016500144300001600309500001500325520083700340650002101177650001601198650002401214650002501238650002101263650001601284650001801300650000801318650003001326650002801356650003001384650003901414650003601453650002301489653001601512653002801528653002501556653001901581653002501600700001701625773005801642852000901700930003301709945001301742946001101755655001201766IND2038880420221123021836.0940418s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203888042DNAL7 a82623732pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLaten, H.M.10aSIRE-1, a long interspersed repetitive DNA element from soybean with weak sequence similarity to retrotransposons: initial characterization and partial sequence  ap. 153-159.  a2019-12-05  aGm776 is a 776-bp subregion of a member of an interspersed family of relatively homogeneous repetitive DNA elements from soybean (Glycine max). The fragment was originally amplified from soybean DNA by the polymerase chain reaction using a single 22-nucleotide primer, and consequently terminates in an inverted repeat. The elements defined by Gm776 are at least 10.6 kb in length and constitute a family of 500-800 members per haploid genome. The family has been designated SIRE-1 (soybean interspersed repetitive element 1). Overlapping regions of Gm776 exhibit suggestive DNA sequence similarity to Ta1 and Ty1, copia-like retrotransposons from Arabidopsis thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, respectively.

The accumulation of ABA was greater in young leaves and roots than in old leaves and roots. In mature leaves, ABA accumulation was related to the severity and duration of the desiccation treatment. Water loss equal to 12% of initial fresh weight caused the ABA content of mature leaves to increase measurably within 30 min and to double in 2.5 h. The drying treatment caused significant (P = 0.05) reductions in leaf water potential and stomatal conductance. Recovery of leaf water potential to the control value occurred within 10 min of rewatering the dehydrated leaves, but recovery of stomatal conductance took an hour or longer, depending on the interval between dehydration and rewatering. The addition of ABA to the transpiration stream of well-watered excised leaves was sufficient to cause partial stomatal closure within 1 h and, depending on ABA concentration, more or less complete stomatal closure within 3 h. When the ABA solution was replaced with water, stomatal conductance increased at a rate inversely related to the concentration of the ABA solution with which the leaves had been supplied. 3arehydration 3aquantitative analysis 3achemical constituents of plants 3astress response 3awater stress 3aSalix burjatica 3aabscisic acid 3astomata 3aroots 3aleaf conductance 2aAbscisic Acidxanalysisxphysiology. 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxanalysisxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistryxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aSalicaceaexchemistryxphysiology. 2aTreesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aWaterxphysiology 0adesiccation 0atranspiration 0aleaves1 aMcDonald, A.J.S.1 aStadenberg, I.1 aDavies, W.J.0 tTree physiology.g2001 July, v. 21, no. 11 p.759-764x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.11.7593Available from publisher's Web site  a20010929b20011005c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03492naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001600166245008200182300001800264500001500282520172200297650002102019650001002040650001802050650001202068650001202080650002102092650002002113650001802133650002002151650003602171650000802207650002302215650001302238650001002251650001002261650001602271650002902287650002102316650002802337650002802365650001202393650000902405650001602414650002202430650002202452653001202474700001602486700001602502700001702518700001802535700001602553700001402569700001702583773007702600852000902677856008702686930003302773945001302806946001102819655001202830IND2323689220221122222635.0011025e200109  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232368922DNAL7 a115810192pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.15.11232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEwers, F.W.10aSeasonal variation in xylem pressure of walnut trees: root and stem pressures  ap. 1123-1132.  a2019-12-04  aMeasurements of air and soil temperatures and xylem pressure were made on 17-year-old orchard trees and on 5-year-old potted trees of walnut (Juglans regia L.). Cooling chambers were used to determine the relationships between temperature and sugar concentration ([glucose] + [fructose] + [sucrose], GFS) and seasonal changes in xylem pressure development. Pressure transducers were attached to twigs of intact plants, root stumps and excised shoots while the potted trees were subjected to various temperature regimes in autumn, winter and spring. Osmolarity and GFS of the xylem sap (apoplast) were measured before and after cooling or warming treatments. In autumn and spring, xylem pressures of up to 160 kPa were closely correlated with soil temperature but were not correlated with GFS in xylem sap. High root pressures were associated with uptake of mineral nutrients from soil, especially nitrate. In autumn and spring, xylem pressures were detected in root stumps as well as in intact plants, but not in excised stems. In contrast, in winter, 83% of the xylem sap osmolarity in both excised stems and intact plants could be accounted for by GFS, and both GFS and osmolarity were inversely proportional to temperature. Plants kept at 1.5 degrees C developed positive xylem pressures up to 35 kPa, xylem sap osmolarities up to 260 mosmol l(-1) and GFS concentrations up to 70 g l(-1). Autumn and spring xylem pressures, which appeared to be of root origin, were about 55% of the theoretical pressures predicted by osmolarity of the xylem sap. In contrast, winter pressures appeared to be of stem origin and were only 7% of the theoretical pressures, perhaps because of a lower stem water content during winter. 3asoil temperature 3astems 3aJuglans regia 3aglucose 3asucrose 3aosmotic pressure 3aair temperature 3aroot pressure 3anutrient uptake 3achemical constituents of plants 3asap 3aseasonal variation 3afructose 3axylem 3aroots 3ameasurement 2aJuglandaceaexphysiology 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPlant Rootsxphysiology 2aPlant Stemsxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aSoil 2aTemperature 2aTreesxphysiology 2aWaterxphysiology 0aJuglans1 aAmeglio, T.1 aCochard, H.1 aBeaujard, F.1 aMartignac, M.1 aVandame, M.1 aBodet, C.1 aCruiziat, P.0 tTree physiology.g2001 Sept., v. 21, no. 15 p.1123-1132x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.15.11233Available from publisher's Web site  a20011101b20011108c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle02603naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245012600144300001600270520078300286650002901069650002101098650002101119650000801140650001901148650002501167650002501192650002201217650001701239650001201256650002301268650002401291650001201315650001801327650002301345650001601368650004301384650001801427650001101445650002901456650002801485650002101513650004801534650002401582650003901606650003801645650003401683650002501717650001601742650003301758653002801791653001901819700001501838773005801853852000901911930003301920945001301953946001101966655001201977IND2038341620221122201828.0940329s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203834162DNAL7 a82248612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEllis, E.M.14aThe Saccharomyces cerevisiae MTS1 gene encodes a putative RNA-binding protein involved in mitochondrial protein targeting  ap. 175-183.  aMost proteins present in the mitochondrion are nuclear encoded, and are directed to the organelle by virtue of a targeting sequence at the N terminus of the precursor protein. Mitochondrial (mt) protein targeting appears to require several accessory proteins that recognise mt precursors both in the cytoplasm and at the mt surface. We describe here the use of yeast genetics to identify a protein that is required for mt protein targeting. Two yeast mutants (mts1 and mts2) were isolated as extragenic suppressors of a known targeting defect in the presequence of the beta-subunit of ATP synthase. We have cloned and sequenced the wild-type allele of one of these genes (MTS1) and shown that it encodes a member of a family of RNA-binding proteins that is essential for growth. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3astructural genes 3abinding proteins 3aRNA 3anucleoproteins 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3aprotein transport 3amitochondria 3amutants 3aribonucleoproteins 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungal 2aFungal Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenes, Fungal 2aHumans 2aMitochondriaxmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNuclear Proteins 2aRNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRestriction Mapping 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexgenetics 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aSuppression, Genetic 2aTemperature 2aVesicular Transport Proteins 0amolecular sequence data 0agenbank/x709511 aReid, G.A.0 tGene.g1993, v. 132, no. 2 p.175-183x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01451naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002100129245007700150300001800227500002400245520056800269650002300837650002200860650001300882650001500895650004000910650006600950700002201016773011401038852000901152655001201161IND4466768620221122201944.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676862DNAL7 a126729492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPelto, Gretel H.10aSocial Research in an Integrated Science of Nutrition: Future Directions  ap. 1231-1234.  aIncludes references  aThis paper is one in a series from the American Society of Nutritional Sciences Long Range Planning Committee, in which we are attempting to map out the implications of future directions in nutritional sciences for ASNS.

A low transformation of Se into organic forms was observed in radish plants grown in Se(VI)-enriched culture media. On the contrary, in those plants exposed to selenite, >95% of the total selenium was found as selenocystine (SeCys2), selenomethionine (SeMet), and Se-methylselenocysteine (SeMetSeCys). The concentrations of these species in fresh samples remained almost unaltered after a simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Therefore, a high selenium content of Se-methylselenocysteine (65%), previously reported as a cancer chemopreventive species, remained in the potentially bioabsorbable fraction. As these plants usually undergo a short development cycle, these results suggest that radish enriched in selenite could be a good choice as an organoselenium supplement for the human diet and animal feed. 3aselenomethionine 3ain vitro digestion 3anutrient content 3abioavailability 3aradishes 3anutrient uptake 3aselenium 3achemical speciation 3aRaphanus sativus 3adigestibility 3amineral content 0aselenocystine 0aseleno amino acids 0aselenite 0aselenium-methylselenocysteine1 aMadrid, Y.1 aCamara, C.0 tJournal of agricultural and food chemistry.g2006 Mar. 22, v. 54, no. 6 p.2412-2417dAmerican Chemical Society, Books and Journals Division]x0021-85617nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf052500n3Available from publisher's Web site  a20060809b20060906c00000000  aINDdRHFe2006/06/28  aOther US 7aarticle03838naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002100164245011900185300001600304500002400320520198100344650001502325650002602340650001202366650002602378650001902404650001502423650001002438650001102448650002102459650001402480650001402494650001702508650001702525650001102542650002502553650001402578650002502592650002102617650002302638650002202661650002502683650002802708650006302736650001602799650002002815650002402835650001702859651001102876653001802887653002102905653002502926653001502951653002602966700003202992700002203024773008503046852000903131856004803140655001203188IND4387947620221122170253.0070218e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438794762DNAL7 a170891402pmid7 a10.1007/s00442-006-0580-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDorrepaal, Ellen10aChanging leaf litter feedbacks on plant production across contrasting sub-arctic peatland species and growth forms  ap. 251-261.  aIncludes references  aPlant species and growth forms differ widely in litter chemistry, which affects decay and may have important consequences for plant growth via e.g. the release of nutrients and growth-inhibitory compounds. We investigated the overall short-term (9.5 months) and medium-term (21.5 months) feedback effects of leaf litter quality and quantity on plant production, and tested whether growth forms can be used to generalise differences among litter species. Leaf litter effects of 21 sub-arctic vascular peatland species on Poa alpina test plants changed clearly with time. Across all growth forms, litter initially reduced plant biomass compared with untreated plants, particularly litters with a high decomposition rate or low initial lignin/P ratio. In the second year, however, litter effects were neutral or positive, and related to initial litter N concentration (positive), C/N, polyphenol/N and polyphenol/P ratios (all negative), but not to decomposability. Differences in effect size among several litter species were large, while differences in response to increasing litter quantities were not significant or of similar magnitude to differences in response to three contrasting litter species. Growth forms did not differ in initial litter effects, but second-year plant production showed a trend (P < 0.10) for differences in response to litters of different growth forms: evergreen shrubs < graminoids or deciduous shrubs < forbs. While long-persisting negative litter effects were predominant across all growth forms, our data indicate that even within nutrient-constrained ecosystems such as northern peatlands, vascular plant species, and possibly growth forms, differ in litter feedbacks to plant growth. Differences in the composition of undisturbed plant communities or species shifts induced by external disturbance, such as climate change, may therefore feedback strongly to plant biomass production and probably nutrient cycling rates in northern peatlands. 3aPoa alpina 3abiogeochemical cycles 3abiomass 3abotanical composition 3aclimate change 3aecosystems 3aforbs 3alignin 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3apeatlands 3aplant growth 3aplant litter 3ashrubs 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aEcosystem 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aLigninxanalysis 2aNitrogenxanalysis 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPhosphorusxanalysis 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPoaxanatomy & histologyxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aPolyphenols 2aSoilxanalysis. 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aSweden 0aHigh latitude 0aLitter chemistry 0aLitter decomposition 0aPhytometer 0aPlant functional type1 aCornelissen, Johannes H.

However, recent studies with cultured cells have suggested that it has the opposite effect, and that iron deficiency enhances expression of ceruloplasmin. We therefore examined in rats how nutritional iron status would affect expression of ceruloplasmin. Groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared on a low iron, starch-based diet for 6–8 wk; half were supplemented by injection of iron dextran. At killing, hematocrits of deficient rats were half normal. Supplemented rats had normal liver concentrations of ferritin and ferritin iron. No ferritin was detected in the livers of the deficient rats. Northern analysis showed that ferritin L and H mRNAs were present in the deficient livers, but expression was half that of the normal rats. There was also twice as much copper. Levels of circulating ceruloplasmin (measured by rocket immunoelectrophoresis) were not altered by iron deficiency, although p-phenylenediamine oxidase activity and plasma copper were reduced ∼30%. In repeated studies, no differences in the expression of hepatic ceruloplasmin mRNA were detected. Treatment of rats of both sexes with additional iron (25 mg as iron dextran) 5–14 d before killing increased liver ferritin but did not alter liver ceruloplasmin mRNA expression or levels of circulating ceruloplasmin. We conclude that iron status is not an important factor in the expression of plasma ceruloplasmin made by the liver. However, it does have modest effects on steady-state levels of liver ferritin mRNA. 3ablood 3acopper 3acultured cells 3adextran 3adiet 3aferritin 3aferroxidase 3agene expression 3aimmunoelectrophoresis 3airon 3aliver 3amessenger RNA 3arats 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCeruloplasminxanalysisxgenetics. 2aCopperxblood 2aFemale 2aFerritinsxbloodxgenetics. 2aGene Expressionxdrug effects 2aHematocrit 2aImmunoelectrophoresis 2aIron, Dietaryxadministration & dosage 2aLiverxchemistry 2aMale 2aNutritional Status 2aRNA, Messengerxanalysis 2aRats 2aRats, Sprague-Dawley1 aAshraf, Mubeen1 aJones, LaTrice1 aWestbrook, Terence1 aHazegh-Azam, Maryam1 aLinder, Maria C.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 Mar., v. 132, no. 3 p.351-356dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03433naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002500129245012900154300001600283500002400299520169800323650001402021650001102035650002702046650001802073650002002091650003102111650001002142650001202152650001102164650001202175650002202187650002502209650002602234650000902260650001202269650001002281650004702291650001202338650003302350650002802383650001602411650002002427650002602447650002702473650004702500650005102547650001602598650005002614650000902664650001702673650001202690700002002702773011202722852000902834655001202843IND4466769220221122132206.0130429s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676922DNAL7 a118805552pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaterland, Robert A.10aEarly Postnatal Nutrition Determines Adult Pancreatic Glucose-Responsive Insulin Secretion and Islet Gene Expression in Rats  ap. 357-364.  aIncludes references  aHuman epidemiologic and experimental animal studies suggest strongly that prenatal and early postnatal nutrition influence adult susceptibility to diet-related chronic disease. To elucidate biologic mechanisms linking divergent early nutritional sufficiency to adult insulin axis function in an animal model of “metabolic imprinting,” this research focused on the following two objectives: 1) identify a tissue responsible for effect persistence, and 2) identify genes showing sustained differential expression in that tissue. Newborn rats were assigned randomly to small (SL), control (C) or large litters (LL) until weaning. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests were conducted directly after weaning (age 26 d) and in adulthood (ages 110 and 255 d). Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets was assessed at those ages. DNA microarrays were used to identify genes showing persistent between-group differential expression in isolated islets. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests suggested persistently reduced pancreatic glucose-responsiveness in SL and LL rats. Insulin tolerance tests showed no group differences in whole-body insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. These data support the hypothesis that the endocrine pancreas contributes to primary imprinting in this model. Persistent defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated islets also supported this hypothesis but only in SL rats. Of 13 named islet genes showing SL vs. C differential expression at age 26 d, 10 remained differentially expressed at age 110 d. These data indicate that the endocrine pancreas plays a primary role in the putative metabolic imprinting mechanism in SL rats. 3aadulthood 3aadults 3aanimal experimentation 3aanimal models 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aglucose 3ahumans 3ainsulin 3ainsulin secretion 3aislets of Langerhans 3amicroarray technology 3arats 3aweaning 2aAging 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aAnimals, Newbornxphysiology 2aBlood Glucosexanalysis 2aBody Weight 2aGene Expression 2aGlucosexpharmacology 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aInsulinxbloodxdiagnostic usexsecretion. 2aIslets of Langerhansxdrug effectsxsecretion. 2aLitter Size 2aPancreasxdrug effectsxgrowth & development. 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aWeaning1 aGarza, Cutberto0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 Mar., v. 132, no. 3 p.357-364dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03586naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001600128245015800144300001600302520172200318650002802040650002102068650002102089650002102110650002702131650001802158650002002176650002002196650002702216650002002243650001602263650004302279650005802322650001802380650002302398650001602421650004002437650002102477650002802498650003202526650005102558650001302609650002502622650003902647650002702686650002802713653001602741700001802757700001702775700001702792700001802809700002102827773005802848852000902906930003302915945001302948946001102961655001202972IND2038342820221120193832.0940329s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203834282DNAL7 a82248642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTobin, M.B.14aThe requirement for subunit interaction in the production of Penicillium chrysogenum acyl-coenzyme A: isopenicillin N acyltransferase in Escherichia coli  ap. 199-206.  aSubunit interaction in the formation of active acyl-coenzyme A:isopenicillin N acyltransferase (AT) has been investigated. Various AT derivatives were produced from altered Penicillium chrysogenum penDE genes placed in Escherichia coli expression systems. The regions of penDE encoding the alpha (11 kDa) and beta (29 kDa) AT subunits were separated at the DNA level by linker insertion at the region encoding Gly(102)/CYS(103). Synthesis of AT from the resulting two-cistron mRNA resulted in active alpha,beta-heterodimeric recombinant AT (reAT), containing subunits of 11 and 29 kDa (similar to wild-type AT). Complete separation of the alpha and beta subunits was performed by placing the region of penDE encoding each subunit on different plasmids. Production of either subunit in the absence of the other did not form active reAT. However, cotransformation of E. coli with two plasmids, each encoding a different AT subunit, produced reAT having acyl-coenzyme A:6-aminopenicillanic acid (acyl-CoA:6-APA) AT activity. Mutation of penDE replacing Thr(105) with Asn resulted in inactive and uncleaved reAT. Coexpression of this mutant penDE with a penDE derivative encoding the beta subunit in E. coli produced acyl-CoA:6-APA AT activity. These results suggest that the formation of reAT involves cooperative folding events between the subunits. In vitro transcription/translation was used to determine the origin of the AT hydrolase activity that cleaves the 40-kDa precursor polypeptide. The appearance of a 29-kDa protein (and presumably the corresponding 11-kDa protein, although not observable) from the 40-kDa in vitro translated protein provides further evidence that AT hydrolysis is an autocatalytic event. 3aPenicillium chrysogenum 3aEscherichia coli 3astructural genes 3aacyltransferases 3agenetic transformation 3agene transfer 3agene expression 3aenzyme activity 3amolecular conformation 3aplasmid vectors 3amutagenesis 2aAcyl Coenzyme Axgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aAcyltransferasesxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBase Sequence 2aCloning, Molecular 2aDNA, Fungal 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aEscherichia coli 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPenicillin-Binding Proteins 2aPenicillium chrysogenumxenzymologyxgenetics. 2aPlasmids 2aProtein Biosynthesis 2aRecombinant Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTransformation, Genetic 0apende genes1 aBaldwin, J.E.1 aCole, S.C.J.1 aMiller, J.R.1 aSkatrud, P.L.1 aSutherland, J.D.0 tGene.g1993, v. 132, no. 2 p.199-206x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02888naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001600164245004000180300001600220500001500236520149300251650001301744650001801757650001901775650001101794650004501805650005101850650002301901650004501924651001101969653001901980653001801999653001802017653001602035653001102051653002602062653001602088653001002104700001502114700001402129700001502143773007302158852000902231856008502240930003302325945001302358946001102371655001202382IND2327751820221120183657.0020627e200203  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232775182DNAL7 a118747222pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/22.4.2612doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Y.S.10aGrowth strain in coconut palm trees  ap. 261-266.  a2019-12-04  aUntil recently, growth stress studies have been made only on coniferous and dicotyledonous trees. Growth stress of trees is thought to be initiated in newly formed secondary xylem cells. This stress can accumulate for years and is distributed inside the trunk. Major characteristics of the trunk of monocotyledonous trees include numerous vascular bundles scattered inside the ground tissue and the lack of secondary growth for enlarging the diameter of the trunk. We used the strain gauge method to measure the released growth strain of the monocotyledonous woody palm, coconut (Cocos nucifera L.), and to investigate the surface growth strain of the trunk and central cylinder at different trunk heights. The internal strains of both vertical and leaning trunks were measured and compared with those of coniferous and dicotyledonous trees. We found that tensile stress existed longitudinally on the surface of vertically growing trunks, whereas compression stress was found at the bending position of leaning trunks. Compression stress was found in the outer part of the central cylinder, whereas tensile stress is generally found in the outer part of the trunk in coniferous and dicotyledonous trees. The distribution of strain in the palm trunk is similar to that of compression wood of the leaning trunk of a conifer. Specific gravity was greater in the outer part of the trunk than in the inner part of the trunk. This difference may be related to the distribution of growth stress. 3adiameter 3areaction wood 3aCocos nucifera 3aheight 2aCocosxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Stemsxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aStress, Mechanical 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aTaiwan 0atensile stress 0aplant anatomy 0agrowth stress 0acompression 0astrain 0aplant vascular system 0aorientation 0axylem1 aChen, S.S.1 aLin, T.P.1 aChen, Y.S.0 tTree physiology.g2002 Mar., v. 22, no. 4 p.261-266x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/22.4.2613Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01209naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245014100159300001200300500002400312520032500336650001500661650001200676650001900688650001700707650001700724700002100741773010000762852000900862856004800871655001200919IND4430728120221120184059.0100101e201001  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443072812DNAL7 a10.1007/s11120-009-9505-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGovindjee10aPicosecond spectroscopy of the isolated reaction centers from the photosystems of oxygenic photosynthesis—ten years (1987-1997) of fun  ap. 1-6.  aIncludes references  aMike Wasielewski's pioneering work on Photosystem II photochemistry has an important place in the history of photosynthesis; we are proud to have been associated with him in making those first measurements.

Leaf samples of overstory and understory chestnut oak (Quercus prinus L.) and understory dogwood (Cornus florida L.) were collected during the 1994 (wet) and 1995 (dry) growing seasons from each of three treatments: dry (-33% throughfall), ambient (control) and wet (+33% throughfall). Foliar soluble carbohydrates and organic acids were measured by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. During May 1994, when the demand for sucrose was greatest, dogwood accumulated small amounts of glucose, quinic acid and Mg2+, offsetting a decline in nitrate concentration. As the mild drought continued and tree growth slowed, there was a significant accumulation of sucrose in dogwood in the dry treatment in June, and a trend toward increased K+. In overstory chestnut oak in the dry treatment over the same period, there were significant accumulations of fructose, glucose and K+, and a trend toward increased quinic acid accumulation. Sucrose did not become a key osmotically active compound in chestnut oak until August 1994. In 1995, with the exception of understory chestnut oak, there was no accumulation of K+ in either species. During the severe drought of 1995, monosaccharides, particularly glucose and fructose, accounted for most of the osmotic adjustment in both species. Among solutes, glucose constituted the largest accumulation in dogwood in the dry treatment in August 1995, followed by fructose and sucrose. There was only a moderate increase in solutes in chestnut oak trees in 1995, with fructose and glucose constituting over 50% of the predicted solute accumulation in July. Both species accumulated a wider array of solutes during the dry year than during the wet year, but treatment differences in solute accumulation in chestnut oak were partially limited by drought. The greater dehydration tolerance of chestnut oak than dogwood was evident in the higher baseline concentrations of organic solutes and the greater array of solutes accumulated in response to drought. 3aCornus florida 3ainterspecific variation 3aQuercus montana 3athroughfall 3aglucose 3asucrose 3achemical constituents of plants 3ahighlands 3amagnesium 3asolutes 3aseasonal variation 3anitrates 3apotassium 3afructose 3aquinic acid 3aleaves 3aunderstory 2aAdaptation, Physiologicalxphysiology 2aCarbohydratesxanalysis 2aCornusxphysiology 2aOsmotic Pressure 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aQuercusxchemistryxphysiology. 2aRain 2aSeasons 2aSoil 2aTreesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aWaterxphysiology 3aTennessee 0aTennessee 0aspecies differences 0agrowth rate 0acarbohydrates 0agrowth period 0aorganic acids and salts1 aTschaplinski, T.J.0 tTree physiology.g2002 Mar., v. 22, no. 4 p.251-260x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/22.4.2513Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03653naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245015000178300001600328500001500344520206300359650001802422650001902440650002502459650001402484650001402498650001302512650001002525650001902535650001902554650001102573650002102584650003102605650001002636650003102646650002902677650003602706650002702742650002202769650001702791650002202808653001802830700002102848700001802869773007302887852000902960856008502969930003303054945001303087946001103100655001203111IND2327752920221120184120.0020627e200204  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232775292DNAL7 a119607612pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/22.6.3632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPepin, S.10aResponses of transpiration and photosynthesis to reversible changes in photosynthetic foliage area in western red cedar (Thuja plicata) seedlings  ap. 363-371.  a2019-12-04  aExperiments were conducted on 1-year-old western red cedar (Thuja plicata Donn.) seedlings to determine the response of illuminated foliage to reversible changes in total photosynthetic foliage area (L(A)). Reductions in L(A) were brought about by either shading the lower foliage or by reducing the ambient CO2 concentration (c(a)) of the air surrounding the lower part of the seedling. In the latter case, the vapor pressure was also changed so that transpiration rates (E) could be manipulated independently of photosynthetic rates (A). We hypothesized that following such treatments, short-term compensatory changes would occur in stomatal conductance (g(s)) and A of the remaining foliage. These changes would occur in response to hydraulic signals generated by changes in the water potential gradient rather than changes in the distribution of sources and sinks of carbon within the seedling. When a portion of the foliage was shaded, there was an immediate reduction in whole-seedling E and a concomitant increase in g(s), A and E in the remaining illuminated foliage. However, the intercellular CO2 concentration did not change. These compensatory effects were fully reversed after the shade was removed. When the lower foliage A was reduced to < 0 micromol m(-2) s(-1), by shading or lowering c(a), and E was either unchanged or increased (by adjusting the vapor pressure deficit), there was no significant increase in g(s) and A in the remaining foliage. We conclude that compensatory responses in illuminated foliage occur only when reductions in L(A) are accompanied by a reduction in whole-plant E. The relationship between the reduction in whole-seedling E and the increase in A is highly linear (r2 = 0.68) and confirms our hypothesis of the strong regulation of gs by hydraulic signals generated within the seedling. We suggest that the mechanism of the compensatory effects is a combination of both increased CO2 supply, resulting from increased g(s), and a response of the rate of carboxylation, possibly related to the activity of Rubisco. 3aThuja plicata 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3aseedlings 3aleaf area 3alighting 3ashade 3avapor pressure 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aleaf conductance 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aLight 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aSeedlingsxphysiology. 2aThujaxphysiology 2aTime Factors 2aTreesxphysiology 0atranspiration1 aLivingston, N.J.1 aWhitehead, D.0 tTree physiology.g2002 Apr., v. 22, no. 6 p.363-371x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/22.6.3633Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle03184naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245008600147300001600233500002400249520170400273650001601977650001001993650000902003650001102012650001502023650001702038650001002055650000902065650003102074650000902105650006602114650000902180650004202189650004602231650001102277650001202288650001302300650000902313650001102322650000902333650001602342650004002358650002202398650002102420700002102441700001902462700002002481700002002501773011202521852000902633655001202642IND4466769820221120184154.0130429s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446676982DNAL7 a118805622pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlaluf, Simon10aDietary Carotenoids Contribute to Normal Human Skin Color and UV Photosensitivity  ap. 399-403.  aIncludes references  aThe aim of the current study was to determine whether dietary carotenoids influence skin pigmentation and UV photosensitivity in a healthy unsupplemented panel (n = 22) of Caucasian (skin Type II) subjects. Skin spectrophotometric and tristimulus (L*a*b*) CR200 chromameter readings were made at various body sites to objectively measure skin carotenoid levels and skin color, respectively. The minimal erythemal dose (MED) was also measured to determine the intrinsic UV photosensitivity of the skin. We found that tristimulus b* values (but not L* and a* values) were consistently and closely correlated with skin carotenoid levels at a number of body sites including the back (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), forehead (r = 0.85, P < 0.00001), inner forearm (r = 0.75, P < 0.0001) and palm of the hand (r = 0.78, P < 0.0001). Skin carotenoid levels and MED were also correlated in these subjects (r = 0.66, P < 0.001), as were tristimulus b* values and MED (r = 0.71, P < 0.0002). From these observations, we conclude that carotenoids from a normal, unsupplemented diet accumulate in the skin and confer a measurable photoprotective benefit (at least in lightly pigmented Caucasian skin), that is directly linked to their concentration in the tissue. Carotenoids also appear to contribute measurably and significantly to normal human skin color, in particular the appearance of “yellowness” as defined objectively by CR200 tristimulus b* values. On the basis of these findings we believe that objective measurements of skin color, in particular tristimulus b* values, may be a potentially useful means of monitoring dietary carotenoid status and assessing UV photosensitivity in Caucasian populations. 3acarotenoids 3acolor 3adiet 3ahumans 3amonitoring 3apigmentation 2aAdult 2aAged 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aBack 2aCarotenoidsxadministration & dosagexanalysisxpharmacology. 2aDiet 2aDose-Response Relationship, Radiation 2aErythemaxetiologyxprevention & control. 2aFemale 2aForearm 2aForehead 2aHand 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aSkinxchemistryxradiation effects. 2aSkin Pigmentation 2aUltraviolet Rays1 aHeinrich, Ulrike1 aStahl, Wilhelm1 aTronnier, Hagen1 aWiseman, Sheila0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 Mar., v. 132, no. 3 p.399-403dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03080naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001600166245012100182300001800303500001500321520147900336650002801815650001901843650002501862650001701887650001401904650002001918650001401938650001301952650001901965650001101984650001901995650001202014650001202026650001702038650003102055650001002086650003102096650005102127650003602178650004402214653002402258653001002282700001702292773007602309852000902385856008702394930003302481945001302514946001102527655001202538IND2327547420221120184022.0020613e200112  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232754742DNAL7 a117313452pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.18.13412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGreen, D.S.10aLight-mediated constraints on leaf function correlate with leaf structure among deciduous and evergreen tree species  ap. 1341-1346.  a2019-12-04  aLeaf structure has been shown to be an important determinant of leaf photosynthetic characteristics, yet the nature of this relationship remains ambiguous. It has been suggested that intra-leaf shading of chloroplasts may explain the negative influence of increasing leaf thickness/density on mass-based photosynthesis. To explore further the importance of light-mediated functional limitations conferred by leaf structure, we examined photosynthetic responses to high unidirectional and bidirectional irradiances among broad- and needle-leaves ranging widely in mass per area (LMA). Except for leaves with the lowest LMA (< 40 g m-2), photosynthesis increased in bidirectional irradiance, and the ratio of unidirectional to bidirectional photosynthesis (Au/Ab) was strongly and negatively related to LMA, approaching 0.5 for the thickest/densest leaves. Bidirectional illumination also increased stomatal conductance, but the magnitude of stomatal response was modest and uncorrelated with LMA. Consequently, the ratio of intercellular CO2 partial pressures during unidirectional versus bidirectional irradiation was positively related to LMA. Hence, it appears that many C3 leaves may not be "light saturated" under high unidirectional illumination. The negative, exponential Au/Ab-LMA relationship in this study supports the notion that, as LMA increases, an increasing fraction of leaf chloroplasts are functioning at subsaturating irradiance under unidirectional light. 3ainterspecific variation 3acarbon dioxide 3astomatal conductance 3aforest trees 3athickness 3alight intensity 3aleaf area 3alighting 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aultrastructure 3adensity 3abiomass 3achloroplasts 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aLight 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Transpirationxphysiology 2aTreesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 0aspecies differences 0alight1 aKruger, E.L.0 tTree physiology.g2001 Dec., v. 21, no. 18 p.1341-1346x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.18.13413Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03341naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003400111040001800145100001700163245008800180300001400268520162300282650001901905650001501924650001301939650002001952650003801972650001902010650001402029650002602043650002102069650002002090650002102110650001602131650002102147650002602168650002502194650002702219650003102246650004502277650004102322650004402363650005002407650004502457651001402502653001102516653001102527700001602538773007102554852000902625856008402634930003302718945001302751946001102764655001202775IND2327548820221120184046.0020613e200201  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232754882DNAL7 a117725512pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/22.1.112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWarren, C.R.10aPhosphorus affects growth and partitioning of nitrogen to Rubisco in Pinus pinaster  ap. 11-19.  aWe tested the hypothesis that photosynthetic and growth responses to phosphorus (P) are functions of differences in the partitioning of nitrogen (N) among different compounds, particularly ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). We tested this hypothesis in: (a) a greenhouse experiment with mycorrhizal seedlings of Pinus pinaster Ait. grown in sand culture for 4 months with six factorial combinations of N (0.125 and 2.0 mM) and P (0.02, 0.08 and 0.34 mM); and (b) a field study in which P was applied at five rates (up to 175 kg ha-1) to 2-year-old P. pinaster growing on P-deficient siliceous sand. After 4 months of nutrient addition or 2 years after fertilizer application, we measured light-saturated rates of photosynthesis, growth, and N and P allocation in needles. Growth of P. pinaster increased significantly with increasing concentrations of P, as did the concentration of P in needles. Concentrations of P and Rubisco were positively related, whereas those of N and Rubisco were unrelated. At low-P supply, the Rubisco/Chl ratio varied between 8.5 and 12 mmol mol-1. With P supply in excess of requirement (needle N:P ratio = 2-12) the Rubisco/Chl ratio increased to between 24 and 26 mmol mol(-1). Rates of light-saturated photosynthesis were unaffected by P supply because adequate concentrations of P were maintained in plants in all treatments. Orthophosphate accumulated in needles of plants receiving a high P supply, which may allow growth to continue for periods under P deficiency, provided that other nutrients also accumulate. In the case of N, Rubisco may fill this role. 3aPinus pinaster 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen 3aplant nutrition 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3aphotosynthesis 3aseedlings 3afield experimentation 3anutrient content 3aconifer needles 3anitrogen content 3amycorrhizae 3aapplication rate 2aAmino Acidsxanalysis 2aNitrogenxphysiology 2aPhosphorusxphysiology 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPinusxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxphysiology. 2aQuaternary Ammonium Compoundsxanalysis 2aRibulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylasexphysiology 2aTreesxgrowth & developmentxphysiology. 3aAustralia 0aratios 0agrowth1 aAdams, M.A.0 tTree physiology.g2002 Jan., v. 22, no. 1 p.11-19x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/22.1.113Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle03353naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245013800178300001600316500001500332520137400347650002001721650002801741650002301769650002601792650001501818650001501833650002301848650001201871650001501883650002101898650001401919650004501933650004201978650002402020650004002044650004302084650005102127650005702178650004202235650005502277650004202332650002502374650005102399653002402450653001002474653001102484700001602495700001602511773007302527852000902600856008502609930003302694945001302727946001102740655001202751IND2327753820221120184049.0020627e200204  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232775382DNAL7 a119607622pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/22.6.3732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiemi, K.10aEffects of exogenous diamines on the interaction between ectomycorrhizal fungi and adventitious root formation in Scots pine in vitro  ap. 373-381.  a2019-12-04  aProduction of free and conjugated polyamines by two ectomycorrhizal fungi, Pisolithus tinctorius (Pers.) Coker and Couch and Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr., was studied in vitro. Spermidine was the main polyamine in the mycelium of both fungi. Paxillus involutus also produced large amounts of the diamine putrescine, whereas Pisolithus tinctorius contained traces of the diamine cadaverine and released into the culture medium an unknown compound probably related to cadaverine or N-methylputrescine. Both fungi accelerated adventitious root formation and increased subsequent root growth of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) hypocotyl cuttings in vitro. Exogenous cadaverine enhanced rooting caused by Pisolithus tinctorius and also promoted mycorrhiza formation by the fungus. Putrescine and Paxillus involutus had a synergistic effect on root initiation, but not on subsequent root growth. We conclude that specific diamines may be involved in the interaction between ectomycorrhizal fungi and adventitious root formation in Scots pine, and that the effects of specific exogenous polyamines are dependent on the fungal strain and its ability to produce these compounds. The finding that Paxillus involutus enhanced rooting and root growth without mycorrhiza formation indicates that fungal-induced rooting is not necessarily related to visible mycorrhiza formation. 3aectomycorrhizae 3ainterspecific variation 3aPaxillus involutus 3aPisolithus tinctorius 3aspermidine 3acadaverine 3aadventitious roots 3arooting 3aputrescine 3aPinus sylvestris 3asynergism 2aBasidiomycotaxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aCadaverinexpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aMyceliumxdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aMycorrhizaexdrug effectsxphysiology. 2aPinusxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aPutrescinexpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aSeedlingsxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 2aSpermidinexpharmacologyxphysiology. 2aSperminexphysiology 2aTreesxdrug effectsxmicrobiologyxphysiology. 0aspecies differences 0aroots 0agrowth1 aHaggman, H.1 aSarjala, T.0 tTree physiology.g2002 Apr., v. 22, no. 6 p.373-381x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/22.6.3733Available from publisher's Web site  a20020801b20020807c00000000  aINDdMKS  aNon-US 7aarticle01547naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001300128245007200141300001600213520040900229650002200638650001600660650002100676650000800697650003000705650002600735650002700761650004200788650003000830650003400860653001200894653001800906653002000924700001400944700002800958700001500986773005801001852000901059930003301068945001301101946001101114655001201125IND2038346420221120173910.0940329s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203834642DNAL7 a82248702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUeki, N.10aDistribution of bent DNA structures in the fission yeast centromere  ap. 247-250.  aTo gain a clue as to the functional significance of DNA curvature, we experimentally characterized the distribution of bent DNA structures throughout the 35-kb cen1 sequence, one of the isolated functional centromeric DNA of the fission yeast, Schizosaccharomyces pombe.

There are many studies of the influences of light intensity and the photoperiod on flowering responses. Those results led to the development of novel practical technology for the control of flowering. However, there are many still unexplained phenomena on the light quality. Kalanchoe (Kalanchoe blossfeldiana Poellniz.) is well known as a typical qualitative (obligate) short-day (SD) plant and it has been used as experimental material for the flowering response. Thus, the flowering responses of two cultivars of kalanchoe, 'Arena' and 'Cora', were studied under the following light regimes: SD under four different light emitting diodes (LEDs), white, blue, green and red; SD under natural light + light extension (LE; 7 h from midnight); SD under natural light + photoperiod extension (12 h; 6:00-18:00) with supplementary LED lighting (four colours as above). In the case of LE, the flowering was completely inhibited under each light quality. Under SD, the earliest flowering occurred under red light. Blue light considerably delayed flowering. In contrast, photoperiod extension (to the critical photoperiod for kalanchoe) with blue light caused a distinct flowering response but there was no flowering under supplementary red and green light. It is concluded that the flowering of kalanchoe is mainly controlled by red light. The direct flowering response to blue light was weak but blue light had a secondary or indirect effect. 3aKalanchoe blossfeldiana 3ablue light 3acolor 3acultivars 3aflowering 3agreen light 3alight intensity 3alight quality 3alighting 3aphotoperiod 3ared light 3asolar radiation1 aKunii, M.0 tActa horticulturae.g2015 Dec. 23, , no. 1107 p.279-284dInternational Society for Horticultural Science.wJournal:jnl46289x0567-75727nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2015.1107.38  aDNAL 7aarticle02708naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003700111040001800148100001500166245009400181300001800275500001500293520123500308650001901543650001101562650001701573650002001590650001401610650002301624650002301647650001801670650001101688650003101699650001301730650005101743650002701794650001201821650002201833651001001855653003001865653001201895700002001907700001601927700001801943773007601961852000902037856008702046930003302133945001302166946001102179655001202190IND2327536020221120133011.0020612e200111  bcc|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232753602DNAL7 a116964122pmid7 a10.1093/treephys/21.17.12452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGielen, B.10aLeaf area dynamics in a closed poplar plantation under free-air carbon dioxide enrichment  ap. 1245-1255.  a2019-12-04  aThree Populus genotypes (P. alba L. (Clone 2AS-11), P. nigra L. (Clone Jean Pourtet) and P. x euramericana (Clone I-214)) growing in a managed, high-density forest plantation were exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) at CO2 concentrations expected to occur in the future (550 ppm). Leaf area index (optical LAI), measured with a fish-eye-type plant canopy analyzer, was not significantly affected by FACE after canopy closure in the second growing season. However, when stands of similar size were compared, optical LAI and number of main stem leaves were reduced by FACE. Allometric relationships, which were established to scale-up leaf area to the stand level (allometric LAI), did not differ between the FACE and control plots. Allometric LAI increased in response to FACE, as a result of increased tree dimensions and increased individual leaf size. We postulate that, although FACE increased allometric LAI, FACE had no effect on optical LAI after canopy closure, because FACE caused increased shading and competition resulting in enhanced leaf fall or leaf turnover. Specific leaf area (SLA) was unaffected by FACE. Allometric relationships and relative responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment were genotype-dependent. 3acarbon dioxide 3acanopy 3aPopulus alba 3aleaf area index 3aleaf area 3aforest plantations 3aPopulus canadensis 3aPopulus nigra 3aleaves 2aCarbon Dioxidexphysiology 2aForestry 2aPlant Leavesxanatomy & histologyxphysiology. 2aSalicaceaexphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTreesxphysiology 3aItaly 0acarbon dioxide enrichment 0aPopulus1 aCalfapietra, C.1 aSabatti, M.1 aCeulemans, R.0 tTree physiology.g2001 Nov., v. 21, no. 17 p.1245-1255x0829-318X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/treephys/21.17.12453Available from publisher's Web site  a20020630b20020705c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02390naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100003100149245013700180300001800317500002400335520120500359650002301564650001701587650001401604650002001618650001201638650001201650650001901662650002201681650002201703650001601725650001301741651001501754700002201769700002101791773009401812852000901906856008901915655001202004IND4466771020221120061101.0130429s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446677102DNAL7 a10.1016/S0261-2194(03)00157-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuzman-Plazola, Remigio A.10aEffects of relative humidity and high temperature on spore germination and development of tomato powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica)  ap. 1157-1168.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of relative humidity (RH) and temperature on tomato powdery mildew (Leveillula taurica) were studied in controlled environments to define conditions that affect disease development in fresh market tomatoes in California. Gradients of RH (20-90%) at constant temperatures (20-30°C) were generated in single growth chambers to determine their effect on mildew development on mature tomato plants. Temperatures of 30°C and above were deleterious for spore germination, germ tube elongation, and disease development. Lesion growth and rate of disease progress were significantly higher at 20°C than at 25°C. Low RH levels (20-40%) reduced spore germination and lesion growth, accelerated host tissue death and reduced disease progress. Intermediate RH levels (50-70%) increased spore germination and optimized disease development, provided temperatures were maintained within favorable limits. High RH levels (80-90%) were favorable for spore germination but continued exposure to these conditions led to a limited lesion growth and disease progress. Short daily periods (two or three daily exposures of at least 2 h) of high temperatures (35°C) suppressed disease development by 70-92%. 3aLeveillula taurica 3afresh market 3agerm tube 3agrowth chambers 3amarkets 3amildews 3apowdery mildew 3arelative humidity 3aspore germination 3atemperature 3atomatoes 3aCalifornia1 aDavis, R.

Arabinogalactan treatments included a high (1.65 g/d) and low (0.55 g/d) dose of AG100, AG1000 or AG3000 provided via gelatin capsules. Arabinogalactan forms differed in purification procedures. Each period consisted of a 6-d adaptation followed by a 4-d collection. Blood and fresh fecal samples were collected on d 10 of each period. Fecal score increased (P < 0.02) in dogs supplemented with the low dose of AG1000. Ileal and total tract dry matter (DM) and organic matter (OM) digestibilities were not affected by treatment. Dogs supplemented with the high dose of AG1000 tended (P = 0.15) to have a higher concentration of total aerobic fecal bacteria than control dogs. Dogs supplemented with the low dose of AG1000 and the high dose of AG3000 had higher concentrations of fecal lactobacilli (P = 0.04) and tended to have higher concentrations of fecal bifidobacteria (P ≤ 0.16) compared with control dogs. Dogs fed the low dose of AG3000 tended (P = 0.10) to have a lower concentration of fecal Clostridium perfringens compared with control dogs.

Meanwhile breeding staple foods that are dense in minerals and vitamins provides a low-cost, sustainable strategy for reducing levels of micronutrient malnutrition. Getting plants to do the work of fortification, referred to as “biofortification,” can reach relatively remote rural populations that conventional interventions are not now reaching and can even have benefits for increased agricultural productivity. Biofortification, thus, complements conventional interventions. The symposium articles discuss several examples of ongoing research projects to develop and disseminate nutrient-dense staple food crops and issues that remain to be resolved before successful implementation can be attained. 3aanimal products 3abiofortification 3adeveloping countries 3afish 3afood crops 3afruits 3amalnutrition 3aminerals 3aplant breeding 3aresearch projects 3arural population 3astaple foods 3avegetables 3avitamins0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 Mar., v. 132, no. 3 p.491S-494SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle00947naa a2200217 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245007100133300001800204500002400222520031100246650001100557650001100568650001500579773011400594852000900708655001200717IND4467671020221120112914.0130503s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446767102DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrinsky, Norman I.10aPossible Biologic Mechanisms for a Protective Role of Xanthophylls  ap. 540S-542S.  aIncludes references  aThis contribution surveys the evidence linking the presence of the two xanthophylls, lutein and zeaxanthin, to a protective role in the macular region of the retina.

S. population that consumes the most soy. Before birth and after weaning, most Americans are not exposed to appreciable levels of soyfoods other than foods that have small amounts of processed soy components. The opposite scenario occurs in Asia, because Asians are more likely to consume relatively high levels of soyfoods throughout life, except between birth and weaning, when breastfeeding or milk-based formula are common. Soy formula is made with soy protein isolate containing isoflavones (SPI+) and supports normal growth and development in term infants. Recent data suggest that there are no long-term adverse effects of early exposure to soy formula through young adulthood. It is as yet unknown whether soy formula consumption by infants will result in health problems or benefits upon aging, but multigenerational animal studies with diets made with SPI+ have not revealed any problems. Soy isoflavones can function as estrogen agonists, antagonists or selective estrogen receptor modulators, depending on the conditions, and much research has focused on health effects of purified isoflavones. Results from several studies suggest that the effects of diets made with SPI+ differ significantly from those of diets to which purified soy isoflavones are added. Furthermore, it seems that soy protein processed to contain lower levels of isoflavones also provides significant health benefits. Further research is needed to confirm the results of the few studies that have been conducted and new studies are needed to investigate the more subtle effects that could occur during development or that could surface later in life. 3aAmericans 3aAsians 3aadulthood 3aadverse effects 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abreast feeding 3afoods 3ainfants 3aisoflavones 3amilk 3asoy protein isolate 3aweaning 3aAsia1 aRonis, Martin J.J.1 aHakkak, Reza1 aRowlands, J.

Using a probe obtained by PCR amplification, we have isolated from the protozoan, Trypanosoma brucei, a cDNA clone encoding a CYC homologue. The amino acid sequence deduced for this gene (CYC1) shares structural homology with A- and B-type CYCs of other organisms, including a motif, the destruction box, which has been related to the rapid turnover of these CYC proteins in mitosis. When expressed in fission yeast, CYC1 is able to rescue the defect of a temperature-sensitive cdc13 mutant, demonstrating that it is functional as a cell-cycle regulator. In trypanosome cells, CYC1 associates with a 34-kda protein that cross-reacts with a monoclonal antibody against the conserved 'PSTAIR' epitope of p34cdc2, and the complex displays histone H1 PK activity. Furthermore, when trypanosome cells are synchronized by hydroxyurea treatment, CYC1 accumulates as cells progress towards mitosis. These observations, taken together, suggest that CYC1 is a component of the active PK complex required for the control of trypanosome mitosis. 3amitosis 3aproteins 3acomplementary DNA 3astructural genes 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3aTrypanosoma brucei 3anucleotide sequences 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aCDC2 Protein Kinasexgenetics 2aCyclin B 2aCyclinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aDNA, Complementary 2aGene Expression Regulation 2aHumans 2aMitosisxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSchizosaccharomycesxgenetics 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aTranscription, Genetic 2aTrypanosoma brucei bruceixchemistryxcytology. 0aregulation 0agenbank/x65625 0acyc1 gne 0amolecular sequence data 0acell cycle1 aGonzalez, S.A.1 aPays, E.0 tGene.g1993, v. 132, no. 1 p.75-82x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940415b19940418c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle03779naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245014600147300001400293500002400307520191900331650003102250650001002281650001502291650000902306650001702315650001602332650002502348650000902373650001802382650004002400650002002440650001202460650002502472650001402497650002502511650001202536650002102548650006402569650004202633650005002675650002302725650006302748650001802811650002202829650000902851650002702860650001102887650002402898650001202922650002202934650003702956650002102993700001903014700001303033773011003046852000903156655001203165IND4467672220221120092130.0130503s2002    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446767222DNAL7 a117735022pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLing, Wen Hua10aSupplementation of the Black Rice Outer Layer Fraction to Rabbits Decreases Atherosclerotic Plaque Formation and Increases Antioxidant Status  ap. 20-26.  aIncludes references  aThe influence of the supplementation of black and white rice outer layer fractions on atherosclerotic plaque formation induced by hypercholesterolemia was investigated in rabbits. Male rabbits (n = 32) were randomly divided into four groups. They were fed nonpurified diet (normal group), a lard (3.5 g/100 g) with high cholesterol (0.5 g/100 g) diet (HC group); the HC diet with 5 g/100 g white rice outer layer fraction (WRF group); or the HC diet with 5 g/100 g black rice outer layer fraction (BRF) for 2 mo. Blood samples were collected for determination of lipid concentration and oxidative and antioxidative status variables, and aortae were taken for the assessment of atherosclerotic plaques. The atherosclerotic plaque area in rabbits fed the BRF diet was 66% lower than that of the HC or WRF rabbits (P < 0.001). Supplementation of the black rice outer layer significantly (P < 0.05) lowered aortic 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) (−52%, −44%) compared with the WRF or HC diets (P < 0.05). There were no differences in aortic 8-OHdG levels between rabbits fed the BRF and normal diets. The BRF diet significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) level of serum (−37%) and aortic artery (−50%) compared with the WRF diet. There were no differences in the concentrations of serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-C or the ratio of apoprotein (apo)I/apoB among the HC, WRF and BRF groups. Similarly, there were no differences in the serum vitamin E concentration and erythrocyte and aorta superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities among rabbits fed these diets. The serum concentration of most fatty acids except 18:1 did not differ between the WRF and the BRF groups. We conclude that the inhibition of atherosclerotic plaque formation derived from the black rice outer layer fraction in rabbits might be mediated by antioxidative or anti-inflammatory effects. 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3aaorta 3ablack rice 3adiet 3aerythrocytes 3afatty acids 3ahypercholesterolemia 3alard 3alipid content 3alow density lipoprotein cholesterol 3amalondialdehyde 3arabbits 3asuperoxide dismutase 3avitamin E 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aAortaxpathology 2aArteriosclerosisxchemically inducedxprevention & control. 2aCholesterol, Dietaryxadverse effects 2aDeoxyguanosinexanalogs & derivativesxblood. 2aFatty Acidsxblood 2aHypercholesterolemiaxchemically inducedxphysiopathology. 2aLipidsxblood 2aLiverxmetabolism 2aMale 2aMalondialdehydexblood 2aOryza. 2aOxidation-Reduction 2aRabbits 2aRandom Allocation 2aSuperoxide Dismutasexmetabolism 2aVitamin Exblood1 aWang, Lin Llin1 aMa, Jing0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 Jan., v. 132, no. 1 p.20-26dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02685naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002000128245008800148300001600236500001500252520100400267650002701271650003401298650002101332650002001353650002801373650002501401650001501426650001201441650002101453650003701474650002301511650002201534650002301556650003501579650003301614650004201647650002801689650007201717650002401789650002301813650002601836653001201862653001601874653001401890700002101904700001701925700002201942700001901964773005801983852000902041930003302050945001302083946001102096655001202107IND2037597420221120071349.0940301s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203759742DNAL7 a84060332pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRabibhadana, S.10aIsolation and expression in Escherichia coli of a Xanthomonas oryzae recA-like gene  ap. 113-118.  a2019-12-05  aThe recA gene from the bacterium Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), a rice pathogen, was cloned based on its ability to complement DNA repair defects of Escherichia coli recA- mutants.

A similar molecular mass protein to RecA has been detected in several Xanthomonas pathovars using an anti-E. coli RecA antibody. Furthermore, the cloned Xoo recA was shown to hybridize to genomic DNA from various Xanthomonas pathovars, but not to genomic DNA from other bacteria species under high-stringency hybridization conditions.

The methanol extract of lichens showed antioxidant, antimicrobial and antityrosinase activities according to the order Usnea ghattensis > Arthothelium awasthii > Heterodermia podocarpa > Parmotrema tinctorum. The IC₅₀ values for the antioxidant and antityrosinase activities of U. ghattensis and A. awasthii were less than or equivalent to that of standard antioxidants and tyrosinase inhibitors. The methanol extracts of the lichen cultures Usnea ghattensis and Arthothelium awasthii were effective against Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract was found to be between 5 and 10 μg extract/mL. The results suggested that the extract of lichen cultures, U. ghattensis and A. awasthii, could be of use as an easily accessible source of natural antioxidants, tyrosinase inhibitory and antimicrobial properties as possible food supplements or in the pharmaceutical industry. 3aBacillus licheniformis 3aBacillus megaterium 3aBacillus subtilis 3aHeterodermia 3aParmotrema 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aUsnea 3aantibacterial properties 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3adietary supplements 3alichens 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3atissue culture 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxanalysis 2aBiological Productsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCulture Techniques 2aFlavonoidsxanalysis 2aFree Radical Scavengersxanalysis 2aInhibitory Concentration 50 2aLichensxchemistryxgrowth & development. 2aLipid Peroxidationxdrug effects 2aMonophenol Monooxygenasexantagonists & inhibitors 2aPhenolsxanalysis 2aPolyphenols 2aPolysaccharidesxanalysis 2aProteinsxanalysis1 aVerma, Neeraj1 aSonone, Anjali1 aMakhija, Urmila0 tPhytotherapy research.g2007 Dec., v. 21, no. 12 p.1159-1170dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x0951-418X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ptr.2228 7aarticle02040naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245007700167300001800244520100100262650000801263650003001271650001401301650001401315650001201329650001501341650001401356700001701370700001801387700002101405773012601426852000901552856008301561930003301644946001301677655001201690IND4406512920221123043342.0080606e20080606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440651292DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11548192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMiyoshi, Tomoichiro10aFission Yeast Pot1-Tpp1 Protects Telomeres and Regulates Telomere Length  ap. 1341-1344.  aTelomeres are specialized chromatin structures that protect chromosomal ends. Protection of telomeres 1 (Pot1) binds to the telomeric G-rich overhang, thereby protecting telomeres and regulating telomerase. Mammalian POT1 and TPP1 interact and constitute part of the six-protein shelterin complex. Here we report that Tpz1, the TPP1 homolog in fission yeast, forms a complex with Pot1. Tpz1 binds to Ccq1 and the previously undiscovered protein Poz1 (Pot1-associated in Schizosaccharomyces pombe), which protect telomeres redundantly and regulate telomerase in positive and negative manners, respectively. Thus, the Pot1-Tpz1 complex accomplishes its functions by recruiting effector molecules Ccq1 and Poz1. Moreover, Poz1 bridges Pot1-Tpz1 and Taz1-Rap1, thereby connecting the single-stranded and double-stranded telomeric DNA regions. Such molecular architectures are similar to those of mammalian shelterin, indicating that the overall DNA-protein architecture is conserved across evolution. 3aDNA 3aSchizosaccharomyces pombe 3achromatin 3aevolution 3amammals 3atelomerase 3atelomeres1 aKanoh, Junko1 aSaito, Motoki1 aIshikawa, Fuyuki0 tScience.g2008 June 6, v. 320, no. 5881 p.1341-1344dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11548193Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02817naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002300143245006500166300001800231520088300249650000901132650001101141650001201152650001001164650001201174650001501186700002101201700002101222700002101243700002901264700002301293700001901316700002301335700002201358700002401380700002101404700002101425700002401446700002301470700002301493700002301516700002201539700002201561700002101583700002101604700003601625700002301661700001601684700002301700700001801723700002401741700002001765700001801785700002501803700002301828700002201851773014401873852000902017856008302026930003302109946001302142655001202155IND4406512020221123022336.0080606e20080606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440651202DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11575802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChampion, David J.13aAn Eccentric Binary Millisecond Pulsar in the Galactic Plane  ap. 1309-1312.  aBinary pulsar systems are superb probes of stellar and binary evolution and the physics of extreme environments. In a survey with the Arecibo telescope, we have found PSR J1903+0327, a radio pulsar with a rotational period of 2.15 milliseconds in a highly eccentric (e = 0.44) 95-day orbit around a solar mass (M(middle dot in circle)) companion. Infrared observations identify a possible main-sequence companion star. Conventional binary stellar evolution models predict neither large orbital eccentricities nor main-sequence companions around millisecond pulsars. Alternative formation scenarios involve recycling a neutron star in a globular cluster, then ejecting it into the Galactic disk, or membership in a hierarchical triple system. A relativistic analysis of timing observations of the pulsar finds its mass to be 1.74 +/- 0.04 M solar symbol, an unusually high value. 3amass 3amodels 3aphysics 3aradio 3asurveys 3atelescopes1 aRansom, Scott M.1 aLazarus, Patrick1 aCamilo, Fernando1 aBassa, C.

We developed a quantitative sequencing-based method called RNA-Seq for mapping transcribed regions, in which complementary DNA fragments are subjected to high-throughput sequencing and mapped to the genome. We applied RNA-Seq to generate a high-resolution transcriptome map of the yeast genome and demonstrated that most (74.5%) of the nonrepetitive sequence of the yeast genome is transcribed. We confirmed many known and predicted introns and demonstrated that others are not actively used. Alternative initiation codons and upstream open reading frames also were identified for many yeast genes. We also found unexpected 3'-end heterogeneity and the presence of many overlapping genes. These results indicate that the yeast transcriptome is more complex than previously appreciated.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA fragmentation 3acomplementary DNA 3aopen reading frames 3ahigh-throughput nucleotide sequencing 3ayeasts 3atranscription (genetics) 3acodons 3atranscriptome 3aintrons 0agenes1 aWang, Zhong1 aWaern, Karl1 aShou, Chong1 aRaha, Debasish1 aGerstein, Mark1 aSnyder, Michael0 tScience.g2008 June 6, v. 320, no. 5881 p.1344-1349dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11584413Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01191naa a2200301 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001700115245012000132300001600252500001500268520022300283650001400506653002500520653003100545653001800576653002400594653006800618700001800686773011000704852000900814939003300823945000800856946001300864655001200877991580098920742620221123005134.0840518e198401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR840031082DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTuggle, B.N.14aThe occurrence of Pterygodermatites nycticebi (Nematoda: Rictulariidae) in a captive slow loris, Nycticebus coucang  ap. 162-163.  a2019-12-05  aPterygodermatites nycticebi from captive slow loris, brief description of male and female specimens, associated histological changes in host intestine, uncertain pathologic significance: Milwaukee County Zoo, Wisconsin 3ahelminths 0aMorphology, Nematoda 0aanimal parasites and pests 0aanimal health 0aPathology, Nematoda 0aPterygodermatites nycticebi (Nematoda)Nycticebus coucang (Host)1 aBeehler, B.A.0 tProceedings - Helminthological Society of Washington.g1984 Jan., v. 51, no. 1 p.162-163x0018-01307nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19840518c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle02417naa a2200361 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075024004400097040001800141100001800159245010200177300001400279500001500293520131500308650001901623650002201642650003101664650002001695650002201715650002101737651001601758653001701774653001901791653001701810700001601827773009001843852000901933856005701942939003301999946001102032655001202043991580098970742620221123005135.0861014e198607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aADL860690172DNAL7 a10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a0871862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomson, W.J.14aThe effect of speckled leaf blotch on apical development and yield in winter wheat in New Zealand  ap. 39-48.  a2019-12-04  aSpeckled leaf blotch (Mycosphaerella graminicola) reduced yield in a winter wheat trial by 18 per cent. Detailed analyses of the effects of disease on yield components showed that disease reduced both grain number per ear and grain weight. The reduction in grain number per ear was due to a decrease in grain number per spikelet, and this occurred for both main stem and tillers, and occurred equally at each spikelet position on the ear. The effect of disease on grain number was traced back to an earlier reduction in floret primordium number per ear, especially floret number per spikelet. It was suggested that floret primordium production was affected by the reduced assimilate supply to the developing apex. The effects of disease on yield could therefore be attributed to effects on plant development both before and after anthesis. The disease effects on yield were not necessarily associated with the time of maximum disease severity. Plots with the early phase of disease epidemic only showed a significant reduction in yield, but there was some evidence of compensation for early reductions to yield potential in the later-determined yield components. We suggest, therefore, that an effective disease-control programme must take into account the possible early effects of disease on yield potential. 3ainflorescences 3aplant development 3aMycosphaerella graminicola 3adisease control 3aTriticum aestivum 3ayield components 3aNew Zealand 0ayield losses 0aMycosphaerella 0ashoot apices1 aGaunt, R.E.0 tAnnals of botany.g1986 July, v. 58, no. 1 p.39-48wJournal:jnl44715x0305-73647nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a087186  a00000000b19861014c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02278naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001500129245011600144300001600260520066900276650002400945650002200969650002200991650004201013650002601055650002801081650001501109650001501124650001901139650001401158650001501172650001601187650001901203650001301222650002801235650003401263650003401297650004101331650002501372650002601397650002801423650003301451650004001484650001201524650001701536653001001553700001501563773008001578852000901658930003301667945001301700946001101713655001201724IND2331069820221123005255.0030228e200211  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND233106982DNAL7 a122275492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhan, M.R.10aEffects of root-dip treatment with certain phosphate solubilizing microorganisms on the fusarial wilt of tomato  ap. 213-215.  aRoot-dip application of Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Aspergillus awamori, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium digitatum resulted in significant decline in the rhizosphere population of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici.

A chemical fungicide gave 24% better yield. 3aAspergillus awamori 3aAspergillus niger 3aBacillus subtilis 3aFusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici 3aPenicillium digitatum 3aPseudomonas fluorescens 3acrop yield 3afungicides 3amicroorganisms 3apathogens 3aphosphates 3arhizosphere 3asolubilization 3atomatoes 2aAspergillusxmetabolism 2aAspergillus nigerxmetabolism 2aBacillus subtilisxmetabolism 2aFungicides, Industrialxpharmacology 2aFusariumxmetabolism 2aSolanum lycopersicum. 2aPenicilliumxmetabolism 2aPlant Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aPseudomonas fluorescensxmetabolism 2aSeasons 2aTime Factors 0awilts1 aKhan, S.M.0 tBioresource technology.g2002 Nov., v. 85, no. 2 p.213-215x0960-85247nnas  aDNAL  a20030508b20030509c00000000  aINDdGK1  aNon-US 7aarticle02804naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245012700125300001600252500001500268520170400283650002101987650002202008650002902030650002002059650002502079653002202104653002302126653001602149653001702165653001402182653001402196653001502210653002002225700001102245700001402256773005802270852000902328930003302337945001302370946001102383655001202394IND2036346220221122165820.0931217s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203634622DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatviw, H.10aIdentification and genetic analysis of Saccharomyces pombe cDNA that suppress deletion of IRA1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ap. 147-152.  a2019-12-05  aIra1 is a negative regulator of Ras proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of IRA1 leads to constitutive activation of the Ras/cyclic AMP (cAMP) pathway, which results in several phenotypes including sensitivity to heat-shock (HS) treatment. We have identified eight Schizosaccharomyces pombe cDNAs that, when overexpressed, suppress the HS-sensitive phenotype associated with the deletion of IRA1 in S. cerevisiae. To determine where these cDNAs act, we tested their ability to suppress other mutations that activate the Ras/cAMP pathway in S. cerevisiae. Two of the cDNA clones, pPSI1 and pPSI2, failed to suppress the HS-sensitive phenotype induced by the activating RAS2(Val19) mutation. Clone pPSI2 encodes Gap1/Sar1, a Sz. pombe homologue of Ira1, which has been previously identified. Three of the six RAS2(Val19) suppressors could suppress the deletion of PDE1 and PDE2, the cAMP phosphodiesterase (Pde)- encoding genes, suggesting that they act downstream from adenylyl cyclase (Cyr). The remaining three clones, pPSI3, pPSI6 and pPSI7, encode proteins that may suppress the HS-sensitive phenotype by reducing Ras and/or Cyr activity. One of these, pPSI3, contains a cDNA that encodes the C-terminal region (aa 166-550) of the Sz. pombe Dbp2 protein, a homologue of the human p68 RNA helicase. We have amplified cDNAs encoding the full-length Sz. pombe Dbp2 protein by the polymerase chain reaction method and have cloned them into a S. cerevisiae expression vector. The ira1- cells harboring these plasmids retained their HS-sensitive phenotype. These results suggest that the truncated Dbp2, but not the full-length protein, is capable of interfering with Ras and/or Cyr activity. 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3agene expression 3aDNA-binding proteins 0aSaccharomycetales 0agenetic regulation 0asuppressors 0aira1 protein 0adeletions 0aira1 gene 0ainhibition 0ainhibitor genes1 aYu, G.1 aYoung, D.0 tGene.g1993, v. 129, no. 1 p.147-152x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940105b19940110c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle02660naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001800128245012100146300001600267520088400283650002201167650002101189650002201210650002701232650002501259650002501284650001701309650002001326650002001346650001801366650002401384650001801408650002301426650001401449650002301463650002601486650001601512650001801528650002801546650003401574650005001608650003101658650003401689653001601723653002801739653001501767653001901782700001401801700002001815700002101835700001701856700001601873700002101889773005801910852000901968930003301977945001302010946001102023655001202034IND2036989020221122170318.0940131s1993    ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203698902DNAL7 a83596922pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlvarez, M.E.14aThe 59-kDa polypeptide constituent of 8-10-nm cytoplasmic filaments in Neurospora crassa is a pyruvate decarboxylase  ap. 253-258.  aThe fungus Neurospora crassa harbors large amounts of cytoplasmic filaments which are homopolymers of a 59-kDa polypeptide (P59Nc). We have used molecular cloning, sequencing and enzyme activity measurement strategies to demonstrate that these filaments are made of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC, EC 4.1.1.1), which is the key enzyme in the glycolytic-fermentative pathway of ethanol production in fungi, and in certain plants and bacteria. Immunofluorescence analyses of 8-10-nm filaments, as well as quantitative Northern blot studies of P59Nc mRNA and measurements of PDC activity, showed that the presence and abundance of PDC filaments depends on the metabolic growth conditions of the cells. These findings may be of relevance to the biology of ethanol production by fungi, and may shed light on the nature and variable presence of filament bundles described in fungal cells. 3aNeurospora crassa 3astructural genes 3acomplementary DNA 3apyruvate decarboxylase 3anucleotide sequences 3aamino acid sequences 3acytoskeleton 3aenzyme activity 3agene expression 3amessenger RNA 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aBase Sequence 2aBlotting, Northern 2aCatalysis 2aCloning, Molecular 2aCytoplasmxenzymology 2aDNA, Fungal 2aGenes, Fungal 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNeurospora crassaxenzymology 2aPyruvate Decarboxylasexgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRNA, Messengerxmetabolism 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 0acodon usage 0amolecular sequence data 0ap59nc gene 0agenbank/l091251 aRosa, Al.1 aTemporini, E.D.1 aWolstenholme, A.1 aPanzetta, G.1 aPatrito, L.1 aMaccioni, H.J.F.0 tGene.g1993, v. 130, no. 2 p.253-258x0378-11197nnas  aDNAL  a19940305b19940310c00000000  aINDdRHF  aNon-US 7aarticle01792naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245005900126300002000185500002400205520084900229650001801078650002001096650002201116650000901138650000901147650001301156650001601169650002601185700002101211700001901232700001801251700002101269700002401290773011901314852000901433655001201442IND4467666820221122132346.0130430s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446766682DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEndo, Fumio10aAnimal models reveal pathophysiologies of tyrosinemias  ap. 2063S-2067S.  aIncludes references  aThe activity of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase (HPD) is regulated by transcription factors. Mutations in the HPD locus are related to two known distinct diseases: hereditary tyrosinemia type 3 and hawkinsinuria. HPD-deficient mice are a good model with which to examine the biological effects of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid, which is a keto acid that causes no apparent visceral damage. In contrast, hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, a genetic disease caused by a deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), induces severe visceral injuries. Mice with FAH deficiency are lethal after birth; thus, efforts to elucidate the mechanisms of the disease process have been impeded. The use of Fah(-/-) Hpd(-/-) double-mutant mice has enabled studies on tyrosinemias, and essential features of visceral injury have been reveale. 3aanimal models 3aenzyme activity 3agenetic disorders 3aloci 3amice 3amutation 3aparturition 3atranscription factors1 aTanaka, Yasuhiko1 aTomoeda, Kaede1 aTanoue, Akito1 aTsujimoto, Gozoh1 aNakamura, Kimitoshi0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 June, v. 133, no. 6S-I p.2063S-2067SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle01806naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245007000131300002000201500002400221500001500245520086800260650003601128650001101164650001901175650001301194650001501207650002201222650002001244650002601264653001601290653001601306700001801322773011901340852000901459655001201468IND4467667220221122132402.0130430s2003    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446766722DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEijk, H.M.H. van10aPlasma protein synthesis measurements using a proteomics strategy  ap. 2084S-2089S.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe analysis of the synthesis of proteins has been the subject of many studies in animals and humans. Plasma proteins can be used as an easy accessible source of specific proteins. In this paper, an innovative method to study the synthetic rate of plasma proteins is described. This methodology, based on the proteomics approach, enables the direct observation of the effects of posttranslational modifications of protein synthesis and/or degradation. The methodology is based on 1D or 2D electrophoresis and subsequent electrospray ionization liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (ESI-LC-MS). Protein synthesis is measured in isotopically labeled peptides of the identified proteins. This innovative method can be used to assess amino acid adequacy and safety by studying protein synthesis and posttranslational modification of plasma proteins in more detail. 3apost-translational modification 3ahumans 3ablood proteins 3apeptides 3aproteomics 3amass spectrometry 3aelectrophoresis 3aliquid chromatography 0amethodology 0anew methods1 aDeutz, N.E.P.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2003 June, v. 133, no. 6S-I p.2084S-2089SdAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle02970naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001600230500001500246520178000261650002802041650002002069650001702089650001802106650002702124650001402151650001502165650001202180650002602192650001402218650002602232653002402258653001802282700002002300700001902320700001902339700001902358773009102377852000902468930003302477945001302510946001302523655001202536IND2206225120221122062942.0000804e199911  flu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220622512DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKershaw, M.J.14aThe role of destruxins in the pathogenicity of Metarhizium anisopliae for three species of insect  ap. 213-223.  a2019-12-05  aThe entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae var anisopliae produces a family of cyclic peptide toxins, destruxins (DTX), both in culture and in vivo in mycosed insects. The contribution of these insecticidal toxins to the disease process has been investigated in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (Lepidoptera), the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria (Orthoptera), and the vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus (Coleoptera). A significant negative correlation was found between the titer of DTX production in vitro of isolates of M. anisopliae var anisopliae pathogenic for Otiorhynchus and the median lethal time, suggesting a role for the toxin in isolate virulence. The same was true for Manduca-active isolates. A key exception was isolate 703. This is highly virulent for M. sexta, yet does not produce DTX in vitro, grows largely as hyphal fragments in the hemolymph of infected insects, and does not cause host paralysis. These results are discussed in the light of the hypothesis that there are at least two possible virulence strategies among isolates of M. anisopliae var anisopliae pathogenic for Manduca viz the "toxin strategy" and the "growth strategy." For locusts, a strong positive correlation was found only between in vitro toxin production and percentage mortality of individuals in which sporulation did not occur on the cadaver. To account for this, it is suggested that if DTX kills locusts before the fungus has established itself, then the pathogen may not compete effectively with the saprophytic flora and, as a result, fails to sporulate. It is concluded that, in the pathogenesis of M. anisopliae var anisopliae for all three insects, there is a relationship between the titer of DTX production of isolates in vitro and the killing power. 3ainterspecific variation 3acyclic peptides 3abiosynthesis 3aManduca sexta 3aMetarhizium anisopliae 3abioassays 3amycotoxins 3amycoses 3aOtiorhynchus sulcatus 3avirulence 3aSchistocerca gregaria 0aspecies differences 0apathogenicity1 aMoorhouse, E.R.1 aBateman, Dick.1 aReynolds, S.E.1 aCharnley, A.K.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g1999 Nov., v. 74, no. 3 p.213-223x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL  a20000902b20000912c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle01694naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008700172300001600259520067600275650002300951650002700974650000901001650002901010650001301039650001901052650001001071650001601081700002101097700002001118773017201138856004901310852000901359655001201368IND60594018020221122063806.0180509e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059401802DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-52.9.6142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCarminati, Domenico10aBacteriocin-Like Inhibitors of Streptococcus lactis Against Listeria monocytogenes  ap. 614-617.  aCulture extracts containing inhibitory substances produced by seven Streptococcus lactis strains and different concentrations of nisin were tested on six strains of Listeria monocytogenes.

We tested this hypothesis in laboratory experiments in which larvae of the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella (L.), were exposed to infective juveniles of S. glaseri (Steiner) (NC strain) in sand columns for various periods of time. The hosts were dissected to determine the sex ratio of the adult nematodes that became established. We found that infective juveniles entered hosts over periods of up to at least 14 h, and that sex ratios varied among experiments. However, there were no temporal differences in colonization by males and females during the infection process: the proportion of males in host cadavers was not related to exposure time or to the total number of nematodes in host cadavers. This result is inconsistent with the male colonization hypothesis. We conclude that differential colonization of hosts over time by males and females either does not occur in S. glaseri, or occurs only rarely or under conditions differing from ours, or occurs to such a small extent that it is difficult to detect. In S. glaseri, male infective juveniles tend to emerge from host cadavers before females. This might give males an advantage over females in locating new hosts following a natural emergence. Nonetheless, to date, males have not been shown to colonize hosts before females in any steinernematid species. 3aSteinernema glaseri 3aGalleria mellonella 3aentomopathogenic nematodes 3ainfection 3asex ratio 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aprotandry 0acolonization 0ahost colonization1 aAbu Hatab, M.1 aGaugler, R.0 tJournal of invertebrate pathology.g1998 Nov., v. 72, no. 3 p.288-295x0022-20117nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdNZM  aOther US 7aarticle02246naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245006900125300001400194520113200208650002301340650001601363650001601379650001701395650001601412650002601428650001801454650002001472653001501492653001501507653002101522653003001543653002301573653002201596700002001618700001801638700002001656773008001676852000901756930003301765945001301798946001301811655001201824IND2049204220221122063811.0951214e199510  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204920422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHadi, Y.S.10aAcetylated rubberwood flakeboard resistance to bio-deterioration  ap. 64-66.  aFlakeboards made from rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis Muell.

Dried flakes were immersed in acetic anhydride and subsequently heated at 120 degrees C to give specimens of 7 and 18 weight percent gains. Control flakeboards were also prepared for comparison. Flakeboards were put in the boxes containing 50 healthy and active dry wood nymphae of Cryptotermes cynocephalus Light for 4 weeks. Nymphae mortality and weight loss were determined for each sample. Flakeboards were also stacked in an arboretum for 12 weeks and protection level and weight loss of flakeboard caused by Macrotermes gilvus Hagen attack were determined. Flakeboards were also inoculated with Schizophyllum commune for 10 weeks and moisture content, weight loss, and modulus of rupture loss of flakeboard were determined. The results showed that the acetylation of the flakes increased the resistance to dry wood termite, subterranean termite, and fungal attacks. The higher the acetylation level, the greater the resistance. 3aHevea brasiliensis 3aflakeboards 3aacetylation 3aCryptotermes 3aMacrotermes 3aSchizophyllum commune 3adeterioration 3apest resistance 0aresistance 0aprotection 0abiodeterioration 0acryptotermes cynocephalus 0amacrotermes gilvus 0afungal resistance1 aDarma, I.G.K.T.1 aFebrianto, F.1 aHerliyana, E.N.0 tForest products journal.g1995 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.64-66x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle01671naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245009200127300001400219500001500233520066600248650003000914650002800944650001700972650001900989650002601008650002001034650002101054650002101075653002401096653002101120700002001141773008001161852000901241930003301250945001301283946001301296655001201309IND2049203520221122063809.0951214e199510  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204920352DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKrankina, O.10aForest resources and wood properties of commercial tree species in the Russian Far East  ap. 44-50.  a2019-12-05  aThe immense forest resources of the Russian Far East seem likely to contribute significantly to world demand for wood. This paper reports information from available (largely Russian) literature about species likely to appear in commerce, their abundance, and properties of interest in their utilization. In terms of growing stock, larch is by far the most abundant, followed by spruce, pine, and birch. Many other species exist in smaller amounts, nearly all from genera familiar in North America. Tabulated properties from the literature give a general idea of how the species compare with one another and permit comparison with more familiar domestic species. 3ageographical distribution 3ainterspecific variation 3aforest trees 3aboreal forests 3abotanical composition 3awood properties 3awood utilization 3aforest resources 0aspecies differences 0arussian far east1 aEthington, R.L.0 tForest products journal.g1995 Oct., v. 45, no. 10 p.44-50x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19960102b19960111c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle03091naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002400148245008700172300001600259520176700275650002302042650000902065650001102074650001302085650002402098650002002122650001502142650001702157650001102174650003202185650001902217650002802236650001402264650001402278650001902292650001502311650001102326650001002337650001402347650001602361700002602377773017202403856004902575852000902624655001202633IND60594018220221122044449.0180509e198909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059401822DNAL7 a10.4315/0362-028X-52.9.6602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKlink, Ed G.

Van10aSanitation by Ultrasonic Cavitation of Steel Mesh Gloves Used in the Meat Industry  ap. 660-664.  aThe microbiological condition of steel mesh gloves commonly used in the meat industry was assessed and an adequate sanitation protocol devised in the course of three experiments conducted in the boning room of a beef packaging operation. The first pilot-experiment monitored the average bacterial load of gloves at various times during the working day, by releasing the tissue trapped inside the gloves through ultrasonic cavitation. After 2, 4, and 6 h of boning, steel mesh gloves contained ca. 9.1 and 8.3 log10 CFU/g mesophilic and psychrotrophic organisms, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae colony counts varied from ca. 5.5 to 8.5 log10 CFU/g. In the second experiment ultrasonic cavitation was followed by disinfection in a 2% Halamid® (sodium paratoluene sulfonchloramide) solution for 5 min. Aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic colony counts after 2 h of boning were still 7.4 and 6.7 log10 CFU/g, respectively, while the average Enterobactericeae colony count was 4.9 log10 CFU/g. In the third experiment gloves were subjected to a protocol including: 1) cleaning by ultrasonic cavitation in the presence of a suitable detergent for 5 min, 2) rinsing with tap water, 3) disinfection in a 2% Halamid® solution for 5 min, and 4) rinsing with tap water. This resulted in counts below the limits of detection for aerobic organisms and Enterobacteriaceae. After 2 h of boning the average mesophilic and psychrotrophic aerobic colony counts were ca. 5.5 and 4.9 log10 CFU/g, respectively and the Enterobacteriaceae colony count ca. 3.9 log10 CFU/g. This contrasted sharply with the much higher levels observed when no sanitation protocol was followed. Hence the developed protocol reduces the risk of cross-contamination by steel mesh gloves considerably. 3aEnterobacteriaceae 3abeef 3aboning 3acleaning 3across contamination 3adetection limit 3adetergents 3adisinfection 3agloves 3alivestock and meat industry 3amicrobial load 3amicrobiological quality 3apackaging 3aprotocols 3arisk reduction 3asanitation 3asodium 3asteel 3atap water 3aultrasonics1 aSmulders, Frans J.

Our analyses indicate that few statistically significant differences exist between the shoot biomass partitioning patterns of the two functional species-groups. In contrast, statistically significant N,P - stoichiometric differences exist between the two functional groups. Across all species, dry leaf mass scales nearly as the square of basal stem diameter and isometrically with respect to dry stem mass. However, total leaf N scales as the 1.37-power and as the 1.09-power of total leaf P across herbaceous and tree shoots, respectively. Therefore, tree shoots can be viewed as populations of herbs elevated by their older, woody herbaceous cohorts. However, tree leaf stoichiometry cannot be modelled in terms of herbaceous N,P - leaf stoichiometry. 3abiomass 3aherbs 3aleaves 3anitrogen 3anitrogen content 3aphosphorus 3ashoots 3astems 3astoichiometry 3atrees 2aBiomass 2aNitrogenxmetabolism 2aPhosphorusxmetabolism 2aPlant Leavesxmetabolism 2aSpecies Specificity 2aTreesxmetabolism1 aCobb, Edward D.0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2006 Nov., v. 29, no. 11 p.2030-2042dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2006.01578.x 7aarticle02629naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001400164245015100178300001600329500002400345520085600369650001701225650001201242650001601254650002001270650001401290650002501304650003101329650000901360650001101369650001601380650001201396650002001408650001101428650002801439650002401467650000901491650002401500650001301524650002301537650002301560650002101583650001601604650000901620650002801629650002101657650001401678650003801692650003401730650001601764700001401780700001501794700001401809700001501823773010801838852000901946856004801955655001202003IND4400468020221122021650.0080127e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440046802DNAL7 a179899532pmid7 a10.1007/s00122-007-0671-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, X.14aThe QTL analysis on maternal and endosperm genome and their environmental interactions for characters of cooking quality in rice (Oryza sativa L.)  ap. 335-342.  aIncludes references  aInvestigations to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing cooking quality traits including amylose content, gel consistency and gelatinization temperature (expressed by the alkali spread value) were conducted using a set of 241 RIL populations derived from an elite hybrid cross of “Zhenshan 97” x “Minghui 63” and their reciprocal backcrosses BC₁F₁ and BC₂F₁ populations in two environments.

It enhances calcium absorption in rats and improves femur and tibia mineral contents in gastrectomized or ovariectomized rats. We studied the effect of inulin (0, 5 and 10 g/100 g diet) on whole-body bone mineral content (WBBMC), whole-body bone area (WBBA) and whole-body bone mineral density (WBBMD) in live, growing male rats fed diets containing 0.2, 0.5 or 1 g Ca/100 g. Three experiments, each corresponding to one of the different dietary Ca concentrations, were performed using male Wistar rats (n = 108; 4 wk old). WBBMC was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry every 4 wk up to wk 22. Inulin increased WBBMC (P < 0.05) and WBBMD (P < 0.001) significantly but not WBBA at all ages and all dietary calcium concentrations. This is the first report to demonstrate that chicory inulin not only increases calcium absorption but also increases mineral parameters in whole-body bones. 3aabsorption 3abone density 3acalcium 3achicory 3adiet 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3afemur 3agastrointestinal system 3ainulin 3amineral content 3aovariectomy 3arats 3atibia 2aAnimals 2aBone Densityxdrug effects 2aChicoryxchemistry 2aInulinxpharmacology 2aMale 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aWeight Gain1 aCumps, J.1 aDevogelaer, J.P.0 tJournal of nutrition.g2002 Dec., v. 132, no. 12 p.3599-3602dAmerican Institute of Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL 7aarticle03472naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004400111040001800155100002400173245005400197300001600251500002400267520167400291650001501965650002001980650001002000650001202010650002402022650001602046650001102062650001502073650001002088650001902098650001102117650001902128650001602147650001002163650001402173650001202187650001402199650001002213650001202223650001102235650004202246650001102288650000902299650004902308650004002357650004302397650004502440700002002485700002202505700002102527700002202548700002402570700002502594773012402619852000902743856009402752655001202846IND4463265820221122021450.0120522e200305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446326582DNAL7 a128163672pmid7 a10.1111/j.1740-8261.2003.tb00454.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHenninger, Wolfgang10aCT features of alveolitis and sinusitis in horses  ap. 269-276.  aIncludes references  aSinusitis is a common disorder in horses and may result from trauma, dental diseases, or space-occupying lesions. Radiography can only provide a limited amount of information. Computed tomography (CT) has been documented as an alternative imaging method. Eighteen horses (mostly Warm-blood) with signs of chronic sinusitis were examined preoperatively with CT to assist in diagnosis of the underlying cause. There was a group of common CT features in horses with dental disease and sinusitis. The first molar was the most frequently affected maxillary cheek tooth. Hypoattenuation of the ce-mentum, destruction of the enamel, and filling of the infundibular cavity with gas were the most frequent CT findings associated with caries. Gas bubbles within the bulging root area or fragmentation of the root in combination with swelling of the adjacent sinus lining were the most important CT features of dental decay. CT findings associated with sinusitis included excessive thickening of the respiratory epithelium in the rostral maxillary sinus; the caudal maxillary sinus was less often involved. The infraorbital canal, the nasomaxillary duct, and the frontomaxillary aperture were usually involved. The maxillary bone, however, especially the facial crest, was involved in nearly every horse, being characterized by endosteal sclerosis, thickening, periosteal reaction, and deformation leading to facial swelling in chronic infections. CT images allowed identification of involvement of individual teeth more clearly to reveal the diseased one for treatment. Three-dimensional imaging allowed improved understanding of the extent and severity of the pathologic change. 3aalveolitis 3aanimal injuries 3abones 3abubbles 3acomputed tomography 3adeformation 3aenamel 3aepithelium 3agases 3ahorse diseases 3ahorses 3aimage analysis 3aradiography 3aroots 3asclerosis 3asinuses 3asinusitis 3ateeth 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aHorse Diseasesxradiographyxsurgery. 2aHorses 2aMale 2aPulmonary Fibrosisxradiographyxveterinary. 2aSinusitisxradiographyxveterinary. 2aTomography, X-Ray Computedxveterinary 2aTooth Diseasesxradiographyxveterinary.1 aFrame, E.

In this study, we sequenced the promoter and full-length exon region of the chicken TGFB2 and found two mutations (g.-640C>T and g.-851_-790del) within the promoter. The two polymorphisms were genotyped in 1030 pedigreed hens recorded for body weight at 7 (BW7), 9 (BW9), 11 (BW11), 13 (BW13), 17 (BW17) weeks old, egg weight at 36 weeks of age (EW36) and egg numbers from the age at first egg (AFE) to 40 weeks of age (EN40). Despite the fact that no mutations were found to have statistically significant genetic effects on egg production, the association results of growth traits showed that both g.-640C>T and g.-851_-790del had significant effects on body weights and that both genotype g.-640TT and g.-851_-790wt/wt were positive for body weight performance. Therefore, the polymorphisms of TGFB2, especially the g.-851_-790del mutation associated with body weight at almost all periods, could be potential useful genetic markers to improve the growth of Beijing You chickens. 3aage at first egg 3abody weight 3aegg production 3aegg weight 3agenes 3agenetic markers 3agenotype 3agrowth traits 3ahens 3amutation 3apromoter regions 2aAnimals 2aBody Weight 2aChickensxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aFemale 2aINDEL Mutation 2aMale 2aPromoter Regions, Genetic 2aTransforming Growth Factor beta2xgenetics1 aOu, J.1 aSun, D.1 aZhang, Y.1 aXu, G.1 aZhang, Y.0 tAnimal genetics.g2011 Feb., v. 42, no. 1 p.108-112dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0268-91467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02060.x 7aarticle00881naa a2200277 u 4500001001700000005001700017008004100034016002200075040001800097100001800115245008200133300001600215520008600231650001700317650001700334650001900351653001200370653001600382700002000398773011000418852000900528939003300537945000800570946001300578655001200591991580085240742620221121231639.0821222e198107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aPAR830000422DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKruse, G.O.W.10aSimple and inexpensive computer cataloging for parasite collections using SAS  ap. 256-260.  acomputer cataloging of parasite collections using the Statistical Analysis System 3aparasitology 3ahuman health 3aanimal science 0amuseums 0acollections1 aPritchard, M.H.0 tProceedings - Helminthological Society of Washington.g1981 July, v. 48, no. 2 p.256-260x0018-01307nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19821222c00000000  aPAR  aOther US 7aarticle01870naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001700143245009800160300001800258520069100276650001400967650001500981650001100996650001401007650001101021650001301032650001801045650001401063650001101077700002601088700002101114700002501135700002601160700002201186773012601208852000901334856008301343930003301426946001301459655001201472IND4406512320221121231742.0080606e20080606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440651232DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11566602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStudt, Felix10aIdentification of Non-Precious Metal Alloy Catalysts for Selective Hydrogenation of Acetylene  ap. 1320-1322.  aThe removal of trace acetylene from ethylene is performed industrially by palladium hydrogenation catalysts (often modified with silver) that avoid the hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane. In an effort to identify catalysts based on less expensive and more available metals, density functional calculations were performed that identified relations in heats of adsorption of hydrocarbon molecules and fragments on metal surfaces. This analysis not only verified the facility of known catalysts but identified nickel-zinc alloys as alternatives. Experimental studies demonstrated that these alloys dispersed on an oxide support were selective for acetylene hydrogenation at low pressures. 3aacetylene 3aadsorption 3aalloys 3acatalysts 3aethane 3aethylene 3ahydrogenation 3apalladium 3asilver1 aAbild-Pedersen, Frank1 aBligaard, Thomas1 aSørensen, Rasmus Z.1 aChristensen, Claus H.1 aNørskov, Jens K.0 tScience.g2008 June 6, v. 320, no. 5881 p.1320-1322dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11566603Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01558naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245002200168300001800190520055000208650001400758650001400772651001700786700002100803700002300824700002000847700002100867700001600888700002100904700001900925773012600944852000901070856008301079930003301162946001301195655001201208IND4406511920221121220919.0080606e20080606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440651192DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11486152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarzione, Carmala N.10aRise of the Andes  ap. 1304-1307.  aThe surface uplift of mountain belts is generally assumed to reflect progressive shortening and crustal thickening, leading to their gradual rise. Recent studies of the Andes indicate that their elevation remained relatively stable for long periods (tens of millions of years), separated by rapid (1 to 4 million years) changes of 1.5 kilometers or more. Periodic punctuated surface uplift of mountain belts probably reflects the rapid removal of unstable, dense lower lithosphere after long-term thickening of the crust and lithospheric mantle. 3amountains 3atectonics 3aAndes region1 aHoke, Gregory D.1 aLibarkin, Julie C.1 aWithers, Saunia1 aMacFadden, Bruce1 aEiler, John1 aGhosh, Prosenjit1 aMulch, Andreas0 tScience.g2008 June 6, v. 320, no. 5881 p.1304-1307dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11486153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080606b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01752naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245006700124300001400191520094600205650002001151650001201171650001401183650002201197653001801219700001801237700001801255700001801273773007901291852000901370930003301379945001301412946001301425655001201438IND2046377620221121221316.0950609e199503  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204637762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, B.G.10aRemoving fungal stain from ponderosa pine by caustic bleaching  ap. 56-60.  aThe potential of peroxide-based bleaching systems for removing fungal stain was investigated on ponderosa pine sapwood. Image analysis of specimens before and after treatment indicated that the use of 2 percent hydrogen peroxide at 50 degrees or 60 degrees C for a minimum of 60 minutes appeared to produce significantly more improvement in whiteness of the test specimens than all other treatment combinations. The sodium hydroxide:sodium silicate ratio in the treatment solution, which acted as a buffer, could be manipulated between 0:12 and 1:6 with little effect on final specimen whiteness. The pH of the bleaching solution at higher NaOH:Na2SiO3 ratios exceeded 12, resulting in considerable loss of peroxide and reduced bleaching efficiency. A preliminary analysis of the results suggests that peroxide bleaching could be an economical method for improving the grade of stained ponderosa pine sapwood. Further trials are recommended. 3aPinus ponderosa 3asapwood 3ableaching 3ahydrogen peroxide 0afungal stains1 aMaristany, A.1 aBrunner, C.C.1 aMorrell, J.J.0 tForest products journal.g1995 Mar., v. 45, no. 3 p.56-60x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle01826naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001700183245006000200300001600260520059900276650001500875650002500890650002200915650002000937650001400957650002300971651001800994653000901012653001701021653002501038653004301063653002101106700001601127700001601143773006601159852000901225856012301234930003301357945001301390946001301403655001201416IND2196097820221121221254.0981221e199805  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219609782DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199805/06)14:3<199::AID-AGR3>3.0.CO;2-W2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOllinger, M.10aUS regulation and new pesticide registrations and sales  ap. 199-212.  aThis article empirically examines the impact of regulation on new pesticide crop use registrations and sales.

From a public policy perspective, results suggest that the availability of effective chemical pesticides for minor crops. such as fruits and vegetables, will likely decline over time. 3apesticides 3alaws and regulations 3acosts and returns 3aeconomic impact 3amarketing 3aeconometric models 3aUnited States 0auses 0aregistration 0afederal insecticides 0afungicide, and rodenticide act of 1947 0aregulatory costs1 aAspelin, A.1 aShields, M.0 tAgribusiness.g1998 , v. 14, no. 3 p.199-212x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199805/06)14:3<199::AID-AGR3>3.0.CO;2-W3Available from publisher's Web site  a19990131b19990208c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01755naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001700183245006200200300001600262520057100278650000900849650002200858650002200880650002000902650002100922650001500943650002500958650001400983650001400997650001901011651001001030653001601040700001501056700001701071773006601088852000901154856012301163930003301286945001301319946001301332655001201345IND2180904620221121221445.0981109e199803  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND218090462DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199803/04)14:2<147::AID-AGR7>3.0.CO;2-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWatanabe, Y.10aFactors affecting consumers' choice of beverages in Japan  ap. 147-156.  aThis article examines the relative importance of various consumer attributes on beverage consumption decisions in Japan.

The results indicate that many of the consumer attributes have a statistically significant association with the decision to consume the various beverages. 3amilk 3abeverage industry 3aconsumer behavior 3adecision making 3aconsumer surveys 3ademography 3aprobabilistic models 3aequations 3alifestyle 3asocioeconomics 3aJapan 0aconsumption1 aSuzuki, N.1 aKaiser, H.M.0 tAgribusiness.g1998 , v. 14, no. 2 p.147-156x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199803/04)14:2<147::AID-AGR7>3.0.CO;2-23Available from publisher's Web site  a19990101b19990111c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01703naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245006700127300001400194520071700208650001800925650002100943650001100964650002000975650001200995650001001007653001201017653001501029653001501044653001401059653001501073700001701088700001701105700001601122700002001138773007901158852000901237930003301246945001301279946001301292655001201305IND2046950220221121221008.0950721e199504  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204695022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLavery, D.J.10aParameters affecting the surface finish of planed Sitka spruce  ap. 45-50.  aThe influence and relative significance of the various silvicultural and machine surface planing parameters in the production of good quality timber surface finishes on Sitka spruce is investigated. Data analysis was carried out using linear multiple-regression techniques. Results are presented in the form of regression charts and scatter plots. Feed speed, moisture content, and rake angle variables have been found to be important predictors of the quality of machine-planed timber. In particular, setting the feed speed to 10 m/min. results in a good-quality finish. Two distinct areas that demand separate scrutiny have been identified on the timber sample boards, the clearwood area and the knotwood area. 3awater content 3aPicea sitchensis 3alumber 3asurface quality 3aplaning 3aknots 0atimbers 0afeed speed 0arake angle 0aknot wood 0aclear wood1 aMcLarnon, D.1 aTaylor, J.M.1 aMoloney, S.1 aAtanackovic, A.0 tForest products journal.g1995 Apr., v. 45, no. 4 p.45-50x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19950802b19950807c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle01700naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245005200125300001400177520096500191650001101156653002601167653001201193653001701205653002601222700001501248773007901263852000901342930003301351945001301384946001301397655001201410IND2046217820221121221021.0950525e199502  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204621782DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBindzi, I.12aA new method of grading lumber for spiral grain  ap. 63-66.  aA new method is presented to account for spiral grain in the grading of structural lumber. This new method requires as inputs the grain deviation angle measured on the wide faces of the piece and the ring angle measured in the end sections of the piece. It is shown that existing grading rules are either inadequate when grading lumber for spiral grain only on the basis of the grain angle on the wide faces of the piece, or unrealistic when they recommend measuring grain angle on the narrow faces of the piece, because this angle is very difficult to evaluate in practice when spiral grain is present. A comparison of current and new methods helps to demonstrate that existing grading rules underestimate the true spiral grain angle of lumber. Industrial implementation of this method would require a device for automatically recording growth ring orientation. Until such a device becomes available, the proposed method is limited to laboratory applications. 3alumber 0astructural components 0agrading 0aspiral grain 0agrain deviation angle1 aSamson, M.0 tForest products journal.g1995 Feb., v. 45, no. 2 p.63-66x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle01530naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002000110245009200130300001400222500001500236520058900251650002500840650002300865650001700888650002300905650002200928650002600950653001000976653001400986700001501000700001801015773007901033852000901112930003301121945001301154946001301167655001201180IND2046243020221121152642.0950530e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204624302DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchneider, P.F.10aDistribution of chloropicrin in Douglas-fir poles 1 to 7 years after remedial treatment  ap. 55-56.  a2019-12-05  aResidual levels of chloropicrin were investigated in Douglas-fir poles that had received remedial fumigant treatment 1, 3, 5, and 7 years earlier.

These changes affect the selection and purchase of convenience goods in Spain. Spanish household expenditures for convenience meats are modeled in a two-stage process, explicitly accounting for the value of women's time. The empirical evidence shows that the value of women's time, income, and household demographic variables are all important determinants of both participation and expenditures on convenience meat goods. The article concludes that large, high-income families in which both the man and woman work are more likely to consume convenience meat goods and also to spend more than others. 3ameat products 3amathematical models 3ahousehold income 3ahousehold surveys 3ahousehold expenditure 3autility functions 3aduration 3aprepared foods 3ademography 3afood consumption 3aSpain 0ahousehold production model 0ademand 0awoman's status 0avalue theory 0avalue of women's time 0aconsumption patterns1 aJensen, H.H.0 tAgribusiness.g1997 , v. 13, no. 6 p.579-586x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199711/12)13:6<579::AID-AGR3>3.0.CO;2-03Available from publisher's Web site  a19980801b19980807c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle01891naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007900127300001400206520116800220650001801388650001101406650002101417653001401438653001401452773007901466852000901545930003301554945001301587946001301600655001201613IND2046244620221121152638.0950530e199501  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204624462DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTremblay, C.10aLongitudinal and radial variation of slope of grain in black spruce lumber  ap. 79-83.  aSlope-of-grain measurements were taken at 11 positions along 94 planed and kiln-dried specimens of black spruce Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P. lumber measuring 38 mm by 89 mm by 4.27 m in length. Measurements were taken manually on the pith side and the bark side, using a sharp-pointed instrument. Slope-of-grain measurements on lumber are only partially consistent with the generally accepted model of the variation of spiral grain in softwoods that is described in the literature, given that slope of grain is higher on the bark side than on the pith side. Results also reveal that slope of grain increases from the pith toward the bark in a radial direction. On the other hand, slope of grain increases from the pith toward the bark randomly, either in a right-hand or left-hand direction. This is contrary to the spiral grain model for softwoods. Finally, we did not establish a relationship between the spiral grain model for softwood and the longitudinal variations of the slope of grain along lumber specimens. The results of this study can be used to improve the experimental transverse scanning method for measuring slope of grain with dielectric sensors. 3aPicea mariana 3alumber 3agrain and figure 0abark side 0apith side0 tForest products journal.g1995 Jan., v. 45, no. 1 p.79-83x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19950703b19950711c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle01454naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245009000125300001400215520068000229650001400909650002300923650001100946650002900957651001900986700001401005773007701019852000901096930003301105945001301138946001301151655001201164IND2045989520221121150625.0950510e199407  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204598952DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMunk, W.P.10aUsing competitive analysis models to set strategy in the Northwest hardboard industry  ap. 11-18.  aThis paper presents an analysis of competitive conditions in the Northwest hardboard industry using the strategy models developed by Michael Porter. The Northwest hardboard industry is both mature and fragmented, with high entry barriers, potential raw material shortages, and low returns making it unattractive to add capacity. Markets are segmented, and firms avoid direct competition. The strategy and behavior of a major industry firm is presented briefly to illustrate the appropriate application of industry competitive principles to strategy development. The firm's approach to this low-margin, high-service segment is examined in the context of the industry analysis. 3ahardboard 3amarket competition 3amodels 3aforest products industry 3aPacific States1 aShane, B.0 tForest products journal.g1994 , v. 44, no. 7/8 p.11-18x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle01297naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245007900127300001400206500001500220520037800235650001500613650001100628650002100639650002200660651001900682653002300701653001900724653002100743700002200764700001600786773007700802852000900879930003300888945001300921946001300934655001200947IND2045990020221121114723.0950510e199407  wiu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND204599002DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchallau, C.10aRegulating for sustained yield: a review of some fundamental relationships  ap. 23-26.  a2019-12-05  aVarious observers assert that the national forests in the Pacific Northwest are not being managed on a sustained yield basis.

In all cases, the Canadian Standard freeness increased after processing compared to hydropulped-only fibers. Micrographs of the fibers obtained using an environmental scanning electron microscope indicate increased fiber flexibility and curl. Following fiber separation, the unit also doubles as a blender, permitting easy blending of fibers, liquid resins, and particulate matter such as thermoplastics, later used to manufacture composite panels. 3aseparators 3awaste paper 3apulping 3arecycling 0aprocessing technology 0afibers 0ahydropulped waste paper1 aShaler, S.M.1 aMott, L.1 aGroom, L.0 tForest products journal.g1994 , v. 44, no. 7/8 p.47-50x0015-74737nnas  aDNAL  a19950609b19950615c00000000  aINDdJYB  aOther US 7aarticle02264naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024007300092040001800165100001900183245011700202300001600319500015300335500001500488520072100503650001301224650001201237650001101249650002401260650002301284650002301307651001201330651001101342651001501353653002001368653001001388653001101398653002601409653001001435653001901445653001901464653002501483700001701508773006601525852000901591856012301600930003301723945001301756946001301769655001201782IND2079940120221121063538.0980504e199709  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND207994012DNAL7 a10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199709/10)13:5<533::AID-AGR7>3.0.CO;2-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThompson, G.D.14aThe organizational structure of the North American fresh tomato market: implications for seasonal trade disputes  ap. 533-547.  aPaper presented at the Tri-National Research Symposium, "NAFTA and Agriculture: is the Experiment Working?," November 1-2, 1996, San Antonio, Texas.  a2019-12-04  aPrimary data collected from grower-shippers of fresh tomatoes in California, Florida, and Mexico reveal considerable heterogeneity among firms. Many firms which are extending their shipping seasons outside traditional seasons must have access to land in diverse geographic areas through ownership and contracts. Besides attempting to be low-cost producers, some firms compete by differentiating their products. The extended shelf life tomato from Mexico is one such differentiated product which has garnered higher FOB prices relative to Florida tomatoes. The implications of heterogeneous firms for trade disputes have not been considered in recent deliberations concerning Florida- and Mexico-based tomato growers. 3atomatoes 3agrowers 3aprices 3ainternational trade 3aseasonal variation 3amarket competition 3aFlorida 3aMexico 3aCalifornia 0atransport costs 0atrade 0atrends 0aagricultural products 0afirms 0afresh products 0aterms of trade 0afree on board prices1 aWilson, P.N.0 tAgribusiness.g1997 , v. 13, no. 5 p.533-547x0742-44777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6297(199709/10)13:5<533::AID-AGR7>3.0.CO;2-73Available from publisher's Web site  a19980531b19980605c00000000  aINDdTBT  aOther US 7aarticle03205naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002900111040001800140100002100158245013800179300001800317500002400335500001500359520183700374650001402211650002202225650001702247650001102264650001302275650002202288650001402310650002002324650001202344650001502356650001302371650001102384650001002395650002502405650001502430653001002445700002902455700001802484700002902502773011602531852000902647856007902656655001202735IND4439690420221121063650.0100709e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443969042DNAL7 a216168662pmid7 a10.3732/ajb.10000092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSteele, Kelly P.10aPhylogeny and character evolution in Medicago (Leguminosae): Evidence from analyses of plastid trnK/matK and nuclear GA3ox1 sequences  ap. 1142-1155.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aPremise of the study: The genus Medicago, with about 87 species, includes the model legume species M. truncatula, and a number of important forage species such as M. sativa (alfalfa), M. scutellata (snail medic), and M. lupulina (black medic). Relationships within the genus are not yet sufficiently resolved, contributing to difficulty in understanding the evolution of a number of distinguishing characteristics such as aneuploidy and polyploidy, life history, structure of cotyledons, and number of seeds per fruit. METHODS: Phylogenetic relationships of 70-73 species of Medicago and its sister genus Trigonella (including Melilotus) were reconstructed from nucleotide sequences of the plastid trnK/matK region and the nuclear-encoded GA3ox1 gene (gibberellin 3-β-hydroxylase) using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. Key results: Our results support certain currently recognized taxonomic groups, e.g., sect. Medicago (with M. sativa) and sect. BUCERAS: However, other strongly supported clades--the "reduced subsection Leptospireae clade" that includes M. lupulina, the "polymorpha clade" that includes M. murex and M. polymorpha and the "subsection Pachyspireae clade" that includes M. truncatula--each of which includes species presently in different subsections of sect. Spirocarpos, contradict the current classification. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the hypothesis that some characters considered important in existing taxonomies, for example, single-seeded fruits that have arisen more than once in both Medicago and Trigonella, are indeed homoplastic. Others, such as the 2n = 14 chromosome number, have also arisen independently within the genus. In addition, we demonstrate support for the utility of GA3ox1 sequences for phylogenetic analysis among and within closely related genera of legumes. 3aMelilotus 3asequence analysis 3alife history 3afruits 3ataxonomy 3achromosome number 3aphylogeny 3aBayesian theory 3aalfalfa 3acotyledons 3aMedicago 3aforage 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3aTrigonella 0aseeds1 aIckert-Bond, Stefanie M.1 aZarre, Shahin1 aWojciechowski, Martin F.0 tAmerican journal of botany.g2010 July, v. 97, no. 7 p.1142-1155dBotanical Society of Americax0002-91227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.10000093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02560naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001600163245009500179300001600274500000900290520148100299592002801780650002301808650002001831650001201851650001101863650001701874650001501891650002401906650002201930650001301952700001701965773012101982856009802103852000902201655001202210IND60665254220221120061126.0191122e197903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525422DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1979.0011183X001900020020x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHill, R.

Reaction to the insect was measured as the number of mined leaflets in a 30-leaflet sample taken from each plant on first harvest and later-season forage in 1976 and 1977. Estimates of variance components were used to calculate heritability of resistance and estimated gain from mass, half-sib family, and modified ear-to-row selection. Predicted gains were compared to determine optimum allocation of number of replications and selection pressures to apply within and among families. Variability among families was significant, but the heritability estimate was low (4.18%). Predicted gains with modified ear-to-row selection were greater than with mass selection only if the number of replications was large and the selection intensity within families was moderate. Half-sib family selection always had smaller predicted gains than the most effective modified ear-torow procedure. Mass selection had greater predicted gains when the number of replications was low and selection intensity within families was very low or very high. The predicted efficiency of mass selection increased relative to that of the other methods when the overall selection intensity decreased. The modified ear-to-row procedure with high selection intensity was recommended for increasing resistance to the leafminer alfalfa.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgromyza frontella 3aMedicago sativa 3aalfalfa 3aforage 3aheritability 3aleafminers 3aselection intensity 3asimulation models 3avariance1 aByers, R.

However, there are limited empirical studies that investigated tourism-economic growth relationship in Tanzania. This study aims to investigate an empirical insight into the actual nature of tourism-economic growth in Tanzania by applying the Granger causality and Wald test methods where annual time series data on international tourism receipt, real Gross Domestic Product, and real effective exchange rate over the period 1989–2018 are used. Further, the Impulse Response Function approach is utilized to provide insight into the qualitative nature of the relationships and the length of time necessary for the causal effect to take place. The findings confirm a unidirectional causality from tourism development to economic growth. The study concludes that Tanzania ought to focus on economic strategies that encourage sustainable tourism development as a feasible source of economic growth.  aPublisher supplied data 3aeconomic development 3aecotourism 3agross domestic product 3aincome 3ainternational tourism 3atime series analysis 3aTanzania 0aCausality 0aEconomic growth 0aImpulse response function 0aTourism 0aTourism led growth1 aRahman, Mohammad Mafizur1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7950-19611 aKhanam, Rasheda0 tHeliyon.g2021 May, v. 7, no. 5 p.e06966-dElsevier LtdwJournal:23264x2405-84407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e069663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100002000155245015600175300001400331520173900345592002802084650002202112650001502134650001102149650001502160650003302175650001402208650002102222650001202243650000902255650002002264650001002284653002202294653000902316653000902325653001402334653001602348653000902364700002302373700001902396773011002415856009002525852000902615655001202624IND60532544420221117202329.0190405e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053254442DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.12.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuell, Margaret10acAMP modulation during sheep in vitro oocyte maturation delays progression of meiosis without affecting oocyte parthenogenetic developmental competence  ap. 16-24.  aRemoval of oocytes from their natural inhibitory follicular environment results in spontaneous resumption of meiosis independent of normal signaling events that occur in vivo. Controlling the onset of meiotic resumption via maintenance of elevated oocyte cAMP levels with adenylyl cyclase (AC) activation and phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibition, and subsequent hormone stimulation with follicle FSH has been shown to dramatically improve developmental competence of bovine and murine IVM oocytes. This study evaluated the effect of cAMP modulation during IVM of sheep oocytes on meiotic progression and development to blastocyst after parthenogenetic activation. Changes in oocyte cAMP levels were quantified during the first 2h of in vitro maturation in control or cAMP-modulating medium. No significant changes in intra-oocyte cAMP were observed under control conditions, though a slight and transient drop was noticed at 15min of maturation. Addition of the AC stimulator Forskolin and the PDE inhibitors IBMX altered the cAMP profile, resulting in 10-fold elevation of cAMP by 15min and sustained >3-fold elevated levels from 30 to 120min. The effect of cAMP elevation on meiotic resumption was measured by completion of germinal vesicle breakdown. Modulated oocytes were significantly delayed when compared to control media oocytes. Also, progression to MII was significantly delayed in modulated versus control oocytes at 20 and 24h, though no differences persisted to 28h. Lastly, when control and modulated oocytes were parthenogenetically activated, no differences in blastocyst formation were observed. Thus, while cAMP modulation delayed meiotic progression, it did not improve developmental competence of sheep IVM oocytes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadenylate cyclase 3ablastocyst 3acattle 3acyclic AMP 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3aforskolin 3agerminal vesicle 3ameiosis 3amice 3aparthenogenesis 3asheep 0aOocyte maturation 0acAMP 0aIBMX 0aForskolin 0aCilostamide 0aGVBD1 aChitwood, James L.1 aRoss, Pablo J.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Mar., v. 154 p.16-24dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.12.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02286naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001800164245008400182300001800266520097100284592002801255650003101283650002101314650002301335650001601358650001001374650001501384650004601399650002601445650006601471650002401537650003301561700002001594700001901614700002001633773014401653856008201797852000901879655001201888IND4458186620221121003539.0200312e201106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445818662DNAL7 a214242692pmid7 a10.1007/s00253-011-3190-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNiimi, Satoko10aMetabolic engineering of 1,2-propanediol pathways in Corynebacterium glutamicum  ap. 1721-1729.  aWe analyzed 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) production in metabolically engineered Corynebacterium glutamicum. Wild-type C. glutamicum produced 93 μM 1,2-PD after 132 h incubation under aerobic conditions. No gene encoding the methylglyoxal synthase (MGS) which catalyzes the first step of 1,2-PD synthesis from the glycolytic pathway was detected on the C. glutamicum genome, but several genes annotated as encoding putative aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) were present. AKR functions as a methylglyoxal reductase in the 1,2-PD synthesis pathway. Expressing Escherichia coli mgs gene in C. glutamicum increased 1,2-PD yield 100-fold, suggesting that wild-type C. glutamicum carries the genes downstream of MGS in the 1,2-PD synthesis pathway. Furthermore, simultaneous overexpression of mgs and cgR_2242, one of the genes annotated as AKRs, enhanced 1,2-PD production to 24 mM. This work establishes that 1,2-PD synthesis by C. glutamicum, previously unknown, is possible.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCorynebacterium glutamicum 3aEscherichia coli 3aaerobic conditions 3aengineering 3agenes 3aglycolysis 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aBiosynthetic Pathways 2aCorynebacterium glutamicumxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGenetic Engineering 2aPropylene Glycolxmetabolism1 aSuzuki, Nobuaki1 aInui, Masayuki1 aYukawa, Hideaki0 tApplied microbiology and biotechnology.g2011 June, v. 90, no. 5 p.1721-1729dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl35319x0175-75987nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-011-3190-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03402naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245014700169520198700316592002802303650001702331650001802348650001802366650002002384650001802404650001102422650004302433650001902476650002102495650002302516650006302539653002202602653001002624653002002634653001502654653001802669653001702687700001302704700001402717700001702731773011402748856008502862852000902947655001202956IND60669779320221119074408.0200117e20200111xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066977932DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2019.4605462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJie, Jianzheng10aHighly efficient enrichment method for human plasma glycoproteome analyses using tandem hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography workflow  aSelective enrichment of glycopeptides from complex sample with hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) method, followed by cleavage of N-glycans by PNGase F to expose an easily detectable mark on the former glycosylation sites is used extensively as a sample preparation for comprehensive glycoproteome analysis. However, the coenrichment of hydrophilic nonglycosylated peptides and the released N-glycans seriously affect the identification of deglycopeptides with nano-LC–MS/MS. Here, we developed a new method for highly efficient and specific enrichment of human plasma N-glycopeptides using HILIC-PNGaseF-HILIC workflow (HPH). The first HILIC enriches the N-glycopeptides from the complex peptide mixtures. After the enriched N-glycopeptides are deglycosylated with PNGase F, the second HILIC captures the coenrichment of hydrophilic nonglycosylated peptides and the N-glycans, and then further enriches the deglycosylated peptides. The glycopeptide enrichment efficiency can be notably improved by employing HPH, evaluated by the highly recovery (more than 93.6%) and specific capturing glycopeptides from tryptic digest of IgG and BSA up to the molar ratios of 1:200. Meanwhile, we found that the alkylated proteins with IAA can affect the enrichment efficiency for N-glycopeptides with HILIC method. Moreover, after optimism the protein digestion, this novel HPH strategy allowed for the identified 722 N-glycopeptides within 202 unique glycoproteins from 1 µL human plasma digest using PNGase F in H₂¹⁶O. Meanwhile, this new HPH strategy identified an average 501 N-glycopeptides within averagely 134 unique glycoproteins from 1 µL human plasma digest using PNGase F in H₂¹⁸O. The enhanced glycopeptide detection was promoted by a substantial depletion of nonglycosylated peptides in the second HILIC.

There was close agreement between high pH values and the disappearance of crustacean zooplankton in four of the highly fertilized ponds. Pond water containing phytoplankton was toxic to the dominant Ceriodaphnia reticulata, yet pond phytoplankton isolated from pond water and resuspended in chlorinated tap water supported excellent growth of C. reticulata. Millipore—filtered pond water was not toxic. Analysis of chemical changes occurring in pond water with filtration showed a slight decrease in pH as the only significant alteration that is directly related to zooplankton mortality. The existence of such a pH mortality factor was demonstrated by testing the survivorship of newborn. C. reticulata in artificially adjusted pH treatments. A change from pH 10.8 to 11.2 radically altered the survivorship. Other hypothesis to explain the disappearance of C. reticulata–predation, starvation, allelophathic chemicals–are discounted. It is suggested that the one reported case of allelopathy between a green alga and a cladoceran, that reported by Ryther (1954), may instead have been partly a pH mortality factor. It is further suggested that in culturally enriched waters of low buffering capacity such a pH mortality factor may be common. In such lakes and ponds the quality of the water deteriorate due to the loss of the zooplankton.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCeriodaphnia 3aChlorophyta 3aallelopathy 3abuffering capacity 3achemical analysis 3afiltration 3alakes 3alife tables 3aneonates 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3aponds 3astarvation 3asurvival rate 3atap water 3atoxicity 3awater quality 3azooplankton1 adeNoyelles, Frank, Jr.cJr.0 tEcology.g1972 July, v. 53, no. 4 p.605-614dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19347743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111024002000153024001100173040001800184072000900202072000900211072000900220100001800229245008000247300001400327500002400341520081500365650002801180650001301208650001301221650001501234650001201249650001001261650001901271650002701290650001201317650002401329650001101353650002601364650000901390650006101399650004201460700002001502700001601522700001301538700001401551773011701565852000901682856009201691856011101783930003301894945002501927946001101952961001301963655001201976IND4389082220221118221706.0070318e200703  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438908222DNAL7 a173739512pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-2915.2006.00655.x2doi7 a10113/34972hdl8 ans1187  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL600 0aL0011 aCarlson, D.A.10aCandidate sex pheromones of the New World screwworm Cochliomyia hominivorax  ap. 93-96.  aIncludes references  aFive novel homologous acetate derivatives of long-chain secondary alcohols and a related ketone were tested for their efficacy as contact mating stimulants for Cochliomyia hominivorax Coquerel (Diptera: Calliphoridae).

This study determined the differences in the perception and choice of adaptation strategies between men and women farmers in Cinzana in the Segou region of Mali. The study used questionnaire interviews involving 260 farmers (49% women) and focus group discussions for data collection. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multinomial logit model to understand the determinants of the level of adoption of adaptation strategies. The results showed that, irrespective of gender, majority of farmers perceived climate change as extended period of droughts, shortened duration of rains, increased frequency of strong winds and increased day and night temperatures. While climate change perception was similar between men and women, choice of adaptation strategies differed significantly in most instances. Women farmers were generally low adopters of crop and varieties-related strategies, soil and water conservation technics (contour farming, use of organic manure), etc., compare to men. Notably, being the household head, age and the availability of free labor were found to positively increased farmers’ probability of adopting many adaptation strategies. The study recommends improving women’s access and control of production resources (land, labor) as means to improving their adoption of adaptation strategies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural development 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acowpeas 3adescriptive statistics 3aenvironment 3afocus groups 3agender 3aissues and policy 3alabor 3alogit analysis 3aprobability 3aquestionnaires 3asoil 3awater conservation 3aMali1 aOuedraogo, Mathieu,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6581-62871 aZougmoré, Robert B.1 aPartey, Samuel Tetteh1 aHouessionon, Prosper1 aMensah, Amos0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.13854-13870dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01242-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01671naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005200164300001600216520074500232592002800977650001301005650001401018650001701032650003301049650001601082650001401098650001801112651001001130700002201140700001901162773009501181856004801276852000901324655001201333IND50069883420221119164312.0131018e201311  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006988342DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-012-0868-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Shuang10aSpecies of Rhytismatales on Berberis from China  ap. 629-635.  aThree species of Rhytismatales on Berberis were found from Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China.

This study investigated the effect of C. fornicata on different components of benthic megafauna diversity (species composition, α-, β- and γ-diversity). In Arcachon Bay (France), C. fornicata was present in 58% of the 221 sampling stations. Crepidula fornicata was particularly abundant in four of the main benthic megafauna assemblages, suggesting a non-random distribution of its population. The mean number of megafauna species per station (α-diversity) was 11 with C. fornicata vs six without. Conversely, community similarity among stations (β-diversity) was higher when C. fornicata biomass increased. Opposing α- and β-diversity trends in the presence of C. fornicata explained the similarity of the global number of species (γ-diversity) between both situations (with and without C. fornicata). These results highlighted how this exotic engineer species acted on different types of diversity: the presence of C. fornicata increased the number of species per sample (α-diversity) but homogenized the benthic community (decreasing β-diversity) in comparison with stations where C. fornicata was absent. Crepidula fornicata stock in Arcachon Bay was also monitored and compared with 1999. The spread of C. fornicata between 1999 and 2011 has been limited with a 318 t stock which was not statistically different than the previous estimate performed in 1999. However, the mean length of C. fornicata collected in 2011 was significantly smaller, mainly due to a higher proportion of small individuals.  aPublisher supplied data 0aCrepidula fornicata 0adiversity 0amegafauna 0aliving stock 0aengineer species 0ainvasive species1 aBlanchet, Hugues1 aHippert, Bettina0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 Dec., v. 98, no. 8 p.2017-2028dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154170016553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02681naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245012800171300001800299520102500317592002801342650002901370650002701399650001101426650001101437650001201448650002301460650001201483650002201495650001901517650001301536650001401549650001501563650002401578650002301602650001901625650000901644653001201653653001001665653002901675653002301704653002301727653001901750700001801769700001901787700002401806700002601830700001801856700002201874700002201896773010301918856008502021852000902106655001202115IND60515412120221119104353.0160315e20160502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051541212DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.10957482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTropea, Alessia10aDevelopment of minimal fermentation media supplementation for ethanol production using two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains  ap. 1009-1016.  aEthanol production by fermentation is strongly dependent on media composition.

All fermentation tests were carried out using a microwell plate reader to monitor the processes. Two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (NCYC 2826 and NCYC 3445) were tested using three nitrogen sources, supplied with different vitamin and salts. The results show that solutions made of urea phosphate, KCl, MgSO ₄·7H ₂O, Ca-panthothenate, biotin allowed an ethanol yield of 22.9 and 23.4 g/L for strain NCYC 2826 and NCYC 3445, respectively, representing 90 and 92% of the theoretical yield. All tests were carried out using glucose as common reference carbon source.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aalcoholic fermentation 3abiotin 3acarbon 3aethanol 3aethanol production 3aglucose 3amagnesium sulfate 3amicroorganisms 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphysiological state 3apotassium chloride 3atrace elements 3aurea 0aEthanol 0ayeast 0aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 0afermentation media 0aalcohol production 0aurea phosphate1 aWilson, David1 aCicero, Nicola1 aPotortì, Angela G.1 aLa Torre, Giovanna L.1 aDugo, Giacomo1 aRichardson, David1 aWaldron, Keith W.0 tNatural product research.g2016 May 2, v. 30, no. 9 p.1009-1016dTaylor & Francisx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2015.10957483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03290naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001300148245018800161300002000349520190300369592002802272596005402300650002902354650002202383650001702405650001602422650001202438650001002450650001302460650001102473650001802484650002202502651001002524700005302534700001702587700001702604700002002621773014802641856008202789852000902871655001202880IND60746345620221118061623.0210731e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074634562DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-020-01185-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMin, Min10aResearch on targeted land poverty alleviation patterns based on the precise identification of dominant factors of rural poverty: a case study of Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, China  ap. 12791-12813.  aPoverty is a common problem faced by various social and economic forms. Eliminating poverty is a major issue of common concern and research all over the world. Land policies for poverty alleviation are an effective means of affecting land agriculture development, increasing the productivity of cultivated land, and promoting growth in farmers’ income and production. In recent years, it has played an important role in promoting poverty alleviation in poverty-stricken areas. However, the poverty alleviation needs of township units have not been precisely identified, and one-size-fits-all land policies are unable to effectively allocate poverty alleviation resources. Consequently, the actual efficiency of policies has been severely restricted, leading to regional differences in poverty alleviation. In response to this bottleneck, this study takes Siyang County in Jiangsu Province as a case study and adopts the geographical detector model to diagnose and identify the spatial differentiation characteristics and dominant factors of poverty and in various townships. The results can be summarised as ‘four dominant factors of poverty—four regional types of poverty townships—four targeted land poverty alleviation patterns’. Detailed results are as follows: the dominant factors affecting differentiation of rural poverty in Siyang County are labour, technology, land resources, and financial support. The various townships of the county were thus classified into four types according to the main factor affecting poverty: labour-constrained, land-constrained, capital-constrained, and technique-constrained, and proposed four targeted land poverty alleviation patterns for the different constraint types and then to improve the effectiveness of land development policies to successfully achieve precise poverty alleviation and reinforce strategies revitalising rural communities.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFD1100105cNational Key R&D Program of China 3aagricultural development 3aagricultural land 3acase studies 3aenvironment 3afunding 3alabor 3aland use 3amodels 3arural poverty 3aspatial variation 3aChina1 aLin, Chen1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5118-55731 aDuan, Xuejun1 aJin, Zhifeng1 aZhang, Luocheng0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.12791-12813dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-01185-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02866naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003300151245013200184300001800316520108300334592002801417650001501445650002701460650003001487650002501517650002501542650001901567650004101586650002201627650001501649650001801664650001101682650003701693650001401730650000901744650001101753653002401764653001501788653001801803653001601821700003401837700003401871700003101905700002901936700003101965700002901996700003502025700002802060700002702088773010302115856008502218852000902303655001202312IND60515412220221119104502.0160315e20160502xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051541222DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2015.11011032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Alencar, Danielle Cardoso10aChemical composition of the essential oil from the leaves of Anaxagorea brevipes (Annonaceae) and evaluation of its bioactivity  ap. 1088-1092.  aThe essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation from leaves of Anaxagorea brevipes was analysed by gas chromatography fitted with a flame ionisation detector (GC–FID) and coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS).

H.10aDisease Severity Estimates—Effects of Rater Accuracy and Assessment Methods for Comparing Treatments  ap. 1104-1112.  aAssessment of disease severity is required for several purposes in plant pathology; most often, the estimates are made visually. It is established that visual estimates can be inaccurate and unreliable. The ramifications of biased or imprecise estimates by raters have not been fully explored using empirical data, partly because of the logistical difficulties involved in different raters assessing the same leaves for which actual disease has been measured in a replicated experiment with multiple treatments. In this study, nearest percent estimates (NPEs) of Septoria leaf blotch (SLB) on leaves of winter wheat from nontreated and fungicide-treated plots were assessed in both 2006 and 2007 by four raters and compared with assumed actual values measured using image analysis. Lin’s concordance correlation (LCC, ρc) was used to assess agreement between the two approaches. NPEs were converted to Horsfall-Barratt (HB) midpoints and were compared with actual values. The estimates of SLB severity from fungicide-treated and nontreated plots were analyzed using generalized linear mixed modeling to ascertain effects of rater using both the NPE and HB values. Rater 1 showed good accuracy (ρc = 0.986 to 0.999), while raters 3 and 4 were less accurate (ρc = 0.205 to 0.936). Conversion to the HB scale had little effect on bias but reduced numerically both precision and accuracy for most raters on most assessment dates (precision, r = −0.001 to −0.132; and accuracy, ρc = −0.003 to −0.468). Interrater reliability was also reduced slightly by conversion of estimates to HB midpoint values. Estimates of mean SLB severity were significantly different between image analysis and raters 2, 3, and 4, and there were frequently significant differences among raters (F = 151 to 1,260, P = 0.001 to P < 0.0001). Only on 26 June 2007 did conversion to the HB scale change the means separation ranking of rater estimates. Nonetheless, image analysis and all raters were able to differentiate control and treated-plot treatments (F = 116 to 1,952, P = 0.002 to P < 0.0001, depending on date and rater). Conversion of NPEs to the HB scale tended to reduce F values slightly (2006: NPEs, F = 116 to 276, P = 0.002 to 0.0005; and, for the HB-converted values, F = 101 to 270, P = 0.002 to 0.0005; 2007: NPEs, F = 164 to 1,952, P = 0.001 to P < 0.0001; and, for HB-converted values, F = 126 to 1,633, P = 0.002 to P < 0.0001). The results reaffirm the need for accurate and reliable disease assessment to minimize over- or underestimates compared with actual disease, and the data we present support the view that, where multiple raters are deployed, they should be assigned in a manner to reduce any potential effect of rater differences on the analysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSeptoria 3adisease severity 3aimage analysis 3aleaf blotch 3aleaves 3amodels 3aplant pathology 3awinter wheat1 aEl Jarroudi, M.1 aKouadio, L.

Antarctic mosses and lichens are reliable biomonitors of airborne metals and in short time they can give useful information about Hg deposition patterns. Data summarized in this review show that although atmospheric Hg concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere are lower than those in the Northern Hemisphere, Antarctic cryptogams accumulate Hg at levels in the same range or higher than those observed for related cryptogam species in the Arctic, suggesting an enhanced deposition of bioavailable Hg in Antarctic coastal ice-free areas. In agreement with the newest findings in the literature, the Hg bioaccumulation in mosses and lichens from a nunatak particularly exposed to strong katabatic winds can be taken as evidence for a Hg contribution to coastal ecosystems by air masses from the Antarctic plateau. Human activities on the continent are mostly concentrated in coastal ice-free areas, and the deposition in these areas of Hg from the marine environment, the plateau and anthropogenic sources raises concern. The use of Antarctic cryptogams as biomonitors will be very useful to map Hg deposition patterns in costal ice-free areas and will contribute to a better understanding of Hg cycling in Antarctica and its environmental fate in terrestrial ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aanthropogenic activities 3aatmospheric chemistry 3abioaccumulation 3acryptogams 3aenvironmental fate 3ahumans 3aindicator species 3alichens 3amarine environment 3amercury 3amosses and liverworts 3aoxidants 3aplateaus 3aterrestrial ecosystems 3atroposphere 3awind 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 3aArctic region 0aAntarctica 0aMercury deposition 0aTerrestrial ecosystems 0aCryptogams 0aHg biomonitoring0 tChemosphere.g2016 Nov., v. 163 p.202-208dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03070naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245014900164300001800313520170200331592002802033650002202061650001802083650002002101650001402121650001302135650001202148650001702160650002202177650002502199650001102224650001402235653002702249653001902276653002602295653002002321700001702341700001302358700001602371700001702387773012802404856008302532852000902615655001202624IND60709536020221119024651.0211219s2020    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953602DNAL7 a10.1016/j.csbj.2020.08.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xinrui10aLarge inverted repeats identified by intra-specific comparison of mitochondrial genomes provide insights into the evolution of Agrocybe aegerita  ap. 2424-2437.  aGenomic structure and content of Agrocybe aegerita mitochondrial DNA contain essential information regarding the evolution of this gourmet mushroom. In this study, eight isolates of A. aegerita were sequenced and assembled into complete mitochondrial genomes. The mtDNA of the isolate Ag0067 contained two genotypes, both of which were quadripartite architecture consisting of two identical inverted repeats, separated by a small single-copy region and a large single-copy region. The only difference was opposite directions of the small single-copy region. The mtDNAs ranged from 116,329 bp to 134,035 bp, harboring two large identical inverted repeats. Genes of plasmid-origin were present in regions flanked by inverted repeat ID2. Most of the core genes evolved at a relatively low rate, whereas five tRNA genes located in corresponding regions of Ag0002:1–14000 and Ag0002:50001–61000 showed higher diversity. A long fragment inversion (10 Kb) was suggested to have occurred during the differentiation of two main clades, leading to two different gene orders. The number and distribution of the introns varied greatly among the A. aegerita mtDNAs. Fast invasion of short insertions likely resulted in the diversity of introns as well as other non-coding regions, increasing the variation of the mtDNAs. We raised a model about the evolution of the large repeats to explain the unusual features of A. aegerita mtDNAs. This study constructed quadripartite architecture of A. aegerita mtDNAs analogous to chloroplast DNA, proposed an interconversion model of the divergent mitochondrial genotypes with large inverted repeats. The findings could increase our knowledge of fungal evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgrocybe aegerita 3abiotechnology 3achloroplast DNA 3aevolution 3agenomics 3aintrons 3amitochondria 3amitochondrial DNA 3amitochondrial genome 3amodels 3amushrooms 0aMitochondrial genotype 0aLinear plasmid 0aShort inverted repeat 0aShort insertion1 aWu, Xiaoping1 aTan, Hao1 aXie, Baogui1 aDeng, Youjin0 tComputational and Structural Biotechnology Journal.g2020, v. 18 p.2424-2437dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23199x2001-03707nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csbj.2020.08.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03809naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245017900173300001400352500001500366520222000381592002802601650002002629650002502649650002102674650001502695650001502710650002102725650002002746650000702766650001002773650003102783650001402814650002102828650002502849650001302874653002502887653002502912653003702937653002802974653001703002653002103019653001103040700002403051700001803075700001803093773009003111856008103201852000903282655001203291IND60544765420221116145536.0160901e20150320xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÇekiç, Sema Demirci12aA colourimetric sensor for the simultaneous determination of oxidative status and antioxidant activity on the same membrane: N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine (DMPD) on Nafion  ap. 60-70.  a2019-12-06  aA colourimetric sensor capable of simultaneously measuring oxidative status (OS) in terms of the hazard produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant activity (AOA) in regard to ROS-scavenging ability of antioxidant compounds was developed. The coloured cationic semi-quinone derivatives, caused by ROS oxidative degradation of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine hydrochloride (DMPD) in pH 5.7 acetate-buffered medium, were formed in solution and immobilized on a perfluorosulfonate-based Nafion membrane. ROS, namely hydroxyl (OH) and superoxide (O2−) radicals, were produced by Fenton/UV and xanthine/xanthine oxidase methods, respectively. The pink-coloured, (+)-charged chromophore (referred to as DMPD-quinone or DMPDQ), resulting from the reaction between DMPD and ROS, could be completely retained on the solid membrane sensor by electrostatic interaction with the anionic sulfonate groups of Nafion. After equilibration, the Nafion membrane surface was homogeneously coloured enabling an absorbance measurement at 514nm, while the aqueous phase completely lacked colour. Antioxidants, when present, caused an absorbance decrease on the membrane due to their ROS scavenging action, giving rise to less DMPDQ production. The absorbance decrease on the sensor was linearly dependent on antioxidant concentration over a reasonable concentration range, enabling the simultaneous determination of OS and AOA-against ROS. The proposed antioxidant sensing method was tested in synthetic and real antioxidant mixtures, and validated against standard antioxidant capacity assays (i.e. ABTS and CUPRAC) for a variety of polyphenolic and antioxidant compounds. The dynamic linear ranges of antioxidants with the DMPD sensor in protection against hydroxyl and superoxide radicals generally varied within the micromolar to a few tens of micromolar concentration interval over one order-of-magnitude. Choosing three representative compounds in the high (epigallocatechin gallate), medium (quercetin) and low (p-coumaric acid) molar absorptivity range, the detection limits ranged within the concentration intervals of 0.2–0.9μM, 0.3–0.8μM, and 4–14μM, respectively, depending on the radical scavenged.  aPublisher supplied data 3adetection limit 3aanalytical chemistry 3axanthine oxidase 3aabsorbance 3aabsorption 3aepigallocatechin 3ap-coumaric acid 3apH 3acolor 3aelectrostatic interactions 3aquercetin 3asuperoxide anion 3aantioxidant activity 3axanthine 0aAntioxidant activity 0aColourimetric sensor 0aN,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylene diamine 0aReactive oxygen species 0aantioxidants 0aOxidative status 0aNafion1 aAvan, Asli Neslihan1 aUzunboy, Seda1 aApak, Reşat,0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Mar. 20, v. 865 p.60-70dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02784naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005000094040001800144100001800162245008300180300001600263500000900279520129500288592002801583650002101611650001601632650001801648650002201666650001201688650001201700650002201712650001401734650002001748650001501768650001201783650000901795650001601804650001001820650001501830650001101845650001501856650001301871650002501884650002501909650001201934650001701946700002201963700002001985700002102005773012202026856009702148852000902245655001202254IND60663394020221119162600.0191122e198407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066339402DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj1984.00021962007600040011x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPandey, R.

Four food legumes, mungbean (Vigna radiata L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), and peanut (Arachis hypogeae L.) were subjected to different moisture gradients in the field on a medium-deep Tropudalf soil. Water stress effects on the shoot and root growth were analyzed to determine relationships with seed yield and plant growth and to evaluate possible drought avoidance mechanisms. Water stress was created with a line-source sprinkler irrigation system. Plant growth analyses were computed from samples taken at frequent intervals during the vegetative and reproductive phases. Increasing moisture stress resulted in progressively less leaf area, leaf area duration (LAD), crop growth rate (CGR), and shoot dry matter. Conversely, specific leaf weight increased with increasing levels of water stress. The four seed legumes differed in their ability to maintain leaf area expansion rate, leaf area index, LAD, CGR, and shoot dry matter at high levels of water stress. Cowpea and peanut had higher root densities at 0.4 to 0.8 m soil depths than soybean or mungbean and this appeared to be a major adaptive mechanism for their drought tolerance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArachis hypogaea 3aGlycine max 3aVigna radiata 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3adrought 3adrought tolerance 3aleaf area 3aleaf area index 3amung beans 3apeanuts 3arain 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseed yield 3ashoots 3asoil depth 3asoybeans 3aspecific leaf weight 3asprinkler irrigation 3atropics 3awater stress1 aHerrera, W.

The increased number of adjustable variables gives these columns an enhanced value for the chromatographer, but, on the other hand, it complicates the process of developing satisfactory separations when complex samples must be analyzed. Thus, the availability of computer assisted methods development (CAMD) tools is highly desirable in this field. Therefore, the first specific tool for the CAMD of LC separations in mixed-mode columns is presented. The tool consists in two processes. The first one develops a retention model for peaks in a predefined experimental domain of pH and buffer concentration. In this domain, the retention as a function of the proportion of organic modifier is modeled using a two-stage re-calibration process departing from isocratic retention data and then, from gradient elutions. With this two-stage approach, reliability is gained. In the second process, the model is finally interpolated and used for the unattended optimization of the different possible elution modes available in these columns. This optimization process is driven by an evolutionary algorithm. The development and application of this new chemometrics tool is demonstrated by the optimization of a mixture of neutral and ionizable compounds. Hence, several different types of gradients were generated, showing a good agreement between simulated and experimental data, with retention time errors lower than 5% in most cases. On the other hand, classical CAMD tools, such as design of experiments, were unable to efficiently deal with mixed-mode optimizations, rendering errors above 30% for several compounds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3achemometrics 3aexperimental design 3aliquid chromatography 3amodels 3apH1 aQuintana, José Benito1 aRodil, Rosario1 aCela, Rafael0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 18, v. 1238 p.91-104dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03390naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002700148245004400175300002000219500001100239520206700250592002802317650002302345650005202368650001602420650001602436650001002452650001102462650001302473650001302486650001102499650001202510650001302522650001702535650001602552650001402568650001702582650001302599650001202612651001002624700005902634773014802693856008202841852000902923655001202932IND60746346120221118061514.0210731e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074634612DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01224-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMahrosh, Hafiza Salaha14aThe COVID-19 puzzle: a global nightmare  ap. 12710-12737.  aReview  aIn December 2019, WHO was informed with several unknown pneumonia cases and later it was found as highly contagious, transmittable and pathogenic viral infection. The novel coronavirus (nCoV-19) was firstly reported from Wuhan city in China. COVID-19 has raised the concern of the world since its emergence from China. The WHO has declared an ongoing COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. Till now 6,057,853 confirmed cases with 371,166 deaths have been reported from approximately 213 countries of the world. The aim of this study is to discuss all the aspects related to recently discovered novel coronavirus. The article, therefore, provides a comprehensive study on the genomic, epidemiological, social, clinical and environmental aspects of SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 receptor as a ligand to bind and transmit its genome just like the SARS-CoV. The clinical symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 are very non-specific and include fever, sore throat, wheezing, rales, headache and rhinorrhoea with round-glass pulmonary opacifications shadowing in X-ray. Many antiviral drugs show efficacy but only in mild to moderate infection levels. Though efforts on development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine have been started earlier as soon as the pandemic was emerged, till date no effective drug or vaccine has been validated with significant efficacy against the disease; therefore, there is a dire need to design effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Multiple vaccine candidates are still in evaluation and exploratory stages on different clinical models with potential results on different animals and human models. mRNA-1273, ChAdOx1, Ad5-nCoV, INO-4800, LV-SMENP-DC and pathogen-specific aAPC are the most advanced and potential drug candidates against COVID-19. Recent studies have revealed any attractive vaccine candidates as promising therapeutic agents based on different strategies of vaccines. Here, the rationale of this review was also to provide an overview of the pathogenesis of the virus and summarize the updated potential vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCOVID-19 infection 3aSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 3aX-radiation 3aenvironment 3afever 3agenome 3agenomics 3aheadache 3ahumans 3aligands 3apandemic 3apathogenesis 3apharyngitis 3apneumonia 3atherapeutics 3avaccines 3aviruses 3aChina1 aMustafa, Ghulam1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6510-64960 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.12710-12737dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01224-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03525naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245016200173300001600335500001500351520187800366592002802244650002302272650001202295650001802307650002102325650000902346650001002355650002502365650001402390650002602404650004302430650001502473650001302488650001102501650001902512650001202531650001602543650001202559651001202571653001002583653001202593653001802605653001802623653002502641653001902666700001502685700002002700700002402720700002402744773013102768856005102899852000902950655001202959IND50088374020221122024252.0140414e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008837402DNAL7 a10.1080/07438141.2011.6333072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Kathryn E.10aAssessment of benthic algal biomonitoring protocols to evaluate effects of shoreline development on the nearshore zone of Precambrian Shield lakes in Ontario  ap. 398-413.  a2019-12-05  aWe assessed the ability of benthic algal biomonitoring protocols to detect effects of differences in shoreline development in the littoral zone of oligo- to mesotrophic Precambrian Shield lakes in south-central Ontario. The study sites (n = 28 in Aug 2006, n = 29 in Aug 2007) spanned a broad gradient of shoreline development (e.g., intact forest, cottages, marinas) but a modest gradient of nutrient concentration (3–22 μg/L total phosphorus). Each site was sampled for water chemistry (nutrients, ions, metals, pH) and 5 levels of benthic algal bioassessment, which differed in the amount of time, resources and expertise required. Level 1 involved visual descriptions of algal cover; Level 2 involved biomass measurements (chlorophyll a, ash-free dry mass); Level 3 involved enumeration of algae to a coarse taxonomic level (i.e., the major algal classes); Level 4 involved quantification of photosynthetic pigments by high-performance liquid chromatography; and Level 5 involved high taxonomic resolution enumeration of diatom communities. Multi- and univariate numerical analyses (e.g., PCA, ANOSIM, ANOVA) were used to assess relationships between measurements of shoreline development, water chemistry, and benthic algal metrics. Results identified that Level 5 was the most sensitive to track differences in the shoreline development among sites. For lakes on the Precambrian Shield, we suggest that benthic algal biomonitoring programs focus on Level 5, despite the higher requirements of time, technical skill, and training.

Despite rapid changes in hydrology and water quality, DGT samplers and intracellular Cd and V concentrations were positively correlated (0.79 < r² < 0.99), suggesting comparable accumulation trends between both DGT-labile and intracellular monitoring techniques. The largest accumulated concentrations of both Cd and V by DGT and phytoplankton accumulation methods were found later into the river discharge period. In controlled settings, accumulated Cd and V concentrations by the diatom Attheya septentrionalis displayed a strong correlation with metals accumulated by DGTs (r² > 0.99). Principal component analysis (PCA) reinforced similarities between both metal monitoring techniques and assessed how changing environmental variables during the river discharge period influenced each monitoring technique. Cd accumulation was influenced by DOC concentrations and protein-like DOM whereas ionic strength (i.e. conductivity) and humic-like DOM influenced V accumulation. The present findings suggest that (1) DGT is a versatile tool for monitoring bioaccumulation of Cd and V in highly dynamic environmental systems and (2) DOC concentration, DOM composition, conductivity, pH, and river discharge influence the bioavailability of Cd and V in estuarine and riverine waters.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAttheya 3aBacillariophyceae 3abioaccumulation 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acorrelation 3aenvironmental factors 3aestuaries 3aionic strength 3amelting 3amonitoring 3apH 3aphytoplankton 3aprincipal component analysis 3arivers 3asamplers 3aspring 3astream flow 3avanadium 3awater quality 3aManitoba 0aBioaccumulation 0aDiffusion 0aChurchill River 0aVanadium 0aCadmium 0aPhytoplankton1 aZhu, Y.1 aShi, Y.X.1 aGuéguen, C.0 tChemosphere.g2016 Nov., v. 163 p.90-98dElsevier LtdwJournal:1969x0045-65357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02827naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245008700168300001600255500000900271520169300280592002801973650002302001650001302024650002202037650001102059650002502070650001102095650001402106650001402120650001202134650001902146650001902165650001302184650001002197650001102207773012202218856008002340852000902420655001202429IND60663394220221119162600.0191226e200207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066339422DNAL7 a10.2134/agronj2002.87602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWells, Randall S.,10aStem and Root Carbohydrate Dynamics of Two Cotton Cultivars Bred Fifty Years Apart  ap. 876-882.  aepub  aLittle is known concerning carbohydrate pools within the nonleaf and nonreproductive portions of the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plant. A 2-yr field study was conducted to ascertain both the concentration and total content of soluble carbohydrate and starch in upper stems, lower stems, vegetative branches, and roots of two cultivars released approximately 50 yr apart [Deltapine (DPL) 14 and 5690] from the same breeding program. In addition, yield, canopy photosynthesis, nodes above white flower, and white flowers per square meter were measured in the second year. Cultivar main effect was significant for soluble carbohydrate, total carbohydrate (soluble carbohydrate + starch), root dry weight, and total stem and root dry weight per plant. These differences are reflected by the generally greater dry weight and larger soluble carbohydrate concentration of DPL 5690 at 143 d after planting in 1994. Deltapine 5690 also exhibited larger late-season, integrated canopy photosynthesis in 1994, attributing to its larger soluble carbohydrate content. There was an initial increase in total stem and root carbohydrate per plant in each year followed by a decrease. Timing of the maxima and minima differed between years and between cultivars in 1994. Both the upper/lower stem carbohydrate ratios and the upper/lower stem starch ratios indicate declining upper-stem carbohydrate as flowering approached a hiatus and a shift in carbohydrate content towards the lower half of the stem. The data indicate that carbohydrate concentration and content per plant vary throughout the season; however, the cultivars exhibited little alteration in carbohydrate trends due to breeding efforts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGossypium hirsutum 3abranches 3abreeding programs 3acanopy 3acarbohydrate content 3acotton 3acultivars 3aflowering 3aflowers 3aphotosynthesis 3aplant breeding 3aplanting 3aroots 3astarch0 tAgronomy journal.g2002 July, v. 94, no. 4 p.876-882dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2002.87603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01726naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245007400167300001400241520076900255592002801024650001501052650001901067650000901086650001901095650001401114650001301128650001101141700001301152700001601165700002101181773009301202856008401295852000901379655001201388IND60112965220221116194020.0141111e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296522DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Changbei10aSelective transport of single protein molecules inside gold nanotubes  ap. 11-14.  aDiffusion of single protein molecules inside gold nanotubes was investigated. 3-dimensional imaging was employed to locate the individual molecules inside the nanotubes as a function of time. As expected, larger proteins and smaller pore sizes resulted in smaller diffusion coefficients. Diffusion within PEG-coated gold nanotubes was found to be two orders of magnitude faster than in previously reported, similar sized untreated polycarbonate membrane pores, showing that adsorption was serious in the latter case. We further demonstrate chromatographic selectivity during transport by modifying the inner surface of the gold nanotubes with self-assembled monolayers of derivatized alkyl thiols. These results should be useful for designing membrane separations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3achromatography 3agold 3aimage analysis 3ananotubes 3aproteins 3athiols1 aHan, Rui1 aQi, Shengda1 aYeung, Edward S.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 18, v. 1238 p.11-14dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03000naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006000147245022400207300001600431520188200447592002802329650001702357650000902374650001802383650001202401650004302413651001702456700001902473773011502492856008202607852000902689655001202698IND60638269420221118222436.0190504e201905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063826942DNAL7 a10.1007/s11625-018-0606-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Breda, John,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0418-407614aThe guiding logics and principles for designing emergent transdisciplinary research processes: learning experiences and reflections from a transdisciplinary urban case study in Enkanini informal settlement, South Africa  ap. 823-841.  aTransdisciplinarity is not a new science per se, but a new methodology for doing science with society. A particular challenge in doing science with society is the engagement with non-academic actors to enable joint problem formulation, analysis and transformation. How this is achieved differs between contexts. The premise of this paper is that transdisciplinary research (TDR) methodologies designed for developed world contexts cannot merely be replicated and transferred to developing world contexts. Thus a new approach is needed for conducting TDR in contexts characterised by high levels of complexity, conflict and social fluidity. To that end, this paper introduces a new approach to TDR titled emergent transdisciplinary design research (ETDR). A core element of this approach is that the research process is designed as it unfolds, that is, it transforms as it emerges from and within the fluid context. The ETDR outlined in this paper emerged through a case study in the informal settlement (slum) of Enkanini in Stellenbosch, South Africa. This case study demonstrates the context from and within which the ETDR approach and identifies a set of guiding logics that can be used to guide ETDR approaches in other contexts. The study demonstrates that the new logics and guiding principles were not simply derived from the TDR literature, but rather emerged from constant interacting dynamics between theory and practice. Learning how to co-design the research process through co-producing transformative knowledge and then implementing strategic interventions to bring about incremental social change is key to theory development in ways that are informed by local contextual dynamics. There are, however, risks when undertaking such TDR processes such as under-valuing disciplinary knowledge, transferring risks onto a society, and suppressing ‘truth-to-power’.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3arisk 3asocial change 3asociety 3asustainability science and engineering 3aSouth Africa1 aSwilling, Mark0 tSustainability science.g2019 May, v. 14, no. 3 p.823-841dSpringer JapanwJournal:J000001136x1862-40657nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11625-018-0606-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02942naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245010000176300001600276520112400292592002801416650001701444650002101461650004401482650001601526650002601542650001801568650002201586650002901608650002101637650001401658650002201672650001701694650001801711650003701729650001201766650002401778650001501802650001901817650001501836650001301851650001401864650002001878650003301898650002101931650002001952653001201972653002601984653001802010653001802028700002002046700002202066700002102088773013502109856008702244852000902331655001202340IND60610396720221119173047.0200228e20181001xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061039672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.2102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhutiya, Priyank L.10aNested seaweed cellulose fiber deposited with cuprous oxide nanorods for antimicrobial activity  ap. 435-444.  aBird's nest type architectural network of cellulosic nanofibers was extracted, with nearly 34% yield, from green filamentous seaweed Chaetomorpha antennina using mild bleaching agent. Nanorods of cuprous oxide (Cu₂O) were grown over the porous sheet, prepared from the seaweed cellulose, by one step hydrothermal method. The seaweed cellulose and Cu₂O nanorods deposited seaweed cellulose sheets, were characterized by XRD, SEM-EDX, FT-IR, TGA and tensile test. XRD revealed that seaweed cellulose acted as reducing agent, reducing CuO to Cu₂O. Morphology showed that the average diameter of seaweed cellulose and deposited Cu₂O nanorods were 30 nm and 90 nm, respectively. Cuprous oxide nanorods deposited seaweed cellulose sheet gave very good antibacterial activity towards gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus thermophilis) and gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginous, Escherichia coli) microbes. The Cu₂O nanorods deposited seaweed cellulose sheet can be viewed to have great potential in biomedical, packaging, biotechnological, textile, water treatment and pharmaceutical applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChaetomorpha 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aPseudomonas 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aStreptococcus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aantibacterial properties 3ableaching agents 3acellulose 3acellulosic fibers 3acupric oxide 3acuprous oxide 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3afabrics 3ahot water treatment 3amacroalgae 3amicroorganisms 3ananofibers 3ananorods 3apackaging 3areducing agents 3ascanning electron microscopy 3athermogravimetry 3awater treatment 0aSeaweed 0aCellulosic nanofibers 0aCu2O nanorods 0aAntibacterial1 aMisra, Nirendra1 aAbdul Rasheed, M.1 aZaheer Hasan, S.0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Oct. 01, v. 117 p.435-444dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.05.2103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245015100166300001600317520142800333592002801761650000801789650002101797650001301818650001501831650002001846650004101866650002001907650001701927650002401944651001401968700002401982773009502006856008402101852000902185655001202194IND60112965320221116193445.0141111e20120518xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Yaoxing10aDevelopment of analysis of volatile polyfluorinated alkyl substances in indoor air using thermal desorption-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry  ap. 114-120.  aThe study attempts to utilize thermal desorption (TD) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) for determination of indoor airborne volatile polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs), including four fluorinated alcohols (FTOHs), two fluorooctane sulfonamides (FOSAs), and two fluorooctane sulfonamidoethanols (FOSEs). Standard stainless steel tubes of Tenax/Carbograph 1 TD were employed for low-volume sampling and exhibited minimal breakthrough of target analytes in sample collection. The method recoveries were in the range of 88–119% for FTOHs, 86–138% for FOSAs, exhibiting significant improvement compared with other existing air sampling methods. However, the widely reported high method recoveries of FOSEs were also observed (139–210%), which was probably due to the structural differences between FOSEs and internal standards. Method detection limit, repeatability, linearity, and accuracy were reported as well. The approach has been successfully applied to routine quantification of targeted PFASs in indoor environment of Singapore. The significantly shorter sampling time enabled the observation of variations of concentrations of targeted PFASs within different periods of a day, with higher concentration levels at night while ventilation systems were shut off. This indicated the existence of indoor sources and the importance of building ventilation and air conditioning system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair conditioning 3aalcohols 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3astainless steel 3asulfonamides 3aventilation systems 3aSingapore1 aChang, Victor W.-C.0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 18, v. 1238 p.114-120dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100002400191245005800215300001600273506007600289520163500365592002802000506003702028650001502065650001902080650001902099650002502118650001702143650000902160650001402169650002102183650001002204650001702214650002302231650001602254650001402270650002302284650001002307650000902317650002402326650001302350650002002363650002602383650002102409650003302430700002202463700003402485773010302519856008402622852000902706655001202715IND60090000220221207081621.0141102e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009000022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.10.0112doi7 aPMC35632842pmcid7 a220411342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShearer, Gregory C.10aFish oil — How does it reduce plasma triglycerides?  ap. 843-851.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLong chain omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are effective for reducing plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. At the pharmaceutical dose, 3.4g/day, they reduce plasma TG by about 25–50% after one month of treatment, resulting primarily from the decline in hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL-TG) production, and secondarily from the increase in VLDL clearance. Numerous mechanisms have been shown to contribute to the TG overproduction, but a key component is an increase in the availability of FAs in the liver. The liver derives FAs from three sources: diet (delivered via chylomicron remnants), de novo lipogenesis, and circulating non-esterified FAs (NEFAs). Of these, NEFAs contribute the largest fraction to VLDL-TG production in both normotriglyceridemic subjects and hypertriglyceridemic, insulin resistant patients. Thus reducing NEFA delivery to the liver would be a likely locus of action for fish oils (FO). The key regulator of plasma NEFA is intracellular adipocyte lipolysis via hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), which increases as insulin sensitivity worsens. FO counteracts intracellular lipolysis in adipocytes by suppressing adipose tissue inflammation. In addition, FO increases extracellular lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase (LpL) in adipose, heart and skeletal muscle and enhances hepatic and skeletal muscle β-oxidation which contributes to reduced FA delivery to the liver. FO could activate transcription factors which control metabolic pathways in a tissue specific manner regulating nutrient traffic and reducing plasma TG.

The recognition of molecules rendering the archaeal membranes stable in such conditions represents an important step towards understanding the molecular mechanisms, which underlie the cellular survival, in order to effectively exploit them in biomedicine and bionanotechnology. Here we report on the bending elasticity and phase behaviour of model lipid membranes containing tetraether archaeal lipids. The bending elasticity modulus of membranes composed of palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether extract from the archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum’s plasma membrane is measured by analysis of the thermal shape fluctuations of nearly spherical giant unilamellar vesicles (tens of micrometers in size). The bending rigidity is reported to non-monotonically depend on the archaeal lipids’ concentration in the bilayer. At 50 wt% of tetraether lipids in the membrane we measure around 20% decrease of the bending modulus compared to the studied single-component phosphocholine bilayer. The membrane resistance to bending increases at archaeal lipids’ content higher than 70 wt%. These findings support the hypothesis about a probable looping conformation at very low amounts of bipolar lipids in the membrane and prevailing spanning tetraether molecules at higher concentrations. Fluorescence microscopy reveals structural phase coexistence at low temperatures (6 °C) for 75 wt% of bolalipids in the bilayer. Laurdan spectroscopy measurements of large unilamellar vesicles (hundreds of nanometers in size) provide evidences for increased lipid ordering at the glycerol level induced by the presence of up to 90 wt% of bolalipid in the bilayer. At this archaeal lipid content we measure increased bending rigidity of the membrane. The fatty acyl chain mobility probed by DPH fluorescence spectroscopy is significantly reduced in the presence of bolalipids. The lipid ordering decreases with increasing the temperature to an extent depending on the bolalipid content in the membrane. The presence of bipolar lipids in the bilayer affects the lipid packing more strongly at the glycerol level compared to the hydrophobic core of the membrane. By elucidating the effect of tetraether lipids on the structural and mechanical properties of the bilayer, the reported results are expected to help in advancing on liposome-based pharmaceuticals and biomedical applications as well as for developments in sensorics and nanotechnology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArchaea 3aartificial membranes 3abending strength 3adrugs 3afluorescence emission spectroscopy 3afluorescence microscopy 3aglycerol 3ahydrophobicity 3alipid content 3amedicine 3amicroorganisms 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananobiotechnology 3apH 3aphosphatidylcholines 3aphosphorylcholine 3aplasma membrane 3asalinity 3atemperature 0aBL 0aDPH 0aESIMS 0aGDGT 0aGP 0aGUV 0aHPTLC 0aITO 0aLUV 0aNMR 0aPDMS 0aPOPC 0aRh 0aTSFA 0aLipid bilayers 0aArchaeal lipids 0aBolalipids 0aGlycerol dialkyl Glycerol tetraethers 0aBending elasticity 0aLipid packing1 aMitkova, Denitsa1 aYordanova, Vesela1 aPohl, Peter1 aBakowsky, Udo1 aStaneva, Galya1 aBatishchev, Oleg1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9581-22330 tColloids and surfaces.g2020 Sept. 20, v. 601 p.124974-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2020.1249743Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01013naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100002000137245006600157300001600223520020300239592002800442650001200470650001400482650002000496650002100516700002100537773009700558856007100655852000900726655001200735IND60518556620221118230349.0160418e197209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855662DNAL7 a10.2307/19343182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeary, Rolfe A.12aA Computational Strategy for System Identification in Ecology  ap. 969-973.  aA computational strategy useful for system identification studies in ecology is described.

The concept of disease development occurring in the fed state now has much support and dysregulation of substrate flux may occur due to poor handling of dietary fat in the immediate postprandial period. The present paper will review recent observations implicating cephalic phase events in the control of enterocyte lipid transport, the impact of varying the composition of meals on subsequent fat metabolism, and the means by which dietary lipid carried in chylomicrons can lead to elevated postprandial non-esterified fatty acid concentrations. This discussion is followed by an evaluation of the data on quantitative meal fat oxidation at the whole body level and an examination of dietary fat clearance to peripheral tissues — with particular attention paid to skeletal muscle and liver given the role of ectopic lipid deposition in insulin resistance. Estimates derived from data of dietary-TG clearance show good agreement with clearance to the liver equaling 8–12% of meal fat in lean subjects and this number appears higher (10–16%) in subjects with diabetes and fatty liver disease. Finally, we discuss new methods with which to study dietary fatty acid partitioning in vivo. Future research is needed to include a more comprehensive understanding of 1) the potential for differential oxidation of saturated versus unsaturated fatty acids which might lead to meaningful energy deficit and whether this parameter varies based on insulin sensitivity, 2) whether compartmentalization exists for diet-derived fatty acids within tissues vs. intracellular pools, and 3) the role of reduced peripheral fatty acid clearance in the development of fatty liver disease. Further advancements in the quantitation of dietary fat absorption and disposal will be central to the development of therapies designed to treat diet-induced obesity.

The relationship between starch hydrolysis (SH) and organic matter digestibility, as well as total variability among TS, amylose content, RDS, SDS, and RS fractions of these test starches were also studied. SH varied significantly ranging from 9.8% in potato starch to 85.5% in sago starch with organic matter digestibility (OMD) of 22.36 and 95.04%, respectively. Significantly positive relationships were also recorded between SH and OMD, SDS, RDS and a significantly negative relationship with RS. Prediction equations were proposed to estimate SH from OMD and TS, and the correlation between estimates and determined SH values was high (r = 0.89, p < 0.0001), alluding to the possibility of estimating SH in starches using OMD and starch content values, hence enabling fast screening and predictability of starch fermentation kinetics for various aspects of nutrition studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamylose 3aarrowroot 3acassava 3acorn 3adigestibility 3aenzymes 3aequations 3afermentation 3ahydrolysis 3anutrition 3aorganic matter 3apotato starch 3apotatoes 3aprediction 3apulp 3aresistant starch 3arice 3asago 3ascreening 3asweet potatoes 3atapioca 3awheat1 aOloghobo, A.

Merr.] production systems on clayey soils are difficult to manage. With improvements in no-till planting equipment and herbicide technologies in the early 1990s, no-till production has become a viable alternative to the traditional tilled seedbed. Therefore, the relative economic performance of tilled and no-till seedbeds with respect to profitability, sensitivity to input price changes, and risk is assessed for maturity group (MG) IV, V, and VI soybean. Field experiments using split plots (main plots were MG and subplots were seedbeds) and a randomized complete block design with four replications were conducted from 1992 to 1994 at Rohwer, AR and from 1990 to 1997 at Keiser, AR on Sharkey and Sharkey silty clay, respectively. The importance of weather conditions is highlighted in the varied seedbed preparation effect on grain yields, with no clear advantage to either method. On average, yields were higher for MG IV at Rohwer and MG VI at Keiser. The breakeven price and yield analysis suggested that MG selection had a larger economic impact than seedbed preparation, regardless of location. This analysis also showed the extent of production cost differences and associated risk of loss by location. Risk analysis revealed that optimal production strategies changed when input costs were added to yield information and further confirmed that MG selection affects profitability more than seedbed preparation. Production practices that better exploit the yield potential of various MG cultivars (as related to weather conditions) therefore deserve further research attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGlycine max 3aarid lands 3aclay soils 3acultivars 3aeconomic impact 3aeconomic performance 3afield experimentation 3agrain yield 3aherbicides 3ainput costs 3ainput prices 3amaturity groups 3ano-tillage 3aplanters 3aproduction technology 3aprofitability 3arisk assessment 3aseedbed preparation 3aseedbeds 3asilty clay soils 3asoybeans 3aweather 3aArkansas1 aKeisling, Terry C.1 aOliver, Lawrence R.1 aDillon, Carl R.1 aManning, Patrick M.0 tAgronomy journal.g2001 July, v. 93, no. 4 p.827-835dAmerican Society of AgronomywJournal:jnl44592x0002-19627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2134/agronj2001.934827x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245013400169300001600303520141200319592002801731650001501759650002101774650002001795650001701815650002101832650002401853650001901877650002201896650002301918650002101941650002501962650001301987650001702000650001602017650002202033650001202055653000702067653000702074653000702081653002302088653002202111653002502133653002702158653002202185653001202207700002102219700002202240700001902262700002302281700001802304773013202322856008702454852000902541655001202550IND60610397220221119172928.0200117e201811  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061039722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.1622doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMomeni, Lida12aA molecular simulation and spectroscopic approach to the binding affinity between trypsin and 2-propanol and protein conformation  ap. 477-485.  aIncreasing the stability and activity of enzymes is one of the most popular ideas in biochemistry studies. The current study focused on the interactions between 2-propanol as an osmolyte and trypsin to increase the enzyme thermal stability by the modification of the solvent environment. To determine the binding mechanism of 2-propanol with trypsin, fluorescence emission quenching was observed as a static mode of quenching upon the binding of 2-propanol to trypsin. With the formation of hydrogen bonds and lower hydrophobicity levels after the addition of 2-propanol, Tm of complexes were increased. Also, the α-helix content of trypsin was increased as obtained by far-UV CD. CD results analysis showed that there was no significant perturbation in the structure of trypsin upon an increase in the concentration of 2-propanol. Molecular docking results also indicated that 2-propanol could bind to trypsin and hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bond contributions played the major role in this binding. Consequently, the results of the molecular dynamics simulation showed that the stability of trypsin-2 propanol was obtained to be about 2.5 nm in the equilibrium state, indicating the stability and rigidity of the trypsin-2 propanol complex. Upon 2-propanol conjugation, the residual activity of the enzyme was increased. 2-propanol, therefore, acted as a stabilizer and activator for trypsin.  aPublisher supplied data 3a1-propanol 3abinding capacity 3aenzyme activity 3afluorescence 3ahydrogen bonding 3ahydrophobic bonding 3ahydrophobicity 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amolecular dynamics 3amolecular models 3aprotein conformation 3asolvents 3aspectroscopy 3astabilizers 3athermal stability 3atrypsin 0aCD 0aTm 0aMD 0aCircular dichroism 0aMolecular docking 0aMolecular simulation 0aFluorescence quenching 0aThermal stability 0aTrypsin1 aShareghi, Behzad1 aFarhadian, Sadegh1 aVaziri, Samira1 aSaboury, Ali Akbar1 aRaisi, Fateme0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2018 Nov., v. 119 p.477-485dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.07.1623Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02455naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245009100166300001800257520127600275592002801551650003401579650002301613650001301636650001001649650002601659650002001685650001401705650001101719650001401730650002601744650001401770651002401784651000901808651001501817700001801832773008901850856008401939961001302023852000902036655001202045IND60549241620221120070242.0160907e201509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054924162DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-12-14-1277-SR2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKolmer, J.

Single uredinial isolates (490 total) were derived from the collections and tested for virulence phenotype on 20 lines of Thatcher wheat that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes. In 2013, 79 virulence phenotypes were described in the United States. Virulence phenotypes MBTNB, TNBGJ, and MCTNB were the three most common phenotypes. Phenotypes MBTNB and MCTNB are both virulent to Lr11, and MCTNB is virulent to Lr26. MBTNB and MCTNB were most common in the soft red winter wheat region of the southeastern states and Ohio Valley. Phenotype TNBGJ is virulent to Lr39/41 and was widely distributed throughout the hard red winter wheat region of the Great Plains. Isolates with virulence to Lr11, Lr18, and Lr26 were common in the southeastern states and Ohio Valley region. Isolates with virulence to Lr21, Lr24, and Lr39/41 were frequent in the hard red wheat region of the southern and northern Great Plains.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAgricultural Research Service 3aPuccinia recondita 3abreeding 3agenes 3ahard red winter wheat 3ahuman resources 3aleaf rust 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3asoft red winter wheat 3avirulence 3aGreat Plains region 3aOhio 3aOhio River1 aHughes, M.

Based on this phenomenon, a new devolatilization method has been developed for accessing the coking property of coals using the evolution of H₂ during thermogravimetric–mass spectrometer (TG-MS) analysis. Four coals having different coking potentials, commonly used in steel industries, were considered. The investigation was performed at temperatures up to 1100 °C in an argon atmosphere under a constant heating rate of 3 °C/min to simulate the coking environment. Nonisothermal kinetics is considered as a good indication of different reaction regimes during pyrolysis, which is generally done through TGA alone. In this study evolution of H₂ is used to develop nonisothermal kinetics through a new quantification approach. Finally, a definite and more generic correlation was established, based on H₂ enrichment in volatiles around specific temperature zones, for measuring the exact coking behavior of coal through TG-MS analysis. This method is very robust and has the ability to predict the exact coking behavior of coal. The results are also compared with the blended coal used in plants which is in very good agreement with developed H₂ enrichment correlation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aargon (noble gases) 3acoal 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3aindustry 3amass spectrometry 3apyrolysis 3aspectrometers 3asteel 3atemperature 3athermogravimetry1 aPanda, Jeetendra Nath1 aNag, Debjani1 aChougale, N.1 aChandaliya, V.

It contributes significantly to the water budget of the country and acts as the main source of freshwater apart from the Nile River. Due to excessive pumping to meet the increasing water demands, the seawater intrusion from the Mediterranean Sea has been triggered affecting the groundwater quality in the northern and middle zones of the Nile Delta aquifer. This paper investigates the possible adverse impact of reducing the flow in the Nile River due to the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the Nile Delta aquifer and considers possible measures to adapt with such impacts. A numerical model is developed using SEAWAT to simulate the groundwater flow and solute transport considering the operation of the new dam. Two scenarios of filling the reservoir during 3 and 6 years were considered. The maximum groundwater drawdown in the middle Delta will reach 2.65 m under the conditions of scenario one and 1.4 m under the conditions of scenario two. Equi-concentration lines 1000 and 35,000 ppm would advance to a distance of 110.2 and 70.85 km, respectively, under the first scenario and 108.25 and 67.3 km, respectively, under the second scenario. Results indicated that filling the reservoir in 3 and 6 years would require reducing groundwater abstraction rates from the Nile Delta aquifer by 60 and 40%, respectively, to maintain the freshwater body in the Nile Delta aquifer.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaquifers 3adams (hydrology) 3adrawdown 3afreshwater 3agroundwater 3agroundwater extraction 3agroundwater flow 3amathematical models 3ariver deltas 3asaltwater intrusion 3asolutes 3awater budget 3awater quality 3awater reservoirs 3aEgypt 3aMediterranean Sea 3aNile River1 aAbdelaty, I.1 aSherif, M.0 tInternational journal of environmental science and technology.g2019 May, v. 16, no. 5 p.2321-2332dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:2208x1735-14727nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-018-1851-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02628naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245017800165300001600343520141100359592002801770650001301798650001401811650001401825650001601839650001701855650001001872650003701882650001201919650000901931650002201940650001101962650002201973650001001995651001202005700002002017700002302037773010102060856004802161852000902209655001202218IND4458223620221120175154.0121003e201105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445822362DNAL7 a10.1134/S10227954110501522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStakheev, V.

Sylvaemus uralensis was distributed nearly over the whole territory of the oblast; S. sylvaticus was found in the central and western parts of the oblast on the right bank area of Don River; S. flavicollis inhabited northern and central parts of Rostov oblast on the right bank area of Don River; S. fulvipectus was found in the southern parts of the oblast, in the left bank area of Don River. Using the chromosome C-banding technique, it was demonstrated that the pygmy wood mice living in Rostov oblast in the right bank areas of Manych River and Don River in its low course, belonged to the eastern European chromosomal form of S. uralensis. The pygmy wood mice from the outskirts of the town of Salsk, the left bank area of Manych River, were probably hybrids between eastern European and southern European chromosomal forms. Based on the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome b gene fragment sequencing and chromosome C-banding, it was suggested that the wood mice inhabiting Rostov oblast belonged to the southern lineage of S. sylvaticus, living on Apennine Peninsula, Balkan Peninsula, and nearly throughout Ukraine.  aPublisher supplied data 3aApodemus 3aEuropeans 3aallozymes 3achromosomes 3acytochrome b 3agenes 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3ahybrids 3amice 3amitochondrial DNA 3arivers 3aspecies diversity 3atowns 3aUkraine1 aBogdanov, A.

This study explores the role of both the environment and disease in regulating the composition of microbial species in the soil and on amphibian hosts. We compared the microbial communities of Plethodon cinereus salamanders along a land‐use gradient in the New York metropolitan area and paired these with associated soil cores. Additionally, we characterized the diversity of bacterial and fungal symbionts that putatively inhibit the pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. We predicted that variation in skin microbial community composition would correlate with changes seen in the soil which functions as the regional species pool. We found that salamanders and soil share many microbial taxa but that these two communities exhibit differences in the relative abundances of the bacterial phyla Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria and the fungal phyla Ascomycota and genus Basidiobolus. Microbial community composition varies with changes in land‐use associated factors creating site‐specific compositions. By employing a quantitative, null‐based assembly model, we identified that dispersal limitation, variable selection, and drift guide assembly of microbes onto their skin, creating high dissimilarity between individuals with likely consequences in disease preventative function.  aPublisher supplied data  aClare Boothe Luce Graduate FellowshipcHenry Luce Foundation  aFreedman Fellowship for Women in STEMcFordham University  aLouis Calder Center Summer GrantcFordham University  aStudent Support GrantcFordham University 3aAcidobacteria 3aActinobacteria 3aAscomycota 3aBasidiobolus 3aBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis 3aPlethodon cinereus 3aProteobacteria 3acommunity structure 3afungi 3aland use change 3ametropolitan areas 3amicrobial communities 3amicrobiome 3amodels 3asoil 3asymbionts 3avirulent strains 3aNew York1 aKutos, Steve1 aNaghshineh, Nina1 aMesko, Marissa1 aYou, Qing1 aLewis, J.

All the complexes were characterized by (¹H, ¹³C and ³¹P) NMR spectroscopy as well as elemental analysis. X-ray structural analysis for 2a and 2d revealed a six-coordinate distorted octahedral geometry around the zirconium center in the solid state. With the activation of a suitable cocatalyst, half-metallocene zirconium complexes 2a–d were employed to catalyze ethylene polymerization and ethylene copolymerization with cycloolefins including norbornene (NBE), 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene (VNB). All the complexes exhibited high efficiency toward the copolymerizations. High comonomer incorporations up to 62% (NBE), 76% (ENB) and 40.6% (VNB), respectively, with high catalytic activities above 10³ kgₚₒₗyₘₑᵣ per molZᵣ per h were achieved using catalyst 2c. Steric hindrance and electronic effects of the complexes or the comonomers greatly influence copolymerization behavior. Thus, catalytic activity and copolymer chain structure, including comonomer incorporation and the molecular weight, can be easily tuned over a wide range by changing catalyst and reaction conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3acarbon 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3acomposite polymers 3acopolymerization 3aethylene 3ageometry 3aligands 3amolecular weight 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aphosphorus 3astable isotopes 3azirconium1 aYang, Jixing1 aWang, Bin1 aLi, Yuesheng0 tRSC advances.g2016 June 21, v. 6, no. 64 p.59590-59599dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ra11501b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245015800165300001400323520124000337592002801577650001501605650001501620650001601635650001101651650002101662650002001683650002101703650001501724650000901739650003301748650001101781650001701792650001801809650001301827650001801840650001501858650001101873650001701884700001701901700001801918700001301936700001601949700001501965773010101980856008202081852000902163655001202172IND60091551820221119025402.0141103e20120315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009155182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLu, Juanjuan10aUltrasensitive electrochemical immunosensor based on Au nanoparticles dotted carbon nanotube–graphene composite and functionalized mesoporous materials  ap. 29-35.  aA facile and sensitive electrochemical immunosensor for detection of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) was designed by using functionalized mesoporous nanoparticles as bionanolabels. To construct high-performance electrochemical immunosensor, Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) dotted carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)–graphene composite was immobilized on the working electrode, which can increase the surface area to capture a large amount of primary antibodies (Ab₁) as well as improve the electronic transmission rate. The as-prepared bionanolabels. composed of mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MCM-41) coated with AuNPs through thionine linking, showed good adsorption of horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary anti-hCG antibody. Interlayer thionine was not only a bridging agent between MCM-41 and AuNPs but also an excellent electron mediator. The approach provided a good linear response range from 0.005 to 500mIUmL⁻¹ with a low detection limit of 0.0026mIUmL⁻¹. The immunosensor showed good precision, acceptable stability and reproducibility. Satisfactory results were obtained for determination of hCG in human serum samples. The proposed method provides a new promising platform of clinical immunoassay for other biomolecules.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3aantibodies 3ablood serum 3acarbon 3acarbon nanotubes 3adetection limit 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3agold 3ahuman chorionic gonadotropin 3ahumans 3aimmunoassays 3aimmunosensors 3ananogold 3ananoparticles 3aperoxidase 3asilica 3asurface area1 aLiu, Shiquan1 aGe, Shenguang1 aYan, Mei1 aYu, Jinghua1 aHu, Xiutao0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2012 Mar. 15, v. 33, no. 1 p.29-35dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2011.11.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02380naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001100147245005800158300001300216500001400229520108300243592002801326650001801354650001501372650001401387650000901401650001501410650001701425650002001442650001601462650002501478650001401503650001401517651001001531651001101541653001601552653001701568653001301585653001801598653001901616653002401635700001901659700003601678773009301714856008201807852000901889655001201898IND60698702620221118053758.0210303e20191031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870262DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.60.466452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLv, Tu10aThree new species and a new combination of Triblidium  ap. 1-15.  aNAL-light  aTriblidiaceae (Rhytismatales) currently consists of two genera: Triblidium and Huangshania.

Before this study, only the type species, Triblidium caliciiforme, had DNA sequences in the NCBI GenBank. In this study, six specimens of Triblidium were collected from China and France and new ITS, mtSSU, LSU and RPB2 sequences were generated. Our molecular phylogenetic analysis and morphological study demonstrated three new species of Triblidium, which are formally described here: T. hubeiense, T. rostriforme and T. yunnanense. Additionally, our results indicated that Huangshania that was considered to be distinct from Triblidium because of its elongated, transversely-septate ascospores, is congeneric with Triblidium. Therefore, we have placed Huangshania in synonymy under Triblidium, rendering Triblidiaceae a monotypic family.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRhytismatales 3aTriblidium 3aapothecia 3aasci 3aascospores 3amelanization 3anew combination 3anew species 3anucleotide sequences 3aphylogeny 3arendering 3aChina 3aFrance 0aHuangshania 0aphylogenetic 0ataxonomy 0aTriblidiaceae 0athree new taxa 0amuriform ascospores1 aHou, Cheng-Lin1 aJohnston, Peter R.,d1926-2014,0 tMycoKeys.g2019 Oct. 31, v. 60 p.1-15dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.60.466453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03025naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001400147245012400161300001600285520187500301592002802176650001102204650002002215650002002235650002302255650002302278650001002301650002602311650001402337650001402351650001302365700001902378700002202397700002102419773012102440856008102561852000902642655001202651IND60478822520221121031026.0160114e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047882252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-015-2040-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDijk, Ben10aIs one defence enough? Disentangling the relative importance of morphological and behavioural predator-induced defences  ap. 237-246.  aMany organisms show predator-induced behavioural and morphological phenotypic plasticity. These defence mechanisms are often expressed simultaneously. To estimate the relative importance of these two defences, we conducted a laboratory experiment using tadpoles of the common frog (Rana temporaria) as prey and Aeshna dragonfly larvae as predators. We first raised tadpoles in the presence and absence of caged predators to induce differences in defensive morphology, and then conducted free ranging predator trials in environments that were either with or without the presence of predation cues to induce differences in defensive behaviour. This 2 × 2 design allowed us to separate the effects of inducible morphology from inducible behaviour. Caged predators induced deeper bodies and tailfins and reduced activity levels in tadpoles. The time to first capture was shortest in tadpoles without morphological or behavioural defences. Tadpoles with a behavioural defence had a significantly longer time to first capture. Tadpoles with only antipredator morphology tended to have a longer time to first capture as compared to those without any induced defences. This treatment also had a higher number of injured tadpoles as compared to other treatments, suggesting that inducible morphology facilitates predator escape due to the ‘lure effect’. However, tadpoles with both behavioural and morphological defences did not have a longer time to first capture as compared to tadpoles with only morphological or behavioural induced defences. Our results suggest that both behavioural and morphological antipredator responses contribute to reduced capture efficiency by predators, but their simultaneous expression did not have any additive effect to the time of first capture and survival, and that the morphology response is most effective when tadpoles are active.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAeshna 3aRana temporaria 3aadditive effect 3adefense mechanisms 3adefensive behavior 3afrogs 3aphenotypic plasticity 3apredation 3apredators 3atadpoles1 aLaurila, Anssi1 aOrizaola, Germán1 aJohansson, Frank0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2016 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.237-246dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-015-2040-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02921naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100001600146245008700162300001600249520161300265592002801878650001301906650001101919650001201930650001301942650001401955650002601969650002401995650001502019650000902034650002502043650001902068650000902087653001602096653004202112653003702154653002302191653002102214653002402235700001702259773011002276856008002386852000902466655001202475IND60616451820221120160316.0181016e201802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061645182DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166819632doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYim, Ka-yan12aA statistical analysis of low-stress mechanical properties of warp-knitted fabrics  ap. 467-479.  aFabric hand is an indispensable characteristic for the selection of fabric and product development and the buying consideration for manufacturers and consumers.

The increasing potential for the wide variety of applications and development of warp-knitted fabrics is not only because its fabric hand gives better determination for fabric marketing, but also because it provides extensive scope for fabric performance and appearance. This paper reports an experimental study on the integrated fabric hand behavior of a series of warp-knitted fabrics made for various apparel applications, such as sportswear, lingerie and leisure wear. These 105 fabrics were produced by varying different physical parameters, including fabric weight and fabric thickness. The Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F) was employed to obtain the fabric hand properties (primary hand value and total hand value) related with stiffness, smoothness and softness. All low-stress mechanical properties and fabric hand values from the testing results were used to verify the applicability of the KES-F on warp-knitted fabrics and to analyze the relationships of fabric parameters and hand characteristics. The results indicate that the KES-F is an appropriate tool to measure the hand attributes of warp-knitted samples, and moderate correlations between physical properties and mechanical behavior were found.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclothing 3acotton 3afabrics 3ahardness 3amarketing 3amechanical properties 3aproduct development 3apurchasing 3asilk 3astatistical analysis 3atextile fibers 3awool 0afabric hand 0aKawabata Evaluation System for Fabric 0alow-stress mechanical properties 0aprimary hand value 0atotal hand value 0awarp-knitted fabric1 aKan, Chi-wai0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 88, no. 4 p.467-479dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166819633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02989naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002700145245009400172300001800266500002000284520132500304592002801629596006801657596006801725650002201793650002201815650001301837650001701850650001501867650001601882650001401898650001801912650001001930650001101940650001401951650001901965650001301984650001701997650001502014700002102029700001802050700002202068700002202090700002102112700002402133700002202157700006102179773013102240856007902371852000902450655001202459IND60749123520221123034854.0210828e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912352DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHerkersdorf, Sebastian10aBacterial cell wall‐degrading enzymes induce basidiomycete natural product biosynthesis  ap. 4360-4371.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aNatural products play a vital role for intermicrobial interactions. In the basidiomycete arena an important representative is variegatic acid, a lactone natural product pigment whose ecological relevance stems from both inhibiting bacterial swarming and from indirect participation in breakdown of organic matter by brown‐rotting fungi. Previous work showed that the presence of bacteria stimulates variegatic acid production. However, the actual external molecular trigger that prompts its biosynthesis in the mushroom hyphae remained unknown. Here, we report on the identification of Bacillus subtilis subtilisin E (AprE) and chitosanase (Csn) as primary inducers of pulvinic acid pigment formation. Using the established co‐culture system of B. subtilis and Serpula lacrymans, we used activity‐guided FPLC‐based fractionation of B. subtilis culture supernatants and subsequent peptide fingerprinting to identify candidates, and their role was corroborated by means of a pigment production assay using heterologously produced chitosanase and subtilisin. B. subtilis mutants defective in either the aprE or the csn gene still triggered pigmentation, yet to a lower degree, which points to a multicausal scenario and suggests the combined activity of these cell wall polymer‐attacking enzymes as true stimulus.  aPublisher supplied data  aCRC/TR 124 ‐ 210879364cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)  aSFB 1127/2 ‐ 239748522cDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) 3aBacillus subtilis 3aSerpula lacrymans 3abacteria 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3achitosanase 3acoculture 3afractionation 3agenes 3ahyphae 3amushrooms 3aorganic matter 3apeptides 3apigmentation 3asubtilisin1 aKrüger, Thomas,1 aWein, Philipp1 aLöffler, Susanne1 aFontaine, Thierry1 aGressler, Markus1 aHertweck, Christian1 aBrakhage, Axel A.1 aHoffmeister, Dirk1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5302-64610 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4360-4371dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02887naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002200149245006800171300001600239500000900255520127500264592002801539650002201567650002301589650002201612650002201634650001301656650001401669650002301683650002001706650002701726650001401753650001801767650001001785650002001795650002101815650001401836650001401850650001401864650001001878651001801888700002001906700001601926700001701942700001601959700002201975700001901997700002002016700001702036700001702053700001502070773013102085856008402216852000902300655001202309IND60665251320221123022404.0191122e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525132DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2014.05.03482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumssa, Tadele T.10aCharacterization of Stem Rust Resistance in Wheat Cultivar Gage  ap. 229-239.  aepub  aWheat (Triticum spp.) stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn. (Pgt), re-emerged as a devastating disease of wheat because of virulent race Ug99 (TTKSK). Many bread wheat (T. aestivum L.) cultivars grown in North America are susceptible to Ug99 or its derivative races that carry additional virulence. ‘Gage’ was released in 1963 mainly for its excellent field resistance to leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks) and stem rust. However, Gage’s resistance has not been genetically characterized, which would facilitate its use in breeding programs. To better define the nature of the resistance in Gage, we created an F₂ population and the corresponding F₂:₃ and F₄:₅ families from crosses between Gage and stem rust susceptible cultivar ‘Bill Brown’. Inheritance of resistance to Pgt race QFCSC and molecular marker analysis indicated that Sr2 and additional genes explain the stem rust resistance of Gage. Using seedling plant infection types from the F₂, F₂:₃, and F₄:₅ families, we found that at least one dominant and, most likely, one recessive gene are involved in Gage’s resistance. Seedling resistance genes acted independently of Sr2 since Sr2 is effective only at the adult plant stage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPuccinia graminis 3aPuccinia recondita 3aTriticum aestivum 3abreeding programs 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adisease resistance 3agenetic markers 3ainheritance (genetics) 3aleaf rust 3amature plants 3araces 3arecessive genes 3aresistance genes 3aseedlings 3astem rust 3avirulence 3awheat 3aNorth America1 aBaenziger, P.S.1 aRouse, M.N.1 aGuttieri, M.1 aDweikat, I.1 aBrown-Guedira, G.1 aWilliamson, S.1 aGraybosch, R.A.1 aWegulo, S.N.1 aLorenz, A.J.1 aPoland, J.0 tCrop science.g2015 Jan., v. 55, no. 1 p.229-239dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2014.05.03483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03279naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094040001800128100002600146245011100172300001600283520142900299592002801728650004401756650002301800650001301823650001401836650002201850650001401872650001201886650001801898650001801916650000901934650001901943650002101962650001101983650002601994650001502020650001702035650003402052650001202086650001502098650002102113650001902134650002202153650002102175650001902196653002402215653002702239653001802266653001702284653001402301653001602315653001602331653001302347653001402360700001802374700001902392700001902411773011002430856008002540852000902620655001202629IND60616451920221120160221.0181016e201803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061645192DNAL7 a10.1177/00405175166819642doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUfodike, Chukwuzubelu10aSynthesis and characterization of extruded cellulosic fibrils for enhanced reinforced/filamentary textiles  ap. 520-531.  aPolystyrene matrixes containing cellulose nanofibril (CNF) with fiber content of 0.5, 1, 5, and 10 wt% were successfully hydrophobized by silylation and extruded into single filaments using both single and dual heat extrusion processing. The fiber–matrix bonding was examined using a scanning electron microscope. With further characterization, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed a formation of Si-O-C bonds, indicating better fiber–matrix adhesion. Raman spectroscopy showed disruption of hydrogen bonding, which indicates interference of parallel nanocellulose fiber adhesion to neighboring fibrils. Thermogravimetric analysis suggests that the thermal stability of the functionalized CNF is higher than that of the corresponding neat sample, which is resultant of stable Si bond formation. Results from dynamic mechanical analysis showed an increasing ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elastic modulus, with peak values attributed to the dual heat processing with up 112 MPa and 10.8 GPa for the UTS and modulus, respectively. The increase is assumed to be as a result of the linear arrangement of the CNF in the Polystyrene (PS) matrix during the extrusion process. Micromechanics modeling calculations suggest the increase is moving towards the fiber properties. The results revealed the strong reinforcing ability of CNFs and their compatibility with the thermoplastic matrix if functionalized.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aRaman spectroscopy 3aadhesion 3acellulose 3acellulose fibrils 3aextrusion 3afabrics 3afiber content 3afiber quality 3aheat 3aheat treatment 3ahydrogen bonding 3amodels 3amodulus of elasticity 3ananofibers 3apolystyrenes 3ascanning electron microscopes 3asilicon 3asilylation 3atensile strength 3atextile fibers 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry 3athermoplastics 0afilamentary textile 0afunctionalized textile 0anatural fiber 0amodification 0aextrusion 0afabrication 0aperformance 0astrength 0atoughness1 aJackson, Sean1 aBolden, Nydeia1 aDickens, Tarik0 tTextile research journal.g, v. 88, no. 5 p.520-531dSAGE PublicationswJournal:jnl46536x1746-77487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00405175166819643Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01955naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002800147245012300175300001400298500001400312520067200326592002800998650002301026650001501049650000901064650001401073650001001087650001501097650001401112650001601126650003101142650001401173650001801187650001201205651001301217653001701230653001301247700002501260700002001285700001901305773009401324856008201418852000901500655001201509IND60698702820221118053514.0210303e20191031xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870282DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.60.379312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonçalves, Micael F.M.10aNeptunomyces aureus gen. et sp. nov.

Therefore, an object-oriented unsupervised classification algorithm for PolSAR images based on the image block is proposed. Firstly, the image is divided into multiple non-overlapping image blocks, and h/q/gray-Wishart classification is performed in each block. Secondly, each cluster obtained is regarded as an object, and the affinity matrix of objects is calculated in the global image. Finally, the objects are merged into the specified class number by density peak clustering (DPC), and the adjacent objects at the block boundary are checked and forced to merge. Experiments are carried out with the measured data of the airborne AIRSAR and E-SAR and the spaceborne GF-3. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves good classification results under a variety of class numbers.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3aland use and land cover maps 3apolarimetry 3asynthetic aperture radar1 aHan, Ping 1 aTei, Sei,0 tRemote Sensing.g2022 Aug. 14, v. 14, no. 16dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:26717x2072-42927nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs141639533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03249naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100006200145245013100207300001800338500002000356520154800376592002801924596004501952650001201997650002202009650001502031650001302046650001302059650001802072650001302090650001702103650001902120650001102139650001402150650001702164650001702181700002302198700002102221700002002242700001702262700001902279700002002298700002102318700001702339700002002356700006402376700006002440773013102500856007902631852000902710655001202719IND60749123720221123024656.0210828e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912372DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMurphy, Chelsea L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5367-859310aGenomic characterization of three novel Desulfobacterota classes expand the metabolic and phylogenetic diversity of the phylum  ap. 4326-4343.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aWe report on the genomic characterization of three novel classes in the phylum Desulfobacterota. One class (proposed name Candidatus ‘Anaeroferrophillalia’) was characterized by heterotrophic growth capacity, either fermentatively or utilizing polysulfide, tetrathionate or thiosulfate as electron acceptors. In the absence of organic carbon sources, autotrophic growth via the Wood–Ljungdahl (WL) pathway and using hydrogen or Fe(II) as an electron donor is also inferred for members of the ‘Anaeroferrophillalia’. The second class (proposed name Candidatus ‘Anaeropigmentia’) was characterized by its capacity for growth at low oxygen concentration, and the capacity to synthesize the methyl/alkyl carrier CoM, an ability that is prevalent in the archaeal but rare in the bacterial domain. Pigmentation is inferred from the capacity for carotenoid (lycopene) production. The third class (proposed name Candidatus ‘Zymogenia’) was characterized by fermentative heterotrophic growth capacity, broad substrate range and the adaptation of some of its members to hypersaline habitats. Analysis of the distribution pattern of all three classes showed their occurrence as rare community members in multiple habitats, with preferences for anaerobic terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments over oxygenated (e.g. pelagic ocean and agricultural land) settings. Special preference for some members of the class Candidatus ‘Zymogenia’ for hypersaline environments such as hypersaline microbial mats and lagoons was observed.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016423cNational Science Foundation USA 3aArchaea 3aagricultural land 3afreshwater 3agenomics 3ahydrogen 3ahypersalinity 3alycopene 3amicrobiology 3aorganic carbon 3aoxygen 3aphylogeny 3apigmentation 3athiosulfates1 aBiggerstaff, James1 aEichhorn, Alexis1 aEwing, Essences1 aShahan, Ryan1 aSoriano, Diana1 aStewart, Sydney1 aVanMol, Kaitlynn1 aWalker, Ross1 aWalters, Payton1 aElshahed, Mostafa S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1067-16471 aYoussef, Noha H.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9159-37850 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4326-4343dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03711naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005700148245013500205520172200340592002802062650002902090650001602119650001302135650003002148650001402178650001902192650001502211650001702226650001902243650001902262650001702281650000902298650001302307650001902320650002502339651001202364653001602376653001702392653002402409653003802433653001302471653001702484653003002501653002602531700006302557700005302620700002002673700002002693700002402713700002102737700006302758700001902821700006202840773011502902856008303017852000903100655001203109IND60736777820221121014201.0210727e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073677782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1018342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrey, Anthony1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2117-108210aGeochemical mapping of a blue carbon zone: Investigation of the influence of riverine input on tidal affected zones in Bull Island  aBull Island (BI) is a coastal sand spit that formed as an unintended consequence of the construction of two walls, built over 200 years ago in Dublin Port, Ireland to alleviate silting of the shipping route. A large lagoon, on the land side of the island was separated in 1964 by the construction of a causeway to produce two separate lagoons that are now impacted by different water sources. Here we investigate the influence of riverine inputs on the two adjacent but unconnected tidal wetland lagoons. The South lagoon (SL) is supplied by tidal water passing through the eutrophic R. Liffey and R. Tolka estuary zones, while the North Lagoon (NL) is supplied by seawater and to a lesser degree, freshwater from the R. Liffey plume. Within each of these zones a clear ecotone exists between the mudflats (MF) and vegetated saltmarshes (SM). We determined the quantity and distributions of bulk geochemical characteristics across BI’s sediments, including total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TN), metals, and also, 16 individual polyromantic hydrocarbon’s (PAH’s) as an indication of anthropogenic input. Primary focus was placed on studying the blue carbon sediments of the lagoon zones. Significant differences in analytical results showed major influences exerted on sediment geochemistry within each lagoon. This study highlights the ability of a functioning coastal wetland to flourish and sequester elevated levels of carbon, metals and pollutants under the constraints of increasing anthropogenic impact. As the inadvertent result of geo-engineering, BI and its environs is a very important site to investigate the potential of artificially constructed wetlands to act as blue carbon reservoirs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3ablue carbon 3aecotones 3aenvironmental engineering 3aestuaries 3aeutrophication 3afreshwater 3ageochemistry 3amarine science 3ariparian areas 3asalt marshes 3asand 3aseawater 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3aIreland 0aBlue carbon 0aCoastal spit 0aGeochemical mapping 0aArtificially constructed wetlands 0aMudflats 0aSalt marshes 0aPolyaromatic hydrocarbons 0aAnthropogenic impacts1 aCunningham, Aisling1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6388-82251 aLee, Alan1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2265-71721 aMonteys, Xavier1 aCoveney, Seamus1 aMcCaul, Margaret V.1 aMurphy, Brian T.1 aMcCloughlin, Thomas1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4574-79631 aHidaka, Brooks1 aKelleher, Brian P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6574-59140 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 June, v. 45 p.101834-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1018343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02953naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001700140245011000157300002000267520145100287592002801738650004401766650001801810650002101828650001601849650001601865650001601881650002101897650001501918650001201933650001801945650001601963650001201979650002001991650001402011650001602025650001102041650003302052650000902085700002202094700001702116700001502133700001902148700002502167700001702192700001902209773012402228856007402352852000902426655001202435IND60640878220221122041559.0190505e20160712xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064087822DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ra11514d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJoshi, Nidhi10aComparative evaluation of enzyme-free nanoclay-ionic liquid based electrodes for detection of bioanalytes  ap. 66120-66129.  aEnzyme-free electrodes were fabricated using nanoclay LAPONITE® and montmorillonite (MMT) and imidazolium based ionic liquids (ILs), 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium chloride ([C2mim][Cl]) and 1-methyl-3-octyl imidazolium chloride ([C8mim][Cl]). Here, we have presented a set of quantitative results which conclude that these enzyme-free electrodes can be used successfully for the development of strip-sensors for detection of bioanalytes. Introduction of ILs into nanoclay dispersions resulted in the enhancement of stability of the thin film electrodes formed of the NC-IL materials. The fabricated electrodes were used for sensing various bioanalytes, such as ascorbic acid (AA), oxalic acid (OA), urea (U), citric acid (CA), glucose (Glu) and cholesterol (Chox). The influence of different alkyl chain lengths of ionic liquids, and the aspect ratio of nanoclay platelets were studied with respect to their electrochemical response to different analytes, which covered seven distinct matrices coated on the electrode surface. Further, the effect of oxygen ion beam irradiation on the electrochemical profiles of these electrodes was explored. The irradiation leads to reduction of the electrochemical properties by blocking certain active charge transfer sites. The electrochemical characterization of these electrodes was done using cyclic voltammetry (CV), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aascorbic acid 3achemical species 3acholesterol 3acitric acid 3adispersions 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aglucose 3aionic liquids 3airradiation 3aliquids 3amontmorillonite 3ananoclays 3aoxalic acid 3aoxygen 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aurea1 aSharma, Abhimanyu1 aRawat, Kamla1 aAsokan, K.1 aSolanki, P.

We bioprospected 16S rRNA amplicons, metagenomes, and metaproteomes from methane hydrate‐bearing sediments under Hydrate Ridge (offshore Oregon, USA, ODP Site 1244, 2–69 mbsf) for novel microbial metabolic and biosynthetic potential. Atribacteria sequences generally increased in relative sequence abundance with increasing sediment depth. Most Atribacteria ASVs belonged to JS‐1‐Genus 1 and clustered with other sequences from gas hydrate‐bearing sediments. We recovered 21 metagenome‐assembled genomic bins spanning three geochemical zones in the sediment core: the sulfate–methane transition zone, the metal (iron/manganese) reduction zone, and the gas hydrate stability zone. We found evidence for bacterial fermentation as a source of acetate for aceticlastic methanogenesis and as a driver of iron reduction in the metal reduction zone. In multiple zones, we identified a Ni‐Fe hydrogenase‐Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter supercomplex (Hun) in Atribacteria and Firmicutes bins and in other deep subsurface bacteria and cultured hyperthermophiles from the Thermotogae phylum. Atribacteria expressed tripartite ATP‐independent transporters downstream from a novel regulator (AtiR). Atribacteria also possessed adaptations to survive extreme conditions (e.g. high salt brines, high pressure and cold temperatures) including the ability to synthesize the osmolyte di‐myo‐inositol‐phosphate as well as expression of K⁺‐stimulated pyrophosphatase and capsule proteins.  aPublisher supplied data  aNSF OCE‐1558916, NSF OCE‐1360077cDivision of Ocean Sciences  cC‐DEBI  cUniversity of Washington's Proteomic Resource  aUWPR95794cGeorgia Tech Earth and Atmospheric Sciences Frontiers Postdoctoral Fellowship  a80NSSC19K0477cNASA Exobiology Grant  aNNX14AJ87GcNASA Exobiology Grant  aNSF OCE‐0939564cCenter for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations 3aFirmicutes 3aOregon 3aThermotogae 3aacetates 3aantiporters 3abiosynthesis 3acold 3afermentation 3agas hydrate 3amanganese 3ametagenomics 3amethane 3amethane production 3amicrobiome 3asediments 3athermophiles1 aRanjan, Piyush1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8293-68891 aKretz, Cecilia B.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0630-84711 aNunn, Brook L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7361-43591 aJohnson, Abigail M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6264-11081 aXu, Manlin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6949-11811 aMcManus, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4697-02321 aStewart, Frank J.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8139-51760 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4646-4660dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01930naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245005400166300001600220520109800236592002801334650001201362650001601374650001401390650001501404650002201419773012101441856008101562852000901643655001201652IND60478822920221121005837.0160114e201602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6047882292DNAL7 a10.1007/s00265-015-2047-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeauchamp, Guy10aTiming of attacks by a predator at a prey hotspot  ap. 269-276.  aPredators and responsive prey might be engaged in a behavioral game in which predators manage responsiveness or fear level in their prey, but the supporting evidence is limited. I investigate a potential case between a predator, the peregrine falcon, and a prey species, the semipalmated sandpiper, during fall staging by sandpipers. For the falcons, attacking vulnerable sandpipers roosting on the shore too early would discourage roosting, but waiting too long might be problematic as well since the roost could disband. Sandpipers are expected to be responsive against potential attacks, but being responsive too long comes at the cost of curtailing rest. The evolutionary stable solution in this game suggests that falcons should attack at all possible times, but concentrate their attacks in the early phases of roosting. Responsiveness by sandpipers, which I measured using the rate of false alarms during roosting, should decrease with time spent roosting. I provide evidence in support of these two predictions, suggesting that falcons and sandpipers are engaged in a war of attrition.  aPublisher supplied data 3afalcons 3afearfulness 3apredators 3aprediction 3aroosting behavior0 tBehavioral ecology and sociobiology.g2016 Feb., v. 70, no. 2 p.269-276dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0340-54437nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00265-015-2047-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03680naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245007500210520204100285592002802326650001802354650001102372650000902383650001902392650001802411650001902429650001902448650000902467650002302476650001502499650001702514651001102531653001802542653001802560653000902578653002202587653001602609653001602625653001602641700002402657700006702681700005902748700002802807700006802835700006402903773011502967856008303082852000903165655001203174IND60736777920221121014207.0210727e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073677792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1018352doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranklin, Gemma L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0671-223910aImpact of port development on the northern Yucatan Peninsula coastline  aDevelopment of port infrastructure for small-scale fisheries started in the late 1960s and increased in the 1980s along the northern Yucatan Peninsula. These ports mainly consist of a pair of jetties that significantly interrupt littoral transport. Hence, they are responsible for coastal erosion in this region, which has been exacerbated by urbanization in coastal areas. Here, satellite imagery, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle flights, and high-resolution GPS beach surveys were employed to investigate seasonal to multi-annual impacts of ports on the coastline. Shoreline positions prior to the construction of the ports are compared with the current location using satellite imagery for 7 ports along the Yucatan coast. Accretion (erosion) rates averaged 8 m yr ⁻¹ and affected approximately 1.5 (2.5 km) updrift (downdrift), respectively. To investigate seasonal variability, a beach monitoring program was conducted along one of the ports (Sisal) between May 2019–April 2020. Field observations show that seasonal variations of wave conditions, associated with sea breeze and winter storms (anticyclonic cold fronts known as Nortes), modulate beach response. Analysis of beach transects show yearly net accretion (erosion) in subaerial and intertidal beach volume updrift (downdrift) of the port in the order of 76.0 (−60.4) m³/m. Moreover, during the period of study four Reef Ball™ breakwaters were deployed on the downdrift side and a beach nourishment of approximately 860 m³ took place to mitigate beach erosion. Field observations suggest that the annual erosion rate decreased from −60.4 m³/m to an accretion of 3.5 and 4.4 m³/m in the two transects located immediately behind the structures installed in May 2019. The current results highlight the need for sand bypassing at ports as a way of mitigating beach erosion in their vicinity. Previous studies conducted at other locations experiencing the same problem suggest that the re-design of the port’s layout might reduce downdrift effects and dredging costs.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeach erosion 3acoasts 3acold 3ainfrastructure 3alittoral zone 3amarine science 3aremote sensing 3asand 3aseasonal variation 3ashorelines 3aurbanization 3aMexico 0aBeach erosion 0aBeach surveys 0aUAVs 0aSatellite imagery 0aGPS surveys 0aPort impact 0aSea-breezes1 aMedellín, Gabriela1 aAppendini, Christian M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6044-33511 aGómez, Juan A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2495-01531 aTorres-Freyermuth, Alec1 aLópez González, José,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9977-31041 aRuiz-Salcines, Pablo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3075-98730 tRegional studies in marine science.g2021 June, v. 45 p.101835-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23214x2352-48557nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rsma.2021.1018353Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02483naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001500169245014600184300001800330520083900348592002801187650001201215650001301227650002201240650002101262650001501283650001801298650001601316650001701332650001401349650001001363650002301373650002301396650002901419650001701448650005601465650002901521650001701550650004801567650002101615650002501636700001401661700001801675700001201693700001601705700001601721700001701737773009201754856008601846852000901932655001201941IND4465528620221120231710.0141111e20121015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446552862DNAL7 a234426992pmid7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.0552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKang, Jing10aDetermination of hyperin in seed of Cuscuta chinensis Lam. by enhanced chemiluminescence of CdTe quantum dots on calcein/K₃Fe(CN)₆ system  ap. 2383-2388.  aIn this paper, 3-mercaptocarboxylic acid (MPA) modified CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were used as sensitizers, to enhance the chemiluminescence (CL) of the calcein/K₃Fe(CN)₆ system. A new CL system of CdTe/calcein/K₃Fe(CN)₆ was developed. The effects of reactant concentrations and the particle sizes of CdTe QDs on the CL emission were investigated in detail. The possible enhancement mechanism of the CL was also further investigated based on the photoluminescence (PL) and CL spectra. Polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid, quercetin, hyperin, catechin and kaempferol, were observed to inhibit the CL signal of the CdTe/calcein/K₃Fe(CN)₆ system and determined by the proposed method. The proposed method was applied to the determination of hyperin in seed of Cuscuta chinensis Lam. and the results obtained were satisfactory.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCuscuta 3acatechin 3achemiluminescence 3achlorogenic acid 3akaempferol 3aparticle size 3apolyphenols 3aquantum dots 3aquercetin 3aseeds 2aCadmiumxchemistry 2aCuscutaxchemistry 2aFerricyanidesxchemistry 2aFluoresceins 2aLuminescent Measurementsxinstrumentationxmethods. 2aPlant Extractsxanalysis 2aQuantum Dots 2aQuercetinxanalogs & derivativesxanalysis. 2aSeedsxchemistry 2aTelluriumxchemistry1 aLi, Xuwen1 aGeng, Jiayang1 aHan, Lu1 aTang, Jieli1 aJin, Yongri1 aZhang, Yihua0 tFood chemistry.g2012 Oct. 15, v. 134, no. 4 p.2383-2388dElsevier Ltdx0308-81467nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.04.0553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02361naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245004500174300002000219520113200239592002801371650001501399650001001414650002301424650001701447650001601464650002101480650001801501650000901519650001601528650001901544650000701563650001401570650001701584650001101601650001601612700001801628700001901646700002201665773015001687856008101837852000901918655001201927IND60580131120221118175930.0170910e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058013112DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9846-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKubiňáková, Emília10aEffect of ferrate on green algae removal  ap. 21894-21901.  aGreen algae Cladophora aegagropila, present in cooling water of thermal power plants, causes many problems and complications, especially during summer. However, algae and its metabolites are rarely eliminated by common removal methods. In this work, the elimination efficiency of electrochemically prepared potassium ferrate(VI) on algae from cooling water was investigated. The influence of experimental parameters, such as Fe(VI) dosage, application time, pH of the system, temperature and hydrodynamics of the solution on removal efficiency, was optimized. This study demonstrates that algae C. aegagropila can be effectively removed from cooling water by ferrate. Application of ferrate(VI) at the optimized dosage and under the suitable conditions (temperature, pH) leads to 100% removal of green algae Cladophora from the system. Environmentally friendly reduction products (Fe(III)) and coagulation properties favour the application of ferrate for the treatment of water contaminated with studied microorganisms compared to other methods such as chlorination and use of permanganate, where harmful products are produced.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCladophora 3aalgae 3aapplication timing 3achlorination 3acoagulation 3aelectrochemistry 3ahydrodynamics 3airon 3ametabolites 3amicroorganisms 3apH 3apotassium 3apower plants 3asummer 3atemperature1 aHíveš, Ján1 aGál, Miroslav1 aFašková, Andrea0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 27 p.21894-21901dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9846-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03463naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245014800166300001400314520181400328592002802142650002602170650002402196650002602220650002802246650001802274650002602292650001102318650002102329650001502350650002802365650001702393650002302410650001002433650001702443650002102460650002602481650001902507653004402526653002402570653002102594653002802615700001702643700001502660700001502675700001702690700001502707700001202722773009302734856008502827852000902912655001202921IND60531649620221120053819.0180831e201610  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053164962DNAL7 a10.1016/j.wasman.2016.07.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Xinyu14aThe evolution of water extractable organic matter and its association with microbial community dynamics during municipal solid waste composting  ap. 79-87.  aThe humification of water extractable organic matter (WEOM) by microorganisms is widely used for assessing compost maturity and quality. However, the effect of bacterial and fungal community dynamics on humification of WEOM was not yet explored fully. Here, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) to investigate the link between bacterial and fungal community dynamics and humification process of WEOM, respectively. Results showed that water-soluble carbon (WSC), humification degree, molecule weight and abundance of aromatic carbon were significantly related to bacterial community (p<0.05), while the protein-like materials were statistically influenced by fungal community (p<0.05). Both bacterial and fungal communities significantly affected the abundance of oxygen-containing functional groups and humic-like materials (p<0.05). These humification parameters were most likely to be influenced by some of bacterial and fungal species at different composting stages. Lactobacillus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Galactomyces geotrichum can enhance the degradation of WSC and protein-like materials at the early composting. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes could promote the increase of aromatic carbon, oxygen-containing functional groups, humification degree and molecular weight of WEOM during the initial fermentation stage. Cladosporium herbarum and Chaetomium globosum could be the dominant controllers at the second fermentation for acceleratingthe formation of oxygen-containing functional groups and humic-like materials of WEOM, respectively. Our results suggested that regulation for the dynamics of these special bacterial and fungal species at different composting stages might be a potential way to accelerate humification of municipal solid waste composting.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAspergillus fumigatus 3aChaetomium globosum 3aCladosporium herbarum 3aGalactomyces geotrichum 3aLactobacillus 3abacterial communities 3acarbon 3acompost maturity 3acomposting 3acorrespondence analysis 3afermentation 3afungal communities 3afungi 3ahumification 3amolecular weight 3amunicipal solid waste 3aorganic matter 0aWater-extractable organic matter (WEOM) 0aBacterial community 0aFungal community 0aHumification parameters1 aHe, Xiaosong1 aXi, Beidou1 aGao, Rutai1 aTan, Wenbing1 aZhang, Hui1 aLi, Dan0 tWaste management.g2016 Oct., v. 56 p.79-87dElsevier LtdwJournal:6325x0956-053X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2016.07.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03582naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001700145245018700162300001800349500002000367520142900387592002801816596006601844596006801910596007901978596006102057596012002118650002302238650001902261650001302280650001702293650001502310650001502325650001702340650002102357650001902378650001102397650001302408650001102421650001502432650001302447650001102460650001302471650002902484650002002513700001702533700001602550700001302566700001202579700001702591700001902608700001302627700005202640700005702692773013102749856007902880852000902959655001202968IND60749124020221122231702.0210828e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912402DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Weiwei10aGenetic mapping of highly versatile and solvent‐tolerant Pseudomonas putida B6‐2 (ATCC BAA‐2545) as a ‘superstar’ for mineralization of PAHs and dioxin‐like compounds  ap. 4309-4325.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and dioxin‐like compounds, including sulfur, nitrogen and oxygen heterocycles, are widespread and toxic environmental pollutants. A wide variety of microorganisms capable of growing with aromatic polycyclic compounds are essential for bioremediation of the contaminated sites and the Earth's carbon cycle. Here, cells of Pseudomonas putida B6‐2 (ATCC BAA‐2545) grown in the presence of biphenyl (BP) are able to simultaneously degrade PAHs and their derivatives, even when they are present as mixtures, and tolerate high concentrations of extremely toxic solvents. Genetic analysis of the 6.37 Mb genome of strain B6‐2 reveals coexistence of gene clusters responsible for central catabolic systems of aromatic compounds and for solvent tolerance. We used functional transcriptomics and proteomics to identify the candidate genes associated with catabolism of BP and a mixture of BP, dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene and carbazole. Moreover, we observed dynamic changes in transcriptional levels with BP, including in metabolic pathways of aromatic compounds, chemotaxis, efflux pumps and transporters potentially involved in adaptation to PAHs. This study on the highly versatile activities of strain B6‐2 suggests it to be a potentially useful model for bioremediation of polluted sites and for investigation of biochemical, genetic and evolutionary aspects of Pseudomonas.  aPublisher supplied data  a2018YFA0901200cNational Key Research and Development Project  a21777098 32000062cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31422004cChinese National Science Foundation for Excellent Young Scholars  a20XD1421900cShanghai Excellent Academic Leaders Program  c“Shuguang Program” Shanghai Education Development Foundation and Shanghai Municipal Education Commission 17SG09 3aPseudomonas putida 3abioremediation 3abiphenyl 3acarbon cycle 3acatabolism 3achemotaxis 3adibenzofuran 3agenetic analysis 3amineralization 3amodels 3anitrogen 3aoxygen 3aproteomics 3asolvents 3asulfur 3atoxicity 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptomics1 aLi, Qinggang1 aZhang, Lige1 aCui, Jie1 aYu, Hao1 aWang, Xiaoyu1 aOuyang, Xingyu1 aTao, Fei1 aXu, Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4418-96801 aTang, Hongzhi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7743-01860 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4309-4325dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02980naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245008500167300001600252500000900268520153100277592002801808650001301836650002501849650002201874650001301896650001401909650001901923650002301942650002301965650003101988650002502019650001902044650001502063650002802078650001602106650001002122650002602132651001302158700003602171700002402207700001802231700002602249773013002275856008402405852000902489655001202498IND60665251720221123004857.0191122e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525172DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2012.09.05502doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBalut, Ana L.10aValidation of Fhb1 and QFhs.nau-2DL in Several Soft Red Winter Wheat Populations  ap. 934-945.  aepub  aExotic resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) such as Fhb1 and QFhs.nau-2DL provide one strategy for breeding wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars resistant to Fusarium head blight (FHB). The first objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of these QTL in reducing FHB in diverse genetic backgrounds and to measure their impact on agronomic and quality traits. Lines from five susceptible × resistant crosses were evaluated in the FHB nursery at Lexington, KY, in 2010 and 2011. The populations were also grown in yield trials at Lexington (2010 and 2011) and Princeton (2011), KY, to measure agronomic and quality traits. Fhb1 reduced Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK) by 32% and deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration by 20%. QFhs.nau-2DL reduced FDK by 29% in two of five populations and DON by 24% in four of five populations. Significant QTL effects (P < 0.05) on agronomic and quality traits were observed although impact was small. One cycle of direct or indirect simulated phenotypic selection was effective at reducing DON levels. The frequency of Fhb1-homozygous resistant lines among the phenotypically selected lines was higher than the frequency of QFhs.nau-2DL-homozygous resistant lines. The second objective was to assess the effectiveness of near-infrared reflectance (NIR) to estimate damage from FHB. Near-infrared reflectance-based predictions of FDK and DON showed that FDK measured by NIR was at least as good as FDK measured by air separation in predicting DON in four of five populations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFusarium 3aFusarium head blight 3aTriticum aestivum 3acrossing 3acultivars 3adeoxynivalenol 3adisease resistance 3agenetic background 3anear-infrared spectroscopy 3aphenotypic selection 3aplant breeding 3aprediction 3aquantitative trait loci 3areflectance 3aseeds 3asoft red winter wheat 3aKentucky1 aClark, Anthonyq(Anthony Jude),1 aBrown-Guedira, Gina1 aSouza, Edward1 aVan Sanford, David A.0 tCrop science.g2013 May, v. 53, no. 3 p.934-945dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2012.09.05503Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03313naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245014600173300002000319520183600339592002802175650002302203650001902226650002602245650001002271650001002281650001502291650001802306650001802324650001002342650001302352650002102365650001402386650001002400650001102410650001102421650001102432650002002443650001002463700002202473700001902495700002502514700002002539700002002559773015002579856008102729852000902810655001202819IND60580131320221118180341.0170910e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058013132DNAL7 a10.1007/s11356-017-9847-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlsaeedi, Abdullah H.10aEngineered silica nanoparticles alleviate the detrimental effects of Na+ stress on germination and growth of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris)  ap. 21917-21928.  aDuring the past 10 years, exploiting engineered nanoparticles in agricultural sector has been rapidly increased.

Five doses of Na⁺ have been prepared from NaCl, i.e., 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, and 5000 mg L⁻¹, and distilled water was applied as a control. Seeds and seedlings were treated with three different NS concentrations (100, 200, and 300 mg L⁻¹). The results proved that Na⁺ concentrations had detrimental effects on all measured parameters. However, treating seeds and seedlings with NS improved their growth and resulted in higher values for all measurements. For instance, the addition of 300 mg L⁻¹ NS leads to an increase of the final germination percentage, vigor index, and germination speed for seeds irrigated with 5000 mg Na⁺ L⁻¹ by 19.7, 80.7, and 22.6%, respectively. Although common bean seedlings could not grow at the highest level of Na⁺, fortification seedlings with NS helped them to grow well under 5000 mg L⁻¹ of Na⁺. An increase of 11.1 and 23.1% has been measured for shoot and root lengths after treating seedlings with 300 mg L⁻¹ NS under irrigation with 5000 mg Na⁺ L⁻¹ solutions, and also at the same treatment, shoot and root dry masses are enhanced by 110.9 and 328.0%, respectively. These results proved the importance of using NS to relieve the detrimental effects of Na⁺-derived salinity. This finding could be reinforced by low Na content which was measured in plant tissues after treating seedlings with 300 mg L⁻¹ of NS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaseolus vulgaris 3aabiotic stress 3aagricultural industry 3abeans 3acrops 3airrigation 3ananoparticles 3aplant tissues 3aroots 3asalinity 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashoots 3asilica 3asodium 3asodium chloride 3avigor1 aEl-Ramady, Hassan1 aAlshaal, Tarek1 aEl-Garawani, Mohamed1 aElhawat, Nevien1 aAlmohsen, Mahdi0 tEnvironmental science and pollution research international.g2017 Sept., v. 24, no. 27 p.21917-21928dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0944-13447nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-017-9847-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02412naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002300145245009000168300001800258500002000276520108200296592002801378596008901406650002701495650001301522650001401535650001401549650001401563650002201577650002201599650001301621650001101634650001601645700001901661700002501680700001801705700006001723773013101783856007901914852000901993655001202002IND60749124120221122231525.0210828e202108  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074912412DNAL7 a10.1111/1462-2920.156432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDietrich, Helge M.10aBiochemistry of methanol‐dependent acetogenesis in Eubacterium callanderi KIST612  ap. 4505-4517.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMethanol is the simplest of all alcohols, is universally distributed in anoxic sediments as a result of plant material decomposition and is constantly attracting attention as an interesting substrate for anaerobes like acetogens that can convert bio‐renewable methanol into value‐added chemicals. A major drawback in the development of environmentally friendly but economically attractive biotechnological processes is the present lack of information on biochemistry and bioenergetics during methanol conversion in these bacteria. The mesophilic acetogen Eubacterium callanderi KIST612 is naturally able to consume methanol and produce acetate as well as butyrate. To grasp the full potential of methanol‐based production of chemicals, we analysed the genes and enzymes involved in methanol conversion to acetate and identified the redox carriers involved. We will display a complete model for methanol‐derived acetogenesis and butyrogenesis in Eubacterium callanderi KIST612, tracing the electron transfer routes and shed light on the bioenergetics during the process.  aPublisher supplied data  cEuropean Research Area Cofund on BioTechnologies (ERA CoBioTech; project BIOMETCHEM) 3aEubacterium callanderi 3aacetates 3aacetogens 3aanaerobes 3abutyrates 3aelectron transfer 3aenergy metabolism 3amethanol 3amodels 3avalue added1 aKremp, Florian1 aÖppinger, Christian1 aRibaric, Luna1 aMüller, Volker,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7955-55080 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4505-4517dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.156433Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03205naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012000155520176700275592002802042650001302070650002002083650001902103650001302122650003002135650001202165650001502177650001102192650002002203650002902223650004302252650001502295650002302310650002302333650001702356651001002373700001502383700001702398700001802415700001202433700001302445700003102458700002102489773012902510856007502639852000902714655001202723IND60791087120221119071902.0220826e20220815xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079108712DNAL7 a10.3390/rs141639582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZou, Yuan 10aSpatio-Temporal Changes in Vegetation in the Last Two Decades (2001–2020) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei Region  aIn terrestrial ecosystems, vegetation is sensitive to climate change and human activities. Its spatial-temporal changes also affect the ecological and social environment. In this paper, we considered the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region to study the spatio-temporal vegetation patterns. The detailed analysis of a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were carried out through the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Our results show a slow and tortuous upward trend in the average leaf area index (LAI) in the study region for the periods 2001–2020. Specifically, Beijing had the highest LAI value, with an average of 1.64 over twenty years, followed by Hebei (1.30) and Tianjin (1.04). Among different vegetation types, forests had the highest normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the range of 0.62–0.78, followed by shrubland (0.58–0.75), grassland (0.34–0.66), and cropland (0.38–0.54) over the years. Spatially, compared to the whole study area, index value in the northwestern part of the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region increased greatly in many areas, such as northwest Beijing, Chengde, and Zhangjiakou, indicating a significant ecological optimization. Meanwhile, there was ecological degradation in the middle and southeast regions, from Tangshan southeastward to Handan, crossing Tianjin, Langfang, the east part of Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and the west part of Cangzhou. Air temperature and precipitation were positively and significantly correlated with net primary production (NPP) and precipitation stood out as a key driver. Additionally, an intensification of the urbanization rate will negatively impact the vegetation NPP, with the shrubland and forest being affected most relative to the cropland.  aPublisher supplied data 3aInternet 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acropland 3aenvironmental degradation 3aforests 3agrasslands 3ahumans 3aleaf area index 3anet primary productivity 3anormalized difference vegetation index 3ashrublands 3asocial environment 3aspectroradiometers 3aurbanization 3aChina1 aChen, Wei 1 aLi, Siliang 1 aWang, Tiejun 1 aYu, Le 1 aXu, Min 1 aSingh, R.

However, recent anecdotal evidence suggests that in populations farmed in Singapore, this sex change may be occurring much earlier than previously recorded, thus posing challenges for hatcheries to select and maintain male fish for breeding purposes. This study examined the gonadal sex and maturation status of barramundi from a commercial sea-cage farm located in the southern waters of Singapore and confirmed this precocious sex change phenomenon. Barramundi (n = 173) harvested between 2 and 3 years old were individually measured (mean ± SE); total length (70.3 ± 7.3 cm), weighed (4.7 ± 1.4 kg), and had their gonads dissected for sex identification through histological analyses. Histology showed that only 19 % were still male, 8% were in transitional stages of sex change and 73 % of fish were female. In this precocious farmed population, females as small as 2 kg were found, with the proportion of males in the population decreasing to less than 50 % from 2.5 to 3 kg (55∼60 cm). Above 3 kg and 5 kg, 70 % and 90 % of sampled individuals were females, respectively. Comparative farm studies from French Polynesia and in wild Australian stocks indicate that the farmed population in our study is changing sex at body weights approximately half that of what was previously known. The findings of this study are important for local breeders to make decisions of when, and at what size to select candidate L. calcarifer broodstock in Singaporean waters so that the recommended 2:1 male-to-female spawning ratio can be achieved. The exact causes for this early sex change are still unknown and deserve further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLates calcarifer 3aSingapore 3abreeding stock 3afarms 3afemales 3afish 3agonads 3ahistology 3amales 3aprotandry 3asex reversal 3aFrench Polynesia 0aAsian seabass 0aProtandry 0aPrecocious sex change 0aBreeding 0aAquaculture1 aDomingos, Jose A.1 aUichanco, Joseph Angelo1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3137-50861 aMonteil, Yann1 aMonteil, Loïc1 aDe Braux, Emmanuel1 aBanh, Quyen Q.T.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2636-35341 aGibson-Kueh, Susan1 aJerry, Dean R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3735-17980 tAquaculture reports.g2021 July, v. 20 p.100712-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:23215x2352-51347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.1007123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02862naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245013800173300001800311520170900329592002802038650001902066650002002085650000902105650001302114650001702127650001302144650001202157650001402169650001602183700001902199700001802218700001802236700001702254773011902271856008902390852000902479655001202488IND60563391820221118053938.0170216e20170216xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056339182DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b021682doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuan, Tian-Hong10aExperimental Study of Coal Pyrolysis under the Simulated High-Temperature and High-Stress Conditions of Underground Coal Gasification  ap. 1147-1158.  aCoal pyrolysis under high-temperature and high-stress conditions was studied experimentally in this work. Which experimental table should be chosen was studied, and parameter settings such as the final pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, and stresses were investigated. Pyrolysis experiments of Xinglongzhuang gas coal and Huating long-flame coal were conducted using an improved Paterson gas-medium high-pressure and high-temperature testing (Paterson HPT) system at temperatures of up to 1000 °C and under different stresses conditions. The results were compared to those of coal pyrolysis experiments without any stress and using a GR.TF80/11 tube furnace. The average heating rates used in these experiments were as low as 0.44 K/min. The produced gas and semicoke (coke) yields both increased with increasing stress, while the tar yield decreased. However, the variations in the yields of the pyrolysis products induced by the same increase in stress gradually decreased as the stress increased and nearly reached a peak at approximately 750 °C. The concentrations of CH₄ and CO₂ in the pyrolysis gas gradually increased with increasing stress, while the H₂ and CO concentrations gradually decreased. Regarding the variations in H₂, CO, CH₄, and CO₂, the Huating coal displayed significantly more variations than the Xinglongzhuang coal for the same increase in stress, indicating its higher sensitivity. The variation curve for each gas component under each stress state was similar to the corresponding curve in the stress-free state, indicating that temperature is a dominant factor in coal pyrolysis and that the effects of stress-induced secondary reactions are relatively small.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3acoal 3afurnaces 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3amethane 3apyrolysis 3atemperature1 aWang, Zuo-Tang1 aLiu, Zhen-Jia1 aChen, Ya-Zhou1 aFu, Zhen-Bin0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Feb. 16, v. 31, no. 2 p.1147-1158dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23338x1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b021683Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02854naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245012300164300001400287520135300301592002801654650001301682650001301695650002001708650002901728650001901757650001501776650001501791650001201806650002301818650001101841650001201852650000901864650000901873650001201882653001201894653001501906653002401921653002001945653002401965653002901989700003602018700001802054700001902072700001702091700001402108773012202122856008302244852000902327655001202336IND60525468720221122012910.0190318e20160501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052546872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agee.2016.02.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Yeonuk10aInterannual variations in methane emission from an irrigated rice paddy caused by rainfalls during the aeration period  ap. 67-75.  aMid-season drainage (MSD) decreases methane emission from an irrigated rice paddy. For this reason, the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and several methane estimation models consider MSD as a static input factor. However, if rainfall occurs during the MSD period, the reduction effect on methane emission may become small. In this paper, we report the methane emission from an intermittently irrigated rice paddy with MSD for three growing seasons. Methane flux was measured using eddy covariance technique with an open-path methane analyzer. Our objective is to ascertain the seasonal and interannual variations in methane emission caused by rainfalls during the MSD period. The growing season (from June to Oct.) methane emission during the three year study period ranged from 198 to 450kg CH4 ha−1, showing significant interannual variability with changes in rainfall during the MSD period. In order to implement the effect of rainfall during the MSD on methane emission (not considered in the IPCC method), we developed a simple method for a scaling factor. The estimated and the observed CH4 emissions agreed within 40%, and additional consideration of soil pH further improved the agreement within 10%. These results suggest that the rainfall effect should be considered when estimating national or global methane emission from irrigated rice paddies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3adrainage 3aeddy covariance 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3agrowing season 3aguidelines 3airrigation 3amethane 3amethane production 3amodels 3apaddies 3arain 3arice 3asoil pH 0aMethane 0aRice paddy 0aMid-season drainage 0aEddy covariance 0aIPCC scaling factor 0aGreenhouse Gas Inventory1 aTalucder, Mohammad Samiul Ahsan1 aKang, Minseok1 aShim, Kyo-Moon1 aKang, Namgoo1 aKim, Joon0 tAgriculture, ecosystems & environment.g2016 May 01, v. 223 p.67-75dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl34709x0167-88097nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agee.2016.02.0323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02831naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245012200164300001300286500001900299520162200318592002801940650001301968650001401981650001601995650001402011650002202025651001002047653001902057653001602076653001302092653002402105653001202129700001602141700001302157700001602170700001902186700002002205773009302225856008202318852000902400655001202409IND60698703320221118053720.0210303e20191205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069870332DNAL7 a10.3897/mycokeys.61.464462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Xiao-Lan10aDescriptions of five new species in Entoloma subgenus Claudopus from China, with molecular phylogeny of Entoloma s.l.  ap. 1-26.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aEntolomasubgenusClaudopus is widely distributed, yet the taxonomy and systematics of its species are still poorly documented. In the present study, more than forty collections of Claudopus were gathered in China and subsequently analysed, based on morphological and molecular data. The results revealed first a high level of species diversity of Claudopus in China and second, there is a wide ecological range regarding the substrates and the habitats ranging from temperate, tropical to subalpine locations. Based on morphological and molecular evidence, five novel species from China are proposed, viz. E. conchatum, E. flabellatum, E. gregarium, E. pleurotoides and E. reductum. Molecular phylogeny of Entoloma s.l. was also reconstructed, based on 187 representatives of Entoloma s.l. by employing the combined ITS, LSU, mtSSU and RPB2 sequences. Ten monophyletic clades (Claudopus, Leptonia, Nolanea, Cuboid-spored Inocephalus, “Alboleptonia”, Cyanula, Pouzarella, Rhodopolia, Prunuloides and Rusticoides) were recovered, while 13 taxa could not be placed in any defined clades. The results confirmed that Claudopus in a traditional morphological sense is not monophyletic and the Rusticoides-group, previously considered within Claudopus, formed a separate clade; but section Claudopus and relatives of E. undatum belong to a distinctive monophyletic group. Despite some monophyletic groups in Entoloma s.l. being distinctive in both morphology and molecular phylogeny, they were still treated as subgenera of Entoloma s.l. temporarily, because accepting them as genera will make Entoloma s.l. paraphyletic.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEntoloma 3amonophyly 3anew species 3aparaphyly 3aspecies diversity 3aChina 0aEntolomataceae 0asystematics 0ataxonomy 0amulti-gene analyses 0aecology1 aHorak, Egon1 aWang, Di1 aLi, Tai-Hui1 aPeng, Wei-Hong1 aGan, Bing-Cheng0 tMycoKeys.g2019 Dec. 05, v. 61 p.1-26dPensoft PublisherswJournal:2143x1314-40497nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3897/mycokeys.61.464463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02215naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245013000172520114500302592002801447650002201475650002201497650001101519650001001530650001601540653003501556653002901591653001201620653001901632653001201651700003101663773008901694856008501783852000901868655001201877IND60727622820221119155820.0210415e20210515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072762282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2021.1199852doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSricharan, V.V.S.10aTime-domain analysis of a bean-shaped multi-body floating wave energy converter with a hydraulic power take-off using WEC-Sim  aA novel floating wave energy converter (BFWEC) with multiple ‘bean shape’ floats and a hydraulic power-take-off system (HPTO) is presented. The overall setup consists of a central buoy (C·B.) connected to a set of floats around it using a lever arm and is position restrained using a taut-mooring system. Three configurations of BFWEC are proposed with four, six, and eight number of floats. A detailed numerical analysis is carried out by modeling the device in a time-domain using an open-source code: WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter Simulator), assuming potential wave theory (PWT). By incorporating HPTO to all the three configurations, simulations are performed in monochromatic waves. Appropriate parameters of HPTO components for each configuration are estimated for the maximum capture width of BFWEC. The effect of the HPTO damping coefficient in maximizing the output of BFWEC is also assessed. Despite the dimensions of BFWEC tailored to the shallow-intermediate Indian waters, the device is simulated with extreme wave characteristics to test its conversion characteristics under the wave conditions away from the resonance.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3ahydraulic systems 3amodels 3awater 3awater power 0aFloating wave energy converter 0aHydraulic power take-off 0aWEC-Sim 0aMulti-body WEC 0aPTO-Sim1 aChandrasekaran, Srinivasan0 tEnergy.g2021 May 15, v. 223 p.119985-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.1199853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03197naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011000169300001800279500002000297500000900317520153700326592002801863596004101891596004301932596002901975596005902004596006102063650001302124650000902137650001302146650002002159650001302179650001302192650001602205650001202221650001102233650001402244650001902258650001702277650001502294700002402309700002402333700003802357700003102395700002702426773013302453856008402586852000902670655001202679IND60665252120221122233327.0220805e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525212DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci2017.07.04592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGalli, Giovanni10aImpact of Phenotypic Correction Method and Missing Phenotypic Data on Genomic Prediction of Maize Hybrids  ap. 1481-1491.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aepub  aPhenotypic datasets in plant breeding are commonly incomplete due to missing phenotypic information. The best approach for correcting these datasets for a stage‐wise genomic prediction (GP) is not unanimous in the scientific community. Therefore, this study evaluates a two‐step GP based on different methods of phenotypic correction considering complete and incomplete datasets of maize (Zea mays L.) single crosses. The dataset consists of 325 hybrids evaluated for grain yield and plant height in four sites. Sequential levels of data loss were simulated to the original dataset (from 0 to 30%) to assess the impact of missing information. The prediction was performed by an additive genomic best linear unbiased prediction model (GBLUP) using best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs), best linear unbiased predictions (BLUPs), and deregressed BLUPs as the response variable. Mean reliability and predictive ability slightly decreased as missing phenotypic information increased, irrespective of the response variable. Regarding phenotypic correction, all methods yielded similar results for these parameters over most missing information percentages. The coincidence of selection between single‐ and two‐stage GP was not systematically affected by response variable across multiple selection intensities, and missing data only led to a minor decrease in coincidence. Therefore, from a breeding standpoint, regardless of phenotypic correction method and missing data level, a similar set of genotypes tend to be selected.  aPublisher supplied data  cAllogamous Plant Breeding Laboratory  cLuiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture  cUniversity of São Paulo  cNacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico  cFundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo 3aZea mays 3acorn 3acrossing 3adata collection 3agenomics 3agenotype 3agrain yield 3ahybrids 3amodels 3aphenotype 3aplant breeding 3aplant height 3aprediction1 aLyra, Danilo Hottis1 aAlves, Filipe Couto1 aGranato, Ítalo Stefanine Correia1 ae Sousa, Massaine Bandeira1 aFritsche-Neto, Roberto0 tCrop science.g2018 July, v. 58, no. 4 p.1481-1491dThe Crop Science Society of America, Inc.wJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.07.04593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02680naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004300094040001800137100001500155245015700170300001400327520122700341592002801568650001801596650001901614650001601633650004501649650001401694650001801708650001201726650003301738650002701771650002401798650001701822650002001839651001001859653000901869653001301878653001001891653001701901700001401918700001501932700001401947700001501961700001301976773011001989856009002099852000902189655001202198IND60532542720221117202606.0190405e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053254272DNAL7 a10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.11.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, X.M.10aSerum hormone concentrations and ovarian follicular wave emergence in Jilin sika deer (Cervus nippon hortulorum) after synchronization of estrous cycles  ap. 44-49.  aThe study was conducted to investigate the serum hormone concentrations and follicular dynamics present after synchronous treatment (CIDR) in female Jilin sika deer (n=15) of estrous cycles. Blood samples were collected to analyze the FSH, LH, estradiol and progesterone during the estrous cycles. Manual transrectal ultrasonography examination was conducted at least thrice weekly to monitor the follicular wave. Ultrasonography showed that follicle development occurred in waves, and most estrous cycles in Jilin sika deer consist of one, two, or three waves. The largest follicles of the interwaves of two- and three-wave cycles were different (P<0.05). The mean interovulatory interval was 15.0±4.6d. There was a surge in circulating FSH in two- and three-wave cycles. The emergence of the largest follicle was related to the peak of serum concentration of estradiol. Serum progesterone concentrations were not different between one- and three-wave cycles (P<0.05). We concluded that FSH and estradiol concentration may have an important role in controlling follicular development, that the estrous cycle in Jilin sika deer is characterized by one, two, or three waves of follicular development after synchronization.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCervus nippon 3ablood sampling 3ablood serum 3acontrolled internal drug release devices 3aestradiol 3aestrous cycle 3afemales 3afollicle-stimulating hormone 3afollicular development 3aluteinizing hormone 3aprogesterone 3aultrasonography 3aChina 0aDeer 0aFollicle 0aOvary 0aReproduction1 aWei, H.J.1 aYang, Y.F.1 aXue, H.L.1 aZhao, W.G.1 aZhao, M.0 tAnimal reproduction science.g2015 Feb., v. 153 p.44-49dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl11636x0378-43207nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anireprosci.2014.11.0173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02120naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024005100094040001800145100001700163245007100180300001600251500000900267520112900276592002801405650002101433650002001454650001101474650001401485650001101499650001501510650002401525700001701549773012101566856009801687852000901785655001201794IND60665252220221122233216.0191122e196609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066525222DNAL7 a10.2135/cropsci1966.0011183X000600050032x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDavis, R.

Bacillus toyonensis is widely used as a probiotic in animal feed. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of B. toyonensis administration on the immune response to an experimental recombinant vaccine against bovine herpesvirus type 5 (BoHV-5) in mice. Mice were vaccinated with BoHV-5 recombinant glycoprotein D and supplemented with the probiotic B. toyonensis in two regimes: one group received the probiotic only during seven days prior to the initial vaccination while the second group was given the probiotic throughout the experimental period of seven weeks. Animals supplemented with probiotic B. toyonensis in two regimes showed an increase in total immunoglobulin (Ig)G, IgG1 and IgG2a levels in serum, in addition to higher titres of antibodies capable of neutralising the BoHV-5 virus than non-supplemented animals (P<0.05). Splenocytes from the supplemented mice had higher mRNA transcription levels of cytokines interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-12. These results show that the use of this probiotic may significantly contribute to the response elicited by recombinant vaccines, especially those that rely on increasing antibody and cell-mediated immune responses for efficacy. Further, the data support an immunomodulatory effect for probiotic B. toyonensis and imply that enhance effect on the immune response against a BoHV-5 recombinant vaccine in mice.  aPublisher supplied data 0aprobiotic 0aimmunomodulation 0arecombinant vaccine1 aMenegon, Y.A.1 aPiraine, R.E.A.1 aRodrigues, P.R.C.1 aCunha, R.C.1 aLeite, F.P.

The understanding of the ecological roles of actinobacteria has significantly improved in the past decades, but a systematic insight into the interactions between actinobacteria and other microbes in nature is warranted. Here, we studied the pairwise effects of actinobacteria on other microbes isolated from red soils under different nutritional conditions. We found that neutral effects dominated the interactions, accounting for 68.1% of the interactions in eutrophic conditions and for a significantly higher proportion (86.2%) in oligotrophic conditions. High nutrient levels boosted active metabolism of actinobacteria and generally made them more aggressive, supporting the stress gradient hypothesis. The secondary metabolites produced by actinobacteria played a pivotal role in interference competition with other microbes, of which the role of desferrioxamine siderophores could not be ignored. Niche overlap seemed to be another cause of competition, notably under oligotrophic conditions. Moreover, the large‐scale phylogeny had a much greater impact on the interaction than the location origin of the microbes. These results provide an understanding of the coexistence of actinobacteria with other microbes in nature and suggest neutrality as a key mechanism for maintaining microbial diversity in soils.  aPublisher supplied data  a81773615cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31700008cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a31670502cNational Natural Science Foundation of China 3aActinobacteria 3adeferoxamine 3aeutrophication 3ametabolism 3aphylogeny 3asecondary metabolites 3asiderophores 3asoil1 aLiu, Ning1 aLiu, Minghao1 aDu, Xueyuan1 aShang, Fei1 aHuang, Ying1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7559-70700 tEnvironmental microbiology.g2021 Aug., v. 23, no. 8 p.4126-4140dJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.wJournal:jnl3867075x1462-29127nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.154833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02672naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006400148245015700212300002000369520137300389592002801762650002401790650001001814650001701824650002201841650001601863650002501879650001801904650001501922651000901937700001701946700002101963700002801984700001602012700001902028773014802047856008202195852000902277655001202286IND60746343220221120091349.0210731e202109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074634322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10668-021-01223-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKelly, Bokary Allaye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1132-706310aRestoring vegetation and degraded lands by using assisted natural regeneration approach (ANRA): case study at Bankass in the centre of Mali, West Africa  ap. 14123-14139.  aAssisted natural regeneration approach was experimented in the Sahel region in the aim of restoring land and vegetation in accordance with the global objectives of the Great Green Wall for the Sahara and the Sahel Initiative.

The height, the diameter at the basis and the diameter at 1.30 m above the ground were measured from 2015 to 2017 at Endé and from 2016 to 2017 at Soula Kanda in November/December each year. For each treatment, thirty shoots were monitored and data were analysed using the software SYSTAT9 FOR WINDOWS. At Endé, the survival rate was 93%. At Soula Kanda, the survival rate of assisted shoots was 97% against 73% for the control. At Endé as well as at Soula Kanda, dead shoots were cut by farmers. The current annual increments at Endé were 44 cm year⁻¹ for height and 1.27 cm year⁻¹ for the diameter at 1.30 m above the ground. At Soula Kanda, the current annual increment for height was the same for the two treatments (20 cm year⁻¹).  aPublisher supplied data 3aGuiera senegalensis 3aSahel 3acase studies 3acomputer software 3aenvironment 3anatural regeneration 3asurvival rate 3avegetation 3aMali1 aSanogo, Sidi1 aSidibé, Sory I.1 aCastillo-Lorenzo, Elena1 aCeci, Paolo1 aUlian, Tiziana0 tEnvironment, development and sustainability.g2021 Sept., v. 23, no. 9 p.14123-14139dSpringer NetherlandswJournal:jnl3870050x1387-585X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-021-01223-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03215naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094024002200132024001900154040001800173100001800191245020300209300001600412506007600428520171200504592002802216506003702244650001602281650001202297650002202309650001802331650003402349650004302383650001202426650002202438650004402460650001302504700002102517700001402538700002302552700001802575773009502593856008402688852000902772655001202781IND60112963220221207073312.0141111e20120511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296322DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0402doi7 aPMC33277972pmcid7 a224751852pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWeisz, Adrian10aPreparation of two novel monobrominated 2-(2′,4′-dihydroxybenzoyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzoic acids and their separation from crude synthetic mixtures using vortex counter-current chromatography  ap. 106-114.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe present work describes the preparation of two compounds considered to be likely precursors of an impurity present in samples of the color additives D&C Red No. 27 (Color Index 45410:1) and D&C Red No. 28 (Color Index 45410, phloxine B) submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for batch certification. The two compounds, 2-(2′,4′-dihydroxy-3′-bromobenzoyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzoic acid (3BrHBBA) and its 5′-brominated positional isomer (5BrHBBA), both not reported previously, were separated from synthetic mixtures by vortex counter-current chromatography (VCCC). 3BrHBBA was prepared by chemoselective ortho-bromination of the dihydroxybenzoyl moiety. Two portions of the obtained synthetic mixture, 200mg and 210mg, respectively, were separated by VCCC using two two-phase solvent systems that consisted of hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–aqueous 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in the volume ratios of 8:2:5:5 and 7:3:5:5, respectively. These separations produced 35mg and 78mg of 3BrHBBA, respectively, each product of over 98% purity by HPLC at 254nm. 5BrHBBA was prepared by monobromination of the dihydroxybenzoyl moiety in the presence of glacial acetic acid. To separate the obtained synthetic mixture, VCCC was performed in the pH-zone-refining mode with a solvent system consisting of hexane–ethyl acetate–methanol–water (6:4:5:5, v/v) and with TFA used as the retainer acid and aqueous ammonia as the eluent base. Separation of a 1-g mixture under these conditions resulted in 142mg of 5BrHBBA of ∼99% purity by HPLC at 254nm. The isolated compounds were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacetic acid 3aammonia 3aartificial colors 3acertification 3acountercurrent chromatography 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aisomers 3amass spectrometry 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asolvents1 aWitten, Jacob J.1 aZeng, Yun1 aMazzola, Eugene P.1 aIto, Yoichiro0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 11, v. 1237 p.106-114dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03299naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024004000113040001800153100001500171245010700186300001600293520165200309592002801961650001501989650002402004650002102028650002102049650002202070650002402092650002002116650001002136650001202146650001802158650001502176650001202191650004202203650002102245650007202266650004302338650001602381650001402397650002102411653001202432653001002444653001602454653002002470653000902490700002502499700001902524773011802543856008702661852000902748655001202757IND60112349120221122061357.0190318e201307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011234912DNAL7 a236653342pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.04.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUryu, Outa14aThe clock gene cycle plays an important role in the circadian clock of the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus  ap. 697-704.  aTo dissect the molecular oscillatory mechanism of the circadian clock in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, we have cloned a cDNA of the clock gene cycle (Gb’cyc) and analyzed its structure and function. Gb’cyc contains four functional domains, i.e. bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B and BCTR domains, and is expressed rhythmically in light dark cycles, peaking at mid night. The RNA interference (RNAi) of Clock (Gb’Clk) and period (Gb’per) reduced the Gb’cyc mRNA levels and abolished the rhythmic expression, suggesting that the rhythmic expression of Gb’cyc is regulated by a mechanism including Gb’Clk and Gb’per. These features are more similar to those of mammalian orthologue of cyc (Bmal1) than those of Drosophila cyc. A single treatment with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of Gb’cyc effectively knocked down the Gb’cyc mRNA level and abolished its rhythmic expression. The cyc RNAi failed to disrupt the locomotor rhythm, but lengthened its free-running period in constant darkness (DD). It is thus likely that Gb’cyc is involved in the circadian clock machinery of the cricket. The cyc RNAi crickets showed a rhythmic expression of Gb’per and timeless (Gb’tim) in the optic lobe in DD, explaining the persistence of the locomotor rhythm. Surprisingly, cyc RNAi revealed a rhythmic expression of Gb’Clk in DD which is otherwise rather constitutively expressed in the optic lobe. These facts suggest that the cricket might have a unique clock oscillatory mechanism in which both Gb’cyc and Gb’Clk are rhythmically controlled and that under abundant expression of Gb’cyc the rhythmic expression of Gb’Clk may be concealed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDrosophila 3aGryllus bimaculatus 3aRNA interference 3acircadian rhythm 3acomplementary DNA 3adouble-stranded RNA 3agene expression 3agenes 3amammals 3amessenger RNA 3aoptic lobe 2aAnimals 2aCLOCK Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCircadian Clocks 2aGryllidaexclassificationxgeneticsxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aInsect Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPhotoperiod 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA Interference 0aCricket 0aCycle 0aClock genes 0aCircadian clock 0aRNAi1 aKarpova, Svetlana G.1 aTomioka, Kenji0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2013 July, v. 59, no. 7 p.697-704dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl45772x0022-19107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2013.04.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100002200142245009400164300001600258520151000274592002801784650002101812650001901833650001201852650001601864650001001880650001101890650001201901650001001913650001201923650001101935650001001946650001401956651001701970653002101987653002402008653001502032653001302047653001902060700002402079700002502103700002602128773010602154856007802260961001202338852000902350655001202359IND60129148620221120075549.0151124e201504  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012914862DNAL7 a10.3375/043.035.02022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrose, Patrick H.10aFire History Reflects Human History in the Pine Creek Gorge of North-Central Pennsylvania  ap. 214-223.  aFire history studies are important tools for understanding past fire regimes and the roles humans played in those regimes. Beginning in 2010, we conducted a fire history study in the Pine Creek Gorge area of north-central Pennsylvania to ascertain the number of fires and fire-free intervals, their variability through time, and the role of human influences. We collected 93 cross sections from fire-scarred red pine (Pinus resinosa) snags, stumps, and living trees at three separate sites along the western rim of Pine Creek Gorge. From these, we found 79 fire years and 11 multidecadal fire-free intervals between 1600 and 2010. The three fire histories were quite synchronous; their fire years and fire-free periods mirrored one another despite being 12 to 14 km apart. Before 1791, fires were rare, suggesting a low population of American Indians and (or) little woodland burning by the tribes. A prolonged fire-free interval from 1650 to 1735 coincided with the Beaver Wars and the introduction of European diseases. Another fire-free period coincided with the American Revolutionary War. After that, fires became quite common with nearly all of them occurring within the next 125 years while Pine Creek Gorge was intensively logged. Since logging ended and fire control started in the 1910s, fires have been virtually absent from the three sites. Based on the fire and human histories, we conclude that human activities and culture are the driving forces behind the fire regimes of Pine Creek Gorge.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAmerican Indians 3aPinus resinosa 3aburning 3afire regime 3afires 3ahumans 3alogging 3asnags 3astreams 3astumps 3atrees 3awoodlands 3aPennsylvania 0adendrochronology 0aEuropean settlement 0afire scars 0aIroquois 0aPinus resinosa1 aGuyette, Richard P.1 aMarschall, Joseph M.1 aStambaugh, Michael C.0 tNatural areas journal.g2015 Apr., v. 35, no. 2 p.214-223dNatural Areas Associationx0885-86087nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3375%2F043.035.02023Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/FS  aDNAL 7aarticle02509naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245009500168300001600263520127900279592002801558650001901586650002401605650002501629650001301654650001401667650001401681650002601695650001301721650001401734650002401748650001401772650001101786650001301797650001701810650001201827651001201839700002201851700002301873773008601896856008401982852000902066655001202075IND60549238320221118110907.0160907e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054923832DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-09-14-0907-RE2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMangandi, Jozer10aIdentifying Resistance to Crown Rot Caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in Strawberry  ap. 954-961.  aResistance to Colletotrichum crown rot (CCR, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) among commercial strawberry cultivars is variable, and increasing host resistance is a goal of the strawberry breeding program at the University of Florida. Twenty-eight accessions of Fragaria virginiana and F. chiloensis, the progenitor species of the cultivated strawberry (F. × ananassa), were evaluated for CCR resistance on artificially inoculated plants in a field trial, along with cultivars and breeding selections. Accessions PI 612320, PI 612323, and PI 551736 and selections FL 10-128 and FL 10-129 had no mortality in either of two seasons. The most susceptible genotypes had mortality between 75 and 100%. In a separate growth-chamber evaluation, seven genotypes were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension onto the crown or by injecting the suspension directly into the crown tissues. Mortality was higher using the injection method but the ranking of the genotypes was similar for both methods, indicating that resistance is expressed within crown tissues. Among the seven genotypes, selections FL 10-128 and FL 10-129 had the lowest mortality regardless of inoculation method, illustrating that a high level of resistance can be found within the cultivated germplasm.  aPublisher supplied data 3aColletotrichum 3aFragaria virginiana 3aGlomerella cingulata 3abreeding 3acrown rot 3acultivars 3afield experimentation 3agenotype 3agermplasm 3ainoculation methods 3amortality 3aspores 3aspraying 3astrawberries 3atissues 3aFlorida1 aPeres, Natalia A.1 aWhitaker, Vance M.0 tPlant disease.g2015 July, v. 99, no. 7 p.954-961dPlant Diseasex0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094%2FPDIS-09-14-0907-RE3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001600153245010000169300001600269520114300285592002801428650001501456650002001471650001301491650001001504650001101514653001101525653001501536653003001551653001601581653001001597653001801607653002201625700006301647700001801710773020701728856008801935852000902023655001202032IND60698602320221122123849.0200719e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069860232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.05.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Hanxian12aA multiclass TrAdaBoost transfer learning algorithm for the classification of mobile lidar data  ap. 118-127.  aA major challenge in the application of state-of-the-art deep learning methods to the classification of mobile lidar data is the lack of sufficient training samples for different object categories. The transfer learning technique based on pre-trained networks, which is widely used in deep learning for image classification, is not directly applicable to point clouds, because pre-trained networks trained by a large number of samples from multiple sources are not available. To solve this problem, we design a framework incorporating a state-of-the-art deep learning network, i.e. VoxNet, and propose an extended Multiclass TrAdaBoost algorithm, which can be trained with complementary training samples from other source datasets to improve the classification accuracy in the target domain. In this framework, we first train the VoxNet model with the combined dataset and extract the feature vectors from the fully connected layer, and then use these to train the Multiclass TrAdaBoost. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves both improvement in the overall accuracy and a more balanced performance in each category.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3adata collection 3alearning 3alidar 3amodels 0aVoxNet 0aTrAdaBoost 0aMulticlass classification 0aPoint Cloud 0a3DCNN 0aDeep learning 0aTransfer learning1 aKhoshelham, Kourosh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6639-17271 aFraser, Clive0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Aug., v. 166 p.118-127dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this study, we report a matrix-induced ion suppression (MIIS)-based method to normalize concentration using flow injection analysis coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (FIA-ESI-MS). An ion suppression indicator (ISI) was spiked into urine samples, and the intensity of the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) for ISI in a urine matrix was subtracted by the EIC for a blank solution and used to calculate the extent to which the signal was reduced by the urine matrix. A series dilution of pooled urine samples was used to correlate the urine concentration and level of ion suppression for ISI. A regression equation was used to estimate the relative concentration of unknown urine samples. The MIIS method was validated for linearity, precision and accuracy. We obtained a good correlation using a quadratic regression model for 1- to 32-fold urine dilutions (R2=0.998). The reproducibility (n=4) and intermediate precision (n=3) were below 5% RSD, and the accuracy ranged from 97.15% to 102.10%. The established method was used to estimate the relative concentrations of 16 urine samples, and the results were compared with commonly used normalization methods. Pearson’s correlation test was used to demonstrate that the MIIS method correlated highly with the creatinine and osmolarity methods; the correlation coefficients were 0.93 and 0.99, respectively. We successfully applied this method to a urinary metabolomics study on breast cancer. This study demonstrated the MIIS method is simple, accurate and can contribute to data integrity in urinary metabolomics studies.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3abreast neoplasms 3acorrelation 3acreatinine 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3aequations 3aflow injection analysis 3ametabolomics 3aosmolarity 3aregression analysis 3aurine 0aUrinary metabolomics 0aNormalization 0aFlow injection analysis-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry 0aMatrix-induced ion suppression 0aBreast cancer1 aLiao, Hsiao-wei1 aTseng, Yufeng Jane1 aTsai, I-lin1 aKuo, Ching-hua0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Mar. 15, v. 864 p.21-29dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02116naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245006300155300001600218520133100234592002801565650001501593650001301608650001201621650001301633650001601646773009601662856007101758852000901829655001201838IND60518554320221118225841.0160418e197207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855432DNAL7 a10.2307/19347842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPielou, E.

Observations on the numbers of occurrences of the animals in the habitats can be tabulated in an r ° c table. The overall "diversity" of the table, HT say, is defined as Brillouin's information measure with the r ° c table's cell frequencies of the different "symbols." It is shown that HT may be split into two components in two different ways. The first way splits HT into HA, the diversity of the animal species, plus the weight mean of the within—species habitat diversities. The second way splits HT into HB, the diversity of the habitats, plus the weighted mean of the within—habitat species diversities. The weighted mean of within—species habitat diversities constitutes a measure of the average niche width of the r species of animals. The weighted mean of within—habitat species diversities constitutes a measure of the average niche overlap among the c habitats examined. The measures are of actual, realized niche widths and niche overlaps and are therefore inevitably affected by the relative abundances of the species and the habitats. A method of standardizing them is proposed. An example is given using data on the occurrences of several species of aphids on several host plants of the genus Solidago (goldenrods).  aPublisher supplied data 3aAphidoidea 3aSolidago 3aanimals 3ahabitats 3ahost plants0 tEcology.g1972 July, v. 53, no. 4 p.687-692dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19347843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02986naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245005000169300001600219520162500235592002801860650002301888650001601911650002101927650001901948650000901967650001901976650001301995650001202008650001102020650001102031650001702042650001802059650002102077650002202098651001302120653002102133653001702154653001302171653002102184653001402205653001602219700002502235700002302260700002402283773011302307856005102420852000902471655001202480IND50088371920221121231930.0140414e20110601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008837192DNAL7 a10.1080/07438141.2011.5837132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJones, John R.10aTemperature and oxygen in Missouri reservoirs  ap. 173-182.  aVertical profiles of water temperature (n = 7193) and dissolved oxygen (n = 6516) were collected from 235 Missouri reservoirs during 1989–2007; most data were collected during May–August and provide a regional summary of summer conditions. Collectively, surface water temperature ranged from a mean of ∼22 C in May to ∼28 C in July, and individual summer maxima typically were 28–32 C. Most (∼95%) reservoirs stably stratify by mid-May, but few are deep enough to have hypolimnia with near-uniform temperatures. Among stratified reservoirs, maximum effective length and maximum depth accounted for 75% of the variation in mixed depth and thermocline depth. Ephemeral, near-surface thermoclines occurred in ∼39% of summer profiles and were most frequent in small, turbid reservoirs. Isotherms below the mixed layer deepen during stratification, and the water column is >20 C by August in all but the deepest reservoirs. Most reservoirs showed incipient dissolved oxygen (DO) depletion by mid-May, and by August, 80% of profiles had DO minima of <1 mg/L. Surface area and chlorophyll (Chl) explained 37% of variation in the earliest date of anoxia, and Chl explained >50% of variation in DO below the mixed layer during summer. Warm summer temperatures and widespread low DO often limit available fish habitat in Missouri reservoirs and compress warm-water fish communities into subsurface layers that exceed their thermal preferences. This study provides a regional baseline of reservoir temperature and oxygen conditions useful for future evaluations of eutrophication and the effects of a warming climate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal communities 3achlorophyll 3adissolved oxygen 3aeutrophication 3afish 3aglobal warming 3ahabitats 3ahypoxia 3aoxygen 3asummer 3asurface area 3asurface water 3awater reservoirs 3awater temperature 3aMissouri 0adissolved oxygen 0afish habitat 0aMissouri 0aoxygen depletion 0areservoir 0atemperature1 aKnowlton, Matthew F.1 aObrecht, Daniel V.1 aGraham, Jennifer L.0 tLake and reservoir management.g2011 June 1, v. 27, no. 2 p.173-182dTaylor & Francis Groupx2151-55307nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07438141.2011.583713  aDNAL 7aarticle03762naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003100150245013000181500001900311520234400330592002802674650001302702650001902715650002102734650002102755650002402776650001102800650002402811650001902835650001702854650001202871650001102883653003202894653001602926653002202942653002802964700002802992700003803020700003503058700002803093773010103121856008503222852000903307655001203316IND60709533820221119024417.0201115e202011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070953382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1042442doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPacheco, Verônica Madeira10aThermal imaging combined with predictive machine learning based model for the development of thermal stress level classifiers  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThermal stress in dairy cows has been studied to improve production efficiency and animal welfare. Several authors have verified the potential of infrared thermography (IRT) as noninvasive tool for monitoring the surface temperature of animals. In this study, machine learning-based models for the individual assessment of thermal stress levels in dairy cows (Holstein) were established and evaluated considering both weather and animal factors. An experiment was performed with 26 lactating cows, which were monitored during summer and winter (40 nonconsecutive days in total; three times a day) to acquire the weather and physiological data including the rectal temperature (RT), respiration rate (RR), and body surface temperature (BST), measured by IRT in different body area. The data were analyzed with the Pearson correlation coefficient to determine the ideal body part (front, ocular area, rib, and flank regions) for computational modeling. In addition, a data analysis with linear regression was performed to enhance the parameters choices. The models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed based on the defined weather and physiological variables. The ANN-based models for predicting the RR (ANN-RR) and RT (ANN-RT) were established with Perceptron, feedforward, and multi-layered architectures. The model responses were used as classifiers for the thermal stress levels (comfort, alert, danger, and emergency). The classification efficiency was assessed with metrics extracted from the confusion matrices (accuracy) and compared with the results of traditional classification methods for thermal stress levels: the Temperature–Humidity Index (THI) and Black Globe-Humidity Index (BGHI). The ANN models provided better predictions of the RR and RT with coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.74 (ANN-RR) and 0.71 (ANN-RT) than the linear regression models. With regard to thermal stress levels, the ANN-based models demonstrated a good predictive ability compared with the BGHI and THI classifications. The best thermal stress accuracy predictions with ANN-RR and ANN-RT were 83% and 84%, respectively; the best accuracies of the BGHI- and THI-based classifiers were 68% and 55%, respectively. In addition, the ANN-based classifier enables an individual assessment of the thermal stress levels of animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHolstein 3aanimal welfare 3abody temperature 3acell respiration 3aregression analysis 3asummer 3asurface temperature 3athermal stress 3athermography 3aweather 3awinter 0aPrecision livestock farming 0aData mining 0aThermal radiation 0aNoninvasive measurement1 aSousa, Rafael Vieira de1 aRodrigues, Alex Vinicius da Silva1 aSardinha, Edson José de Souza1 aMartello, Luciane Silva0 tLivestock science.g2020 Nov., v. 241 p.104244-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl5113x1871-14137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.livsci.2020.1042443Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02719naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245015800165300001800323520169300341592002802034653002302062653002202085653001602107653001502123653001402138700001802152773016902170856008102339852000902420655001202429IND60651142220221119173249.0190711e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065114222DNAL7 a10.1017/S00253154170014972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorton, Brian14aThe biology and functional morphology of Mytilaster minimus (Bivalvia: Mytiloidea: Mytilidae) from the intertidal dinaric karst of Croatia (Adriatic Sea)  ap. 1999-2016.  aMytilaster minimus is widely distributed along the rocky intertidal of much of the Mediterranean's coastline and the Adriatic Sea. Populations are, however, threatened by the Lessepsian invader Brachidontes pharaonis that occupies the same habitat and is more tolerant of environmental extremes. This is the first study of the anatomy of M. minimus in relation to its evolution and adaptations towards an intertidal life on the karsted limestone shores that characterize much of the Mediterranean. In most anatomical respects M. minimus is a typical mytilid but is small (<16 mm shell length) and, post-juvenile, greatly deformed concomitant with its niche of colonizing pits in the karsted rocks. It is thus generally squatter, that is, dorso-ventrally flattened, laterally expanded and antero-posteriorly foreshortened in comparison with M. galloprovincialis. A pair of statocysts has been identified in the visceral mass. Most interest, however, resides in the fact the posterior byssal retractor muscles, like the shell, are foreshortened to comprise one paired block and the posterior pedal retractor muscles are situated beneath these not anterior to them as in other mytilids. These adaptations equip M. minimus for a compressed, squat, life in the intertidal karst. In addition to competition from the introduced B. pharaonis in the Mediterranean, M. minimus is facing competitive exclusion from the native Mytilus galloprovincialis that, as a result of intensive and increasing mariculture, is coming to dominate Croatian shorelines. This study is, therefore, prescient in laying the foundations for future research on what is becoming a threatened native Mediterranean species.  aPublisher supplied data 0aHeteromyarian form 0ashell deformities 0amusculature 0astatocysts 0aevolution1 aPuljas, Sanja0 tJournal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom.g2018 Dec., v. 98, no. 8 p.1999-2016dCambridge University PresswJournal:21923x1469-77697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00253154170014973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02579naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245013200166300001600298520140900314592002801723650002401751650002201775650003501797650001901832650002001851650001201871650001501883650000701898650002101905700002901926700001901955700002301974700002001997773009502017856008402112852000902196655001202205IND60112963420221116194003.0141111e20120511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296342DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKruk, Pavol12aA study on the alkaline hydrolysis of isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone by capillary electrophoresis with enhanced sample loadability  ap. 122-127.  aAn analytical potential of capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) with enhanced sample loadability (a 200nL injection volume) in determination of alkaline hydrolysis products of isatin-β-thiosemicarbazone (IBT), a compound with important biological activity, has been studied. The CZE separation conditions for a complete resolution of transformation products, i.e. 2-aminophenylglyoxalate, 2-(2-aminophenyl)-2-semicarbazonoethane, anthranilate and E-Z geometric isomers of 2-(2-aminophenyl)-2-thiosemicarbazonoethane, have been optimized. CZE separations with UV detection at 240nm were performed using glycine running buffer at high pH (9.2) and containing an uncharged β-cyclodextrin as a complexing agent. High sensitivity (with detection limits ranging from 0.1 to 1.2μM), good repeatability (RSD of migration times less than 0.4% and 0.4–3.4% RSD of peak areas) and linearity over two orders of magnitude were achieved for the compounds studied. The employed CZE method, characterized by simple sample handling (only dilution step needed) and total analysis time of less than 15min, has been applied successfully to time monitoring of the transformation of IBT in alkaline media. Under optimized CZE conditions, the effect of pH of reaction media, implemented by different concentration of NaOH (0.1–100mM), on the course of the alkaline hydrolysis of IBT was studied in this respect, as well.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkaline hydrolysis 3abeta-cyclodextrin 3acapillary zone electrophoresis 3achromatography 3adetection limit 3aisomers 3amonitoring 3apH 3asodium hydroxide1 aStankovičová, Henrieta1 aBodor, Róbert1 aGáplovský, Anton1 aMasár, Marián0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 11, v. 1237 p.122-127dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.03.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02107naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002600150245015300176300001600329520094700345592002801292650002101320650001601341650002901357650001601386650001901402650001101421650001501432650000901447650001301456650001301469650001801482650001401500700002201514773010401536856008401640852000901724655001201733IND60089997520221118055134.0141102e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008999752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bbalip.2011.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTarling, Elizabeth J.10aDancing with the sterols: Critical roles for ABCG1, ABCA1, miRNAs, and nuclear and cell surface receptors in controlling cellular sterol homeostasis  ap. 386-395.  aATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters represent a large and diverse family of proteins that transport specific substrates across a membrane. The importance of these transporters is illustrated by the finding that inactivating mutations within 17 different family members are known to lead to specific human diseases. Clinical data from humans and/or studies with mice lacking functional transporters indicate that ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCG4, ABCG5 and ABCG8 are involved in cholesterol and/or phospholipid transport. This review discusses the multiple mechanisms that control cellular sterol homeostasis, including the roles of microRNAs, nuclear and cell surface receptors and ABC transporters, with particular emphasis on recent findings that have provided insights into the role(s) of ABCG1.

Removal sampling and banding techniques using Japanese mist nets were employed to document community structure, food habits, reproductive cycles, and movement patterns of these bats. Results indicated that 27—31 species occur at or near ground level at each locality. Species diversity, as measured by H', was highest in the Costan Rican community; each community contained 3—4 common species and many uncommon species. Based on body size and general food habits, niche overlap appears to be greatest among small to intermediate—sized insectivores and frugivores, many of which, however, are apparently uncommon. Four basic reproductive patterns are found among the species. Most frugivores are seasonally polyestrous whereas some insectivores are monestrous and at least one is polyestrous. It is postulated that in both insectivores and frugivores birth peaks coincide with maximum food levels. Recapture patterns of several species suggest that home range size may be positively correlated with body size; omnivorous species may have larger home ranges than similarly size species with more restricted diets.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChiroptera 3abody size 3acommunity structure 3acorrelation 3adiet 3aeating habits 3afrugivores 3ahome range 3ainsectivores 3aomnivores 3aspecies diversity 3aCosta Rica 3aPanama Canal Zone1 aHooper, Emmet T.1 aWilson, Don E.0 tEcology.g1972 July, v. 53, no. 4 p.555-569dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19347713Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100006300147245010900210300001300319520162400332592002801956650002501984650002302009650002002032650002302052650002802075650001102103650002102114650001302135650001102148650001702159650001502176650001602191653003202207653002102239653001102260653002602271653002102297773008902318856008102407852000902488655001202497IND60544763720221116145749.0160901e20150602xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWiseman, Clare L.S.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3865-127710aAnalytical methods for assessing metal bioaccessibility in airborne particulate matter: A scoping review  ap. 9-18.  aIn contrast to the existence of standardized methods to assess metal bioaccessibility via the gastrointestinal route, there are no widely-accepted, established in vitro testing protocols to measure elemental solubility in the human lung. This may be attributed, in part, to the difficulty associated with simulating the lung’s complex in vivo conditions. The purpose of this review is two-fold: (1) to determine how the bioaccessibility of metals associated with ambient particulate matter (PM) in the human lung has been assessed in the literature, and (2) examine the suitability and biological relevance of applied methods for the measurement of metal bioaccessibility employed to date.The review revealed that limited attention has been paid to the development and application of biologically-relevant in vitro methods to measure elemental solubility in ambient PM as a proxy for bioaccessibility in the human lung. Few studies (n=14) used synthetic lung fluids to simulate in vivo conditions, with only half extracting samples at a biologically-relevant temperature of 37°C. There was limited evidence suggesting that the use of water is less effective as a leaching agent compared to simulated lung fluids. In sum, this scoping review highlights a critical need to develop standardized methods for the systematic assessment of elemental bioaccessibility via the respiratory route. Priority should be placed on the validation of biologically-relevant methods, including the use of leaching agents and extraction parameters used, which allow for testing to be conducted in a reliable, yet cost efficient, manner.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical chemistry 3aanalytical methods 3abioavailability 3acost effectiveness 3agastrointestinal system 3ahumans 3ain vitro studies 3aleaching 3ametals 3aparticulates 3asolubility 3atemperature 0aAirborne particulate matter 0aBioaccessibility 0aMetals 0aSimulated lung fluids 0aIn vitro methods0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 June 02, v. 877 p.9-18dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03322naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245012000167300001400287520192200301592002802223650001002251650002002261650001902281650001302300650001102313650001902324650001602343653003002359653002102389653002202410653002202432653002602454700001902480700005102499700001502550700001502565700001802580773020502598856008802803852000902891655001202900IND60698602620221122063852.0200719e202008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6069860262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2020.05.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Qing10aLeveraging photogrammetric mesh models for aerial-ground feature point matching toward integrated 3D reconstruction  ap. 26-40.  aIntegration of aerial and ground images has been proved as an efficient approach to enhance the surface reconstruction in urban environments. However, as the first step, the feature point matching between aerial and ground images is remarkably difficult, due to the large differences in viewpoint and illumination conditions. Previous studies based on geometry-aware image rectification have alleviated this problem, but the performance and convenience of this strategy are still limited by several flaws, e.g. quadratic image pairs, segregated extraction of descriptors and occlusions. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach: leveraging photogrammetric mesh models for aerial-ground image matching. The methods have linear time complexity with regard to the number of images. It explicitly handles low overlap using multi-view images. The proposed methods can be directly injected into off-the-shelf structure-from-motion (SFM) and multi-view stereo (MVS) solutions. First, aerial and ground images are reconstructed separately and initially co-registered through weak georeferencing data. Second, aerial models are rendered to the initial ground views, in which color, depth and normal images are obtained. Then, feature matching between synthesized and ground images are conducted through descriptor searching and geometry-constrained outlier removal. Finally, oriented 3D patches are formulated using the synthesized depth and normal images and the correspondences are propagated to the aerial views through patch-based matching. Experimental evaluations using five datasets reveal satisfactory performance of the proposed methods in aerial-ground image matching, which succeeds in all of the ten challenging pairs compared to only three for the second best. In addition, incorporation of existing SFM and MVS solutions enables more complete reconstruction results, with better internal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3acolor 3adata collection 3ageoreferencing 3alighting 3amodels 3aphotogrammetry 3aurban areas 0aAerial-ground integration 0aFeature matching 0a3D reconstruction 0aMulti-view stereo 0aStructure-from-motion1 aWang, Zhendong1 aHu, Han1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1137-22081 aXie, Linfu1 aGe, Xuming1 aZhang, Yeting0 tISPRS journal of photogrammetry and remote sensing.g2020 Aug., v. 166 p.26-40dElsevier B.V.aInternational Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

In this study, we investigated the effect of NO on Camellia sinensis pollen tubes exposed to aluminum (Al) stress. Exogenous application of the NO donor decreased the pollen germination rate and pollen tube length and increased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and antioxidant enzyme activities under Al stress. Simultaneously, the NO donor effectively increased NO content in pollen tube of C. sinensis under Al stress and could aggravate the damage of Al³⁺ to C. sinensis pollen tubes by promoting the uptake of Al³⁺. In addition, application of the NO-specific scavenger significantly alleviated stress damage in C. sinensis pollen tube under Al stress. Moreover, 18 CsALMT members from a key Al-transporting gene family were identified, which could be divided into four subclasses. Pearson correlation analysis showed the expression level of CsALMT8 showed significant positive correlation with the Al³⁺ concentration gradient and NO levels, but a significant negative correlation with pollen germination rate and pollen tube length. The expression level of CsALMT5 was negatively correlated with the Al³⁺ concentration gradient and NO level, and positively correlated with pollen germination rate and pollen tube length. The expression level of CsALMT17 showed a significant negative correlation with Al³⁺ concentration and NO content in pollen tubes, but significant positive correlation with pollen germination rate and pollen tube length. In conclusion, a complex signal network regulated by NO-mediated CsALMTs revealed that CsALMT8 was regulated by environmental Al³⁺ and NO to assist Al³⁺ entry into pollen tubes; CsALMT5 might be influenced by the Al³⁺ signal, stimulate malate efflux in vacuoles and chelate with Al³⁺ to detoxify Al in C. sinensis pollen tube.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCamellia sinensis 3aaluminum 3aantioxidant enzymes 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3amalates 3amalondialdehyde 3anitric oxide 3apollen 3apollen tubes 3atea1 aTian, Zhiqiang 1 aXing, Anqi 1 aWu, Zichen 1 aLi, Xuyan 1 aDai, Lingcong 1 aYang, Yiyang 1 aYin, Juan 1 aWang, Yuhua 0 tPlants.g2022 Aug. 29, v. 11, no. 17dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21620x2223-77477nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants111722333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02838naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001900147245007700166300001400243520147300257592002801730650001301758650001601771650001501787650002001802650004101822650002301863650001501886650001901901650001501920650001801935650001101953650003201964650003101996653001902027653002202046653003102068653002002099653003202119653003102151700001802182773009002200856008102290852000902371655001202380IND60544763820221116145757.0160901e20150310xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054476382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBagheri, Habib10aPolybutylene terephthalate-nickel oxide nanocomposite as a fiber coating  ap. 20-28.  aA highly efficient polybutylene terephthalate (PBT)-based nanocomposite containing nickel oxide nanoparticles was synthesized by electrospinning technique and used as a fiber coating for solid phase microextraction. The influential morphological parameters and capability of the prepared nanocomposite including the NiO content, the coating time, the PBT concentration and applied voltage were considered for optimization. The applicability of the synthesized fiber coating was examined by headspace solid phase micro extraction and gas chromatography mass spectrometry detection of some volatile organic compounds in aqueous samples. Among the synthesized nanocomposites and pristine PBT nanofibers, the fiber coating with 14% of NiO nanoparticles doping level exhibited the highest extraction efficiency. In addition, important parameters influencing the extraction/desorption process were investigated and optimized. The detection limits were less than 5ngL−1 using the selected ion monitoring mode. The inter-day and intra-day precisions of the developed method under optimized conditions were below 11%. The method showed a linearity in the range of 10–1000ngL−1 with the correlation coefficient greater than 0.9987. The optimized method was applied to the sampling of some volatile organic compounds from real water samples. The developed method is convenient, rapid, simple, easy and inexpensive and offers high sensitivity and sufficient reproducibility.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoatings 3acorrelation 3adesorption 3adetection limit 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aheadspace analysis 3amonitoring 3ananocomposites 3ananofibers 3ananoparticles 3anickel 3asolid phase microextraction 3avolatile organic compounds 0aNanocomposites 0aNiO nanoparticles 0aPolybutylene terephthalate 0aElectrospinning 0aSolid phase microextraction 0aVolatile organic compounds1 aRoostaie, Ali0 tAnalytica chimica acta.g2015 Mar. 10, v. 863 p.20-28dElsevier B.V.x0003-26707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aca.2015.01.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01869naa a2200253 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001900137245008500156300001600241520109500257592002801352650001401380650001101394650000901405650001301414773009601427856007101523852000901594655001201603IND60518554620221118225742.0160418e197207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855462DNAL7 a10.2307/19347952doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSale, Peter F.10aInfluence of Corals in the Dispersion of the Pomacentrid Fish, Dascyllus Aruanus  ap. 741-744.  aCoral colonies suitable for use as shelter are an important resource for the pomacentrid reef fish, Dascyllus aruanus. Each fish restricts its movements to the vicinity of a single colony which may be shared with several other individuals. This paper examines the pattern of distribution of individuals of this species among corals. The correlation between the number of fish in a group and the area of the colony used by the group was determined for 16 locations on a reef. The strength of this correlation varied greatly, but a significant relationship (P<0.01) existed between its strength and the intensity of use of the corals in each sampling area. In those places where use of coral was most intense, the correlation between the number of fish in a group and the area of the coral used by the group approached unity. The results indicate that the available suitable corals are fully used in only some parts of a reef, but than in these parts, an efficient dispersion of fish among corals is achieved. The behavioral mechanisms by which the dispersion might be attained are discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDascyllus 3acorals 3afish 3asampling0 tEcology.g1972 July, v. 53, no. 4 p.741-744dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2307/19347953Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02137naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245018700170300001400357520106900371592002801440650002301468650001401491650003101505650001501536650003001551650002101581700001801602700001701620773009301637856008401730852000901814655001201823IND60112963620221116194147.0141111e20120511xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011296362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0662doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhou, Qingxiang10aInvestigation of the applicability of highly ordered TiO₂ nanotube array for enrichment and determination of polychlorinated biphenyls at trace level in environmental water samples  ap. 24-29.  aPresent study investigated the applicability of ordered TiO₂ nanotube arrays for the enrichment and determination of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in water samples. A new and reliable method was developed for the preconcentration and determination of PCBs by micro-solid phase equilibrium extraction in combination with gas chromatography and electron capture detection (GC–ECD), which exploited the special physical and chemical properties of ordered TiO₂ nanotube arrays. The experimental results indicated that low LODs were easily achieved in the range of 0.02–0.10μgL⁻¹ for PCB-28, PCB-52, PCB-101, PCB-153, PCB-138, and PCB-180. The proposed method was validated with several real water samples, and good spiked recoveries have been obtained in the range of 95.8–110.5%. The experimental results demonstrated that TiO₂ nanotube arrays could be reused for over 200 times without the lost of the extraction efficiency. All these showed that TiO₂ nanotube arrays would be very useful in the enrichment and determination of trace pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3agas chromatography 3ananotubes 3aphysicochemical properties 3apollutants 3apolychlorinated biphenyls 3atitanium dioxide1 aHuang, Yunrui1 aXie, Guohong0 tJournal of chromatography.g2012 May 11, v. 1237 p.24-29dElsevier B.V.x0021-96737nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2012.02.0663Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01432naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002500094040001800119100001800137245005900155300001600214520055800230592002800788650001300816650001200829650001400841650001800855650001500873650002000888650001700908650001700925773009600942856007101038852000901109655001201118IND60518554720221118225645.0160418e197207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051855472DNAL7 a10.2307/19347912doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSmall, Ernest10aWater Relations of Plants in Raised Sphagnum Peat Bogs  ap. 726-728.  aThe water relations of woody plants of a raised sphagnum peat bog were examined by evaluation of water potential employing the pressure bomb and by measuring transpiration resistance with a leaf—resistance porometer.

In this study, we investigate the vocalisation activity of mountain hare (Lepus timidus) over the course of a year to better understand its occurrence and function. We found that mountain hares have a low vocalisation rate of one vocalisation every 33 night hours. We hypothesise that this low rate is the result of a strategy to minimise detection by predators. However, the 20 recorded vocal events correspond with intraspecific communication events such as warning others about danger and defending resources. This case study identifies further research directions to help strengthen our understanding of communication between solitary hares.  aPublisher supplied data  a-cAudax Foundation 3aLepus timidus 3aOchotona 3acase studies 3ahares 3apredators 3avocalization1 aWehrle, Martin1 aObrist, Martin K.0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2019 Dec., v. 65, no. 6 p.95-95dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl4237928x1612-46427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-019-1331-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02323naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002500145245007600170300001600246520107700262592002801339650001701367650001301384650001501397650001001412650001901422650001801441650001201459650001701471650001801488650001601506653001701522653001501539653001901554653001701573653002101590653001601611700001901627700003201646773012301678856007901801852000901880655001201889IND60520538120221119192502.0160521e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052053812DNAL7 a10.2478/pjfns-2013-00122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamborska, Katarzyna10aSpray Drying of Honey: The Effect of Drying Agents on Powder Properties  ap. 109-118.  aThe aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of honey spray drying with addition of maltodextrin and gum Arabic as drying agents. The influence of the concentration of the solution subjected to drying, the type and content of the drying agents upon the physical properties of obtained powders was examined. An attempt was undertaken to obtain powder with a honey content of more than 50% d.b. Spray drying of multifloral honey with the addition of maltodextrin and gum Arabic was carried out at inlet air temperature of 180°C, feed rate of 1 mL/s and rotational speed of a disc atomizer of 39,000 rpm. The properties of obtained powders were quantified in terms of moisture content, bulk density, Hausner ratio, apparent density, hygroscopicity and wettability. Using gum Arabic it was possible to obtain a product with a higher content of honey (67% solids) than in the case of maltodextrin (50% d.b.). However, the powders obtained with gum Arabic were characterised by worse physical properties: higher hygroscopicity and cohesion, and longer wetting time.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulk density 3acohesion 3agum arabic 3ahoney 3ahygroscopicity 3amaltodextrins 3apowders 3aspray drying 3awater content 3awettability 0amaltodextrin 0agum Arabic 0ahygroscopicity 0abulk density 0aapparent density 0awettability1 aGajek, Paulina1 aKamińska-Dwórznicka, Anna0 tPolish journal of food and nutrition sciences.g2015 Apr. 30, v. 65, no. 2 p.109-118dDe Gruyter Openx2083-60077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/pjfns-2013-00123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle05806naa a2200793 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245012700167300001300294520349800307592002803805596006103833650001403894650003503908650000803943650001603951650001303967650002103980650002504001650002004026650001804046650003504064650001404099650002104113650002404134650002304158650002404181650001404205650002004219650001904239650001004258650001004268650001604278650001904294650003304313650001104346650003104357650001204388650001304400650001304413650001204426650001304438650001304451650003004464650001804494650001404512650002204526650001004548650002204558650001904580651001004599651001004609651001304619653002304632653001604655653001604671700001904687700001804706700002104724700005504745773010804800856008304908852000904991655001205000IND60671604820221119053444.0191003e201910  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067160482DNAL7 a10.1094/PDIS-03-19-0599-PDN2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirdat, Kiran10aFirst Report of an Association of Multispecies Phytoplasmas with Mango Phyllody and Little Leaf Disease from Western India  ap. 2666.  aMango (Mangifera indica L., family Anacardiaceae) trees with malformed vegetative tissues at branch nodes and phyllody in panicles with thicker and stunted peduncle were observed in Pune region, Western India, in February and March 2018. Although the etiology of mango malformation disease is established by performing Koch’s postulate, confirming species of Fusarium are the causative agents (Chakrabarti 2011; Crespo et al. 2014), the observed symptoms, namely, excessive vegetative growth resulting in “bunchy top” appearance with shootlets bearing small, scaly leaves and leafy girdles, however, were also suggestive of phytoplasma infection. The growing symptomatic tissues were collected from one seedling, two panicles, and four branch nodal tissues from separate plants. Eight other asymptomatic samples were also collected. To confirm the presence of phytoplasmas, 2 g of malformed tissue from symptomatic plants was used for total DNA extraction using the CTAB method. The DNA was also extracted from asymptomatic plants. The phytoplasma 16S rRNA gene was amplified from 50 ng of DNA using primers P1/P7 followed by nested primers R16F2n/R16R2. The 16S rRNA gene of phytoplasma was detected in a symptomatic seedling, one nodal tissue, and one panicle sample, except in one symptomatic nodal tissue and a panicle. This may be owing to unevenly spread low phytoplasma titer, as known from previous studies (Abeysinghe et al. 2016; Caicedo et al. 2015). No amplification was observed in asymptomatic samples. All symptomatic samples were also tested for the presence of Fusarium DNA using universal PCR primers ITS1/ITS4; however, none of the samples tested positive, nor was fungal mycelium observed when sections of symptomatic tissue stained with cotton blue were observed under the microscope. The obtained 16S rRNA gene sequences from a symptomatic panicle (MH744151), nodal tissue (MH744152), and seedling (MH744153) samples showed 99.30% sequence similarity with ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris’ AYWB (CP000061), 16SrI group (aster yellows); 99.53% with ‘Ca. P. balanitae’ Balanites triflora (AB689678), 16SrV group (elm yellows); and 98.57% with ‘Ca. P. aurantifolia’ WBDL (U15442), 16SrII group (peanut witches’ broom), respectively, when analyzed using EzTaxon database and iPhyClassifier. So far, unknown phytoplasma associated with malformed mango inflorescence was reported from Egypt using electron microscopy (El-Banna et al. 2007), and ‘Ca. P. asteris’ (group 16SrI) was PCR detected from Pakistan (Fahmeed et al. 2009). These results suggest that polyphagous sap-sucking insect vectors must be involved in phytoplasma transmission from other alternate plant hosts to mango, and further studies are required. India produced over 19 million tons of mangoes, which is over 40% of the world’s production, and exported over U.S.$60 million worth of mangos in 2016 to 2017. To our knowledge, this is the first formal evidence of the association of multispecies phytoplasma strains with a mango malformation disease in India. The malformation is a severe disease of mango that causes serious damage to the seedlings and flowering tissue, resulting in severe economic losses. It is therefore essential to understand the etiology of mango malformation disease associated with phytoplasmas beyond the existing knowledge by collecting additional samples from different agro-climatic regions of India, ultimately for the better management of the disease.  aPublisher supplied data  aSERB/2016/000752cScience and Engineering Research Board 3aBalanites 3aCandidatus Phytoplasma asteris 3aDNA 3aDNA primers 3aFusarium 3aMangifera indica 3aabnormal development 3aagroclimatology 3aaster yellows 3acetyltrimethylammonium bromide 3adatabases 3adisease severity 3aelectron microscopy 3aetiological agents 3afinancial economics 3aflowering 3afoliar diseases 3afruit diseases 3afungi 3agenes 3ahost plants 3ainsect vectors 3ainternal transcribed spacers 3aleaves 3amango malformation disease 3amangoes 3amycelium 3apanicles 3apeanuts 3apeduncle 3aphyllody 3apolymerase chain reaction 3aribosomal RNA 3aseedlings 3asequence homology 3atrees 3avegetative growth 3awitches' broom 3aEgypt 3aIndia 3aPakistan 0amango malformation 0alittle leaf 0aphytoplasma1 aThorat, Vipool1 aGhole, Tushar1 aTakawale, Pramod1 aYadav, Amit1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4882-90750 tPlant disease.g2019 Oct., v. 103, no. 10 p.2666-2666dPlant DiseasewJournal:jnl30858x0191-29177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-03-19-0599-PDN3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02512naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245007400173300001400247520138400261592002801645650002201673650000801695650001501703650001401718650001301732650001201745650001701757650000901774650001101783650001501794650001301809650001101822700002201833700002301855700002501878700002001903773008301923856008702006852000902093655001202102IND60546597220221120031930.0160903e201406  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054659722DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.02.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLassin, Arnault10aEstimated thermodynamic properties of NaFeS2 and erdite (NaFeS2:2H2O)  ap. 14-24.  aThe main by-products of a lead-recovery process from waste are scoriaceous sodium–iron sulphides, whose storage is problematic due to their great reactivity with air and water. The objective of this work was to complete thermodynamic databases with a totally new set of properties for the two major components: NaFeS2 and erdite (NaFeS2:2H2O). The solubility product of erdite was measured at 20°C in a batch reactor. It is −38.0±0.3 when the reaction is written as a function of the predominant species at the experimental conditions: NaFeS2:2H2O+0.5H2O=HFeO2-+1.875HS-+0.125SO4=+Na++2.125H+.The resulting standard Gibbs free energy of formation of erdite from elements is −809.76kJ/mol at 25°C and 1bar. An original calculation procedure, relying on a combination of different theoretical models, then allowed the determination of the standard Gibbs free energies of formation of NaFeS2 and of the water of hydration for transforming NaFeS2 into erdite. At 25°C and 1bar, they are −322.85 and −243.46kJ/mol respectively. The other standard thermodynamic properties (enthalpy, entropy, and heat capacity) of erdite are −922.04kJ/mol, 232.6J/(molK) and 175.7J/(molK), respectively. For NaFeS2, they are −331.33kJ/mol, 114.3J/(molK) and 97.7J/(molK), respectively. For the water of hydration they are −295.36kJ/mol, 59.2J/(molK) and 39.0J/(molK), respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGibbs free energy 3aair 3abyproducts 3adatabases 3aenthalpy 3aentropy 3ageochemistry 3aheat 3amodels 3asolubility 3asulfides 3awastes1 aPiantone, Patrice1 aCrouzet, Catherine1 aBodénan, Françoise1 aBlanc, Philippe0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 June, v. 45 p.14-24dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.02.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02309naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245012300168300001400291520097000305592002801275650001801303650001701321650001201338650002301350650001901373650001901392650001401411650001901425650002001444650002001464651001001484653001901494653001101513653001401524653002501538653002901563700005401592700001801646773011401664856008801778852000901866655001201875IND60525030220221122224722.0190318e20160415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052503022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.02.0732doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, xinfei10aBiodegradation of marine crude oil pollution using a salt-tolerant bacterial consortium isolated from Bohai Bay, China  ap. 43-50.  aThis study aims at constructing an efficient bacterial consortium to biodegrade crude oil spilled in China's Bohai Sea. In this study, TCOB-1 (Ochrobactrum), TCOB-2 (Brevundimonas), TCOB-3 (Brevundimonas), TCOB-4 (Bacillus) and TCOB-5 (Castellaniella) were isolated from Bohai Bay. Through the analysis of hydrocarbon biodegradation, TCOB-4 was found to biodegrade more middle-chain n-alkanes (from C17 to C23) and long-chain n-alkanes (C31–C36). TCOB-5 capable to degrade more n-alkanes including C24–C30 and aromatics. On the basis of complementary advantages, TCOB-4 and TCOB-5 were chosen to construct a consortium which was capable of degrading about 51.87% of crude oil (2% w/v) after 1week of incubation in saline MSM (3% NaCl). It is more efficient compared with single strain. In order to biodegrade crude oil, the construction of bacterial consortia is essential and the principle of complementary advantages could reduce competition between microbes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBrevundimonas 3aOchrobactrum 3aalkanes 3aaromatic compounds 3abiodegradation 3amicroorganisms 3apetroleum 3asalt tolerance 3asodium chloride 3awater pollution 3aChina 0aBiodegradation 0aMarine 0aCrude oil 0aBacterial consortium 0aComplementary advantages1 aZhao, Lin,1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3128-01351 aAdam, Mohamed0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 105, no. 1 p.43-50dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.02.0733Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03086naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100001800145245006900163300001600232520170200248592002801950650001601978650001101994650002202005650001202027650001702039650001302056650001202069650001302081650000902094650001002103650002302113650001402136650001302150653000902163653001402172653002002186653001802206653002102224700001702245700001902262700001902281700002202300700002002322700002702342773012302369856007902492852000902571655001202580IND60520538220221119192646.0160521e20150430xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052053822DNAL7 a10.1515/pjfns-2015-00062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, Teresa10aInfluence of Sweetness and Ethanol Content on Mead Acceptability  ap. 137-142.  aMead is a traditional alcoholic beverage obtained by fermenting mead wort; however, its production still remains frequently an empirical exercise. Different meads can be produced, depending on fermentation conditions. Nevertheless, to date few studies have been developed on factors that may influence mead quality. The main objective of this work was to study the influence of sweetness and ethanol content on mead acceptability. Different meads were produced with two sweetness levels (sweet and dry meads) and three ethanol contents (18, 20, 22% (v/v)), adjusted by brandy addition. Afterwards, meads acceptability was evaluated by sensory analysis through a consumers’ panel (n=108) along with chemical analysis by HPLC-RID of glucose, fructose, ethanol, glycerol and acetic acid. The sweet (75 ggₗᵤcₒₛₑ₊fᵣᵤcₜₒₛₑ/L) and dry (23 ggₗᵤcₒₛₑ₊fᵣᵤcₜₒₛₑ/L) meads presented glycerol contents equal to 5.10±0.54 and 5.96±0.95 g/L, respectively, that were desirable since glycerol improves mead quality. Low concentrations of acetic acid were determined (0.46±0.08 and 0.57±0.09 g/L), avoiding the vinegar off-character. Concerning sensory analysis, the alcohol content of mead had no effect on the sensory attributes studied, namely, aroma, sweetness, flavour, alcohol feeling and general appreciation. Regarding sweetness, the “sweet meads” were the most appreciated by the consumers (score of 5.4±2.56), whereas the “dry meads” (score of 2.7±2.23) showed low acceptability.

In this study, a novel photocatalyst constructed using Ag and AgInO₂ was developed to improve the visible-light-driven properties. The photocatalytic efficiency of Ag/AgInO₂ for the degradation of methylene blue (MB) reached 97.8%, which was much higher than that of pure AgInO₂. Characterization results show that the as-prepared nanocomposites can not only broaden the visible-light absorption range but also promote the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Trapping experiments confirmed that superoxide radicals (˙O²⁻) and holes (h⁺) were the predominant contributors in the degradation of the organic dye MB. These encouraging results provide an alternative approach for the development of metal–semiconductor hybrid nanostructures towards improving the efficiency of solar-energy utilization in the near future.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3aenergy conversion 3amethylene blue 3ananocomposites 3ananomaterials 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aremediation 3asemiconductors 3asilver 3asolar energy 3asuperoxide anion1 aXu, Difa1 aJia, Yanrong1 aZhang, Shiying0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 12, v. 7, no. 48 p.30392-30396dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02331f3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03153naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001600188245008700204300001200291506007600303520167400379592002802053506003702081650002902118650002102147650002602168650002702194650001402221650001102235650001202246650001202258650002102270650001102291650001202302650002902314650001902343650001402362650001802376700002302394700005502417773012002472856008202592852000902674655001202683IND60586836220221207145059.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683622DNAL7 a10.1186/s13068-017-0978-72doi7 aPMC57136462pmcid7 a292133302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKu, JasonT.10aRenewable synthesis of n-butyraldehyde from glucose by engineered Escherichia coli  ap. 291.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: n-Butyraldehyde is a high-production volume chemical produced exclusively from hydroformylation of propylene. It is a versatile chemical used in the synthesis of diverse C4–C8 alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, and amines. Its high demand and broad applications make it an ideal chemical to be produced from biomass. RESULTS: An Escherichia coli strain was engineered to produce n-butyraldehyde directly from glucose by expressing a modified Clostridium CoA-dependent n-butanol production pathway with mono-functional Coenzyme A-acylating aldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh) instead of the natural bifunctional aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase. Aldh from Clostridium beijerinckii outperformed the other tested homologues. However, the presence of native alcohol dehydrogenase led to spontaneous conversion of n-butyraldehyde to n-butanol. This problem was addressed by knocking out native E. coli alcohol dehydrogenases, significantly improving the butyraldehyde-to-butanol ratio. This ratio was further increased reducing media complexity from Terrific broth to M9 media containing 2% yeast extract. To increase production titer, in situ liquid–liquid extraction using dodecane and oleyl alcohol was investigated. Results showed oleyl alcohol as a better extractant, increasing the titer of n-butyraldehyde produced to 630 mg/L. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated n-butyraldehyde production from glucose. Through sequential strain and condition optimizations, butyraldehyde-to-butanol ratio was improved significantly compared to the parent strain. Results from this work may serve as a basis for further development of renewable n-butyraldehyde production.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aClostridium beijerinckii 3aEscherichia coli 3aalcohol dehydrogenase 3aaldehyde dehydrogenase 3aaldehydes 3aamines 3abiomass 3abutanol 3acarboxylic acids 3aesters 3aglucose 3aliquid-liquid extraction 3aoleyl alcohols 3apropylene 3ayeast extract1 aSimanjuntak, Wiwik1 aLan, EthanI.1http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6658-34510 tBiotechnology for biofuels.g2017 Dec., v. 10, no. 1 p.291-291dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4350543x1754-68347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-017-0978-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02776naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100002500186245009100211300001800302506007600320520106700396592002801463506003701491650002701528650002701555650001301582650002101595650002101616650001401637650001601651650001001667650002001677650000901697650001201706650001701718650001401735650002201749650001701771650001701788650001401805653001401819653001601833653001601849653002001865653001501885700002601900700001701926773019101943856007902134852000902213655001202222IND60230520220221207083409.0150614e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6023052022DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.14249541122doi7 aPMC43307312pmcid7 a256245062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKirienko, Natalia V.10aMitophagy confers resistance to siderophore-mediated killing by Pseudomonas aeruginosa  ap. 1821-1826.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn the arms race of bacterial pathogenesis, bacteria produce an array of toxins and virulence factors that disrupt core host processes. Hosts mitigate the ensuing damage by responding with immune countermeasures. The iron-binding siderophore pyoverdin is a key virulence mediator of the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa , but its pathogenic mechanism has not been established. Here we demonstrate that pyoverdin enters Caenorhabditis elegans and that it is sufficient to mediate host killing. Moreover, we show that iron chelation disrupts mitochondrial homeostasis and triggers mitophagy both in C. elegans and mammalian cells. Finally, we show that mitophagy provides protection both against the extracellular pathogen P. aeruginosa and to treatment with a xenobiotic chelator, phenanthroline, in C. elegans . Although autophagic machinery has been shown to target intracellular bacteria for degradation (a process known as xenophagy), our report establishes a role for authentic mitochondrial autophagy in the innate immune defense against P. aeruginosa.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCaenorhabditis elegans 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3abacteria 3abacterial toxins 3achelating agents 3achelation 3ahomeostasis 3ahosts 3ainnate immunity 3airon 3amammals 3amitochondria 3apathogens 3aprotective effect 3areproduction 3asiderophores 3avirulence 0amitophagy 0aPseudomonas 0asiderophore 0ainnate immunity 0aC. elegans1 aAusubel, Frederick M.1 aRuvkun, Gary0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Feb. 10, v. 112, no. 6 p.1821-1826dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14249541123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02556naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001300140245017500153300002000328520140200348592002801750650002301778650003001801650001101831650001501842650001301857650001601870650001801886650001401904700001401918700001801932700001901950700001801969773012401987856007402111852000902185655001202194IND60641954520221122040405.0190506e20170621xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064195452DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra02360j2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPan, Jie14aThe conversion of donor to acceptor and rational design for diketopyrrolopyrrole-containing small molecule acceptors by introducing nitrogen-atoms for organic solar cells  ap. 31800-31806.  aFor the purpose of improving the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices, non-fullerene small acceptors have been presented by modifying desirable donors, such as a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based acceptor with two thiazoles, namely poly{3,6-bis(5-hexyldecyl-2thenyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(alkyl)pyrrolo[3,4]pyrrolo-1,4-dionethiazole} (PDPP2TzT), synthesized by introducing two nitrogens onto the copolymer based on DPP and terthiophene (poly[{2,5-bis(2-hexyldecyl)-2,3,5,6-tetrahydro-3,6-dioxopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-diyl}]-alt-{[2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene-5,5′′-diyl}]) (PDPP3T). In order to clarify the transfer mechanism, we put forward a comparative theoretical study of PDPP3T and PDPP2TzT using density functional theory/time-dependent density functional theory (DFT/TD-DFT) calculations. Subsequently, we determined that the mechanism of the conversion from a donor to an acceptor was that the insertion of nitrogen could reduce the LUMO energy by changing the electron density and intramolecular interactions. Based on this mechanism, a series of acceptors were designed with the advantages of PDPP2TzT. The results illustrate that b4 showed the best performance when blended with PDPP5T as the donor for BHJ devices. Finally, we hope our investigations will provide guidelines for further rational design of acceptor materials for BHJ devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomposite polymers 3adensity functional theory 3aenergy 3aguidelines 3anitrogen 3asolar cells 3aterthiophenes 3athiazoles1 aYin, Hang1 aXie, Yu-Zhong1 aSun, Guang-Yan1 aSu, Zhong-Min0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 21, v. 7, no. 51 p.31800-31806dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra02360j3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03705naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003300133040001800166100002400184245012000208300001800328500001500346506007600361520162300437592002802060506003702088650001902125650001502144650002502159650001102184650001302195650001602208650002002224650001902244650001102263650001902274650002302293650001102316650001902327650001902346650001902365650001102384650001202395650001502407650002902422650002302451650001602474650003102490650002902521650001202550650001602562650002202578653001502600700001402615700002102629700001802650700001802668700002302686700002202709700002402731700002402755773017302779856004602952852000902998655001203007IND4487032920221207090810.0120530e20120529xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448703292DNAL7 a225861032pmid7 aPMC33652122pmcid7 a10.1073/pnas.11191311092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBauerle, William L.10aPhotoperiodic regulation of the seasonal pattern of photosynthetic capacity and the implications for carbon cycling  ap. 8612-8617.  a2019-12-04  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAlthough temperature is an important driver of seasonal changes in photosynthetic physiology, photoperiod also regulates leaf activity. Climate change will extend growing seasons if temperature cues predominate, but photoperiod-controlled species will show limited responsiveness to warming. We show that photoperiod explains more seasonal variation in photosynthetic activity across 23 tree species than temperature. Although leaves remain green, photosynthetic capacity peaks just after summer solstice and declines with decreasing photoperiod, before air temperatures peak. In support of these findings, saplings grown at constant temperature but exposed to an extended photoperiod maintained high photosynthetic capacity, but photosynthetic activity declined in saplings experiencing a naturally shortening photoperiod; leaves remained equally green in both treatments. Incorporating a photoperiodic correction of photosynthetic physiology into a global-scale terrestrial carbon-cycle model significantly improves predictions of seasonal atmospheric CO2 cycling, demonstrating the benefit of such a function in coupled climate system models. Accounting for photoperiod-induced seasonality in photosynthetic parameters reduces modeled global gross primary production 2.5% (∼4 PgC y–1), resulting in a >3% (∼2 PgC y–1) decrease of net primary production. Such a correction is also needed in models estimating current carbon uptake based on remotely sensed greenness. Photoperiod-associated declines in photosynthetic capacity could limit autumn carbon gain in forests, even if warming delays leaf senescence.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acarbon dioxide 3aprediction 3aprimary productivity 3aautumn 3asaplings 3aphotoperiod 3aair temperature 3aclimate change 3acarbon 3agrowing season 3aseasonal variation 3asummer 3aremote sensing 3aclimate models 3aphotosynthesis 3aleaves 3aforests 2aAlgorithms 2aCarbon Cyclexphysiology 2aModels, Biological 2aPhotoperiod 2aPhotosynthesisxphysiology 2aPlant Leavesxphysiology 2aSeasons 2aTemperature 2aTreesxphysiology 0asenescence1 aOren, Ram1 aWay, Danielle A.1 aQian, Song S.1 aStoy, Paul C.1 aThornton, Peter E.1 aBowden, Joseph D.1 aHoffman, Forrest M.1 aReynolds, Robert F.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2012 May 29, v. 109, no. 22 p.8612-8617dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1119131109  aDNAL 7aarticle02027naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245004900171300001600220520108400236592002801320650001501348650001401363650002101377650001201398650002201410650002001432650001001452650001101462650001901473650001601492700002201508773009001530856004801620852000901668655001201677IND50068854920221120142618.0130830e201309  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006885492DNAL7 a10.1007/s11483-013-9310-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFranzese, Giancarlo10aWater at Biological and Inorganic Interfaces  ap. 153-169.  aWe analyze the role of water at biological and inorganic interfaces.

We focus on the thermodynamics of hydration water at cryopreservation temperatures and its effects on the dynamics of nano-confined and protein-hydration water. We consider the relevance of confining heterogeneities for controlling the physical properties of hydration water and the effects of interfacial water on protein stability.

Multivariate analysis was used to estimate the intra-trait correlation among the taxa, and path analyses were used to determine the relative contributions of crown architectural and phenological traits to first-year height growth. The multivariate analysis indicated that BC1, slash, and loblolly pine have different relationships among the traits studied, suggesting that a separate path analysis was required for each taxon. Path analysis coefficients of determination of the final models were 0.69, 0.73, and 0.65 for the pseudo-backcross, loblolly, and slash pine families, respectively. The ranking of traits by relative magnitude of effect on total growth was, for the pseudo-backcross crown projected area (CPA), fascicle length (FL), number of nodes (NN), number of branches (NB), number of needles per fascicle (NF), and fascicle diameter. For loblolly, this was CPA, NB, FL, NN, NF, initiation, and specific leaf area. For slash, this was CPA, NN, FL, NF, and NB. The study indicated that all crown traits considered in the path analysis had moderate effects on first-year height growth, with the exceptions of the consistently large effect of CPA and the minimal effect of the phenological traits.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus elliottii 3aPinus taeda 3agrowth traits 3aleaf area 3amultivariate analysis 3aslash1 aHuber, Dudley A.1 aMartin, Timothy A.0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2012 Dec., v. 8, no. 6 p.1281-1292dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-012-0514-7  aDNAL 7aarticle02417naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002100151245010000172300001600272520112000288592002801408650002201436650002501458650002401483650002601507650001101533650002001544651001801564651002001582651001801602651001101620651002801631653001901659653002501678653004001703653004701743653001401790773010801804856008601912852000901998655001202007IND60655506620221120213005.0200514e20190102xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065550662DNAL7 a10.1080/01916122.2018.14470432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRiding, James B.14aThe literature on Triassic, Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous dinoflagellate cysts: Supplement 3  ap. 104-150.  aSince the production of three literature compilations in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 266 further published contributions on Triassic, Jurassic and earliest Cretaceous (Berriasian) dinoflagellate cysts were issued between April 2014 and January 2018, or have been discovered.

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we used two tomato lines 081018 (K+-deficiency-sensitive) and 081034 (K+-deficiency-tolerant), showing tolerance to K+ deficiency to investigate the relationship between the H2O2 and sucrose in the tomato under K+-deficiency. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> accumulation was increased by the low K+ condition (0.5 mM) after 8 h in 081018. The enzymes related to the metabolism of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were decreased, and more malondialdehyde (MDA) was produced. After 24 h, the sucrose content had accumulated significantly in the leaves, however, it was deficient in the roots, and the expression level of the sucrose transporters (SUT1) was inhibited. In 081034, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was increased under K+-deficiency, and then the H2O2 subsequently returned to the control treatment (4 mM) levels and did not produce more MDA. The sucrose content was not significantly different from the control treatment after 24 h. The expression of SUT1 was not suppressed. These results suggested that the H2O2 dynamics played different roles in the two different strains. The transportation of sucrose was suppressed by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from the leaf (source) to the root (sink) in 081018, and unrestricted by the advantageous reactive oxygen species dynamics capacity in 081034.  aPublisher supplied data 3acrop yield 3aleaves 3amalondialdehyde 3aphotosynthesis 3apotassium 3asucrose 3atomatoes 3atransportation1 aZhang, Ning1 aLiu, Xin1 aJiang, Jing0 tZahradnictví.g, v. 48, no. 2 p.90-97dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21417x0862-867X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/103/2020-hortsci3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02447naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001700149245009600166506002800262520135100290592002801641506003701669650003701706650002101743650002401764650003001788650001101818700001301829700001801842700001601860700001701876700001701893773009501910856008302005852000902088655001202097IND60739800220221207132942.0170113s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980022DNAL7 a10.1051/bioconf/201708030112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJunpeng, Tan10aModification and characterization of an aptamer-based surface plasmon resonance sensor chip  aResource is Open Access  aRecently, aptamer-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensors have become increasingly popular due to their high specificity, high sensitivity, real-time detection capabilities, and label-free features. The core component of an aptamer-based SPR sensor is a chip. This paper presents the modification steps and the characterization results of a sensor chip for the construction of a 2, 4, 6-trinitrotoluene-targeted, aptamer-based, SPR sensor. After cleaning the aptamer-based SPR sensor chip, polyethylene glycol (PEG) with functional thiol groups at one end was added to the chip surface by Au-S covalent bonds to form a self-assembled film. Then, the carboxyl groups at the other end of PEG and the carboxyl groups of trinitrophenyl-glycine (TNP-Gly) were activated and connected via ethylenediamine (EDA). This effectively completed the chip’s modification. During the modification process, relevant experimental conditions were optimized. The chip’s surface elements, as well as their chemical states, were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results, outlined in the following study, demonstrate that this modification of an aptamer-based SPR sensor chip adhered to normative expectations. Thus, the modification process proposed here establishes an important foundation for subsequent study of TNT detection.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aX-ray photoelectron spectroscopy 3aethylenediamines 3apolyethylene glycol 3asurface plasmon resonance 3athiols1 aBin, Hao1 aZhicheng, Liu1 aFengbo, Bai1 aRuiqin, Yang1 aHongxia, Hao0 tBIO web of conferences.g2017, v. 8 p.03011-dEDP ScienceswJournal:27810x2117-44587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1051/bioconf/201708030113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03297naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100006400141245011300205300001600318520178400334592002802118650002102146650003002167650001102197650003102208650001602239650001502255650002302270650002102293650001902314650001802333650001102351650001902362650001302381651001102394651001302405653003002418653001902448653002002467700002002487700002302507700002102530700002402551773015502575856007602730852000902806655001202815IND60764346220221119231022.0220128e20210906xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076434622DNAL7 a10.1017/inp.2021.282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStoneburner, Alex L.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9643-412610aSimulated trampling by cattle negatively impacts invasive yellow-flag iris (Iris pseudacorus) when submerged  ap. 232-239.  aYellow-flag iris (Iris pseudacorus L.) is a nonnative, invasive wetland plant that disrupts riparian ecosystem processes and is widely distributed across the United States and Canada. Due to its physiological and morphological characteristics, I. pseudacorus has the capacity to exclude native vegetation and form extensive monocultures in both lotic and lentic wetland systems. Methods commonly used to manage I. pseudacorus include manual (e.g., hand pulling, digging) and mechanical (e.g., mowing) treatments for small populations and herbicide applications for larger populations; however, herbicide applications near water may be prohibited due to label restrictions. The objective of this research was to evaluate cattle trampling as a nonchemical method to reduce I. pseudacorus in riparian habitats. A greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the effects of inundation and two different timings of simulated trampling on I. pseudacorus density, height, and soluble sugar concentrations in the rhizomes. A complementary field demonstration was established on a ranch in northwestern Nebraska to evaluate cattle trampling effects on I. pseudacorus density and height after two consecutive years. Simulated cattle trampling in the greenhouse had no effect on I. pseudacorus density or height of non-inundated samples. However, combining trampling with inundation reduced I. pseudacorus density from a median of 10 I. pseudacorus per pot to 0 I. pseudacorus per pot and median height from 0.35m to 0m by the conclusion of the study. Additionally, the field demonstration resulted in reductions of both density and height of I. pseudacorus after two consecutive years (72% and 67% reduction, respectively). Soluble sugar concentrations were not impacted by any treatment.  aPublisher supplied data 3aIris pseudacorus 3aadministrative management 3acattle 3agreenhouse experimentation 3agreenhouses 3aherbicides 3aindigenous species 3ainvasive species 3alentic systems 3alotic systems 3asugars 3awetland plants 3awetlands 3aCanada 3aNebraska 0aInvasive riparian species 0ariparian areas 0arangeland weeds1 aMeiman, Paul J.1 aOcheltree, Troy W.1 aNissen, Scott J.1 aBradfield, Scott J.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2021 Sept. 6, v. 14, no. 4 p.232-239dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2021.283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02194naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001800140245009400158300001800252520124300270592002801513650001601541650001301557650001201570650001601582650001601598700001401614700001601628700001801644773013401662856007501796852000901871655001201880IND60788300620221121090406.0220812e20220811xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078830062DNAL7 a10.1039/d2cc03224d2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Zhuoxing10aIntroduction to the biomimetic design of interfacial materials for water overflow control  ap. 9051-9059.  aThe overflow behavior of liquid at a curved surface or a surface border is a common phenomenon in many circumstances of daily life and industry. Accurate control of overflow is beneficial for improving the convenience of our daily life and efficiency of production, thus has great importance not only for enhancing existing applications but for creating new products. The effect of surface wettability on overflow has not been paid enough attention in the past, however, as the development of construction techniques, especially 3D printing, of superwettable surfaces and the understanding of the dynamic interfacial wetting properties, the potential of surface wettability and structure on the overflow control has gained great recognition in the recent decade. On this basis, the feature article will outline the understanding evolution of the overflow phenomenon, and summarise the current research on the control of overflow behavior from aspects including the bioinspired idea, the fabrication of superwettable surfaces, the development of control techniques, the exploration of control mechanisms, etc., and provide an outlook for the accurate control of overflow by surfactant and additives, along with challenges and perspectives.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3aindustry 3aliquids 3asurfactants 3awettability1 aPeng, Jia1 aYu, Cunlong1 aDong, Zhichao0 tChemical communications.g2022 Aug. 11, v. 58, no. 65 p.9051-9059dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26910x1364-548X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1039/d2cc03224d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02541naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011300171300001600284520130800300592002801608650002701636650001301663650002201676650002501698650001601723650001501739650001501754650001401769650002301783650001501806653002201821653002201843653002301865653001501888653002101903700002101924773012601945856005102071852000902122655001202131IND50087911320221118181220.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008791132DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2011.5728882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVästilä, Kaisa10aEnvironmentally preferable two-stage drainage channels: considerations for cohesive sediments and conveyance  ap. 171-180.  aDesign of environmentally preferable agricultural drainage channels calls for an improved understanding of cohesive sediment processes. Flow and cohesive sediments were investigated in a new demonstration and test channel where a floodplain was excavated on one side of the existing channel to improve flood conveyance. In this approach, the existing, naturally recovered channel was mostly left intact to reduce environmental impacts. Continuous monitoring of discharge and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during 1 year revealed that the construction work of the two-stage channel caused 2% of the annual suspended sediment (SS) load. Agricultural areas covering 13% of the catchment were estimated to contribute over half of the annual SS, predominantly during the rising stages. Seasonal positive hysteresis was found in SSC which was explained by different drainage efficiencies of two distinct sediment sources. The temporally varying shares of the two sources caused scatter in the rating curves between discharge and SSC or SS load. Out-of-channel processes were shown to govern the amount and timing of the SS input into the channel, indicating that environmentally preferable agricultural channel design should consider the cohesive sediment processes and sources at the catchment scale.  aPublisher supplied data 3adesign for environment 3adrainage 3adrainage channels 3aenvironmental impact 3afloodplains 3ahysteresis 3amonitoring 3asediments 3asuspended sediment 3awatersheds 0aDrainage channels 0acohesive sediment 0asuspended sediment 0ahysteresis 0aflood conveyance1 aJärvelä, Juha,0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 9, no. 3-4 p.171-180dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2011.572888  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001500151245014600166300001600312520148600328592002801814650001901842650001401861650002001875650002501895650001101920650001501931650002201946650001401968650001501982650001801997650001702015650001802032650001802050650000902068700001402077700001802091700005602109700001802165773011802183856008602301852000902387655001202396IND60605340220221120171914.0200712e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060534022DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTanaka, S.10aConcentrations and biological half-life of radioactive cesium in epigeic earthworms after the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident  ap. 227-232.  aTo understand the long-term behavior of radiocesium in the biological processes of a forest ecosystem, its concentration in Japanese epigeic earthworms (Megascolecidae), litter, and soil, and the ambient dose equivalent rates, were investigated after the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. The metabolism of radiocesium in the earthworms was also investigated in the laboratory, and its biological half-life (Tb) was estimated. The concentration of ¹³⁷Cs in the habitat soil and litter changed from 2014 to 2016, with levels in the litter going from 44.9 Bq/g dw (in 2014) to 45.3 Bq/g dw (2015) and 10.7 Bq/g dw (2016); in soil, these values were 9.79 Bq/g dw, 7.14 Bq/g dw and 18.0 Bq/g dw, respectively. By contrast, no significant changes were observed in the concentrations in the earthworms, which were 4.87 Bq/g fw, 5.30 Bq/g fw and 4.67 Bq/g fw in 2014, 2015, and 2016, respectively. The ambient dose equivalent rates at the sampling site declined significantly over these three years, going from 2.15 μSv/h to 1.68 μSv/h and 1.35 μSv/h, mostly corresponding to physical decay of radiocesium. The majority (95%) of the ¹³⁷Cs in the earthworms, observed via autoradiography, was concentrated primarily in the intestine. The clearance of ¹³⁷Cs from the earthworms was described by dual exponential functions: the half-life in the rapid loss due to gut clearance was 0.10 days and a second slower loss due to physiological clearance was 27.4 days.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMegascolecidae 3aaccidents 3aautoradiography 3abiological half-life 3acesium 3aearthworms 3aforest ecosystems 3ahalf life 3aintestines 3anuclear power 3apower plants 3aradioactivity 3aradionuclides 3asoil1 aAdati, T.1 aTakahashi, T.1 aFujiwara, K.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5974-15971 aTakahashi, S.0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 Dec., v. 192 p.227-232dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02293naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004200094040001800136100002700154245013000181300001400311506002800325520095000353592002801303506003701331650001901368650002401387650001701411650001601428650002101444650001401465650001101479650001901490650001001509653001901519653001801538653001701556653001701573653001801590653001101608653001601619773012601635856008901761852000901850655001201859IND60739800520221207132416.0180531e199606  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980052DNAL7 a10.20870/oeno-one.1996.30.2.11092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFournioux, Jean-Claude10aDemonstration and study of characters of foliar « compensatory growth» phenomenon in grapevine (<em>Vitis vinifera</em> L.)  ap. 53-65.  aResource is Open Access  aDefoliation and decapitation experiments showed that the growth of a grapevine leaf was inhibited by both the terminal bud and the younger higher leaves. There is a phenomenon of synergy between these two influences. A young leaf freed of these two influences showed a higher growth rate than the norm ; this is « compensatory growth ». It is when a leaf is in its phase of maximal growth that it is most able to realize this &laquo compensatory growth ». This is not due to a longer growth time, but more to a faster growth rate. This « compensatory growth » is not the consequence of competition between leaf growth and internodal elongation. Exogenous applications of auxins prevented or restricted this growth; gibberellic acid had no effect. These results partly explain those of other authors who demonstrate that reduction in the leaf area of a vine is accompanied by an increase in photosynthetic efficiency of the remaining leaves.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVitis vinifera 3acompensatory growth 3adecapitation 3adefoliation 3agibberellic acid 3aleaf area 3aleaves 3aphotosynthesis 3avines 0aVitis vinifera 0aleaves growth 0acompensation 0adefoliations 0adecapitations 0aauxins 0agibberellin0 tOENO One.g1996 June, v. 30, no. 2 p.53-65dInternational Viticulture and Enology SocietywJournal:27875x2494-12717nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.20870/oeno-one.1996.30.2.11093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03654naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002600141245007700167300001600244520210700260592002802367650002002395650002402415650002602439650003002465650001102495650002302506650001102529650002202540650002202562650001002584650002102594650001402615650001402629650000902643650001402652651001302666653002402679653001902703653001802722653002302740700005602763700002002819700001902839700002502858773015502883856007603038961001303114852000903127655001203136IND60764346420221119231219.0220128e20211122xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076434642DNAL7 a10.1017/inp.2021.302doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPethybridge, Sarah J.10aSouthern blight of perennial swallowwort (Vincetoxicum spp.) in New York  ap. 223-231.  aPale swallowwort [Vincetoxicum rossicum (Kleopow) Barbar.; syn.: Cynanchum rossicum (Kleopow) Borhidi] and black swallowwort [Vincetoxicum nigrum (L.) Moench; syn.: Cynanchum louiseae Kartesz & Gandhi] are invasive perennial viny milkweeds that have become prevalent across natural and managed habitats in northeastern North America. Southern blight of V. rossicum caused by the fungus Athelia rolfsii (Curzi) C. C. Tu & Kimbr. was reported at a New York county park in 2008, resulting in a decline in V. rossicum stands. The disease outbreak and persistence of the pathogen highlighted the potential of A. rolfsii for Vincetoxicum spp. control. To better characterize A. rolfsii's pathogenicity and biology, we studied virulence to adult Vincetoxicum spp., spatiotemporal attributes of the Southern blight epidemic at the discovery site over 4 yr, and sclerotial survival over 2 yr. Disease incidence and severity were high for both Vincetoxicum spp. in misting chamber experiments. The spatiotemporal spread patterns of Southern blight in V. rossicum suggest the epidemic in the first year of monitoring (2016) was already highly aggregated and that subsequent spread was limited and resulted in significant local aggregation. Sclerotial survival studies at two locations (Pittsford and Ithaca, NY) demonstrated the A. rolfsii isolates can overwinter in upstate New York and are pathogenic to Vincetoxicum spp. the subsequent season. However, shallow burial of sclerotia more rapidly reduced survival compared with placement on the soil surface. Overwinter survival of A. rolfsii sclerotia in New York is notable, as this pathogen is typically associated with subtropical and tropical regions. Broadcast applications of the pathogen would be needed for widespread Vincetoxicum control at a site, but even restricting releases to select locations would not prevent pathogen movement off-site via water or machinery. The known risks of the A. rolfsii isolate to other broadleaf plants in natural and agricultural settings suggest a low feasibility of use for the biological control of Vincetoxicum spp.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAthelia rolfsii 3aVincetoxicum nigrum 3aVincetoxicum rossicum 3aadministrative management 3aadults 3abiological control 3ablight 3adisease incidence 3adisease outbreaks 3afungi 3ainvasive species 3apathogens 3asclerotia 3asoil 3avirulence 3aNew York 0adog-strangling vine 0ainvasive plant 0anatural areas 0aSclerotium rolfsii1 aMurphy, Sean1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8500-75241 aSharma, Sandeep1 aBiazzo, Jeromy1 aMilbrath, Lindsey R.0 tInvasive plant science and management.g2021 Nov. 22, v. 14, no. 4 p.223-231dThe Weed Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl4194316x1939-747X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/inp.2021.303Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001200139245009400151300001800245520126400263592002801527650001301555650001401568650001901582650001601601650001801617650001601635700001701651700001501668773013301683856007501816852000901891655001201900IND60538214620221118093231.0160815e20140205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053821462DNAL7 a10.1021/ie40344942doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Man10aHydrodynamic Performance of a Spout–Fluid Bed with Draft Tube at Different Temperatures  ap. 1999-2010.  aTemperature is one of the key factors exerting a strong effect on the hydrodynamic performance of spout–fluid beds. In this study, experiments were conducted in a 160-mm-diameter spout–fluid bed with a nonporous draft tube at four temperatures: 293, 373, 440, and 500 K. The effect of temperature on the hydrodynamic performance indexes of pressure drop, gas bypassing, minimum spouting velocity, and flow pattern was investigated. The pressure drop in the annular region was higher at 500 K than at 293 K. The minimum spouting velocity (Uₘₛ) increased with temperature at a low superficial fluidizing gas velocity (Uₘₛ < 0.010 m/s). However, Uₘₛ decreased with temperature at a high superficial fluidizing gas velocity (Uₘₛ > 0.020 m/s) because the amount of gas flow rate transferred from the fluidizing gas into the draft tube increases with temperature. Six flow patterns identified by pressure drop fluctuations and digital images show that the gas velocity ranges in the two flow regimes of spouting with aeration and spout–fluidization are narrow or limited at 500 K compared with those at 293 K. The effect of temperature on these hydrodynamic performance indexes should be considered in the use and design of spout–fluid beds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3achemistry 3adigital images 3aengineering 3ahydrodynamics 3atemperature1 aGuo Qingjie,1 aLiu, Luyan0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 05, v. 53, no. 5 p.1999-2010dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie40344943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02976naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245015800177300001600335520145800351592002801809650002301837650001401860650001501874650000901889650001101898650002401909650001501933650002001948650001801968650001401986650001302000653001602013653002902029653000902058653001402067653001302081653002102094653001602115653002002131700002402151700002402175700003302199700003702232773011802269856008602387852000902473655001202482IND60605340420221120162051.0200712e201812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060534042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDíaz-Asencio, Lisbet12aA radioligand receptor binding assay for ciguatoxin monitoring in environmental samples: Method development and determination of quality control criteria  ap. 289-294.  aCiguatoxins are algal toxins responsible for tens of thousands of human intoxications yearly, both in tropical and subtropical endemic regions as well as worldwide through fish exportation. Previously developed methods for biotoxin surveillance in the environment and seafood include analytical methods and in vivo and in vitro bioassays. The radioligand receptor binding assay (r-RBA) is among the in vitro methodologies currently used for the detection and quantification of marine biotoxins. For the ciguatoxin group, the r-RBA has been widely used as a means to characterize the mode of action and as detection method in various biological matrices. Yet, screening methods have not been standardized, and the details of the ciguatoxin-specific r-RBA are not well-documented, which limit interlaboratory comparison and progress toward method validation. This work presents the development of an optimized r-RBA for ciguatoxins and provides guidance on its use and quality control checks for analysis of environmental samples. We focus on the analysis of critical parameters involved in determining assay acceptability. Calculation of toxin concentrations in fish samples is illustrated with four examples. Thus, this paper provides the detailed information required for a full validation of the r-RBA, a necessary step toward the development and implementation of a regulatory monitoring programme for ciguatoxins in seafood products using the r-RBA.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3abioassays 3aciguatoxin 3afish 3ahumans 3amechanism of action 3amonitoring 3aquality control 3aradioactivity 3ascreening 3aseafoods 0aCiguatoxins 0aEnvironmental monitoring 0aFish 0aCiguatera 0aToxicity 0aDetection method 0aRadioligand 0aQuality control1 aClausing, Rachel J.1 aRañada, Ma Llorina1 aAlonso-Hernández, Carlos M.1 aDechraoui Bottein, Marie-Yasmine0 tJournal of environmental radioactivity.g2018 Dec., v. 192 p.289-294dElsevier LtdwJournal:2014x0265-931X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2018.06.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01292naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245006700210300001100277506007600288520018100364592002800545506003700573650001100610650001500621650001400636650001100650650001500661650002000676650002000696700002000716773010300736856008200839852000900921655001200930IND60124374120221207102841.0210827e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012437412DNAL7 a259085132pmid7 aPMC44085962pmcid7 a10.1186/s13059-015-0635-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLibbrecht, Romain14aThe making of eusociality: insights from two bumblebee genomes  ap. 75.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe genomes of two bumblebee species characterized by a lower level of sociality than ants and honeybees provide new insights into the origin and evolution of insect societies.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBombus 3aFormicidae 3aevolution 3agenome 3ahoney bees 3ainsect colonies 3asocial behavior1 aKeller, Laurent0 pGenomeBiology.comg2015 Dec., v. 16, no. 1 p.75-75dBioMed CentralwJournal:26753x1465-69067nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0635-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245013500156300001800291520150300309592002801812650001301840650000901853650003101862650002101893650000701914650003401921650002701955650003401982650002402016650003302040650002202073650001302095650001602108700001602124700001902140700001702159700001702176700001502193773012802208856007402336852000902410655001202419IND60638436020221118140203.0190429e20161117xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063843602DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay02739c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCheng, Zhen10aHighly sensitive and selective detection of perfluorooctane sulfonate based on the Janus Green B resonance light scattering method  ap. 8042-8048.  aA simple, highly sensitive and selective assay method has been developed for the determination of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a kind of emerging persistent organic pollutant, which is bio-accumulative, resistant to degradation and toxic. It was found that PFOS can form complexes with protonated Janus Green B (JGB) through electrostatic interaction in pH 5.8 citric acid–sodium citrate (CA–NaCA) buffer medium resulting in a remarkable enhancement of the resonance light scattering (RLS) intensity of the system. The study shows that the maximum scattering wavelength is located at 319.0 nm and the enhanced RLS intensities are in proportion to the concentration of PFOS in the range of 0.05–9.0 μmol L⁻¹ (R² = 0.9958), with a detection limit of 5.6 nmol L⁻¹ (3σ). Under the same experimental conditions, various perfluorinated compounds (PFPrA, PFBA, PFPeA, PFHeA, PFHpA, PFOA, PFNA, and PFBS) and JGB interactions were studied and the scattering signal changes very little. Based on the above discussion, a simple, highly sensitive and selective resonance light scattering analysis method was established for the detection of PFOS. In this work, the optimum reaction conditions were investigated. The reaction mechanism between JGB and PFOS was also studied by the absorption spectrum, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the combination ratio and so on. This method is successfully applied to the selective detection of PFOS in environmental water samples with RSD ≤2.7%.  aPublisher supplied data 3acitrates 3adyes 3aelectrostatic interactions 3alight scattering 3apH 3aperfluorooctane sulfonic acid 3aperfluorooctanoic acid 3apersistent organic pollutants 3areaction mechanisms 3ascanning electron microscopy 3aspectral analysis 3atoxicity 3awavelengths1 aZhang, Fang1 aChen, Xianping1 aDu, Lingling1 aGao, Chutong1 aTan, Kejun0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Nov. 17, v. 8, no. 45 p.8042-8048dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c6ay02739c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01798naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002100140245011300161300001800274520072600292592002801018650001501046650002001061650001001081650001901091650001501110650001101125650002201136650001801158650001301176700003601189700001201225773012801237856007401365852000901439655001201448IND60638436120221118140235.0190429e20161124xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063843612DNAL7 a10.1039/c6ay02753a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMoening, Tara N.10aMatrix-enhanced nanostructure initiator mass spectrometry (ME-NIMS) for small molecule detection and imaging  ap. 8234-8240.  aWe describe here the development of a new hybrid ionization approach, matrix-enhanced nanostructure initiator mass spectrometry (ME-NIMS).

The full lengths of MHC class II A and B cDNA were cloned from turbot by homology cloning and rapid amplification of cDNA ends polymerase chain reaction (RACE PCR), and genomic organization, molecular polymorphism, and expression of turbot class IIB gene were examined to study the function of class IIB gene in fish. The deduced amino acid sequence of turbot class II A (GenBank accession no.DQ001730) and turbot class IIB (GenBank accession no. DQ094170) had 69.8%, 67.6%, 65.5%, 59.2%, 54.5%, 52.8%, 46.2%, 46.6%, 28.3%, 28.5%, 22.2% identity and 71.5%, 70.7%, 67.1%, 68.4%, 46.7%, 53.5%, 46.7%, 50.0%, 25.2%, 29.2%, 27.6% identity with those of Japanese flounder, striped sea bass, red sea bream, cichlid, rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, carp, zebrafish, nurse shark, mouse and human, respectively. Eleven class IIB alleles were identified from three turbot individuals. The amino acid sequence of turbot class IIB designated as Scma-DAB*0101 had 86.9%, 88.6%, 88.6%, 89.4%, 87.8%, 86.9%, 84.1%, 86.5%, 87.3%, 77.1%, and 86.9% identity with those of turbot class IIB 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 (Scma-DAB*0201- Scma-DAB*1201), respectively. Six different class IIB alleles observed in a single individual may infer the existence of three loci at least. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated that turbot class IIA and B were ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues. Challenge of turbot with pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio anguillarum, resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of MHC class IIB mRNA from 24 h to 48 h after infection in liver and head kidney, and a significant decrease from 24 h to 72 h after infection in spleen, followed by an increase after 96 h, respectively.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCichlidae 3aDanio rerio 3aGinglymostoma cirratum 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aPagrus major 3aParalichthys olivaceus 3aSalmo salar 3aScophthalmus maximus 3aT-lymphocytes 3aVibrio anguillarum 3aadaptive immunity 3aalleles 3aamino acid sequences 3abacteria 3abass 3acarp 3acomplementary DNA 3aflounder 3ahumans 3akidneys 3aliver 3aloci 3amajor histocompatibility complex 3amessenger RNA 3amice 3anucleotide sequences 3apeptides 3arapid amplification of cDNA ends 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3aspleen 3atissues 3aturbot1 aChen, Song-Lin0 tMarine biotechnology.g2006 Dec., v. 8, no. 6 p.611-623dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-005-6174-y3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02523naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245011800173300001300291506002800304520075400332592002801086506003701114650001201151650001101163650001101174650001301185650001201198650002201210653002501232653004401257653003801301653004601339653002301385653001301408653001001421653002101431653002701452653002301479653002801502653001701530653001801547653001801565653001401583653001001597653001301607653002801620700002001648700002201668773018301690856008701873852000901960655001201969IND60739801420221207123105.0200116e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073980142DNAL7 a10.30901/2227-8834-2017-4-5-212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurlyaeva, M.

They have very high demand, especially the young ones. There are high morphological similarity and different market values between different species. For these reasons arises the need to develop techniques that allow identifying as many species as possible. In this study, a DNA method based on DNA phylogenetic analysis of sequences (forensically informative nucleotide sequencing) has been developed. This method has been used to authenticate 12 eel species, including the most important to commercial level (Anguilla anguilla, A. rostrata, A. japonica, A. australis), by means of the amplification of a 239-base pair (bp) fragment of the mitochondrial Cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. This method is useful to clarify questions related to the correct labeling of commercial products and to verify the traceability in commercial trade and for fisheries control.  aPublisher supplied data 3asequence analysis 3aAnguilla anguilla 3amarket value 3aeel 3aDNA 3asteaks 3aphylogeny 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3acytochrome b 3afisheries 3atraceability 0alabeling1 aVieites, Juan M.1 aEspiñeira, Montserrat0 tEuropean food research & technology.g2012 Apr., v. 234, no. 4 p.689-694dSpringer-Verlagx1438-23777nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00217-012-1672-4  aDNAL 7aarticle03681naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100005900141245013700200300001400337520209300351592002802444650002102472650002002493650001502513650001802528650001602546650001902562650001502581650001502596650001502611650001802626650001802644650001402662650001602676651001302692653003102705653002702736653002702763653003302790653003202823653001402855653002402869700002502893700005902918773012502977856007603102852000903178655001203187IND60764347020221119231448.0220128e20210730xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076434702DNAL7 a10.1017/wsc.2021.522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrewer, John R.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6492-129610aDifferences in Selectivity between Bermudagrass and Goosegrass (Eleusine indica) to Low-Rate Topramezone and Metribuzin Combinations  ap. 55-63.  aGoosegrass [Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn.] remains problematic for bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] turf managers due to the ineffective, selective control of mature plants with available postemergence herbicides and lack of sufficient residual activity from those herbicides to control seedling plants. Topramezone controls mature E. indica, but past efforts to suppress potential injury to bermudagrass turf have been inconsistent. We hypothesized that metribuzin at 210 g ai ha–¹ in admixture with topramezone would improve bermudagrass tolerance while conserving mature E. indica control. In preliminary field studies, metribuzin mixed with topramezone at 1.2 or 2.5 g ae ha–¹ applied twice at a 3-wk interval reduced bermudagrass injury and white discoloration compared with topramezone applied alone, but metribuzin did not safen bermudagrass to mesotrione. Topramezone at 3.7 g ha–¹ plus 210 g ha–¹ metribuzin applied twice at a 3-wk interval offered improved bermudagrass tolerance while it still controlled mature E. indica during 15 field and 2 greenhouse studies in Virginia. This program offered a 10-fold decrease in suprathreshold duration of white discoloration compared with topramezone alone at 6.1 g ha–¹. Bermudagrass absorbed three times less radioactivity than E. indica at timings up to 48 h after treatment with [¹⁴C]topramezone. Bermudagrass also metabolized twice as much topramezone compared with E. indica at 48 h after treatment. Metribuzin reduced ¹⁴C absorption by approximately 25% in both species. These studies confirm the performance of a novel, low-dose topramezone plus metribuzin program for mature E. indica control in bermudagrass turf and suggest that selectivity between bermudagrass and E. indica to topramezone is due to differential absorption and metabolism. The fact that metribuzin reduces topramezone absorption in both species suggests that it may help reduce bermudagrass phytotoxic response to topramezone, but its role in altering selectivity between bermudagrass and E. indica may be due to other factors.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCynodon dactylon 3aEleusine indica 3aabsorption 3adiscoloration 3agreenhouses 3alawns and turf 3amesotrione 3ametabolism 3ametribuzin 3aphytotoxicity 3aradioactivity 3aseedlings 3atopramezone 3aVirginia 0aDays over injury threshold 0adigital image analysis 0atopramezone absorption 0atranslocation and metabolism 0aturf dark-green color index 0aturfgrass 0awhite discoloration1 aAskew, Whitnee L.

More specific properties, such as charge distribution, circulating half-life and bioactivity, are directly impacted by sialic acid content. Undesirable loss of protein sialylation is commonly observed in CHO bioprocesses, and sialic acid degradation is one of the root causes. In this work, sialic acid degradation by extracellular sialidase was investigated in an Fc-fusion protein production bioprocess. First, cell-free incubation with the cell culture supernatant (CCS) collected at the end of culture revealed a 12.46% drop in sialic acid content by sialidase after 6 days of incubation, while other monosaccharides on the glycans remained stable. Then, potential factors that could affect the action of sialidase were studied, and a pH of over 7.05 was found to have a strong inhibitory effect on the degradation of sialic acid in the CCS. The results were further validated in bioreactors with different pH controls to demonstrate that a minimization of sialic acid loss could be achieved by controlling pH at higher values. Our work provides a simple and effective way to alleviate the decrease in sialic acid content and improves the understanding of the relationship between process control and product sialylation in CHO bioprocesses.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioactive properties 3abioprocessing 3abioreactors 3acell culture 3aglycoproteins 3ahalf life 3amonosaccharides 3apH 3apolysaccharides 3aprocess control 3aprotein synthesis 3asialic acid 3asialidase 3atherapeutics 0aChinese hamster ovary cells 0aFc-fusion protein 0aSialic acid 0aSialidase 0apH1 aLiu, Jintao1 aLiu, Xuping1 aFan, Li1 aZhao, Liang1 aTan, Wen-Song1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9857-47980 tProcess biochemistry.g2018 Oct., v. 73 p.162-169dElsevier LtdwJournal:12511x1359-51137nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procbio.2018.08.0153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100003200138245009800170300001600268520086200284592002801146650001201174650001201186650002001198650001801218650001501236650002201251650000901273650002201282650002101304650001501325650002301340650001401363650001201377650002301389651001001412700002001422700002001442700002101462700001901483700001701502700001801519773010701537856007201644852000901716655001201725IND60342770820221121124014.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034277082DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.22522doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWildemeersch, Jasmien C.

These degraded lands, however, generally provide poor yields, which is largely assigned to an increased vulnerability to drought, as a major part of the rainfall is lost through inefficient rain water distribution. More efficient use of rainwater can be achieved with the aid of water and soil conservation (WSC) techniques, which positively alter the soil water balance in favour of productive water. In Niger, zaï and demi‐lunes WSC techniques improve yields, but their adoption has not been widespread, and the dissemination generally encounters difficulties.

S38-S42.  aInformation on the presence or absence of airborne spores or other particles would be useful in an increasing number of areas including agriculture. Traditional methods used for detecting and enumerating of airborne spores of fungal plant pathogens are time consuming and require specialist knowledge. Some spore types (e.g. ascospores) are difficult to differentiate using these methods. To facilitate this, new methods, which can be used to accurately differentiate fungal spore types, are required. A Burkard 7-day volumetric spore trap used in combination with an immunofluorescence test has been developed to detect and quantify field-trapped ascosporic inoculum of Mycosphaerella brassicicola (the ringspot pathogen of brassicas). This test has also been found useful in the validation of more rapid user-friendly immunoassay based trapping procedures. A microtiter immunospore trapping device, which uses a suction system to directly trap air-particulates by impaction into microtiter wells, has been used successfully for the rapid detection and quantification of ascosporic inoculum of M. brassicicola. The system shows potential for the rapid field-detection of airborne ascosporic inoculum of the ringspot pathogen.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMycosphaerella 3aascospores 3afluorescent antibody technique 3aimmunoassays 3ainoculum 3aplant protection 3arapid methods 3aspore traps1 aWakeham, A.J.0 tPlant Protection Science.g, v. 38, no.

The experiments were designed according to a 2×3 factorial design, where the factors were: two protein sources (fish or plant meals) and three methods of applying OAB to the diets (none, before, or after extrusion). In Exp. 1, duplicate groups of 0.95-kg trout were used to assess the effect of OAB on digestibility of nutrients. The supplementation of OAB before extrusion in the plant protein-based diet significantly reduced the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude fat, and most amino acids. Supplementation of OAB after extrusion reduced the digestibility of crude fat both in the fishmeal and plant protein-based diets. Partly replacing fishmeal with plant proteins reduced the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude fat, phosphorous and several amino acids. In Exp. 2, triplicate groups of 0.23-kg trout were used to evaluate the effect of OAB on growth performance and gut health. Supplementation of OAB in both fishmeal and plant protein-based diets before extrusion significantly increased feed conversion ratio, and middle intestine to body weight ratio. Partly replacing fishmeal with plant proteins significantly increased feed conversion ratio. There was no effect of dietary treatment on morphology in the distal intestine. In conclusion, supplementing diets with a sodium formate and butyrate blend did not improve growth rate or feed utilization of rainbow trout. Replacing 36% fishmeal with a combination of soybean meal and pea protein concentrate negatively influenced the nutrient digestibility and feed conversion ratio, but did not affect the growth rate of rainbow trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aorganic matter 3alipids 3adigestibility 3anutrients 3aplant proteins 3aprotein concentrates 3apeas 3aamino acids 3aintestines 3asodium 3atrout 3afeed supplements 3adigestible protein 3abutyrates 3aprotein sources 3abody weight 3afeed conversion 3aextrusion 3aorganic salts 3amixtures 3afish meal 3asoybean meal 3amixing 3aexperimental design 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 0aplants1 aStorebakken, Trond1 aShearer, Karl D.1 aPenn, Michael1 aØverland, Margareth0 tAquaculture.g2011 Feb. 3, v. 311, no. 1-4 p.233-240dElsevier B.V.x0044-84867nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.11.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02835naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002300139245013600162300002000298520152600318592002801844650001501872650001201887650002301899650001201922650002001934650002201954650001301976650001301989650001802002650001902020650000902039650001602048650001502064650001102079650001302090650001402103700003302117700002902150700002502179773010102204856007502305852000902380655001202389IND60576819220221121040053.0170806e20130813xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057681922DNAL7 a10.1021/la402148b2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNalam, Prathima
C.10aExploring Lubrication Regimes at the Nanoscale: Nanotribological Characterization of Silica and Polymer Brushes in Viscous Solvents  ap. 10149-10158.  aNanotribological properties of silica surfaces, with and without adsorbed, brushlike copolymers of poly(l-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLL-g-PEG) and poly(l-lysine)-graft-dextran (PLL-g-dextran) have been investigated in aqueous viscous solvent mixtures by means of colloid-probe lateral force microscopy. Lateral forces for PEG/dextran brushes have been measured as a function of shear velocity in aqueous mixtures of glycerol and ethylene glycol (EG), which are highly miscible with water, but are poor solvents for hydrophilic PEG and dextran chains. Prior to the friction measurements on polymer brushes, a nanoscale Stribeck curve was obtained on a bare silica surface in the selected aqueous cosolvent mixtures. The Stribeck curve for bare surfaces indicates the existence of a surface-solvating thin film due to the adsorption of hydrated ions, preventing direct silica–silica contact in the boundary-lubrication regime. A clear transition to the hydrodynamic regime is seen at high speeds for solvents with higher viscosities. The polymer brushes, however, show a shear-thinning effect with increasing shear speed and a combined influence of polymer film and solvent viscosity on the measured friction forces. The formation of an interfacial fluid-film is shown to shift the hydrodynamic regime of hydrated brushes to a lower value of Uη. The correlation between the structural configuration and the corresponding frictional properties of the polymer brushes upon changing solvent quality is discussed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abrushes 3acomposite polymers 3adextran 3aethylene glycol 3afilms (materials) 3afriction 3aglycerol 3ahydrodynamics 3ahydrophilicity 3aions 3alubrication 3amicroscopy 3asilica 3asolvents 3aviscosity1 aRamakrishna, Shivaprakash N.1 aEspinosa-Marzal, Rosa M.1 aSpencer, Nicholas D.0 tLangmuir.g2013 Aug. 13, v. 29, no. 32 p.10149-10158dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fla402148b3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010400165300001600269520167300285592002801958650001201986650001601998650001302014650001202027650002002039650001102059650001602070650002102086650001602107650001202123650001602135650002102151651001402172653002902186653002002215653002802235653002202263653003502285653002102320700001902341700001902360700001802379773012602397856005102523852000902574655001202583IND50087912120221118183750.0140412e20111201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008791212DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2011.6487752doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPham, Ngoc10aEffects of submerged tropical macrophytes on flow resistance and velocity profiles in open channels  ap. 195-203.  aIn this paper, the results of flume experiments are presented, conducted to investigate the effect of different submerged flexible plant species on flow resistance and flow patterns in open channels. Three common plant types in tropical regions were selected: Cabomba caroliniana, a quite flexible fully submerged species; Echinodorus grandiflorus, a somewhat less flexible, fully submerged species; and Nymphaea rubra, a rooted species with floating leaves. For each plant type, three different densities were tested for various discharges, water depths, and depths of plant submergence. The flow resistance was expressed in terms of the commonly used Manning coefficient n. The results indicate that among the particular plant species investigated here, the floating leaf species N. rubra exhibits the lowest flow resistance (Manning's n = 0.014), viz. less than half the values for C. caroliniana and E. grandiflorus, respectively. A detailed analysis showed that this is due to the particular plant morphology, consisting of relatively large biomass (floating leaves) with only small stem density. It was observed that the flow resistance not only strongly and inversely depends on the Reynolds number, but also on the degree of plant submergence (i.e. water depth/deflected plant height ratio), and on the density of the vegetated plant beds. It appears that the biomass/drag force ratio seems of less importance. From the measured velocity profiles, the influence of the various types of vegetation species could clearly be observed. These factors are important for the design and management of vegetated open channels in tropical urban areas like Singapore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCabomba 3aEchinodorus 3aNymphaea 3abiomass 3aflow resistance 3aleaves 3amacrophytes 3aplant morphology 3asubmergence 3atropics 3aurban areas 3avegetation types 3aSingapore 0aEcohydraulic experiments 0avegetated flows 0aopen channel hydraulics 0avelocity profiles 0amacrophytes-induced turbulence 0aplant resistance1 aPenning, Ellis1 aMynett, Arthur1 aRaghuraj, Rao0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2011 Dec. 1, v. 9, no. 3-4 p.195-203dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2011.648775  aDNAL 7aarticle04085naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006000139245011100199300001600310500002000326520213800346592002802484596003702512596005702549650001302606650000902619650001102628650002202639650002402661650001102685650001202696650001102708650001302719650001902732650001002751650002102761651002002782700002202802700002002824700001902844700003102863700002302894700002102917700002202938700002002960700002602980700002103006700002503027700006203052700006303114700001903177700001903196700002503215700002203240773012703262856007303389852000903462655001203471IND60627911220221122162427.0190128e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062791122DNAL7 a10.1111/ddi.128392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBleyhl, Benjamin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4858-950X10aAssessing niche overlap between domestic and threatened wild sheep to identify conservation priority areas  ap. 129-141.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aAIM: Populations of large ungulates are dwindling worldwide. This is especially so for wild sheep, which compete with livestock for forage, are disturbed by shepherds and their dogs, and are exposed to disease transmissions from livestock. Our aim was to assess spatial patterns in realized niche overlap between wild and domestic sheep to better understand where potential competition might arise, and thus to identify priority areas for wild sheep recovery. LOCATION: Southern Caucasus (220,000 km²). METHODS: We studied Gmelin's mouflon (Ovis orientalis gmelinii), an ancestor of domestic sheep, to investigate seasonal habitat use and niche overlap with domestic sheep. To map habitat, we analysed mouflon occurrences collected during 2006–2016, and domestic sheep occurrences from shepherd camp locations digitized on high‐resolution satellite imagery. We mapped areas of potential competition between mouflon and domestic sheep and assessed potential habitat displacement. RESULTS: Mouflon and domestic sheep niches overlapped substantially (overlap index I = 0.89, where 1 means perfect overlap) but were not identical. Mouflon habitat was less widespread than domestic sheep habitat (14,000 vs. 40,270 km²) and tended to be located in more rugged areas with less vegetation cover. We identified 51 priority patches as reintroduction candidates if grazing pressure and poaching were reduced. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that competition with domestic sheep might have pushed mouflon into marginal habitat. Thus, conservation efforts focusing on current mouflon habitat might miss suitable reintroduction sites. We demonstrate that a combined habitat model for wild and domestic sheep can identify general sheep habitat, which might be more useful for conservation planning than understanding current mouflon habitat selection. Our results highlight that considering competition with livestock is important for large ungulate conservation, both in terms of reactive (e.g., lessening livestock pressure in prime habitat) and proactive strategies (e.g., reintroduction in areas with low contemporary overlap).  aPublisher supplied data  cFederal State of Berlin, Germany  cWorld Land Trust through the Iranian Cheetah Society 3aancestry 3adogs 3aforage 3agrazing intensity 3ahabitat preferences 3amodels 3amouflon 3aniches 3aplanning 3aremote sensing 3asheep 3avegetation cover 3aCaucasus region1 aArakelyan, Marine1 aAskerov, Elshad1 aBluhm, Hendrik1 aGavashelishvili, Alexander1 aGhasabian, Mamikon1 aGhoddousi, Arash1 aHeidelberg, Aurel1 aKhorozyan, Igor1 aMalkhasyan, Alexander1 aManvelyan, Karen1 aMasoud, Mohammadreza1 aMoqanaki, Ehsan M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7968-02101 aRadeloff, Volker C.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9004-221X1 aSoofi, Mahmood1 aWeinberg, Paul1 aZazanashvili, Nugzar1 aKuemmerle, Tobias0 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.129-141dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128393Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01966naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245010800165300001300273520083600286592002801122650002001150650001401170650001101184650001501195650001101210650001501221653001101236653001601247653001201263653001701275653001401292700002201306700002701328700001501355700001601370773012201386856005101508852000901559655001201568IND50087912320221118183757.0140412e20120301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008791232DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2011.6253592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBogner, K.10aImproving the evaluation of hydrological multi-model forecast performance in the Upper Danube Catchment  ap. 1-12.  aMedium range flood forecasting activities, driven by various meteorological forecasts ranging from high resolution deterministic forecasts to low spatial resolution ensemble prediction systems, share a major challenge in the appropriateness and design of performance measures.

Some simple modifications are applied in order to circumvent the problem of the autocorrelation dominating river discharge time-series and in order to create a benchmark model enabling the decision makers to evaluate the forecast quality and the model quality. Although the performance period is quite short the advantage of a simple cost-loss function as a measure of forecast quality can be demonstrated.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautocorrelation 3ahydrology 3amodels 3aprediction 3arivers 3awatersheds 0aFloods 0aforecasting 0aquality 0averification 0acost-loss1 aCloke, Hannah L.,1 aPappenberger, Florian,1 aDe Roo, A.1 aThielen, J.0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2012 Mar. 1, v. 10, no. 1 p.1-12dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2011.625359  aDNAL 7aarticle03064naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002900152245014700181300001800328520164300346592002801989650003002017650002602047650002902073650002502102650002502127650001702152650001102169650002602180650002702206650001402233650002202247650003002269650001402299650002802313650002602341650001102367700001702378700002502395700001702420773011702437856005502554852000902609655001202618IND4510561620221119212234.0150730e200208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND451056162DNAL7 a10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03104.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDomergue, FrÃ©dÃ©ric10aCloning and functional characterization of Phaeodactylum tricornutum frontâend desaturases involved in eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis  ap. 4105-4113.  aPhaeodactylum tricornutum is an unicellular silicaâless diatom in which eicosapentaenoic acid accumulates up to 30% of the total fatty acids. This marine diatom was used for cloning genes encoding fatty acid desaturases involved in eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis. Using a combination of PCR, mass sequencing and library screening, the coding sequences of two desaturases were identified. Both protein sequences contained a cytochromeâb5 domain fused to the Nâterminus and the three histidine clusters common to all frontâend fatty acid desaturases. The full length clones were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and characterized as Î5â and Î6âfatty acid desaturases. The substrate specificity of each enzyme was determined and confirmed their involvement in eicosapentaenoic acid biosynthesis. Using both desaturases in combination with the Î6âspecific elongase from Physcomitrella patens, the biosynthetic pathways of arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acid were reconstituted in yeast. These reconstitutions indicated that these two desaturases functioned in the Ï3â and Ï6âpathways, in good agreement with both routes coexisting in Phaeodactylum tricornutum. Interestingly, when the substrate selectivity of each enzyme was determined, both desaturases converted the Ï3â and Ï6âfatty acids with similar efficiencies, indicating that none of them was specific for either the Ï3â or the Ï6âpathway. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the isolation and biochemical characterization of fatty acid desaturases from diatoms.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aPhyscomitrella patens 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aamino acid sequences 3abiochemical pathways 3abiosynthesis 3aclones 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3afatty acid composition 3ahistidine 3amolecular cloning 3apolymerase chain reaction 3ascreening 3astearoyl-CoA desaturase 3asubstrate specificity 3ayeasts1 aLerchl, Jens1 aZÃ¤hringer, Ulrich1 aHeinz, Ernst0 tEuropean journal of biochemistry.g2002 Aug., v. 269, no. 16 p.4105-4113dBlackwell Science Ltdx0014-29567nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03104.x  aDNAL 7aarticle04134naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002900188245009600217300001200313506007600325520251000401592002802911506003702939650002702976650002003003650002503023650001003048650001803058650002203076650002203098650001103120650001303131650001403144650001303158650005203171650002203223650001403245700001703259700001903276700002003295700002303315700001703338700001803355700002603373700002303399773009203422856008103514852000903595655001203604IND60124374820221207102840.0161029e201512  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012437482DNAL7 a10.1186/s13071-015-0834-12doi7 aPMC44073942pmcid7 a258889172pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHebert, Francois Olivier10aIdentification of candidate mimicry proteins involved in parasite-driven phenotypic changes  ap. 225.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Endoparasites with complex life cycles are faced with several biological challenges, as they need to occupy various ecological niches throughout their development. Host phenotypes that increase the parasite’s transmission rate to the next host have been extensively described, but few mechanistic explanations have been proposed to describe their proximate causes. In this study we explore the possibility that host phenotypic changes are triggered by the production of mimicry proteins from the parasite by using an ecological model system consisting of the infection of the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) by the cestode Schistocephalus solidus. METHOD: Using RNA-seq data, we assembled 9,093 protein-coding genes from which ORFs were predicted to generate a reference proteome. Based on a previously published method, we built two complementary analysis pipelines to i) establish a general classification of protein similarity among various species (pipeline A) and ii) identify candidate mimicry proteins showing specific host-parasite similarities (pipeline B), a key feature underlying the possibility of molecular mimicry. RESULTS: Ninety-four tapeworm proteins showed high local sequence homology with stickleback proteins. Four of these candidates correspond to secreted or membrane proteins that could be produced by the parasite and eventually be released in or be in contact with the host to modulate physiological pathways involved in various phenotypes (e.g. behaviors). One of these candidates belongs to the Wnt family, a large group of signaling molecules involved in cell-to-cell interactions and various developmental pathways. The three other candidates are involved in ion transport and post-translational protein modifications. We further confirmed that these four candidates are expressed in three different developmental stages of the cestode by RT-PCR, including the stages found in the host. CONCLUSION: In this study, we identified mimicry candidate peptides from a behavior-altering cestode showing specific sequence similarity with host proteins. Despite their potential role in modulating host pathways that could lead to parasite-induced phenotypic changes and despite our confirmation that they are expressed in the developmental stage corresponding to the altered host behavior, further investigations will be needed to confirm their mechanistic role in the molecular cross-talk taking place between S. solidus and the threespine stickleback.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGasterosteus aculeatus 3aSchistocephalus 3adevelopmental stages 3agenes 3aion transport 3amembrane proteins 3amolecular mimicry 3aniches 3apeptides 3aphenotype 3aproteome 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3asequence homology 3atapeworms1 aPhelps, Luke1 aSamonte, Irene1 aPanchal, Mahesh1 aGrambauer, Stephan1 aBarber, Iain1 aKalbe, Martin1 aLandry, Christian R.,1 aAubin-Horth, Nadia0 tParasites & vectors.g2015 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.225-225dBioMed Centralx1756-33057nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13071-015-0834-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02464naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245012800163300001600291520119600307592002801503650002201531650001401553650002801567650001401595650002001609650002401629650001001653650001601663650001301679650001701692650001101709650001401720650001101734650001001745650001201755650001301767650002201780700001701802700001501819700001701834773009801851856004801949852000901997655001202006IND50066493620221122052858.0130605e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006649362DNAL7 a10.1007/s10340-012-0467-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVijayan, S.10aDefensin (TvD1) from Tephrosia villosa exhibited strong anti-insect and anti-fungal activities in transgenic tobacco plants  ap. 337-344.  aPlant defensin is a small, cationic, cysteine-rich broad-spectrum antimicrobial peptide with four or five disulfide bridges and has been shown to be a component of the innate immunity system in plants. In the present study, the defensin gene (TvD1) from Tephrosia villosa was overexpressed in tobacco and characterized. Two high-expression (T1, T26) and one low-expression (T13) plant lines were selected through semi-quantitative RT-PCR and used for bioassays along with non-transgenic controls. The high-expression plant line exhibited strong in vivo anti-fungal and anti-feedant activity against the pathogen Rhizoctonia solani and the first and second instar larvae of the Spodoptera litura (F.), the tobacco cutworm, respectively. The low-expression plant line showed a moderate level of tolerance/resistance in the bioassays. The recombinant peptide (rTvD1) exhibited toxicity to tobacco pollen grains in the germination assay, but transgenic plants produced copious fertile pollen and set capsules with viable seeds. The results of this study demonstrate that the single gene (TvD1) effectively controls both fungal and insect pests and, hence, it can be used for crop transformation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSpodoptera litura 3aTephrosia 3aThanatephorus cucumeris 3abioassays 3adisulfide bonds 3agene overexpression 3agenes 3agermination 3aimmunity 3ainsect pests 3alarvae 3apathogens 3apollen 3aseeds 3atobacco 3atoxicity 3atransgenic plants1 aSingh, N.

While numerous studies use species distribution models (SDMs) to predict species’ future distributions, relatively few investigate potential climatic impacts on the spatial structure of genetic diversity, and how it varies across species ranges. We revisited phylogeographic data for three New Zealand forest beetles to predict the effects of climate change on the geographic distributions, genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure for each species. LOCATION: New Zealand METHODS: We used ensemble SDMs to predict potential distributions for Agyrtodes labralis (Leiodidae), Brachynopus scutellaris (Staphylinidae) and Epistranus lawsoni (Zopheridae) in 2035, 2065 and 2100. To assess the impact of predicted range loss on genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure, we estimated haplotype and nucleotide diversity, ΦST, Average Taxonomic Distinctness (AvTax), Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) and Net Relatedness Index (NRI) under current and future climatic scenarios, excluding sequences from localities predicted to become unsuitable. We tested whether predicted population loss was spatially clustered and how losses were distributed across the phylogenies of each species. RESULTS: Agyrtodes labralis is predicted to lose parts of its current distribution by 2100, with the loss of 50% of unique haplotypes and a significant reduction in PD, while Brachynopus scutellaris and Epistranus lawsoni will likely experience an expansion in climatically suitable area and little change in genetic diversity. Brachynopus scutellaris populations are predicted to be more phylogenetically clustered than expected by 2100, but changes in AvTax were negligible for all species. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the loss of genetic diversity under climate change is significant; however, intraspecific lineages with deep genetic divergences are widely distributed, buffering against greater change in phylogeographic structure. For species with strong geographic clustering of genetic diversity, climate change impacts may be quite different.  aPublisher supplied data  aVKR023120cVillum Fonden  cDet Frie Forskningsråd  aDNRF96cDanmarks Grundforskningsfond 3aLeiodidae 3aStaphylinidae 3aZopheridae 3abiodiversity 3aclimate change 3aforests 3agenetic variation 3ageographical distribution 3ahaplotypes 3amodels 3aphylogeny 3aphylogeography 3aNew Zealand1 aKennedy, Jonathan D.1 aNogués‐Bravo, David1 aMarske, Katharine A.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9837-93670 tDiversity & distributions.g2019 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.142-153dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3867071x1366-95167nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ddi.128343Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002600094040001800120100001500138245010100153300001600254520175100270592002802021650001302049650001902062650001702081650001902098650000802117650001502125650003002140650002502170650002202195650002202217650001902239650001902258650001602277650001302293650001802306650003102324650001502355650002202370650001502392650001702407650001302424651001002437700002002447773010702467856007202574852000902646655001202655IND60342771520221121124043.0150810e201507  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6034277152DNAL7 a10.1002/ldr.23582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Siyuan10aImpact of Meadow Degradation on Soil Water Status and Pasture Management—A Case Study in Tibet  ap. 468-479.  aAlpine meadow dominated by Kobresia pygmaea forms both an important ecosystem and the main pasture resource on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau, and its degradation is detrimental to ecosystem health and the pastoral economy. This paper reports research on the impacts of possible degradation on soil and biological properties related to water status, as water availability is fundamental to grass productivity. It also considers herders' perceptions towards, and adaptation to, the changing environment. The research was carried out in and around Kema village in Nagqu Prefecture, Northern Tibet. The biotic and abiotic properties of the K. pygmaea meadow are significantly different in patches with diverse soil and vegetation combinations, which include normal meadow, crusted meadow, and bare soil. Change of species composition, low species diversity, coarsening of soil, and lack of soil moisture and organic matter are found under bare soil after erosion of the turf layer. Low infiltration rates and reduced dew deposition are found under crusted meadow. Herders have witnessed some aspects of the deterioration of meadow quality and have noticed some climatic variations. However, they do not consistently link changing meadow quality to climate change and rarely have a clear idea of what overgrazing is, as although their mobility has been reduced, they may think that they are still using pastures periodically as in transhumance. Adapting current privatisation policies by considering herders' traditions and needs, and balancing scientific knowledge with local perception and knowledge, will help to guarantee long‐term benefits through sustainable use of the fragile alpine meadow resource.

Here we used a mouse model of melanoma in which melanocyte-specific expression of Braf ⱽ⁶¹⁸ᴱ (analogous to the human BRAF ⱽ⁶⁰⁰ᴱ mutation) led to the development of skin hyperpigmentation and nevi, as well as melanoma formation with incomplete penetrance. Sleeping Beauty insertional mutagenesis in this model led to accelerated and fully penetrant melanomagenesis and synchronous tumor formation. Treatment of Braf ⱽ⁶¹⁸ᴱ transposon mice with the BRAF inhibitor PLX4720 resulted in tumor regression followed by relapse. Analysis of transposon insertions identified eight genes including Braf, Mitf , and ERas (ES-cell expressed Ras) as candidate resistance genes. Expression of ERAS in human melanoma cell lines conferred resistance to PLX4720 and induced hyperphosphorylation of AKT (v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1), a phenotype reverted by combinatorial treatment with PLX4720 and the AKT inhibitor MK2206. We show that ERAS expression elicits a prosurvival signal associated with phosphorylation/inactivation of BAD, and that the resistance of hepatocyte growth factor-treated human melanoma cells to PLX4720 can be reverted by treatment with the BAD-like BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Thus, we define a role for the AKT/BAD pathway in resistance to BRAF inhibition and illustrate an in vivo approach for finding drug resistance genes.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagonists 3aanimal models 3acell death 3amelanoma 3amice 3amutagenesis 3aprotein-serine-threonine kinases 3aproto-oncogenes 3aserine 3atherapeutics 3athreonine 3athymoma 3atransgenic animals 3atransposons 0amelanoma 0adrug resistance 0aBRAF inhibitors 0amouse models1 aKarreth, Florian A.1 aRust, Alistair G.1 aPerez-Mancera, Pedro A.1 aRaśīda, Māmunura,1 aIorio, Francesco1 aAlifrangis, Constantine1 aArends, Mark J.1 aBosenberg, Marcus W.1 aBollag, Gideon1 aTuveson, David A.1 aAdams, David J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2015 Feb. 10, v. 112, no. 6 p.E536-E545dNational Academy of ScienceswJournal:jnl45680x0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.14181631123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02173naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001500152245011800167520104100285592002801326650001501354650001201369650001201381650001101393650001501404650001501419653000901434653001201443653001201455653003301467653002501500700001501525700001201540700001901552700001401571773010601585856008701691852000901778655001201787IND60729077820221120160454.0220326e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072907782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Ying10aApplication of kernel extreme learning machine and Kriging model in prediction of heavy metals removal by biochar  aKernel extreme learning machine (KELM) and Kriging models are proposed to predict biochar adsorption efficiency of heavy metals. Both six popular ions (Pb²⁺, Cd²⁺, Zn²⁺, Cu²⁺, Ni²⁺, As³⁺) and single ion are considered to test the accuracy of KELM and Kriging models. Two ways (data selection and fix output value) are attempted to improve the model fitting accuracy and the best R² can reach 0.919 (KELM) and 0.980 (Kriging). In addition, stepwise regression and local sensitivity analysis show that adsorption efficiency has strong relationship with pHₛₒₗᵤₜₑ and T. Moreover, the most sensitive parameters are T, pHH₂O, r, C and pHₛₒₗᵤₜₑ. The accurate KELM and Kriging models identify the most important controlling factors on metal adsorption, and ultimately provide some sort of predictive framework that will be useful in selecting appropriate biochar for particular treatment scenarios. This, in turn, will reduce the number of metal-biochar adsorption experiments needed going forward.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3abiochar 3akriging 3amodels 3aprediction 3atechnology 0aKELM 0aKriging 0aBiochar 0aStepwise regression analysis 0aSensitivity analysis1 aLi, Yuelei1 aFan, Da1 aSong, Jingpeng1 aYang, Fan0 tBioresource technology.g2021 June, v. 329 p.124876-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02636naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002200188245008300210300001800293520093500311592002801246650002801274650002101302650001401323650001101337650001401348650001301362650001201375650004601387650004001433650005401473650001101527650003101538650000901569650002001578650001501598650004601613650003201659650001001691700002201701700002201723700002301745700002301768700002001791700002201811700002701833773010901860856008101969990002302050852000902073655001202082IND60090709020221120212601.0141102e20120515xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009070902DNAL7 a225206292pmid7 aPMC33450942pmcid7 a10.1016/j.bmc.2012.03.0432doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHughes, Philip F.12aA highly selective Hsp90 affinity chromatography resin with a cleavable linker  ap. 3298-3305.  aOver 200 proteins have been identified that interact with the protein chaperone Hsp90, a recognized therapeutic target thought to participate in non-oncogene addiction in a variety of human cancers. However, defining Hsp90 clients is challenging because interactions between Hsp90 and its physiologically relevant targets involve low affinity binding and are thought to be transient. Using a chemo-proteomic strategy, we have developed a novel orthogonally cleavable Hsp90 affinity resin that allows purification of the native protein and is quite selective for Hsp90 over its immediate family members, GRP94 and TRAP 1. We show that the resin can be used under low stringency conditions for the rapid, unambiguous capture of native Hsp90 in complex with a native client. We also show that the choice of linker used to tether the ligand to the insoluble support can have a dramatic effect on the selectivity of the affinity media.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaffinity chromatography 3abinding capacity 3achemistry 3ahumans 3aneoplasms 3aproteins 2aAnimals 2aChromatography, Affinityxinstrumentation 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aHSP90 Heat-Shock Proteinsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aHumans 2aHydrogen-Ion Concentration 2aMice 2aProtein Binding 2aProteomics 2aResins, Syntheticxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aSensitivity and Specificity 2aSwine1 aBarrott, Jared J.1 aCarlson, David A.1 aLoiselle, David R.1 aSpeer, Brittany L.1 aBodoor, Khaldon1 aRund, Lauretta A.1 aHaystead, Timothy A.J.0 tBioorganic & medicinal chemistry.g2012 May 15, v. 20, no. 10 p.3298-3305dElsevier Ltdx0968-08967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2012.03.0433Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle02757naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245012700179300001600306520098500322592002801307650001701335650001101352650002101363650002001384650004601404650001601450650001501466650000901481650002601490650002601516650001401542650001001556650004401566653000701610653000701617653000701624653000701631653002701638653000901665653000701674653000701681653000801688653000801696653000801704653000701712653001001719653002001729653001701749653001201766653001701778653001601795653001601811653001801827700002401845700001901869700002301888773010001911856008702011852000902098655001202107IND60623693720221119203758.0210105e20190330xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6062369372DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Bruijn, Wouter J.C.10aMass spectrometric characterisation of avenanthramides and enhancing their production by germination of oat (Avena sativa)  ap. 682-690.  aAvenanthramides are amides, with a phenylalkenoic acid (PA) and an anthranilic acid (AA) subunit, which are secondary metabolites of oat. Oat seeds were germinated, extracted, and the avenanthramides analysed by a combination of UHPLC with ion trap and high resolution ESI-MS. Typical fragmentation pathways with corresponding diagnostic fragments belonging to the PA and AA subunits were identified and summarised in a decision guideline. Based on these findings 28 unique avenanthramides were annotated in the oat seed(ling) extracts, including the new avenanthramide 6f (with a 4/5-methoxy AA subunit). Avenanthramide content increased by 25 times from seed to seedling. Avenanthramides 2p, 2c, and 2f, which are commonly described as the major avenanthramides, represented less than 20% of the total content in the seedlings. Future quantitative analyses should, therefore, include a wider range of avenanthramides to avoid underestimation of the total avenanthramide content.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAvena sativa 3aamides 3aanthranilic acid 3aavenanthramides 3aelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry 3agermination 3aguidelines 3aoats 3aquantitative analysis 3asecondary metabolites 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3aultra-performance liquid chromatography 0aAv 0aAA 0aPA 0aFA 0aRP-UHPLC-PDA-ESI-IT-MS 0aFTMS 0aPI 0aNI 0aCID 0aHCD 0aNCE 0aNL 0aLC-MS 0aAvenanthramides 0aCereal grain 0aPoaceae 0aAvena sativa 0aGermination 0aPhytoalexin 0aPlant defence1 avan Dinteren, Sarah1 aGruppen, Harry1 aVincken, Jean-Paul0 tFood chemistry.g2019 Mar. 30, v. 277 p.682-690dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2018.11.0133Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01708naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245005800167300001600225520086100241592002801102650001501130650001201145650001901157650002201176650001901198651001801217773009301235856008101328852000901409655001201418IND60121418820221122053117.0150302e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012141882DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-015-1331-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHolmes, K. John12aA historical perspective on climate change assessment  ap. 351-361.  aThe arid lands controversy beginning in the late 19th century provides a unique perspective on the role that large scale climate assessments play in the policy process. Initially the climate of the western arid lands divided scientists, policy makers, and the public between those that believed new conditions would require specialized policies and adaptations and those that argued conditions would not be severe. The consensus eventually emerged for a large-scale response, a consensus based on the seminal Report on the Arid Lands of the United States and later scientific assessments that coupled the physical and human dimensions of climatic change. This earlier debate demonstrates how climate assessments in the United States play out in policy deliberations with public opinion and climatological events to ultimately control the fate of responses.  aPublisher supplied data 3aarid lands 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3aissues and policy 3apublic opinion 3aUnited States0 tClimatic change.g2015 Mar., v. 129, no. 1-2 p.351-361dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1331-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001700144245015400161300002000315520130200335592002801637650001501665650001101680650001301691650001101704650001901715650001901734650001101753650003801764653003101802653002201833653001601855653002401871653004001895700001601935700001701951700001501968700001201983700001601995700005602011700005702067773014202124856007902266852000902345655001202354IND60753932920221119164354.0211020e20211011xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075393292DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c151332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYan, Changyu10aDonor−π–Acceptor Heterosystem-Functionalized Porous Hollow Carbon Microsphere for High-Performance Li–S Cathode Materials with S up to 93 wt %  ap. 48872-48880.  aLithium–sulfur (Li–S) batteries, as a prospective energy storage system, are still plagued by many problems that prevent them from their application, especially the low content of sulfur in the cathode. Herein, a cathode material with S up to 93 wt % is designed via a hollow donor−π–acceptor heterosystem, which combines catalytic sites, adsorption sites, and good conductivity together. Following this guidance, a hollow porous carbon sphere is prepared with CoO particles and single V atoms decorated on it (Co/V-HPCS), providing ultrahigh volumetric space for sulfur. Even the electrode made of sulfur-loaded Co/V-HPCS (Co/V-HPCS@S) has a high content of 90 wt % (sulfur content in the electrode is ∼83.5 wt %), and the cathode exhibits an excellent discharge capacity of 575.2 mAh g–¹ under 0.2C after 100 cycles. With careful analysis by means of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), the catalytic amounts of CoO particles and single V atoms loaded on the carbon shell are confirmed, which endows the material with outstanding catalytic ability to transfer sulfur and excellent adsorption of polysulfides. This concept of the cathode material increases the possibility of advanced long-life Li–S batteries with high tap density and high energy density.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acarbon 3acathodes 3aenergy 3aenergy density 3amicroparticles 3asulfur 3atransmission electron microscopes 0alithium−sulfur batteries 0acathode materials 0acarbon host 0ahigh sulfur content 0adonor−π−acceptor heterosystems1 aLi, Wenqian1 aLiu, Xuejiao1 aChen, Ming1 aLiu, Xi1 aLi, Xiaomin1 aZai, Jiantao1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7562-62331 aQian, Xuefeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8199-65020 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 11, v. 13, no. 41 p.48872-48880dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c151333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02276naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100005800152245011600210520093200326592002801258650001701286650002301303650001501326650001301341650002401354650001501378653002001393653002301413653002401436653002301460700001401483700001901497700005201516700001701568700001701585700001601602700001501618700001901633773010601652856008701758852000901845655001201854IND60729078020221120150208.0220326e202106  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072907802DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiang, Danping1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2259-897712aA strategy for successive feedstock reuse to maximize photo-fermentative hydrogen production of Arundo donax L.  aThis study proposed a strategy to maximize the hydrogen yield by reusing feedstock of Arundo donax L. For this purpose, a successive 4-batch photo-fermentative hydrogen production (PFHP) was carried out to test the strategy. About 50% of total hydrogen yield was additionally obtained by reusing the Arundo donax L for successive 4 times in comparison to single 1st batch (161.4 mL/U. cell dry weight). In addition to the highest hydrogen yield, the maximum hydrogen production rate (6.0 mL/U. cell dry weight /h), and the highest volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration (32 mM) were also obtained from the 1st batch, while the 2nd batch gave the maximum substrate conversion efficiency (96.5%). Moreover, a positive relationship between the sum of acetic and butyric acids with hydrogen yields was observed. This strategy would help in enhancing hydrogen yield that coupled with cost reduction for biohydrogen production.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArundo donax 3acost effectiveness 3afeedstocks 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogen production 3atechnology 0aFeedstock reuse 0aSuccessive 4 times 0aHydrogen production 0aPhoto-fermentation1 aYue, Tian1 aZhang, Zhiping1 aHe, Chao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6426-68581 aJing, Yanyan1 aLu, Chaoyang1 aZhang, Huan1 aChen, Zhou1 aZhang, Quanguo0 tBioresource technology.g2021 June, v. 329 p.124878-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04449naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245010400169300001400273520274800287592002803035650000903063650002603072650001103098650001203109650001903121650001203140650001203152650002503164650001503189650001503204650002003219650001103239650000903250650001303259650000903272650001703281650001603298653002003314653001903334653001403353653002203367653002603389653001903415653001503434653002303449653002103472700001603493700002403509700002003533700001803553700002203571700002003593700002203613773010503635856008603740852000903826655001203835IND60114142920221118124257.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011414292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWalter, Julia10aCombined effects of multifactor climate change and land-use on decomposition in temperate grassland  ap. 10-18.  aClimate change is likely to alter decomposition rates through direct effects on soil biotic activity and indirect effects on litter quality with possible impacts on the global carbon budget and nutrient cycling. Currently, there is a need to study the combined effects of climatic drivers and agricultural practises on decomposition.In an in situ litter bag experiment, we studied the effects of rainfall variability (including drought combined with heavy rain pulses as well as regular irrigation) interacting with winter warming and increased winter precipitation and with changes in cutting frequency, on decomposition in a temperate grassland. Litter bags contained mixed and species-specific litter of all different climate and land-use manipulations and were placed within the plots of litter origin. Moreover, we aimed to disentangle the causes of changes in decomposition by investigating two further approaches: Firstly, we studied the effects of changes in leaf chemicals as a result of the manipulations by removing litter from the experiment that has been pre-exposed to the manipulations before placing it on an untreated standard plot outside the experiment. Secondly, we assessed the effects of changes in soil faunal activity by investigating the decomposition of standard material under differing rainfall variability.As a result, decomposition was reduced when litter bags were exposed to drought for six weeks within an 11 months period. Neither additional winter rain nor winter warming had an effect on decomposition, likely because winter warming reduced snow cover and increased variability of surface temperatures. Climate manipulations did not change litter quality. Furthermore, decomposition on the untreated standard plot was not affected by the climate manipulations that the litter was previously exposed to. Thus, reduced decomposition under extreme rainfall variability and drought may mainly be caused by a decrease in soil biotic activity, as indicated by reduced decomposition of standard material during drought.More frequent cutting strongly stimulated decomposition, however, this stimulating effect was absent under extreme rainfall variability including drought. The stimulation of decomposition under more frequent cutting was attributed to changes in litter quality, namely a decrease in C/N ratio. Accordingly, litter from more frequently cut communities decomposed faster on the untreated control plot outside the experiment.Projected increases in drought frequency and increased rainfall variability under climate change may inhibit decomposition and alter nutrient and carbon cycling along with soil quality. Especially decomposition in frequently cut grassland appears vulnerable towards drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3abags 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acutting 3adrought 3aglobal carbon budget 3agrasslands 3airrigation 3aland use change 3aleaves 3arain 3asnowpack 3asoil 3asoil quality 3atemperature 0aCarbon turnover 0aClimate change 0aC/N ratio 0aEVENT experiments 0aExtreme weather event 0aGlobal warming 0aLitter bag 0aMicrobial activity 0aNutrient cycling1 aHein, Roman1 aBeierkuhnlein, Carl1 aHammerl, Verena1 aJentsch, Anke1 aSchädler, Martin1 aSchuerings, Jan1 aKreyling, Juergen0 tSoil biology & biochemistry.g2013 May, v. 60 p.10-18dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl124x0038-07177nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.01.0183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02912naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245005700169300001400226520183600240592002802076650001502104650001202119650001202131650001602143650001402159650001902173650002102192650002202213650001802235650001502253650001902268650001602287700002002303700002202323773009102345856008102436852000902517655001202526IND60121419020221122124701.0150302e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012141902DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-015-1333-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKarstensen, Jonas10aAllocation of global temperature change to consumers  ap. 43-55.  aClimate policy is generally concerned with the mitigation of well-mixed greenhouse gases, allocated to the country where the emissions occur, and with different emissions weighted together with the Global Warming Potential (GWP) using a 100 year time horizon. This perspective is not unique. Recent research has considered the inclusion of Short-Lived Climate Forcers (SCLFs), allocated emissions to the consumption of goods and services, and used alternative emissions metrics. Here, for the first time, we combine these alternative perspectives to explore the potential policy implications of three alternative framings: 1) using the Global Temperature change Potential (GTP) to directly link current emissions to temperature change, 2) including SLCFs that have both warming and cooling effects on climate, and 3) allocating emissions to consuming sectors and regions. Collectively, we use these three aspects to allocate the future temperature response to the consumption of goods and services in a given year. We show, in order of importance, that the method of allocating emissions to economic sectors is the most important, followed by the emission metric (including time-horizon), and then the mix of short-lived and well-mixed climate forcers. The consumption perspective reallocates emissions from electricity and manufacturing to service sectors, which suggests different policy options for demand and supply. The net effect of multiple pollutants and GTP significantly change the importance of the sectors compared to when only considering CO₂or when using the GWP. We argue that a focus on only one accounting system and framing in climate policy can potentially limit consideration of mitigation options to a reduced set of activities, and thereby missing significant opportunities for mitigation in other aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaccounting 3aclimate 3acooling 3aelectricity 3aemissions 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gases 3aissues and policy 3amanufacturing 3apollutants 3asupply balance 3atemperature1 aPeters, Glen P.1 aAndrew, Robbie M.0 tClimatic change.g2015 Mar., v. 129, no. 1-2 p.43-55dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1333-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03302naa a2200685 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245005300164300001600217520152800233592002801761650001301789650001901802650001401821650001201835650001501847650001001862650001601872650001201888650001301900650001401913650000901927650001101936650001601947650001001963650001101973651001101984653001901995653001302014653001202027653001202039653001902051653001902070700001502089700001402104700002102118700002002139700001502159700001402174700001702188700001402205700001602219700001702235700003402252700001902286700001602305700001502321700001802336700001402354700001902368700001802387773010802405856008202513852000902595655001202604IND60587034220221122065725.0190403e20180601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058703422DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fcr.2017.11.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMäkinen, H.10aSensitivity of European wheat to extreme weather  ap. 209-217.  aThe frequency and intensity of extreme weather is increasing concomitant with changes in the global climate change. Although wheat is the most important food crop in Europe, there is currently no comprehensive empirical information available regarding the sensitivity of European wheat to extreme weather. In this study, we assessed the sensitivity of European wheat yields to extreme weather related to phenology (sowing, heading) in cultivar trials across Europe (latitudes 37.21° to 61.34° and longitudes −6.02° to 26.24°) during the period 1991–2014. All the observed agro-climatic extremes (≥31°C, ≥35°C, or drought around heading; ≥35°C from heading to maturity; excessive rainfall; heavy rainfall and low global radiation) led to marked yield penalties in a selected set of European cultivars, whereas few cultivars were found to with no yield penalty in such conditions. There were no European wheat cultivars that responded positively (+10%) to drought after sowing, or frost during winter (−15°C and −20°C). Positive responses to extremes were often shown by cultivars associated with specific regions, such as good performance under high temperatures by southern-origin cultivars. Consequently, a major future breeding challenge will be to evaluate the potential of combining such cultivar properties with other properties required under different growing conditions with, for example, long day conditions at higher latitudes, when the intensity and frequency of extremes rapidly increase.  aPublisher supplied data 3abreeding 3aclimate change 3acultivars 3adrought 3afood crops 3afrost 3agrain yield 3aheading 3alatitude 3aphenology 3arain 3asowing 3atemperature 3awheat 3awinter 3aEurope 0aEuropean wheat 0aCultivar 0aWeather 0aExtreme 0aClimate change 0aYield response1 aKaseva, J.1 aTrnka, M.1 aBalek, Jaroslav,1 aKersebaum, K.C.1 aNendel, C.1 aGobin, A.1 aOlesen, J.E.1 aBindi, M.1 aFerrise, R.1 aMoriondo, M.1 aFernandez, Aurelio Rodriguez,1 aRuiz-Ramos, M.1 aTakáč, J.1 aBezák, P.1 aVentrella, D.1 aRuget, F.1 aCapellades, G.1 aKahiluoto, H.0 tField crops research.g2018 June 01, v. 222 p.209-217dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl10215x0378-42907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fcr.2017.11.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02768naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245011400169300001600283520164400299592002801943650002301971650001701994650001902011650002002030650001602050650001202066650001002078650001802088650001402106650001602120650001602136651001202152700001802164700001702182773009302199856008102292852000902373655001202382IND60121419120221122124704.0150302e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012141912DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-015-1334-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCooper, Hannah M.10aIncorporating uncertainty of groundwater modeling in sea-level rise assessment: a case study in South Florida  ap. 281-294.  aResearchers can assist in effective decision making by reducing uncertainty in marine and groundwater inundation due to Sea-level Rise (SLR). A majority of studies consider marine inundation, but only recently has groundwater inundation been incorporated into the SLR mapping. However, the effect of including uncertainty in groundwater modeling is still not well understood. In this study, we evaluate the effect of considering groundwater modeling uncertainty in assessing land area inundated vulnerable to marine and groundwater inundation in South Florida. Six Water Table Elevation Model (WTEM) techniques (Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR), Global Polynomial Interpolation (GPI), Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW), Ordinary Kriging (OK), and Empirical Bayesian Kriging (EBK)) are tested to identify the best approach. Simple inundation models excluding uncertainty with and without WTEM are examined. Refined inundation models using Monte Carlo simulation that include uncertainty in future SLR estimates, LiDAR elevation, vertical datums and the transformations made between datums with and without WTEM uncertainty are evaluated. GPI and EBK are recognized as the best for producing WTEMs in two primary physiographic regions (the Southern Slope and Atlantic Coastal Ridge). Excluding uncertainty without WTEM underestimates total land area by 14 %, while including uncertainty without WTEM overestimates total vulnerable land area by 16 % at the 95 % probability threshold. It is significant to include WTEM uncertainty in SLR vulnerability analysis for more effective adaptation decisions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3acase studies 3aclimate change 3adecision making 3agroundwater 3akriging 3alidar 3alinear models 3asea level 3auncertainty 3awater table 3aFlorida1 aZhang, Caiyun1 aSelch, Donna0 tClimatic change.g2015 Mar., v. 129, no. 1-2 p.281-294dSpringer-Verlagx0165-00097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-015-1334-13Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03699naa a2200757 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002600188245009200214300001200306506007600318520134900394592002801743596005901771506003701830650002301867650002701890650001601917650002501933650001501958650001201973650003301985650001102018650001002029650001602039650001502055650001702070650001702087650001902104650001902123650002402142650001602166650002002182650002002202650002902222650001802251650002002269650001702289650001602306700002102322700001602343700001802359700002102377700002402398700002802422700002202450700002002472700001702492700002602509700003202535700002002567700002602587700002302613700002202636700002102658700005402679773010502733856008202838852000902920655001202929IND60586833820221207143354.0200107e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683382DNAL7 a292027092pmid7 aPMC57162462pmcid7 a10.1186/s12870-017-1155-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMutwakil, Mohammed Z.10aTranscriptomic and metabolic responses of Calotropis procera to salt and drought stress  ap. 231.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Calotropis procera is a wild plant species in the family Apocynaceae that is able to grow in harsh, arid and heat stressed conditions. Understanding how this highly adapted plant persists in harsh environments should inform future efforts to improve the hardiness of crop and forage plant species. To study the plant response to droμght and osmotic stress, we treated plants with polyethylene glycol and NaCl and carried out transcriptomic and metabolomics measurements across a time-course of five days. RESULTS: We identified a highly dynamic transcriptional response across the time-course including dramatic changes in inositol signaling, stress response genes and cytokinins. The resulting metabolome changes also involved sharp increases of myo-inositol, a key signaling molecule and elevated amino acid metabolites at later times. CONCLUSIONS: The data generated here provide a first glimpse at the expressed genome of C. procera, a plant that is exceptionally well adapted to arid environments. We demonstrate, through transcriptome and metabolome analysis that myo-inositol signaling is strongly induced in response to drought and salt stress and that there is elevation of amino acid concentrations after prolonged osmotic stress. This work should lay the foundations of future studies in adaptation to arid environments.  aPublisher supplied data  aT-35-9cKing Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCalotropis procera 3aamino acid composition 3aamino acids 3abiochemical pathways 3acytokinins 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3aforage 3agenes 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3ametabolomics 3amyo-inositol 3aosmotic stress 3aplant response 3apolyethylene glycol 3asalt stress 3asodium chloride 3astress response 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscriptome 3atranscriptomics 3awater stress 3awild plants1 aHajrah, Nahid H.1 aAtef, Ahmed1 aEdris, Sherif1 aSabir, Mernan J.1 aAl-Ghamdi, Areej K.1 aSabir, Meshaal J.

Three routes were used for the preparation of emulsions (10% (w/v) oil and 0.5% (w/v) SPI with or without 0.5% (w/v) GA). In emulsions I, SPI solution with/without GA were first pH adjusted followed by homogenization with oil; in emulsions II, the oil was directly emulsified with SPI–GA coacervates at pH 4.0 to form the ‘mixed emulsions’, then pH was adjusted; in emulsions III, GA was added to a SPI-stabilized emulsion followed by pH adjustment. The results showed that pH adjustment before or after homogenization with oil greatly influenced the droplet size and emulsifying stability whether for the SPI emulsions or SPI/GA emulsions. The emulsions III showed much slower flocculation rate and higher emulsifying stability at pH 4.0–7.0. The microstructures of SPI–GA emulsion III were more uniform, with the comparably smallest d₄₃ values in the presence of SDS. It could be indicated that the preparation routes of emulsions greatly influenced the stability of SPI–control emulsion or SPI–GA emulsion.  aPublisher supplied data 3adroplet size 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aflocculation 3agum arabic 3ahomogenization 3amicrostructure 3aoils 3apH 3asoy protein isolate1 aJia, Cong1 aZhang, Caimeng1 aHua, Yufei1 aChen, Yeming0 tRSC advances.g2017 June 21, v. 7, no. 51 p.31875-31885dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c7ra01472d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01290naa a2200277 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245010100175300001400276520041100290592002800701650001300729650001700742650001000759650002200769650001200791650001800803773008300821856008700904852000900991655001201000IND60546594920221122102432.0160903e201403  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054659492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.01.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThien, Bruno M.J.12aA simple way to constrain the stoichiometry of secondary smectites upon aqueous glass alteration  ap. 45-46.  aThe comparison of the stoichiometry of several nuclear waste glasses and basaltic glasses with their associated secondary smectites evidenced that Si/Al ratios of secondary smectites are nearly equal to the Si/Al ratios of parent glasses.

The heterogeneity of the E6/E7 splicing profile might be in part due to the intrinsic variation of splicing factors in tumor cells. However, the splicing factors that bind the E6/E7 intron 1 (In-1) have not been defined. Therefore, we aimed to identify these factors; we used HeLa nuclear extracts (NE) for in vitro spliceosome assembly. The proteins were allowed to bind to an RNA/DNA hybrid formed by the In-1 transcript and a 5′-biotinylated DNA oligonucleotide complementary to the upstream exon sequence, which prevented interference in protein binding to the intron. The hybrid probes bound with the nuclear proteins were coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads for chromatography affinity purification. Proteins were eluted and identified by mass spectrometry (MS). Approximately 170 proteins were identified by MS, 80% of which were RNA binding proteins, including canonical spliceosome core components, helicases and regulatory splicing factors. The canonical factors were identified as components of the spliceosomal B-complex. Although 35–40 of the identified factors were cognate splicing factors or helicases, they have not been previously detected in spliceosome complexes that were assembled using in vivo or in vitro models.

Previous studies have also identified their excessive accumulation in sewage sludge. Anaerobic digestion is one of the most used sludge stabilization methods in wastewater treatment plants. Therefore, understanding the potential effects of (nano)microplastics on anaerobic digestion has been receiving increasing attention from researchers. This article provides a comprehensive review of mechanisms underlying the impacts of (nano)microplastics on anaerobic digestion. Notably, this review covers mechanisms of inhibition/enhancement of anaerobic digestion by (nano)microplastics and their potential impacts on biochemical pathways, key enzymes, functional genes, and microbial communities investigated to date. Moreover, potential environmental risks of biosolids contaminated with (nano)microplastics were highlighted. Finally, knowledge gaps and future research needs were outlined. This review will guide more standardized studies in the future, covering both fundamental and engineering aspects.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanaerobic digestion 3aaquatic environment 3abiosolids 3amicroplastics 3amunicipal wastewater 3asewage sludge 3asewage treatment 3awastewater treatment 0aMicroplastics 0a(Nano)microplastics 0aAnaerobic digestion 0aSewage sludge 0aBiomethane1 aHai, Faisal I.1 aLu, Wenjing1 aAl Mamun, Abdullah,1 aRanjan Dhar, Bipro0 tBioresource technology.g2021 June, v. 329 p.124894-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2021.1248943Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03187naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245010000163506011700263506007600380520177500456592002802231506003702259650002302296650002202319650001202341650002202353650001502375650001102390651001002401653002302411653001502434653002202449653001502471653001802486700001902504700001902523700002702542773010502569856008202674852000902756655001202765IND60767975420221207121455.0220619e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076797542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.tfp.2022.1002232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShahi, Neha10aForest—People nexus in changing livelihood contexts: Evidence from community forests in Nepal  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCommunity forestry in Nepal has set an example of people's participation in forest management. The direct dependency of local people on forest resources for livelihood activities has been one of the key adhesive factors for collective efforts in forest management. Changing livelihood strategies from agriculture-based livelihoods to migration (and remittances thereof) and the service sector, introduces a new dispensation which is yet to be sufficiently understood. This paper explores the changing livelihood strategies of forest users and analyses their effects on participation in forest management. The structured household survey (n = 106), key informant interviews (n = 6), and focal group discussions (n = 3) in three community forest user groups in the mid-hills of Nepal were employed to analyze the changing livelihood strategies in the last 15 years, and to underscore their implications for forest management. We followed the recall process, and in order to ease the recall process, the reference events were discussed with the respondent. The result showed an increasing switch to non-forest dependent livelihood strategies, characterized by the emergence of non-agriculture (remittance, business, service) sectors. While there is no change in the number of CF meetings attended, and the average time spent per meeting by user households, a decreasing dependence on forests, as well as the willingness to participate in forest management was recorded. These were associated with the change in livelihood strategies from agriculture to non-agriculture-based practices. This context justifies the need for a re-think on how to stabilize the rural sector to limit rural exodus and the management of community forest resources in the mid-hills of Nepal.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acommunity forestry 3aforest management 3aforests 3ahousehold surveys 3alivelihood 3apeople 3aNepal 0aCommunity forestry 0aDependency 0aForest management 0aLivelihood 0aParticipation1 aBhusal, Prabin1 aPaudel, Ganesh1 aKimengsi, Jude Ndzifon0 tTrees, forests and people.g2022 June, v. 8 p.100223-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27502x2666-71937nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tfp.2022.1002233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03371naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100002100188245015300209300001100362506007600373520178100449592002802230506003702258650002502295650002002320650001802340650001202358650001702370650002502387650001402412650001602426650001702442650001302459650002002472650001202492650003102504650001302535650002002548650001102568700002102579700002302600700002502623700002202648773010402670856008202774852000902856655001202865IND60586834220221207143352.0180619e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683422DNAL7 a10.1186/s12896-017-0406-x2doi7 aPMC57156172pmcid7 a292027342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Xing-Feng12aA tandem CBM25 domain of α-amylase from Microbacterium aurum as potential tool for targeting proteins to starch granules during starch biosynthesis  ap. 86.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Starch-binding domains from carbohydrate binding module family 20 have been used as a tool for starch engineering. Previous studies showed that expression of starch binding domain fusion proteins in planta resulted in modified starch granule structures and physicochemical properties. However, although 13 carbohydrate binding module families have been reported to contain starch-binding domains, only starch-binding domains from carbohydrate binding module family 20 have been well studied and introduced into plants successfully. In this study, two fragments, the tandem CBM25 domain and the tandem CBM25 with multiple fibronectin type III (FN3) domains of the α-amylase enzyme from Microbacterium aurum, were expressed in the tubers of a wild type potato cultivar (cv. Kardal) and an amylose-free (amf) potato mutant. RESULTS: The (CBM25)₂ and FN3 protein were successfully accumulated in the starch granules of both Kardal and amf transformants. The accumulation of (CBM25)₂ protein did not result in starch morphological alterations in Kardal but gave rise to rough starch granules in amf, while the FN3 resulted in morphological changes of starch granules (helical starch granules in Kardal and rough surface granules in amf) but only at a very low frequency. The starches of the different transformants did not show significant differences in starch size distribution, apparent amylose content, and physico-chemical properties in comparison to that of untransformed controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the starch-binding domains from carbohydrate binding module family 25 can be used as a novel tool for targeting proteins to starch granules during starch biosynthesis without side-effects on starch morphology, composition and properties.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMicrobacterium aurum 3aadverse effects 3aalpha-amylase 3aamylose 3abiosynthesis 3acarbohydrate binding 3acultivars 3aengineering 3afibronectins 3agranules 3amodified starch 3amutants 3aphysicochemical properties 3apotatoes 3astarch granules 3atubers1 aNazarian, Farhad1 aVincken, Jean-Paul1 aVisser, RichardG.

However, a reduction in the quantity of sugar may affect its nutritional value and quality. The feasibility of the combined use of stevia and coffee silverskin for achieving healthier, nutritious and good quality biscuits has been investigated. Ten wheat four biscuit formulations were designed. Sucrose, maltitol and stevia were used as sweeteners and coffee silverskin was used as a natural colouring and as a source of dietary fbre. The quality of the biscuits was evaluated by measuring their moisture, thickness, breaking force and colour. Acrylamide (ACR) and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) contents were also determined in the interest of food safety. The quality and safety of the innovative biscuits was obtained by an analysis of the sugars, proteins, free amino acids, chlorogenic acid, overall antioxidant capacity and acrylamide after in vitro digestion. Only the stevia biscuits and those added with coffee silverskin extract and the solid residue recovered from the extraction process, were selected for that study. A comparison of the stevia formulated biscuits, with the stevia formula added with silverskin, showed that the added biscuits had a good nutritional quality and improved texture and colour.  aPublisher supplied data 3aStevia 3aacrylamides 3aantioxidant activity 3abiscuits 3achlorogenic acid 3acolor 3afree amino acids 3ahydroxymethylfurfural 3ain vitro digestion 3amaltitol 3anutritive value 3aproteins 3asucrose 3asweeteners 3atexture 3awheat 0astevia 0acoffee silverskin 0aacrylamide 0aHMF 0aquality biscuits 0alow sugar 0amaltitol1 aMartinez-Saez, Nuria1 aMesias, Marta1 aMorales, Francisco J.1 aCastillo, M.

Fast bacterial growth in the nutrient broth considerably enhanced pyrene degradation rate, whereas degradation efficiency per cell was substantially decreased. The addition of nutrient broth could not alter the transcription levels of all dioxygenase genotypes. In the PAH-only substrates, bacterial growth completely relied on biological conversion of PAHs into the effective carbon sources, which led to a higher degradation efficiency of pyrene per cell than the case of nutrient broth. Significant correlations were only observed between nidA-related dioxygenase expression and pyrene degradation or bacterial growth. The highest pyrene degradation rate in the presence of phenanthrene was consistent with the highest transcription level of nidA and 4,5-pyrenediol as the sole initial metabolite. This study reveals that bacterial growth requirement can invigorate degradation of PAHs by regulating metabolic pathway and genotypic enzyme expression.  aPublisher supplied data 3awater pollution 3aphenanthrenes 3abiochemical pathways 3acarbon 3agenotype 3amicrobial growth 3aMycobacterium 3ametabolites 0aDioxygenase 0aPolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 0aBiodegradation 0aPyrene 0aBacterial growth 0aphenanthrene1 aHuang, Jinyin1 aYuan, Ke1 aLin, Li1 aWang, Xiaowei1 aYang, Lihua1 aLuan, Tiangang0 tMarine pollution bulletin.g2016 Apr. 15, v. 105, no. 1 p.73-80dElsevier LtdwJournal:12420x0025-326X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.02.0543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002500188245011500213300001200328506007600340520184700416592002802263506003702291650001502328650000802343650002102351650002502372650001402397650001502411650001402426650003302440650003102473650001002504650001102514650001602525650003202541650002402573650002602597650004302623650005202666650002502718650002902743650001602772700002502788773013102813856008202944852000903026655001203035IND60586834420221207143357.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683442DNAL7 a292027752pmid7 aPMC57162612pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-2027-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguyen, My-Nuong Thi10aNam Dia long, a Vietnamese folk formula, induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells through various mechanisms of action  ap. 522.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The holistic approach of traditional medicine renders the identification of its mechanisms of action difficult. Microarray technology provides an efficient way to analyze the complex genome-wide gene expression of cells treated with mixtures of medicinal ingredients. We performed transcriptional profiling of MCF-7 cells treated with Nam Dia Long (NDL), a Vietnamese traditional formula, to explore the mechanism of action underlying the apoptosis inducing effect of this formula reported in a previous study. METHODS: MCF-7 cells were treated with aqueous extracts of NDL at the IC₅₀ concentration for 24, 36 and 48 h. Total RNAs at 24 h and 48 h were subsequently extracted, reverse transcribed and submitted to microarray expression profiling using the Human HT-12 v4.0 Expression Bead Chip (Illumina). Functional analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery and the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. The expression level from selected genes at the three time points were assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot. RESULTS: Fifty-four and 601 genes were differentially expressed at 24 and 48 h of NDL treatment, respectively. Genes with altered expression at 24 h were mostly involved in cell responses to xenobiotic stress whereas genes differentially expressed at 48 h were related to endoplasmic reticulum stress, DNA damage and cell cycle control. Apoptosis of NDL treated MCF-7 cells resulted from a combination of different mechanisms including the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways, cell cycle arrest- and oxidative stress-related cell death. CONCLUSION: NDL elicited a two-stage response in MCF-7 treated cells with apoptosis as the ultimate result. The various mechanisms inducing apoptosis reflected the complexity of the formula composition.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA damage 3aRNA 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aapoptosis 3acell cycle 3adatabases 3aendoplasmic reticulum stress 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3ahumans 3aingredients 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3amechanism of action 3amicroarray technology 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3atraditional medicine 3atranscription (genetics) 3axenobiotics1 aHo-Huynh, Thuy-Duong0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.522-522dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-2027-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02859naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001300144245010500157300002000262520146000282592002801742650001101770650001501781650001101796650002401807650001401831653003201845653001701877653002401894653003201918653002601950700001401976700001701990700001402007700005502021700006102076700001602137700005402153773014202207856007902349852000902428655001202437IND60753933820221119164105.0211020e20211005xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6075393382DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.1c154412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Lu10aCobalt Coordinated Cyano Covalent-Organic Framework for High-Performance Potassium-Organic Batteries  ap. 48913-48922.  aPotassium ion batteries (PIBs) are expected to become the next large-scale energy storage candidates due to its low cost and abundant resources. And the covalent organic framework (COF), with designable periodic organic structure and ability to organize redox active groups predictably, has been considering as the promising organic electrode candidate for PIB. Herein, we report the facile synthesis of the cyano-COF with Co coordination via a facile microwave digestion reaction and its application in the high-energy potassium ion batteries for the first time. The obtained COF-Co material exhibits the enhanced π–π accumulation and abundant defects originated from the Co interaction with the two-dimensional layered sheet structure of COF, which are beneficial for its energy-storage application. Adopted as the inorganic-metal boosted organic electrode for PIBs, the COF-Co with Co coordination can promote the formation of the π–K⁺ interaction, which could lead to the activation of aromatic rings for potassium-ion storage. Besides, the porous two-dimensional layered structure of COF-Co with abundant defects can also promote the shortened diffusion distance of ion/electron with promoted K⁺ insertion/extraction ability. Enhanced cycling stability with large reversible capacity (371 mAh g–¹ after 400 cycles at 100 mA g–¹) and good rate properties (105 mAh g–¹ at 2000 mA g–¹) have been achieved for the COF-Co electrode.  aPublisher supplied data 3acobalt 3aelectrodes 3aenergy 3amicrowave treatment 3apotassium 0acovalent organic frameworks 0acoordination 0alithium-ion battery 0apotassium storage mechanism 0apotassium-ion battery1 aZheng, Lu1 aLi, Xiaopeng1 aWang, Han1 aLv, Li-Ping1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4054-008X1 aChen, Shuangqiang1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9111-16911 aSun, Weiwei1 aWang, Yong1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3489-76720 tACS applied materials & interfaces.g2021 Oct. 05, v. 13, no. 41 p.48913-48922dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23284x1944-82527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsami.1c154413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03003naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002000147245011100167500002200278520124700300592002801547650002101575650001801596650001501614650001401629650000901643650002101652650001801673650001701691650001701708650001101725650002401736650001601760650002101776650002301797650000901820650002001829650001601849650001401865650002501879650001901904651000901923653002101932653001701953653001001970653001901980653000801999653001602007700001402023700001702037700001802054700002202072700002102094700001602115700002002131700002002151700001802171773007402189856008102263852000902344655001202353IND60587034920221121013320.0171214s2017    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058703492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jep.2017.11.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHeo, Kang-Hyuck10aActinidia arguta extract attenuates inflammasome activation: potential involvement in NLRP3 ubiquitination  aPre-press version  aActinidia arguta (A. arguta) has been widely used in Asian countries as a traditional medicinal herb to treat inflammation-related diseases, such as gastritis, bronchitis, and arthritis.The inhibitory effect of A. arguta leaves’ extract (AA) on inflammasome activation was investigated to verify its traditional use in treating inflammation-related diseases.Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) primed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were activated by selective inflammasome stimulators, and the effect of AA on inflammasome activation was investigated. A monosodium urate crystal (MSU)-induced peritonitis mouse model was used to study the in vivo efficacy of AA on inflammasome activation.In the in vitro study, AA regulated NLRP3 ubiquitination and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) oligomerization, leading to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated interleukin (IL)−1β secretion. The inhibitory effect of AA on inflammasome activation in vitro was further confirmed in vivo using an MSU-induced peritonitis mouse model.AA provided scientific evidence, substantiating the traditional claims for its use in the treatment of inflammation and inflammation-mediated metabolic disorders, including gout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aActinidia arguta 3aanimal models 3abronchitis 3agastritis 3agout 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammasomes 3ainflammation 3ainterleukins 3aleaves 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amedicinal plants 3ametabolic diseases 3amice 3aoligomerization 3aperitonitis 3asecretion 3atraditional medicine 3aubiquitination 3aAsia 0aActinidia arguta 0ainflammasome 0aNLRP3 0aubiquitination 0aASC 0aperitonitis1 aSun, Xiao1 aShim, Do-Wan1 aKim, Myong-Ki1 aKoppula, Sushruta1 aYu, Sang–Hyeun1 aKim, Han-Bi1 aKim, Tack-Joong1 aKang, Tae-bong,1 aLee, Kwang-Ho0 tJournal of ethnopharmacology.g2017, dElsevier B.V.x0378-87417nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2017.11.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02841naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002000153245010100173300001600274520144800290592002801738650002101766650001301787650001601800650001701816650001501833650001601848650003001864650001601894650001501910650002401925650001101949650001501960650002201975650002001997650001302017650001202030650001502042650001002057651001102067700001702078700002302095700002902118700001902147773008502166856008702251852000902338655001202347IND60546595420221120024027.0160903e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054659542DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.01.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÅkesson, Maria10aModelling pesticide transport in a shallow groundwater catchment using tritium and helium-3 data  ap. 231-239.  aUsing tritium and helium-3 data for calibration, a 2-D transport model was set up to explain the occurrence of bentazone, dichlorprop, glyphosate, isoproturon, MCPA and metamitron in a small groundwater catchment in southern Sweden. The model was parameterised with site-specific degradation and sorption data to enable transport simulations. Local climatological data and a 21-year record of agricultural pesticide use within the study area were used as boundary conditions. Model output was evaluated against a 7-year long pesticide monitoring data-series from two monitoring wells within the study area. The model successfully predicts observed breakthrough of bentazone, dichlorprop, isoproturon and MCPA. However, it fails to simulate observed occurrences of glyphosate and metamitron. Glyphosate and metamitron exhibit relatively high sorption potential, and their occurrence is suggested to be the result of non-equilibrium preferential flow paths which the model cannot reproduce due the conceptualisation of the system as homogenous and isotropic. The results indicate a promising methodological approach applicable to groundwater contamination risk assessment, and demonstrate the potential for transport model calibration by means of tritium and helium-3 data. Main constraints of the study relate to the relatively simple system conceptualisation, indicating a need for further consideration of physical and chemical heterogeneity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMCPA (herbicide) 3abentazon 3adichlorprop 3ageochemistry 3aglyphosate 3agroundwater 3agroundwater contamination 3aisoproturon 3ametamitron 3ameteorological data 3amodels 3amonitoring 3apreferential flow 3arisk assessment 3asorption 3atritium 3awatersheds 3awells 3aSweden1 aBendz, David1 aCarlsson, Christel1 aSparrenbom, Charlotte J.1 aKreuger, Jenny0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Nov., v. 50 p.231-239dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.01.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02118naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009700171300001600268520091500284592002801199650001501227650002201242650002201264650000901286650001701295650002201312653002001334653002201354653002701376653003201403700001801435700002101453700003501474700002101509773010701530856008601637852000901723655001201732IND60114143820221118124309.0190318e201305  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011414382DNAL7 a10.1016/j.soilbio.2013.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuenay, Yasemin10aTransgressive overyielding of soil microbial biomass in a grassland plant diversity gradient  ap. 122-124.  aIn a grassland plant diversity experiment, we studied if plant species richness induces transgressive overyielding in soil microbial biomass, the definition of which is greater microbial biomass with a plant mixture than in each of the plant monocultures. In June and November of 2012 soil microbial biomass increased significantly with plant species richness. Overyielding occurred in more than 61% of 24 plots containing six species, and transgressive overyielding occurred in 13–21% of the plots depending on season. Plots with nine species showed overyielding in all cases, and 25–50% showed transgressive overyielding. Transgressive underyielding occurred in a few plots with six species in June. Our results indicate plant complementarity effects on soil microbial biomass in diverse plant communities across seasons and stress the relevance of simplification of plant communities for soil processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3agrasslands 3amicrobial biomass 3aplant communities 3asoil 3asoil ecology 3aspecies diversity 0aJena Experiment 0aMicrobial biomass 0aPlant species richness 0aTransgressive underyielding1 aEbeling, Anne1 aSteinauer, Katja1 aWeisser, W.

The organic carbon and sulphur contents of Fika shale samples are in the range of 0.51–2.13 and 0.31–1.65wt.%, respectively, pointing that these shales were deposited in suboxic-anoxic marine conditions. The biomarker and chemical compositions provide evidence for a major contribution of aquatic algae and microorganisms with minor terrigenous organic matter input. Moderate salinity stratification and relatively anoxic-suboxic bottom water conditions are also likely in the Fika shales. Therefore, stratified water column with moderate salinity and relatively anoxic-suboxic bottom water conditions have contributed to organic matter (OM) preservation in the Fika shale layer. Fika shale samples are rich in SiO2 (54.80wt.%), followed by Al2O3 (23.75wt.%) and Fe2O3 (10.19wt.%). Compared with average shale, the analysed shale samples are obviously enriched in Al2O3 (23.75wt.%), TiO2 (1.34wt.%), and P2O5 (0.30wt.%), indicating that these sediments are rich in clay minerals and represent a good possibility for enhanced organic matter production and enrichment.Plots of Fika shale on bivariate discriminant function diagram suggest an active continental margin setting for the provenance. The inferred tectonic setting for the late Cretaceous shales of the Fika Formation of the Chad (Bornu) Basin is in agreement with the tectonic evolutionary history of the west and central Africa during the Cretaceous period.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgae 3aaluminum oxide 3abasins 3abiomarkers 3acarbon 3aclay minerals 3aferric oxide 3ageochemistry 3amicroorganisms 3aorganic matter 3aprovenance 3asalinity 3asediments 3ashale 3asilica 3asulfur 3atectonics 3atitanium dioxide 3aChad 3aNigeria1 aAbdullah, Wan Hasiah1 aHakimi, Mohammed Hail1 aSarki Yandoka, Babangida M.0 tApplied geochemistry.g2014 Apr., v. 43 p.1-12dElsevier Ltdx0883-29277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeochem.2014.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03071naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245009900171300001600270520142300286592002801709650001801737650001601755650002001771650001601791650001701807650001201824650001201836650002101848650001801869650001501887650002301902650004301925650001801968650001301986650001101999650001602010700002102026700001702047700001802064700002002082700002302102700002202125700001902147700001902166700002302185700002102208700001802229700002202247773011902269856008502388990002302473852000902496655001202505IND60094874620221119112455.0141104e201111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009487462DNAL7 a10.1016/j.diabres.2011.07.0312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aÖz Gül, Özen10aEffect of sitagliptin monotherapy on serum total ghrelin levels in people with type 2 diabetes  ap. 212-216.  aAIM: Sitagliptin is not associated with weight gain and has neutral effects on body weight. It is unclear whether sitagliptin treatment alters serum ghrelin levels in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Forty-four subjects with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to receive sitagliptin or medical nutrition therapy (MNT) for 12 weeks. Changes in anthropometric variables, glycemic control, insulin resistance, lipid parameters, and total ghrelin levels were evaluated at baseline and following 12 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Significant decreases in body weight and body mass index were observed over the entire study period in both treatment groups. Glycosylated hemoglobin and postprandial plasma glucose levels were statistically significant decreased in the groups receiving sitagliptin compared with baseline values (p=0.021 and p=0.021, respectively), while they were unchanged in the groups receiving MNT. There was a significant decrease in total ghrelin in the groups receiving sitagliptin (p=0.04) compared with baseline values but not in the groups receiving MNT (p=0.46) at the end of the 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with sitagliptin was associated with a significant decrease in serum ghrelin levels. These results suggest that the neutral effect of sitagliptin on weight might be associated with the suppression of fasting serum ghrelin levels.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood glucose 3ablood serum 3abody mass index 3abody weight 3adiet therapy 3afasting 3aghrelin 3aglycemic control 3aglycosylation 3ahemoglobin 3ainsulin resistance 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3anormal values 3apatients 3apeople 3aweight gain1 aKıyıcı, Sinem1 aErsoy, Canan1 aCander, Soner1 aYorulmaz, Hakan1 aGül, Cuma Bülent1 aÜnal, Oğuz Kaan1 aSarandol, Emre1 aKırhan, Emine1 aSığırlı, Deniz1 aErtürk, Erdinç1 aTuncel, Ercan1 aİmamoğlu, Şazi0 tDiabetes research and clinical practice.g2011 Nov., v. 94, no. 2 p.212-216dElsevier Ireland Ltdx0168-82277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2011.07.0313Available from publisher's site  mNon-PubAg articles  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002100152245015900173500001900332520148900351592002801840650001401868650002401882650001801906650002401924650001101948650001101959650001201970650001101982650001601993650001702009650003202026650002502058650001202083650001802095650001102113650002302124650000902147653003102156653001802187653001802205653000802223653000802231653000702239653000902246653000702255653000702262700006302269700002302332773010702355856008702462852000902549655001202558IND60729079220221120160548.0210322e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072907922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biombioe.2021.1060102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIvanchenko, Anna10aAnaerobic co-digestion of agro-industrial waste with cheese whey: Impact of centrifuge comminution on biogas release and digestate agrochemical properties  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThis paper studies the effect of mechanical pretreatment of NPKCa-containing waste (vegetable waste VW and thickened sewage activated sludge TSAS) on biogas production and agronomic quality of the digestates. The efficiency of this process was evaluated by the yield of methane during anaerobic co-digestion with bioadditive (cheese whey), as well as the nutrients content in digestates by using an agrochemical test. It was found that with increasing comminution intensity the particle size of the substrate decreases from 50 to 16 μm which causes an increase in biogas yield by ~30%. As a result, the carbon content in the digestates decreases from 72 to 44%, whereas nutrients content increases by, %TS: N – 3.4; P – 3.7; K – 3.7; Ca – 7.6. The grinded substrate was used for anaerobic digestion with the addition of various amounts of cheese whey. Obtained digestates have a stimulating effect on the growth of barley and peas plants. In particular, digestion with 3 wt% of whey had the maximum impact on plant yield (+0.3–0.4 t ha⁻¹ compared to control). Moreover, the combination of vigorous comminution with the addition of whey leads to a significant reduction in the fermentation duration (up to 4 times) and increases biogas production by 41%. Obtained digestates can be considered as organo-mineral fertilizers since they contain up to 43% of the total amount of NPKCa and meet the requirements for the content of heavy metals under Ukrainian legislation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadditives 3aagricultural wastes 3aagrochemicals 3aanaerobic digestion 3abarley 3abiogas 3abiomass 3acarbon 3acheese whey 3afermentation 3agas production (biological) 3alaws and regulations 3amethane 3aparticle size 3asewage 3avegetable residues 3awhey 0aOrgano-mineral fertilizers 0aSewage sludge 0aVegetal waste 0aCOD 0aDEC 0aTS 0aTSAS 0aVS 0aVW1 aYelatontsev, Dmytro1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1043-418X1 aSavenkov, Anatoliy0 tBiomass and bioenergy.g2021 Apr., v. 147 p.106010-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl3929140x0961-95347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biombioe.2021.1060103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03477naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245015100208300001200359506007600371520141400447592002801861596008501889506003701974650002202011650001602033650002202049650001302071650001502084650003402099650001502133650001002148650001302158650001402171650002402185650003802209650002202247650000902269650003402278650001202312650001602324650001102340650001802351651001002369700001902379700002202398700002102420700001702441700002102458700002602479700002002505700002802525700002402553700002302577700001902600773011702619856008202736852000902818655001202827IND60586834820221207143410.0201104e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058683482DNAL7 a292027562pmid7 aPMC57156192pmcid7 a10.1186/s12917-017-1305-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNogarol, Chiara10aPestivirus infection in cattle dairy farms: E2 glycoprotein ELISA reveals the presence of bovine viral diarrhea virus type 2 in northwestern Italy  ap. 377.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) types 1 and 2 are members of the Pestivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. This genus also includes the HoBi-like virus, tentatively classified as BVDV type 3. BVDV-1 is widely distributed in Italy despite the extensive use of BVDV-1-based vaccines, while BVDV-2 and HoBi-like Pestivirus have been detected occasionally. Monitoring the occurrence of sporadic or atypical pestiviruses is a useful approach to evaluate the need for additional vaccine strains that can be used in BVDV control programs. RESULTS: In this study we developed a multiwell antibody ELISA based on the recombinant E2 protein of the three bovine pestiviruses. We evaluated the assay’s applicability for surveillance purposes using pooled milk samples, each prepared from a maximum of 35 lactating cows and collected from 176 dairy herds. As expected, the majority of the pooled samples reacted to a greater extent against the BVDV-1 E2 antigen. All three milk pools from a single farm reacted to the BVDV-2 antigen, however. Further analysis using spot tests, antigen detection, and sequence analysis of the 5′-UTR region confirmed the presence of five persistently infected calves carrying a BVDV-2a strain. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights for the first time that sporadic circulation of BVDV-2 can be predicted by immunoenzymatic methods in the absence of specific vaccination.  aPublisher supplied data  aPRIN 2010LLXR94cMinistero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3asequence analysis 3adairy herds 3aantigen detection 3aantigens 3amonitoring 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 2 3aantibodies 3afarms 3avaccines 3alactation 3aveterinary medicine 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3alactating females 3amilk 3aBovine viral diarrhea virus 1 3aviruses 3avaccination 3acalves 3aglycoproteins 3aItaly1 aDecaro, Nicola1 aBertolotti, Luigi1 aColitti, Barbara1 aIotti, Bryan1 aPetrini, Stefano1 aLucente, Maria Stella1 aElia, Gabriella1 aPerona, G.q(Giovanni),1 aProfiti, Margherita1 aBuonavoglia, Canio1 aRosati, Sergio0 tBMC veterinary research.g2017 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.377-377dBioMed CentralwJournal:jnl4152735x1746-61487nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12917-017-1305-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03183naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100003700148245009000185506011700275506007600392520123200468592002801700506003701728650001201765650002601777650002501803650001401828650001001842650002001852650001501872650002001887650001101907650001201918650000901930650001101939653002301950653001701973653001601990653001402006653002802020700002202048700003302070700002802103700002602131700003402157700006902191700004602260700001902306700004002325700006802365773009202433856008302525852000902608655001202617IND60767976120221207122307.0220605e202206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076797612DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fufo.2022.1001322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSouza, Maria Luiza Rodrigues de,10aFish carcass flours from different species and their incorporation in tapioca cookies  aCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 Generic (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)uhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThis study aimed to evaluate different methods to produce flour from tilapia carcasses (cooked, cooked/aromatized, and flavored), and the use of different concentrations of cooked tilapia carcass flour for the enrichment of tapioca cookies. Tapioca cookies with the inclusion of cooked carcass flour from different fish species (tilapia, tuna, sardines, and salmon) were also studied. The flour from the cooked carcass showed low moisture and lipid contents and high protein, calcium, and phosphorus contents, as well as high L* values, and low a* and b* values. The tapioca cookies enriched with cooked tilapia carcass flour (9%) showed high protein content and good sensory acceptance. Concerning the cookies made with flour from different fish species, the tilapia flour led to an increase in protein contents, as well as linoleic, arachidonic, and eicosapentaenoic fatty acids concentrations of the cookies. These cookies also received the highest purchase intent scores. Therefore, the inclusion of flour from fish carcasses in tapioca cookies may be an effective alternative to increase the nutritional value of the product, besides adding value to the fishery waste and reducing the environmental impact of farming fish.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acalcium 3aeicosapentaenoic acid 3aenvironmental impact 3afisheries 3aflour 3anutritive value 3aphosphorus 3aprotein content 3asalmon 3atapioca 3atuna 3awastes 0aFilleting residues 0aFish carcass 0aSalmo salar 0aTunnus sp 0aSardinella brasiliensis1 aGasparino, Eliane1 aGoes, Elenice Souza dos Reis1 aCoradini, Melina Franco1 aVieira, Vivian Izabel1 aOliveira, Gislaine Gonçalves1 aMatiucci, Marcos Antônio1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2053-26721 ade Castro, Ana Carolina Valente Junqueira1 aSiemer, Simone1 aFernandes, Vitória Regina Takeuchi1 aFeihrmann, Andresa Carla1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2389-04670 tFuture foods.g2022 June, v. 5 p.100132-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:27596x2666-83357nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fufo.2022.1001323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02626naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002200094024001900116024003900135040001800174100002000192245009100212300001600303506007600319520105000395592002801445506003701473650003101510650002501541650001401566650000901580650001101589650001701600650001301617650001401630653000801644653001701652653000801669653001401677653003201691653002001723653002801743653001401771700001901785700003201804700002901836700002701865700002501892773009601917856008602013852000902099655001202108IND60605338220221207120217.0200717e20180208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060533822DNAL7 aPMC59301692pmcid7 a293434112pmid7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöster, Stefan10aConsequence of enhanced LC3-trafficking for a live, attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine  ap. 939-944.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aDevelopment of a new vaccine against tuberculosis is urgently needed. Recent work has demonstrated that two related LC3-associated trafficking pathways, autophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP), enhance antigen presentation and might play a role in vaccine efficacy. Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibits both LC3-trafficking pathways. Moreover, the vaccine strain, BCG, induces even less LC3-trafficking than M. tuberculosis, which may help explain its limited efficacy. To determine whether enhanced LC3-trafficking can improve efficacy of a live, attenuated M. tuberculosis vaccine, we took advantage of our recent finding that the bacterial virulence factor CpsA inhibits LAP. When we deleted cpsA in the mc²6206 vaccine strain, it dramatically increased LC3-trafficking. We compared the protective efficacy of the strain lacking cpsA to the parent strain and to BCG in mice challenged with M. tuberculosis. We found that the strain lacking cpsA generated modestly enhanced protection in the spleen, but overall did not outperform BCG.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aMycobacterium tuberculosis 3aantigen presentation 3aautophagy 3amice 3aspleen 3atuberculosis 3avaccines 3avirulence 0aLAP 0aTuberculosis 0aBCG 0aAutophagy 0aLC3-associated phagocytosis 0aInnate immunity 0aLive attenuated vaccine 0aAuxotroph1 aKlevorn, Thais1 aPapavinasasundaram, Kadamba1 aSassetti, Christopher M.1 aPortal-Celhay, Cynthia1 aPhilips, Jennifer A.0 tVaccine.g2018 Feb. 08, v. 36, no. 7 p.939-944dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.0123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02914naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002700152245008600179520181000265592002802075650001502103650001902118650001202137650001502149650000902164650001302173650001402186653001002200653001902210653001302229653001802242653001402260653001702274700001602291700001902307773010602326856008702432852000902519655001202528IND60772484720221118011728.0220531e20220805xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077248472DNAL7 a10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1289232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSasidharanpillai, Arun10aDesign of stable liquid infused surfaces: Influence of oil viscosity on stability  aSlippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have been used as a good alternative for superhydrophobic coatings due to their increased durability against mechanical forces and their ability to repel liquids with a wide range of surface tensions. SLIPS generally consists of a superhydrophobic porous structure infiltrated with a lubricant. The self-healing ability of SLIPS helps to maintain their water repellency longer than superhydrophobic surfaces. Even though SLIPS have great functionalities for practical applications, their stability is still insufficient due to the loss of lubricant from them. The oil loss from SLIPS depends mainly on the viscosity of the lubricant infiltrated into it. Even though plenty of research has been conducted over SLIPS with viscosities ranging from 1 cSt to 20, 000 cSt, a complete understanding of the oil loss mechanism is still not available. Therefore, in this work, we investigated the influence of silicone oil (lubricant) viscosity on the stability of SLIPS to determine a suitable viscosity range to fabricate stable SLIPS. Various SLIPS were fabricated by infiltrating silicone oils with a wide viscosity range. Stability studies were conducted by obtaining the volume of oil removed from the SLIPS with respect to the number of drops. Narrow SLIPS were also fabricated to understand the effect of self-healing speed on the oil loss process. Finally, a dynamic wicking experiment is conducted to determine the self-healing speed of silicone oils. SLIPS with silicone oil viscosities of 3000 cSt and 5000 cSt demonstrated lower loss rates and higher stability. However, the oil loss was fastest for SLIPS with 100 cSt silicone oil. Rapid self-healing of the lower viscosity oil was the main reason for the quick oil loss from lower viscosity SLIPS.  aPublisher supplied data 3adurability 3ahydrophobicity 3aliquids 3alubricants 3aoils 3asilicone 3aviscosity 0aSLIPS 0aLubricant loss 0aCloaking 0aWetting-ridge 0aStability 0aSelf-healing1 aLee, Younki1 aLee, Seunghyup0 tColloids and surfaces.g2022 Aug. 05, v. 646 p.128923-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11945x0927-77577nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.1289233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03122naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002600151245016900177300001600346520142100362592002801783650001801811650002201829650001801851650001501869650001501884650001101899650002501910650001301935650001701948650002401965650001101989650001802000650002102018650001302039650001602052650002402068650001302092651001902105653001202124653001002136653002202146653001202168653002002180653001702200653001302217653001102230700002002241700002002261700002102281700002002302700001902322773009602341856008602437852000902523655001202532IND60605338320221122144209.0200717e20180208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060533832DNAL7 a10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGarza-Cuartero, Laura10aAntibody recognition of cathepsin L1-derived peptides in Fasciola hepatica-infected and/or vaccinated cattle and identification of protective linear B-cell epitopes  ap. 958-968.  aFasciola hepatica infection causes important economic losses in livestock and food industries around the world. In the Republic of Ireland F. hepatica infection has an 76% prevalence in cattle. Due to the increase of anti-helminthic resistance, a vaccine-based approach to control of Fasciolosis is urgently needed. A recombinant version of the cysteine protease cathepsin L1 (rmFhCL1) from F. hepatica has been a vaccine candidate for many years. We have found that vaccination of cattle with this immunodominant antigen has provided protection against infection in some experimental trials, but not in others. Differential epitope recognition between animals could be a source of variable levels of vaccine protection. Therefore, we have characterised for first time linear B-cell epitopes recognised within the FhCL1 protein using sera from F. hepatica-infected and/or vaccinated cattle from two independent trials. Results showed that all F. hepatica infected animals recognised the region 19–31 of FhCL1, which is situated in the N-terminal part of the pro-peptide. Vaccinated animals that showed fluke burden reduction elicited antibodies that bound to the regions 120–137, 145–155, 161–171 of FhCL1, which were not recognised by non-protected animals. This data, together with the high production of specific IgG2 in animals showing vaccine efficacy, suggest important targets for vaccine development.  aPublisher supplied data 3aB-lymphocytes 3aFasciola hepatica 3aanthelmintics 3aantibodies 3acathepsins 3acattle 3acysteine proteinases 3aepitopes 3afascioliasis 3afinancial economics 3aflukes 3afood industry 3aimmunoglobulin G 3apeptides 3avaccination 3avaccine development 3avaccines 3aIrish Republic 0armFhCL1 0aFhCL1 0aFasciola hepatica 0aVaccine 0aEpitope mapping 0aCathepsin L1 0aPeptides 0aCattle1 aGeurden, Thomas1 aMahan, Suman M.1 aHardham, John M.1 aDalton, John P.1 aMulcahy, Grace0 tVaccine.g2018 Feb. 08, v. 36, no. 7 p.958-968dElsevier LtdwJournal:6210x0264-410X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.01.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04449naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003600111024002000147040001800167072000900185100002000194245016100214300001600375500002400391500001500415520229800430650002202728650001902750650001502769650002302784650002302807650002102830650001802851650003002869650001202899650001202911650001402923650002102937650001802958650002202976650002302998650001103021650001403032650001403046650001203060650004303072650002403115650003103139650002003170650006903190650002603259653002503285653001403310700001703324700001603341773012803357852000903485856011103494856008603605930003303691945002503724946001303749961001303762655001203775IND4381737020221118221735.0060707e200307  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438173702DNAL7 a146801192pmid7 a10.1603/0022-2585-40.4.5122doi7 a10113/34592hdl  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL8211 aAndreadis, T.G.10aInfectivity and pathogenicity of a novel baculovirus, cuniNPV from Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae) for thirteen species and four genera of mosquitoes  ap. 512-517.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aThe infectivity and pathogenicity of newly discovered baculovirus, CuniNPV (family Baculoviridae, genus Nulclepolyhedrovirus) originally isolated from the mosquito Culex nigripalpus Theobald, was evaluated in laboratory bioassys against thirteen species and four genera of mosquitoes native to the northeastern U.S. Purified virus at a dosage rate of 1.6 x 10⁷ occlusion bodies/ml with 10 mM Mg2+ added was used in exposures with second through fourth instars at temperatures ranging from 17 to 27°C. High infection rates and accompanying mortality were achieved in Cx. pipiens L. (83.0-14.4%), Cx. pipiens f. molestus (80.4% infection), and Cx. salinarius Coquillett (48.0-43.1%). Cx. restuans Theobald was also susceptible but infection rates were lower (21.3-12.5%). The gross pathology associated with infection was identical to that reported in Cx. nigripalpus. Infected larvae were lethargic and were often suspended at the water surface. Development of CuiNPV was observed in the nuclei of the midgut epitheial cells in the gastric caeca and posterior region of the stomach of host larvae. One hundred percent mortality was observed in all larvae that exhibited gross symptoms of infection within 4-d p.i. Cx. territans Walker (subgenus Neoculex Dyar) was the only Culex mosquito that was not susceptible. No infections were obtained with any species of Aedes [Ae. vexans (Meigen)], Culiseta [Culiseta morsitans (Theobald)] or Ochlerotatus [Ochlerotatus canadensis (Theobald), Oc. cantator (Coquillett), Oc. communis (De Geer), Oc. excrucians (Walker), Oc. japonicus (Theobald), Ochlerotatus stimulans (Walker), and Ochlerotatus triseriatus (Coquillett)]. The host range of CuniNPV appears to be restricted to Culex mosquitoes within the subgenus Culex. An inhibitory effect on transmission of CuniNPV was observed when a liver powder/Brewer's yeast mixture was used as a source of food reinforcing the critical role of Mg2+ and sensitivity of the infection process to the presence other divalent cations (Cu2+, Fe2+, and Zn2+) in the larval medium that interfered with the infection process. The high infectivity and pathogenicity of CuniNPV for the principal vectors of West Nile virus in North America make CuniNPV an attractive candidate for future development as a biopesticide. 3aCulex nigripalpus 3ainsect viruses 3ahost range 3aviral insecticides 3avirus transmission 3aartificial diets 3aBaculoviridae 3abiological control agents 3ainstars 3acations 3amagnesium 3amosquito control 3apathogenicity 3awater temperature 3adisease resistance 3alarvae 3amortality 3ainfection 2aAnimals 2aCulexxgrowth & developmentxvirology. 2aCulicidaexvirology 2aDigestive Systemxvirology 2aLarvaxvirology 2aNucleopolyhedrovirusesxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aPest Controlxmethods 0aNucleopolyhedrovirus 0aCulicidae1 aBecnel, J.J.1 aWhite, S.E.0 tJournal of medical entomology.g2003 July, v.  40, no.  4 p.512-517dEntomology Dept., B.P.

High‐throughput analysis is facilitated by an Nd:YLF solid state laser capable of pulse repetition rates up to 5 kHz, a high digitizer acquisition rate (up to 50 pixels/s), and continuous laser raster sampling. MS/MS experiments are enabled through the use of a precision timed ion selector, second source acceleration, and a dedicated collision cell. Continuous raster sampling is shown here to facilitate rapid MS/MS ion image acquisition from thin tissue sections for the drug rifampicin and for a common kidney lipid, SM4s(d18:1/24:1). The ability to confirm the structural identity of an analyte as part of the MS/MS imaging experiment is an essential part of the analysis. Additionally, the increase in sensitivity and specificity afforded by an MS/MS approach is highly advantageous, especially when interrogating complex chemical environments such as those in biological tissues. Herein, we report continuous laser raster sampling TOF/TOF imaging methodologies which demonstrate 8 to 14‐fold increases in throughput compared with existing MS/MS instrumentation, an important advantage when imaging large areas on tissues.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adesorption 3adrugs 3aimage analysis 3ainstrumentation 3aionization 3akidneys 3amass spectrometry 3arifampicin 3aspectrometers 3atissues1 aChumbley, Chad W.1 aCaprioli, R.

The K ₘ values for NADH and NO3− were 40 µM and 104 µM, respectively. Activity of the reduction of nitrate was very high with reduced methylviologen and NADH, but no activity was observed with NADPH or reduced flavin mononucleotide; oxidation of NADH was very high with cytochrome c but did not occur with ferricyanide. These results indicate that Emiliania nitrate reductase is NADH-specific (EC 1.6.6.1), and that among algae and plants its subunit structure and kinetic properties are unique.  aPublisher supplied data 3aEmiliania huxleyi 3aNAD (coenzyme) 3aNADP (coenzyme) 3acytochrome c 3amolecular weight 3anitrate reductase 3anitrate reduction 3anitrates 3aoxidation1 aShiraiwa, Yoshihiro0 tMarine biotechnology.g2003 Feb., v. 5, no. 1 p.20-26dSpringer-Verlagx1436-22287nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10126-002-0051-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01752naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002000148245012700168300001400295520061600309592002800925650002200953650001300975650002100988650000901009650001201018651001601030653001701046653002001063653001301083653002201096653002001118773017301138856008201311852000901393655001201402IND60655505020221120200830.0190801e20190211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065550502DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.121.1.542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMaier, Chris T.10aRange Expansion of the Viburnum Leaf Beetle, Pyrrhalta viburni (Paykull, 1799) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), in Connecticut  ap. 54-62.  aThe Eurasian viburnum leaf beetle, Pyrrhalta viburni (Paykull, 1799), can injure and sometimes kill wild and cultivated Viburnum spp. in North America.

M. B.10aOptimization and Selection of Reforming Approaches for Syngas Generation from Natural/Shale Gas  ap. 1841-1855.  aReforming of natural or shale gas is the primary industrial method for the production of syngas. There are four major approaches to reforming: steam reforming, partial oxidation, dry reforming, and combinations of these reforming reactions. The selection of the reforming approach is not a straightforward task. It is highly dependent on process objectives and availability of material and energy resources. Furthermore, the reformer selection has a significant impact on: process yield, energy requirement, CO₂ emissions, and wastewater generation. It also has operational implications including: catalyst life, process safety, and control. The purpose of this work is to develop a systematic tool to aid in the modeling and selection of appropriate reformers to achieve an objective. This can include particular process or economic objectives and constraints such as H₂:CO ratio. An equilibrium model is developed and solved using optimization software (LINGO). Economic, energy, and environmental constraints are included in the optimization formulation. Top-level economic scenarios were investigated including the inclusion of carbon tax, natural gas, and energy price fluctuations. The work is also extended to shale gas reforming and shows that the composition of the shale gas has a significant impact on potential yields. Given the potential variability in shale gas composition, the optimization model is also used in selecting a gas reservoir (feedstock) for specific objectives and constraints of the reforming process. The inclusion of strict energy and environmental constraints can favor some reforming options over others.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon markets 3acatalysts 3acomputer software 3aenergy 3aenergy costs 3aengineering 3afeedstocks 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3amodels 3anatural gas 3aoxidation 3ashale gas 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3awastewater1 aElbashir, Nimir O.1 aEl-Halwagi, Mahmoud M.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 05, v. 53, no. 5 p.1841-1855dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie402382w3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03560naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094024002200127024001900149040001800168100001800186245006700204300002000271506007600291520182600367592002802193506003702221650003102258650003502289650002002324650001702344650001002361650002002371650002402391650002102415650002902436650003602465650002202501650001202523700001902535700002102554700002402575700002502599700002302624700002302647700002302670700002602693700002502719700002202744773017602766856007902942852000903021655001203030IND60178553620221207134805.0150604e20140415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6017855362DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.13201781112doi7 aPMC39926542pmcid7 a247067782pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAnderson, Ian10aHeat shock protein 90 controls HIV-1 reactivation from latency  ap. E1528-E1537.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aLatency allows HIV-1 to persist in long-lived cellular reservoirs, preventing virus eradication. We have previously shown that the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is required for HIV-1 gene expression and mediates greater HIV-1 replication in conditions of hyperthermia. Here we report that specific inhibitors of Hsp90 such as 17-(N-allylamino)-17-demethoxygeldanamycin and AUY922 prevent HIV-1 reactivation in CD4+ T cells. A single modification at position 19 in the Hsp90 inhibitors abolished this activity, supporting the specificity of the target. We tested the impact of Hsp90 on known pathways involved in HIV-1 reactivation from latency; they include protein kinase Cs(PKCs), mitogen activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated kinase/positive transcriptional elongation factor-b and NF-κB. We found that Hsp90 was required downstream of PKCs and was not required for mitogen activated protein kinase activation. Inhibition of Hsp90 reduced degradation of IkBα and blocked nuclear translocation of transcription factor p65/p50, suppressing the NF-κB pathway. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Hsp90 interacts with inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK) together with cochaperone Cdc37, which is critical for the activity of several kinases. Targeting of Hsp90 by AUY922 dissociated Cdc37 from the complex. Therefore, Hsp90 controls HIV-1 reactivation from latency by keeping the IKK complex functional and thus connects T-cell activation with HIV-1 replication. AUY922 is in phase II clinical trial and, in combination with a PKC-ϑ inhibitor in phase II clinical trial, almost completely suppressed HIV-1 reactivation at 15 nM with no cytotoxicity. Selective targeting of the Hsp90/Cdc37 interaction may provide a powerful approach to suppress HIV-1 reactivation from latency.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aHuman immunodeficiency virus 1 3aclinical trials 3acytotoxicity 3afever 3agene expression 3aheat shock proteins 3aprotein kinase C 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3avirus replication 3aviruses1 aLow, Jun Siong1 aWeston, Stuart.,1 aWeinberger, Michael1 aZhyvoloup, Alexander1 aLabokha, Aksana A.1 aCorazza, Gianmarco1 aKitson, Russell A.1 aMoody, Christopher J.1 aMarcello, Alessandro1 aFassati, Ariberto0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2014 Apr. 15, v. 111, no. 15 p.E1528-E1537dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.13201781113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03001naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002000092024003700112040001800149100002000167245010500187300001800292500000900310520165900319592002801978650001102006650001002017650001302027650002302040650002402063650002102087650002502108650002102133650002802154650001102182650001702193650001802210650001102228773012302239852000902362856011102371856008402482961001302566655001202579IND4388285420221118221437.0191228e200607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438828542DNAL7 a10113/34632hdl7 a10.2135/cropsci2005.08-02712doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aUlloa, Mauricio10aHeritability and Correlations of Agronomic and Fiber Traits in an Okra-Leaf Upland Cotton Population  ap. 1508-1514.  aepub  aIn cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.), the cost and time to develop and evaluate appropriate genetic populations have limited the number of intensive and complete heritability studies. Herein, three agronomic and 17 fiber quality traits were assessed for heritability and correlation analyses on progeny rows in an okra-leaf cotton population of 208 families. Progenies were advanced in succeeding generations by a single-seed descent. Comparison between F₂:₃ and F₂:₆ generations for individual traits and individual progeny by trait revealed significant differences between the two generations. Heritability estimates (h ² > 0.60), and correlations within and between (r > 0.55) F₂:₃ and F₂:₆, generations have practical applications for the simultaneous improvement of multiple fiber traits. Fiber strength was positively correlated to 2.5 and 50% fiber span length and negatively correlated to short fiber content. Number of neps was positively correlated to number of seed coats, and short and immature fiber content, and negatively correlated to mean fiber fineness and maturity ratio. The genetic potential for improving agronomic and fiber traits may exist in populations with this alternative leaf morphology, okra-leaf type. Mass selection may be effective for improving most of the above traits (h² > 0.60). However, pedigree, sibs, and progeny tests need to be used to achieve higher genetic progress. Selection may be applied as early as the F₃ when selection units can be replicated. Thereafter, antagonistic trait correlations may become neutral or favorable in later generations, facilitating improvement of fiber quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3acotton 3atesta 3adiameter 3aGossypium hirsutum 3agenetic correlation 3aagronomic traits 3astrength (mechanics) 3aplant morphology 3aplant genetic resources 3alength 3aheritability 3afiber quality 3aleaves0 tCrop science.g2006 July, v. 46, no. 4 p.1508-1514dCrop Science Society of AmericawJournal:jnl44570x0011-183X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttps://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/34633Available in the National Agricultural Library PubAg search system40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2005.08-02713Available from publisher's site  aUSDA/ARS 7aarticle03336naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001300152245009600165300001600261520180700277592002802084650002002112650002002132650001502152650001502167650000802182650002602190650002202216650001102238650001902249650002302268650001102291651002102302651001502323653001902338653003002357653002302387653003002410653002102440653002302461700001802484700001702502700001902519700001502538700001602553700001902569700001802588773010402606856008702710852000902797655001202806IND60612509220221118060719.0201125e201810  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061250922DNAL7 a10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.08.0362doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Pu10aTemporal variation (2011–2014) of atmospheric OCPs at King George Island, west Antarctica  ap. 432-439.  aA three-year sampling campaign (Jan 2011–Jan 2014) was conducted on organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) using high-volume air sampling nearby the Chinese Great Wall Station, west Antarctica. The concentrations of ∑₂₃OCPs ranged between 5.87 and 27.9 pg m⁻³ (mean 14.3 ± 5.4 pg m⁻³), and no temporal trend was observed over the entire sampling period. However, the dominant compound, hexachlorobezene (HCB) (71% on average of ∑₂₃OCPs), exhibited a seasonal variation with higher levels in the austral winter. Gas-particle partitioning of OCPs was explored based on KOA absorption model, steady-state model and Junge–Pankow adsorption model. LogKP showed significantly negative correlations with logPL⁰ of OCPs (p < 0.01, the slope is −0.30) and TSP values in the samples (p < 0.01), suggesting absorption by the organic matter as the dominant sorption process and TSP as an important factor influencing gas-particle partitioning of OCPs in this remote environment. The chiral signature indicated a commonly nonracemic residue of α-HCH and o,p’-DDT in the Antarctic air. The deviation from racemic (DFR) of o,p’-DDT showed a strongly negative dependence on its concentration (p < 0.01), properly suggesting more fresh input of o,p’-DDT after 2011. Preferential depletion of (+) α-HCH was observed mainly in gas phase, indicating the influence of re-volatilization of chiral compounds from source areas and/or ocean on their enantiomeric composition in remote air. Source apportionment demonstrated that long range atmospheric transport (LRAT) was the main transport pathway of OCPs, while nonracemic residues of HCHs and DDTs indicated a contribution of secondary source emission, i.e. seawater-air exchange, to their occurrence in west Antarctica.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDDT (pesticide) 3aHCH (pesticide) 3aabsorption 3aadsorption 3aair 3aatmospheric chemistry 3ahexachlorobenzene 3amodels 3aorganic matter 3aseasonal variation 3awinter 3aAntarctic region 3aAntarctica 0aAntarctica air 0aOrganochlorine pesticides 0aTemporal variation 0aGas-particle partitioning 0aChiral signature 0aSource implication1 aMeng, Wenying1 aLi, Yingming1 aZhang, Qinghua1 aZhang, Lin1 aFu, Jianjie1 aYang, Ruiqiang1 aJiang, Guibin0 tAtmospheric environment.g2018 Oct., v. 191 p.432-439dElsevier LtdwJournal:12031x1352-23107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2018.08.0363Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02445naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002300148245010700171300001500278520123800293592002801531650001201559650001401571650001801585650001201603650001601615650001401631650001701645650001801662650001201680650001601692650001401708651001501722651001001737653001201747700002301759773017401782856008201956852000902038655001202047IND60655505220221120192001.0190801e20190211xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065550522DNAL7 a10.4289/0013-8797.121.1.812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPollock, Darren A.10aRecords of Coleoptera as Prey of Robber Flies (Diptera: Asilidae) in Eastern New Mexico and West Texas  ap. 81-102.  aTwo hundred and ninety-three records for 20 families of Coleoptera (excluding Carabidae) preyed upon by 36 species (in 18 genera) of robber flies (Diptera: Asilidae) in eastern New Mexico and adjacent west Texas are listed. Among genera of asilid predators, individuals of Heteropogon Loew, 1847 (4 spp.) were responsible for 54.6% of all Coleoptera prey records, followed by Efferia Coquillett, 1893 (7 spp.) with 10.2% and Diogmites Loew, 1866 (3 spp.) with 9.2%. The three genera of asilids with the highest percentage of beetle prey among all insect and spider prey collected were Ospriocerus Loew, 1866 (41% of 44 records), Heteropogon Loew, 1847 (23% of 814 records) and Proctacanthus Macquart, 1838 (10% of 440 records). Four families of beetles accounted for 72% of prey records: 33% were Chrysomelidae (comprising 16 species), 18% Scarabaeidae (15 species), 11% Tenebrionidae (4 species), and 10% Melyridae (6 species). Data are presented on the prey composition for each of the 18 asilid genera documented in this paper.

In this paper, an integrated watershed model considering important hydrological processes has been presented for the event based runoff simulation. Green–Ampt–Mein–Larson model has been used for the estimation of infiltration. For runoff estimation, kinematic wave equations are solved for a channel network using finite-element method. Remotely sensed data have been used for evaluating land use/land cover data. Geographical information systems have been used for the preparation of digital elevation model and various thematic maps. The developed integrated model has been applied to Harsul watershed in India. Calibration of the model has been carried out using six rainfall events and validation with four rainfall events. From the results, it is seen that the model is able to simulate the hydrographs with reasonable accuracy. A sensitivity analysis of the model has also been carried out. The developed model is useful for runoff estimation in small watersheds.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural watersheds 3aequations 3ageographic information systems 3ahydrograph 3ahydrologic models 3aland cover 3aland use 3arain 3aremote sensing 3arunoff 3athematic maps 3awater management 3aIndia 0aChannel network 0afinite-element method 0ageographical information systems 0aremotely sensed data 0arunoff simulation1 aEldho, T.I.1 aRao, E.P.1 aKulkarni, A.T.0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.17-30dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2010.547497  aDNAL 7aarticle02214naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012000169300001600289520091500305592002801220650001601248650001801264650001701282650001501299650001001314650002101324650004401345650002601389650002701415700001401442700001701456700001801473700002301491700002201514700002601536700002401562700002201586773009401608856008101702852000901783655001201792IND60124372120221118043040.0150427e201505  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012437212DNAL7 a10.1007/s12223-014-0366-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aStodůlková, Eva12aA highly diverse spectrum of naphthoquinone derivatives produced by the endophytic fungus Biatriospora sp.

Ascomycone B and 6-deoxyfusarubin elicited rapid cytotoxicity at micromolar concentrations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aX-radiation 3aculture media 3acytotoxicity 3aendophytes 3afungi 3ahuman cell lines 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3asecondary metabolites 3asubmerged fermentation1 aMan, Petr1 aKuzma, Marek1 aČerný, Jan,1 aCísařová, Ivana1 aKubátová, Alena1 aChudíčková, Milada1 aKolařík, Miroslav1 aFlieger, Miroslav0 tFolia microbiologica.g2015 May, v. 60, no. 3 p.259-267dSpringer-Verlagx0015-56327nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-014-0366-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02609naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001900139245011100158300001800269520130000287592002801587650002901615650001501644650001201659650001601671650002001687650001401707650002301721650001601744650001501760650001301775650001301788650001801801650001101819650001801830700002501848700001401873700001301887700002601900700002001926773013301946856007502079852000902154655001202163IND60538213020221118092402.0160815e20140205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053821302DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402465z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatanou, Eleni10aMicrocalorimetric Studies on Co–Re/γ-Al2O3 Catalysts with Na Impurities for Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis  ap. 1787-1793.  aIn Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS), sodium impurities originating from biomass feedstock can be introduced into the catalyst as traces via the synthesis gas. The addition of small amounts of Na to a Co-based Fischer–Tropsch catalyst has been studied in terms of catalytic performance and key characteristics. The Na addition had a severe effect on the catalytic performance, causing significant suppression of the catalytic activity. Small amounts of Na (up to 1000 ppm) had no effect on chemisorption amounts or heats of adsorption for H₂ or CO. Higher amounts of Na added (10 000 or 20 000 ppm) had a dramatic effect on the activity and selectivity in CO hydrogenation. Minor changes in heats of adsorption and chemisorption uptake suggest that the effect of large amounts of Na can be assigned both to geometric and electronic effects. Stronger adsorption of the reactants in parallel to the diffusion barrier caused by the site blocking from Na atoms could explain the dramatic drop in the catalytic activity. For the samples containing low amounts of Na (<1000 ppm), the results cannot support the previous hypothesis; in this case, the negative effect on the activity is suggested to be ascribed to the mobility of the Na, triggered by the presence of water under FTS conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFischer-Tropsch reaction 3aadsorption 3abiomass 3acalorimetry 3acarbon monoxide 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3aengineering 3afeedstocks 3ageometry 3ahydrogen 3ahydrogenation 3asodium 3asynthesis gas1 aLillebø, Andreas H.1 aYang, Jia1 aChen, De1 aHolmen, A.q(Anders),1 aBlekkan, Edd A.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 05, v. 53, no. 5 p.1787-1793dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie402465z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03509naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002400139245010000163300001800263520216200281592002802443650002302471650001302494650001802507650001402525650001602539650001302555650001902568650000902587650001702596650001302613650001302626650002402639650003102663650002302694650002002717700001602737700001802753700002102771700001902792700002302811773013302834856007502967852000903042655001203051IND60538213120221118092351.0160815e20140205xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053821312DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402486c2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aElmalik, Elfatih E.10aRole of Hydrocarbon Building Blocks on Gas-to-Liquid Derived Synthetic Jet Fuel Characteristics  ap. 1856-1865.  aThe role of typical hydrocarbon building blocks of gas-to-liquid (GTL) derived jet fuels on their physical and chemical properties have been investigated. The ultimate goal of our studies is to develop accurate composition–property relationships for synthetic fuels to be used in optimizing synthetic fuel properties as per the aviation industry standards. The composition–property analysis has been carried out through formulating in-house fuel blends using neat GTL fuel building blocks (normal-, iso-, and cyclo-paraffins). Typical properties of interest in this study are density, freezing point, flash point, and heat content, all of which are essential for jet fuel certification. The systematic approach developed in this study was to identify an optimized region, in which all major properties for aviation standards are met. Different techniques were used, including the development of ternary mapping of these aforementioned building blocks alongside their physical properties. This has been achieved through formulating 35 blends giving a broad spread across the ternary map and generating a database from the experimental results. The optimized region and the composition–property relationships were obtained through building a statistical model of artificial neutral networks (ANNs) using the data generated as its basis. The generated data show that some properties, such as freezing point, exhibit nonlinear results whereas others are strongly linear, such as density and heat content. Aromatics in jet fuels are impactful (and required) even though their environmental harms are evident, and as such, their role on certain properties was preliminarily investigated. Furthermore it has been observed that different crystal shapes exist within some areas in the freezing point ternary map. Finally, the use of mathematical models as predictive tools was investigated, and in most instances the model developed was accurate. The outcome of the current study has been used to develop a new visualization technique for the relationship between GTL synthetic paraffinic kerosene’s and their building blocks (i.e., paraffinic hydrocarbons).  aPublisher supplied data 3aaromatic compounds 3aaviation 3acertification 3adatabases 3aengineering 3afreezing 3afreezing point 3aheat 3ahydrocarbons 3aindustry 3akerosene 3aphysical properties 3aphysicochemical properties 3astatistical models 3asynthetic fuels1 aRaza, Bilal1 aWarrag, Samah1 aRamadhan, Haider1 aAlborzi, Ehsan1 aElbashir, Nimir O.0 tIndustrial & Engineering Chemistry Research.g2014 Feb. 05, v. 53, no. 5 p.1856-1865dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fie402486c3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03065naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004400094040001800138100001900156245012900175300001400304506002800318520140800346592002801754506003701782650001901819650003501838650002701873650001201900650001201912650001001924650001801934650001101952650001601963650001101979650001301990650001302003650001102016650001002027653002002037653002002057653001102077653002802088653002802116653002402144653002402168700001902192700002102211700002002232773018302252856009102435852000902526655001202535IND60739798720221207065805.0190819e201808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6073979872DNAL7 a10.30766/2072-9081.2018.65.4.76-812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPavlova, S.

The experiment is put on grass stand of the seventh year of growth. The basis of the stand consisted of the herbs, sown in 1997: Psathyrostachys juncea, Bromus inermis Leyss and Medicago falcata L. Soils of the experimental site are cryogenic, flood-plain, sod (steppificated). Studied was the efficiency of mineral nitrogen (N60-120) against the background of P60K60 and subsowing of a lucerne in cereal old-age herbage (at a sсarifiсation and an inoculation of seeds with bacterial preparation Yakut local strain CB No.1). The article provides the results of old-age cereal and bean and cereal herbage studies. Artificial herbage of the twelfth year of growth formed productivity of 1.4-2.5 t/hectare of dry matter at pasture use, with preservation of lucerne in herbage from 3 to 10%. At haying use productivity increase was obtained - 1.0 t/hectare of dry matter. High content of exchange energy (9.4 MJ) is noted at pasture use in variant with bean and cereal mix with lucerne subsowing (2004) + P60K60, at haying use in bean and cereal mix with subsowing of lucerne (2004) at a scarification + P60K60 it is 8.2 MJ. In old-age herbage the efficiency remains at the level of 1.1-1.6 feed units from hectare and 313-615 kg of crude protein.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBromus inermis 3aMedicago sativa subsp. falcata 3aPsathyrostachys juncea 3aSiberia 3aalfalfa 3abeans 3acrude protein 3aenergy 3afloodplains 3aforage 3anitrogen 3apastures 3arivers 3asward 0acentral yakutia 0acryogenic soils 0acereal 0abean and cereal herbage 0anitrogen-fixing strains 0abotanical structure 0amineral fertilizers1 aKuzmina, A.

EtOH-induced neuroinflammation plays an important role in EtOH neurotoxicity. Studies have shown that EtOH activates microglia and induces an inflammatory response. Resveratrol (Rsv) is a natural polyphenol found in a wide variety of plants and fruits, and produces the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in the central nervous system. However, effect of Rsv on EtOH-induced neuroinflammation is still unknown. We investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of Rsv in the context of EtOH-induced neurotoxicity and the molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the effect. The results showed that treatment of rats with Rsv prevented the deficits of spatial reference memory induced by EtOH and mitigated EtOH-induced neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and decreasing the levels of inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor α. The further studies indicated that Rsv reduced TLR2 expression in vivo and in vitro, and downregulated expression of myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). These data demonstrate that Rsv alleviates the ethanol-induced neuroinflammation via inhibition of TLR2-MyD88-NF-κB signal pathway.  aPublisher supplied data 3aToll-like receptor 2 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3acentral nervous system 3acognition 3aethanol 3afruits 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3amemory 3amemory disorders 3aneuroglia 3aneurotoxicity 3aphosphorylation 3apolyphenols 3arats 3aresveratrol 3asignal transduction 3atranscription factor NF-kappa B 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 0aResveratrol 0aethanol 0amicroglia 0aTLR2 0anuclear factor κB1 aShi, Chuandao1 aMeng, Juanjuan1 aXu, Shouzhu1 aLiu, Juntian1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1710-79420 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2018, dElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2018.07.0073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02172naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245009700167300001400264520094400278592002801222650001101250650001501261650002201276650001601298650001101314650001901325650002501344650001501369651001501384651001701399651001001416653001001426653001501436653001101451653001801462653001301480653002501493700003801518773012201556856005101678852000901729655001201738IND50087910120221118181204.0140412e20110301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008791012DNAL7 a10.1080/15715124.2011.5538322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSood, Aditya10aManaging international river basins: reviewing India–Bangladesh transboundary water issues  ap. 43-52.  aAs the demand for fresh water has increased over the years, the conflicts between water-sharing countries have also been on the rise. Many countries, such as Bangladesh in Asia, depend upon water originating from outside their national borders and hence do not have any control in the headwaters and large part of the watershed management of their rivers. Being militarily and economically weaker than its neighbours, it cannot influence their watershed management policies. Consequently, it suffers from both floods and water scarcity. This paper looks at the long-standing conflict between Bangladesh and India with regard to the sharing of water of the River Ganges. It discusses the water quantity and quality problems faced by Bangladesh and its inability to negotiate an equitable deal with India. In order to reduce the water-sharing conflict between Bangladesh and India, a multi-national watershed management approach is required.  aPublisher supplied data 3afloods 3afreshwater 3aissues and policy 3ariver water 3arivers 3awater quantity 3awatershed management 3awatersheds 3aBangladesh 3aGanges River 3aIndia 0aIndia 0aBangladesh 0aGanges 0awater sharing 0aconflict 0awatershed management1 aMathukumalli, Bala Krishna Prasad0 tInternational journal of river basin management.g2011 Mar. 1, v. 9, no. 1 p.43-52dTaylor & Francisx1814-20607nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2011.553832  aDNAL 7aarticle03694naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100003800150245013300188300001800321520164200339592002801981650001402009650002802023650002002051650000902071650001402080650001002094650001502104650004302119650002402162651001102186653001802197653001502215653001602230653002002246653001702266700006102283700005802344700001802402700002002420700002102440700005902461700002102520700002402541700001602565700002102581700002002602700002902622700002402651700001902675773034002694856008503034852000903119655001203128IND60772485820221118011722.0220719e202208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077248582DNAL7 a10.1016/j.numecd.2022.03.0212doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKontochristopoulou, Aikaterini M.10aSociodemographic, anthropometric, and lifestyle correlates of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in europe: The Feel4Diabetes study  ap. 1851-1862.  aThe current work aimed to identify the predominant correlates of prediabetes and T2DM among a variety of socio-demographic, anthropometric and lifestyle indices, in a large sample of adults from families at high risk for T2DM. In this cross-sectional study, 2816 adults were recruited from low-socioeconomic areas in high-income countries (HICs) (Belgium-Finland), HICs under austerity measures (Greece-Spain), and low/middle-income countries (LMICs) (Bulgaria-Hungary).

Conversely, <1 cup/week legumes (OR, 95% C.I. 0.55 (0.31–0.99) as well as 0–0.5 servings (OR, 95% C.I. 0.34 (0.12–0.95) and 0.5–1 servings (OR, 95% C.I. 0.37 (0.19–0.71) of full-fat dairy/day have a negative association compared to higher consumptions, respectively. These findings indicate the need for diabetes prevention measures targeting young adults and especially men, above 45 years of age, with central obesity and poor dietary habits and prioritize vulnerable groups and populations living in LMICs. NCT 02393872  aPublisher supplied data 3aadiposity 3across-sectional studies 3aeconomic crises 3afish 3alifestyle 3amales 3ametabolism 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3awaist circumference 3aEurope 0aFeel4Diabetes 0aPrevention 0aPrediabetes 0aType 2 diabetes 0aRisk factors1 aKaratzi, Kalliopi1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5453-898X1 aKaraglani, Eva1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5395-70231 aCardon, Greet1 aKivelä, Jemina1 aWikström, Katja1 aIotova, Violeta1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4160-12001 aTsochev, Kaloyan1 aTankova, Tsvetalina1 aRurik, Imre1 aRadone, Anett S.1 aLiatis, Stavros1 aMakrilakis, Konstantinos1 aMoreno Aznar, Luis,1 aManios, Yannis0 tNutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases.g2022 Aug., v. 32, no. 8 p.1851-1862dElsevier B.V.aThe Italian Diabetes Society, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II UniversitywJournal:11953x0939-47537nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2022.03.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02126naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245013900170300001600309520118700325592002801512650001701540650001101557650002101568651000901589700003401598773012901632856007801761852000901839655001201848IND60764153020221119000827.0220904e20170427xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6076415302DNAL7 a10.17221/103/2016-jfs2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarshad Keivan, Behjou10aImpact of logging intensity on stem density, basal area and biodiversity indices five years after logging in a Caspian hardwood forest  ap. 167-172.  aThe aim of the present study was to analyse the impacts of different logging intensities after five years from logging including non-logged, low (3.4 felled stems per hectare), medium (5.2 felled stems per hectare) and high (7.1 felled stems per hectare) treatments on stem density, basal area, canopy cover, and forest biodiversity indices. The study area was located in northern Iran. Data was collected on a set of 120 circular plots with 5 m radius from both non-logged and logging areas. Stem density, basal area, and percentage of canopy cover were measured. Biodiversity study was done by measuring two diversity indices including Simpson’s and Shannon-Wiener’s, two richness indices including Margalef’s and Menhinick’s and two evenness indices including Pielou’s and Hill’s indices. The results indicated that the treatment with the medium logging intensity was found to cause the highest amount of positive effects on stem density, basal area, and biodiversity indices. It is concluded that harvesting intensity should be limited to a medium level (approximately 5 felled trees per hectare) during each logging operation to improve forest biodiversity indices.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiodiversity 3acanopy 3ahardwood forests 3aIran1 aOmid Ghaffarzadeh, Mollabashi0 tJournal of Forest Science.g, v. 63, no. 4 p.167-172dCzech Academy of Agricultural ScienceswJournal:21419x1212-48347nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.17221/103/2016-jfs3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03151naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002100150245011000171300001600281520158700297592002801884650001701912650002101929650001901950650001601969650001001985650004301995650001202038650003602050650001502086650001102101650001902112650003402131650001402165650001502179653002202194653001302216653001202229653001002241653001702251700001802268700001602286700001902302700002402321700002202345700002502367773014802392856008402540852000902624655001202633IND60612509720221118060620.0180905e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061250972DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biocel.2018.07.0112doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSiddharth, Sumit14aThe soluble nectin-4 ecto-domain promotes breast cancer induced angiogenesis via endothelial Integrin-β4  ap. 151-160.  aCancer stem cells secrete diffusible factors into the microenvironment that bind to specific endothelial cell receptors and initiate an angiogenesis cascade. Tumor-induced angiogenesis is an important parameter of tumorigenesis and is critical for tumor growth and metastasis. A pvrl-4 encoded gene, NECTIN-4, has potential roles in cancer cell growth and aggressiveness, and it is only expressed in cancer cells. There is evidence that nectin-4 plays a role in tumorigenesis, but the function of nectin-4 in tumor angiogenesis has lacked thorough evidence of mechanism. Using highly metastatic breast cancer cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we have developed an excellent angiogenesis model and systematically studied the contribution of nectin-4 to angiogenesis. We also provide in-depth in ovo, in vivo and in vivo evidence that nectin-4 causes angiogenesis. Following hypoxia, metastatic breast cancer stem cells (mBCSCs) driven ADAM-17 expression causes the shedding of the ecto-domain of nectin-4 into the microenvironment, which physically interacts with integrin-β4 specifically on endothelial cells. This interaction promotes angiogenesis via the Src, PI3K, AKT, iNOS pathway and not by Phospho-Erk or NF-κβ pathways. In vitro, in ovo and in vivo induction and abrogation of an angiogenesis cascade in the presence and absence of the nectin-4 ecto-domain, respectively, confirms its role in angiogenesis. Thus, disrupting the interaction between nectin-4 ecto-domain and integrin-β4 may provide a means of targeting mBCSC-induced angiogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aangiogenesis 3abreast neoplasms 3acarcinogenesis 3acell growth 3agenes 3ahuman umbilical vein endothelial cells 3ahypoxia 3ainducible nitric oxide synthase 3ametastasis 3amodels 3aneoplasm cells 3aphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 3areceptors 3astem cells 0aCancer stem cells 0aNectin-4 0aADAM-17 0aHUVEC 0aAngiogenesis1 aNayak, Anmada1 aDas, Sarita1 aNayak, Deepika1 aPanda, Jyochanamayi1 aWyatt, Michael D.1 aKundu, Chanakya Nath0 tinternational journal of biochemistry & cell biology.g2018 Sept., v. 102 p.151-160dElsevier LtdaElsevier LtdwJournal:12452x1357-27257nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2018.07.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04326naa a2200721 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024004100133040001800174100002000192245012900212300001800341500002400359500001500383506007600398520196300474506003702437650001802474650001802492650002402510650001002534650002202544650001502566650001602581650001202597650001102609650001402620650002502634650002602659650002202685650001102707650001602718650002702734650002102761650002002782650005302802650002802855650002902883650001402912650004702926650002402973650003002997650002803027650001403055650003403069650002703103650002203130650005503152651001803207651001803225651001403243653003603257700002103293700002103314700002403335773013303359852000903492856009103501655001203592IND4378483120221207110404.0060306e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437848312DNAL7 a165176402pmid7 aPMC13932182pmcid7 a10.1128/AEM.72.3.1932-1938.20062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlapade, Ola A.10aMicrobial Communities and Fecal Indicator Bacteria Associated with Cladophora Mats on Beach Sites along Lake Michigan Shores  ap. 1932-1938.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aA high biomasses of Cladophora, a filamentous green alga, is found mainly during the summer along the shores of Lake Michigan. In this study, the abundance and persistence of the fecal indicator bacterium Escherichia coli and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) on Cladophora mats collected at Lake Michigan beaches were evaluated using both culture-based and molecular analyses. Additionally, 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing were used to examine the bacterial community composition. Overall, E. coli was detected in all 63 samples obtained from 11 sites, and the average levels at most beaches ranged from 2,700 CFU/100 g (wet weight) of Cladophora to 7,500 CFU/100 g of CLADOPHORA: However, three beaches were found to have site average E. coli densities of 12,800, 21,130, and 27,950 CFU/100 g of CLADOPHORA: The E. coli levels in the lake water collected at the same time from these three sites were less than the recommended U.S. Environmental Protection Agency limit, 235 CFU/100 ml. E. coli also persisted on Cladophora mats in microcosms at room temperature for more than 7 days, and in some experiments it persisted for as long as 28 days. The SRB densities on Cladophora mats were relatively high, ranging from 4.4 x 10⁶ cells/g (6.64 log CFU/g) to 5.73 x 10⁶ cells/g (6.76 log CFU/g) and accounting for between 20% and 27% of the total bacterial counts. Partial sequences of the 16S rRNA gene clones revealed a phylogenetically diverse community, in which the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium-Bacteroides cluster and the low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria were the dominant organisms, accounting for 40% and 12.8%, respectively, of the total clone library. These results further reveal the potential public health and ecological significance of Cladophora mats that are commonly found along the shoreline of Lake Michigan, especially with regard to the potential to harbor microorganisms associated with fecal pollution and odor-causing bacteria.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aribosomal RNA 3apublic health 3acommunity structure 3alakes 3aindicator species 3aCladophora 3aplate count 3abeaches 3aclones 3apollution 3anucleotide sequences 3abacterial communities 3amolecular cloning 3asummer 3atemperature 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aEscherichia coli 2aBathing Beaches 2aChlorophytaxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aDNA, Bacterialxanalysis 2aEcosystem 2aEscherichia colixisolation & purification 2aFecesxmicrobiology 2aFresh Waterxmicrobiology 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSoil Microbiology 2aSulfur-Reducing Bacteriaxisolation & purification 3aLake Michigan 3aUnited States 0aWisconsin 0aEnvironmental Protection Agency1 aDepas, Morgan M.1 aJensen, Erika T.1 aMcLellan, Sandra L.0 tApplied and environmental microbiology.g2006 Mar., v. 72, no. 3 p.1932-1938dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0099-22407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.72.3.1932-1938.20063Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01834naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100001800180245014100198300001600339500002400355520067300379650002601052650001001078650001601088650002401104650001701128650002801145700002301173773009301196852000901289856009301298930003301391945002501424946001101449655001201460IND4421715620221119165908.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442171562DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.04.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL210 0aM001 0aM1201 aNynca, Joanna10aMeasurement of concentration and viability of brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis)spermatozoa using computer-aided fluorescent microscopy  ap. 256-258.  aIncludes references  aThe usefulness of computer-aided fluorescent microscopy for measuring the concentration and viability of brook trout spermatozoa was tested with the NucleoCounter SP-100 system (Chemometec, Denmark).

Tanks received a daily carbon source (tapioca powder) to promote the microbial community and improve water quality, resulting in zero water-exchange during the 49 d. Mean shrimp weight at harvest ranged from 0.20 g (5000 shrimp m⁻³, no added substrate) to 0.40 g (5000 shrimp m⁻³, added substrate). Shrimp growth was significantly greater (P <0.05) when substrates were added but was not significantly affected (P >0.05) by stocking density. Shrimp survival averaged 58.3% across all treatments and was not significantly affected (P >0.05) by stocking density or substrate. A maximum mean harvest density of 2956 shrimp m⁻³ and biomass of 1.11 kg m⁻³ were produced at a stocking density of 5000 m⁻³ with added substrates. Harvest density significantly increased (P <0.05) with stocking density but was not significantly affected (P >0.05) by the addition of substrate. Biomass significantly increased (P <0.05) with stocking density and addition of substrate. Mean TAN and nitrite concentrations were significantly higher (P <0.05) at the higher density and with no added substrate. The results demonstrated that the addition of substrates increased growth and further enhanced production, while also contributing to more favourable water quality conditions. Growth and survival was not affected by stocking density, therefore greater production outputs were achieved at the higher density. 3aPenaeus monodon 3ashrimp 3abody weight 3amortality 3afeed conversion 3ashrimp culture 3astocking rate 3awater quality 3adissolved oxygen 3apH 3awater temperature 3ahydrochemistry 3abiomass 3anitrogen oxides 3anitrites 0aharvest density 0atotal ammonia nitrogen1 aComan, Frank E.1 aJackson, Chris J.1 aGroves, Sarah A.0 tAquaculture.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 293, no. 1-2 p.42-48dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.03.0493Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02733naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001200171245013100183300001600314500002400330520121200354650003801566650004601604650001201650650001001662650001001672650002401682650003701706650001101743650001201754650000901766650001201775650002301787650006101810650001301871650004101884650002901925700001801954700001801972700002201990700001602012700001402028700001202042773012102054852000902175856005502184655001202239IND4437709420221119170304.0100528e201006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443770942DNAL7 a205909832pmid7 a10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00949.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Xin10aGenetic Analysis of ele Mutants and Comparative Mapping of ele1 Locus in the Control of Organ Internal Asymmetry in Garden Pea  ap. 528-535.  aIncludes references  aPrevious study has shown that during zygomorphic development in garden pea (Pisum sativum L.), the organ internal (IN) asymmetry of lateral and ventral petals was regulated by a genetic locus, SYMMETRIC PETAL 1 (SYP1), while the dorsoventral (DV) asymmetry was determined by two CYC-like TCP genes or the PsCYC genes, KEELED WINGS (K) and LOBED STANDARD 1 (LST1). In this study, two novel loci, ELEPHANT EAR-LIKE LEAF 1 (ELE1) and ELE2 were characterized. These mutants exhibit a similar defect of IN asymmetry as syp1 in lateral and ventral petals, but also display pleiotropic effects of enlarged organ size. Genetic analysis showed that ELE1 and ELE2 were involved in same genetic pathway and the enlarged size of petals but not compound leaves in ele2 was suppressed by introducing k and lst1, indicating that the enlargement of dorsal petal in ele2 requires the activities of K and LST1. An experimental framework of comparative genomic mapping approach was set up to map and clone LjELE1 locus in Lotus japonicus. Cloning the ELE1 gene will shed light on the underlying molecular mechanism during zygomorphic development and further provide the molecular basis for genetic improvement on legume crops. 3aLotus corniculatus var. japonicus 3aPisum sativum subsp. sativum var. sativum 3acorolla 3acrops 3agenes 3agenetic improvement 3agenetic techniques and protocols 3aleaves 3alegumes 3aloci 3amutants 2aChromosome Mapping 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aMutation 2aPeasxanatomy & histologyxgenetics. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics1 aZhuang, Li-Li1 aAmbrose, Mike1 aRameau, Catherine1 aHu, Xiao-He1 aYang, Jun1 aLuo, Da0 tJournal of integrative plant biology.g2010 June, v. 52, no. 6 p.528-535dBlackwell Publishing Asiax1672-90727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2010.00949.x 7aarticle03411naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171072000900180072000900189100002100198245011300219300001600332500002400348520156300372650002301935650000901958650001601967650001401983650001801997650002002015650001502035650003602050650001602086650003102102650003002133650002102163650001502184650002102199650001802220650001202238650001702250650001502267650001702282650001602299650002602315653002202341653005602363700002302419700002202442700002102464700002402485773009302509852000902602856009302611930003302704945002502737946001102762655001202773IND4421714020221119170126.0090612e20090715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442171402DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.04.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aL300 0aM001 0aM1201 aMakridis, Pavlos10aUse of microalgae bioencapsulated in Artemia during the weaning of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup)  ap. 153-157.  aIncludes references  aThe microalgae species Chlorella minutissima and Tetraselmis chuii were bioencapsulated in Artemia metanauplii and used during the weaning of Senegalese sole, Solea senegalensis post-larvae. We evaluated the effect of microalgae on: (i) survival and growth of the Senegalese sole post-larvae and juveniles, (ii) expression of genes related to the non-specific immune system, and (iii) the microbial load of sole juveniles. The survival of sole juveniles at the end of the experiment was significantly higher in the treatments added microalgae in their diet compared with the control treatment (P <0.05), while there was no effect on the final weight of sole juveniles. The total numbers of bacteria as determined by the counts on Zobell's medium were significantly lower in both treatments added microalgae compared with the control treatment (P <0.05), whereas no significant differences were shown among the different treatments in the numbers of presumptive Vibrio as determined by counts on TCBS. Four partial nucleotide sequences of genes related to the immune system were isolated from lymphoid tissues of S. senegalensis: natural resistance associated macrophage protein 1 (Nramp1), complement C3, transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), and transferrin. The expression of these four genes was calculated at the end of the experiment in relation to the expression of β-actin, a housekeeping gene. No significant differences (P >0.05) were determined among the three treatments in relation to the expression of the four genes in homogenates of fish. 3aSolea senegalensis 3asole 3amarine fish 3amortality 3aanimal growth 3aimmune response 3acomplement 3atransforming growth factor beta 3atransferrin 3agene expression regulation 3aintestinal microorganisms 3afeed supplements 3amicroalgae 3aimmunostimulants 3aencapsulation 3aArtemia 3afish feeding 3alive feeds 3afish culture 3amariculture 3aChlorella minutissima 0aTetraselmis chuii 0anatural resistance associated macrophage proteins-11 aMoreira, Cristiana1 aAlves Costa, Rita1 aRodrigues, Pedro1 aDinis, Maria Teresa0 tAquaculture.g2009 July 15, v. 292, no. 3-4 p.153-157dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.04.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090926b20091002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/26  aNon-US 7aarticle01921naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100002300149245019500172300001400367500001500381520057600396650002500972650002800997650003601025650001901061650002501080650001301105651001101118653002401129653002201153653001801175700001701193700001401210700001501224700001901239773008401258852000901342856008901351930003301440945001301473946001301486655001201499IND2039303320221119170152.0940506e199301  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203930332DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.1993.96981702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLechat-Vahirua, I.10aAromatic plants of French Polynesia.

The review is divided into three main sections: discussing intrinsic, pre-slaughter and post-slaughter factors that influence leather quality. Only one literature source that investigated the morphology of ostrich skin could be found. The high vascularity near the surface of the skin was indicated in making the skin susceptible to bruising, which influences skin quality, while the strength and flexibility of ostrich leather was attributed to the three-dimensional cross-weave arrangement of collagen fibres. Various studies reported a high degree of variation in quality within and between ostrich skins. The potential of genetic selection for improved skin quality was also considered, and it was demonstrated that most ostrich leather traits exhibited significant genetic variation. Findings on pre-slaughter factors, such as the effects of age, weight, nutrition and management practices, are also summarised. Few research reports on post-slaughter factors that influence leather quality were found. A few studies looked at the effect of storage on ostrich skin quality, but literature on the effect of processing techniques are lacking. Research priorities identified include the development of methods to assess skin quality on-farm and finding objective methods of evaluating ostrich leather quality. 3aprocessing technology 3astorage conditions 3aanimal husbandry 3aalternative livestock 3aostriches 3askin lesions 3abody weight 3amales 3aanimal age 3aStruthio 3aleather 3agenotype 3aproduct quality 3agenetic variation 3afemales 3aSouth Africa 0askin 0aliterature reviews1 aHoffman, L.C.1 aCloete, S.W.P.1 avan Schalkwyk, S.J.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 7 p.549-557dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA082553Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01436naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245014100164300001500305520037800320650001300698650002400711650001200735650002500747650003600772651001000808700001600818700002200834773008500856852000900941856008900950930003301039945001301072946001301085655001201098IND2039305220221119164340.0940506e199301  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203930522DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.1993.96981792doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTrozzi, A.10aConstituents of the cold-pressed oil of Faustrime, a trigeneric hybrid of Monocitrus australasica X Fortunella sp.

In this report, we test three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of two genes for associations to intramuscular fat (IMF) measurements in cattle. We genotyped SNP of carboxypeptidase E (CPE) and ccaat/enhancer binding protein, α (CEBPA) in a sample of a total of 813 cattle of taurine, composite and indicine breeds. All three polymorphisms showed significant differences between breeds, with the widest range found in CEBPA:g.271A > C where the A allele frequency ranged from P = 0.07 in Brahman to 0.88 in Shorthorn. The taurine breeds showed high linkage disequilibrium between the pair of CPE SNP, with all four breeds showing r² = 1.0. The Brahman and Santa Gertrudis showed r² [less-than or equal to] 0.17. Both CPE:g.445C > T and CPE:g.601C > T SNP showed significant allele substitution effects to IMF in animals of taurine ancestry, with an allele substitution effect of α = 0.22, P = 0.020 for CPE:g.445C > T, explaining 0.4% of the phenotypic variance. 3aquantitative trait loci 3abreed differences 3amarbling 3amarker-assisted selection 3abeef cattle 3atissue distribution 3abinding proteins 3acarboxypeptidases 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism 3amuscle tissues 3agenes 3agenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3acattle breeds 3agenetic variation 3aquantitative traits 3acarcass composition 3abody fat 3aAustralia 0aintramuscular fat 0aHanwoo (cattle breed) 0alongissimus muscle 0ameat quality 0acarboxypeptidase E 0accaat/enhancer binding protein1 aBunch, Rowan J.1 aHarrison, Blair E.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 7 p.558-562dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA083073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01236naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245007700164300001400241520026700255650001900522650002500541650003600566700001800602700001800620700001400638700001700652773008400669852000900753856008900762930003300851945001300884946001300897655001200910IND2039305120221119164249.0940506e199301  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203930512DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.1993.96981782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLwande, W.10aConstituents of the essential oil of Helichrysum odoratissimum (L.)

All species were grown at the same site, under the same climatic conditions, and with soil moisture and nutrient availability being non-limiting to plant growth. The forage species evaluated were cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata cv. Kara H0265), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv. Bronsyn), short rotation ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum cv. Concord), fescue (Festuca arundinacea cv. Advance Maxp.), phalaris (Phalaris tuberose cv. Holdfast), paspalum (Paspalum dilatatum cv. Poir. Common), kikuyu (Pennisetum clandestinum cv. Whittet), prairie grass (Bromus willdenowii cv. Matua), lucerne (Medicago sativa cv. Sceptre), persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum cv. Maral), red clover (Trifolium pretense cv. Astred), white clover (Trifolium repens cv. Kopu II), chicory (Cichorium intybus cv. Grouse) and plantain (Plantago lanceolata cv. Tonic). The 14 forage species treatment plots were laid out in a completely randomised block design with three replicate blocks. The treatment plots were around the circumference of a circle so that the three cows used in each test had unbiased access to all forage species within the blocks. The tests comprised observing the forage being grazed at 10-s intervals for 1 h. The cow preference was recorded as time (min) spent grazing on each forage species. Three Holstein Friesian dairy cows of similar dominance were selected and had grazed all 14 forage species before tests. Cows were fed to requirements before each test so that they would be selective in choice of forages. The most preferred species over the whole year was prairie grass followed by kikuyu and then white clover, despite the fact that kikuyu was not available in winter. Fescue was the least preferred grass species. The mean grazing times for prairie grass and kikuyu during the 1-h test periods of grazing was 11.6 and 10.5 min, respectively. White clover and lucerne were the most preferred legumes (9.6 and 9.0 min, respectively), whereas chicory and plantain were little consumed (3.5 and 3.2 min, respectively). A prediction equation comprising water soluble carbohydrates (WSC%) and nitrate-nitrogen [NO₃-N (g/kg DM)] over all seasons and forage species accounted for more variation in cow preference than any other single or combination of variables measured: cow preference [time (min) on plots] = 1.86 + 0.67 WSC% - 1.9 NO₃-N (g/kg DM) (r² = 0.76; s.e. = 2.22; n = 109). The results indicate that the relative palatability of forages can be reasonably well predicted from WSC% and NO₃-N concentration, having a positive and negative effect on cow preference, respectively. The prediction equation was improved for groups of species if neutral detergent fibre (NDF%) was included: grasses, cow preference [time (min) on plots] = 24.5 + 0.42 WSC% - 1.31 NO₃-N (g/kg DM) - 0.39 NDF% (r² = 0.87; s.e. = 1.62; n = 57); legumes, cow preference [time (min) on plots] = 3.02 + 0.98 WSC% - 2.15 NO₃-N (g/kg DM) - 0.08 NDF% (r² = 0.92; s.e. = 1.38; n = 36); and herbs, cow preference [time (min) on plots] = 19.41 + 0.22 WSC% - 1.74 NO₃-N (g/kg DM) - 0.69 NDF% (r² = 0.53; s.e. = 1.81; n = 19). 3adairy cows 3aforage evaluation 3apasture plants 3aforage legumes 3aforage grasses 3afeeding preferences 3apalatability 3atensile strength 3acarbohydrates 3awater solubility 3anitrogen content 3afiber content 3aBromus catharticus 3aPennisetum clandestinum 3aTrifolium repens 3aFestuca arundinacea1 aFulkerson, W.J.1 aNandra, K.S.1 aBarchia, I.M.0 tAnimal production science.g2009, v. 49, no. 7 p.586-594dCSIRO Publishingx1836-57877nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/EA082993Available from publisher's Web site  a20090813b20091002c00000000  aINDd4CTe2009/07/11  aNon-US 7aarticle01542naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131100001500149245015600164300001400320520037500334650002400709650001900733650001100752650001000763650002500773650003600798651002900834700001400863700001500877700001600892700001900908773008400927852000901011856008901020930003301109945001301142946001301155655001201168IND2039304420221119164335.0940506e199301  ilu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND203930442DNAL7 a10.1080/10412905.1993.96981742doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLamaty, G.10aAromatic plants of tropical central Africa.

Stress metabolic markers were found to be among the most significant metabolic markers associated with the mutation, but also compounds related to growth regulation or nutrition. The metabolic phenotype of esk1 was also compared to that of wild type (WT) under various environmental constraints, namely cold, salinity and dehydration. The mutant was shown to express constitutively a subset of metabolic responses which fits with the core of stress metabolic responses in the WT. But remarkably, the most specific metabolic responses to cold acclimation were not phenocopied by esk1 mutation and remained fully inducible in the mutant at low temperature. Under salt stress, esk1 accumulated lower amounts of Na⁺ in leaves than the WT, and under dehydration stress its metabolic profile and osmotic potential were only slightly impacted. These phenotypes are consistent with the hypothesis of an altered water status in esk1, which actually exhibited basic lower water content (WC) and transpiration rate (TR) than the WT. Taken together, the results suggest that ESK1 does not function as a specific cold acclimation gene, but could rather be involved in water homeostasis. 3aArabidopsis 3aacclimation 3agenes 3ahomeostasis 3aleaves 3ametabolome 3amutants 3amutation 3anutrition 3aosmotic pressure 3aphenotype 3aroots 3asalinity 3asalt stress 3ashoots 3asodium 3atemperature 3atranspiration 3awater content 2aArabidopsisxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCold Temperature 2aDehydration 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aMetabolome 2aMutation 2aOsmosis 2aPhenotype 2aPlant Rootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxdrug effectsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Transpiration 2aSodium Chloridexpharmacology 2aStress, Physiological 2aWaterxmetabolism1 aNIOGRET, MARIE-FRANÇOISE1 aKERVAZO, LUCIE1 aLARHER, FRANÇOIS ROBERT1 aKOPKA, JOACHIM1 aBOUCHEREAU, ALAIN0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2009 Feb., v. 32, no. 2 p.95-108dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0140-77917nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2008.01898.x 7aarticle02098naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245009500181300001400276520077800290650001901068650001401087650001301101650001701114650003001131650003201161650006701193650002801260650003401288653002401322700001601346700001601362700001901378700001601397700002101413773010401434852000901538856008501547930003301632946001101665655001201676IND4399239320221119164346.0071223e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439923932DNAL7 a173479222pmid7 a10.1007/s10532-007-9110-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGuo, Jianbo 12aA novel moderately halophilic bacterium for decolorizing azo dye under high salt condition  ap. 15-19.  aHalomonas sp strain GTW was newly isolated from coastal sediments contaminated by chemical wastewater and was identified to be a member of the genus Halomonas by 16S rDNA sequence analysis and physical and biochemical tests.

PrrC homologs are present in many bacterial proteomes, though their biological activities are uncharted. PrrCs consist of two domains: an N-terminal NTPase module related to the ABC family and a distinctive C-terminal ribonuclease module. In this article, we report that the expression of EcoPrrC in budding yeast is fungicidal, signifying that PrrC is toxic in a eukaryon in the absence of other bacterial or viral proteins. Whereas Streptococcus PrrC is also toxic in yeast, Neisseria and Xanthomonas PrrCs are not. Via analysis of the effects of 118 mutations on EcoPrrC toxicity in yeast, we identified 22 essential residues in the NTPase domain and 11 in the nuclease domain. Overexpressing PrrCs with mutations in the NTPase active site ameliorated the toxicity of wild-type EcoPrrC. Our findings support a model in which EcoPrrC toxicity is contingent on head-to-tail dimerization of the NTPase domains to form two composite NTP phosphohydrolase sites. Comparisons of EcoPrrC activity in a variety of yeast genetic backgrounds, and the rescuing effects of tRNA overexpression, implicate tRNALys⁽UUU⁾ as a target of EcoPrrC toxicity in yeast.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEscherichia coli 3aNeisseria 3aStreptococcus 3aXanthomonas 3aactive sites 3abacteriophages 3adimerization 3agene overexpression 3agenetic background 3amodels 3amutation 3aribonucleases 3atoxicity 3atransfer RNA 3aviral proteins 3ayeasts1 aSchwer, Beate1 aSchaffrath, Raffael1 aShuman, Stewart0 tNucleic acids research.g2011 Jan., v. 39, no. 2 p.687-700x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkq8313Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03168naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004300092040001800135072000900153072000900162072000900171100002100180245010400201300001600305500002400321500001500345520164900360650001602009650001702025650001502042650002002057650003202077650002302109650001602132650001102148650002502159650001602184653002402200653001402224700002202238700002002260700001802280700001802298700001902316700002002335700002002355773009202375852000902467856009302476930003302569945002502602946001102627655001202638IND4421712220221119164529.0090612e20090801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442171222DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.04.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL822 0aM001 0aM1201 aVoutilainen, Ari10aInfectivity of trematode eye flukes in farmed salmonid fish -- Effects of parasite and host origins  ap. 108-112.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aParasites cause significant economic losses in fish farming, and knowledge of the mechanisms underlying their effects on hosts is an essential prerequisite of preventative procedures for the parasite problem in hatcheries. One such mechanism is local adaptation of parasites, which should lead to higher infectivity of parasites in sympatric host-parasite combinations compared to corresponding allopatric combinations. In this study, we investigated the infectivity of two ubiquitous species of trematode eye flukes, Diplostomum sp. and Tylodelphus clavata, in their farmed salmonid fish hosts with respect to origin of the parasite and the host. First, we exposed two anadromous and one landlocked Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations to controlled infection by Diplostomum sp. and natural infection by T. clavata. The anadromous salmon populations were local to Diplostomum sp. and non-local to T. clavata. In the case of the landlocked salmon, the population was non-local to Diplostomum sp. and local to T. clavata. Second, we exposed a landlocked population of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) to Diplostomum sp. cercariae from one non-local and two local parasite populations. The results indicated that eye fluke infectivity in both Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr was 1.5-2.6 times higher in local parasite-host combinations compared to those separated by greater geographical distance. This suggests that diplostomid parasites are able to adapt to local host populations, which may have significant implications such as high abundance and prevalence of the parasites in endangered fish stocks that are maintained in hatcheries. 3aSalmo salar 3afish culture 3afish farms 3aanadromous fish 3ahost-parasite relationships 3aSalvelinus alpinus 3aDiplostomum 3asalmon 3atrematode infections 3afarmed fish 0aTylodelphus clavata 0aTrematoda1 aValdez, Henriikka1 aKarvonen, Anssi1 aKortet, Raine1 aKuukka, Hanna1 aPeuhkuri, Nina1 aPiironen, Jorma1 aTaskinen, Jouni0 tAquaculture.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 293, no. 1-2 p.108-112dElsevier Sciencex0044-84867nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.04.0063Available from publisher's Web site  a20090928b20091002c00000000  aINDdRSCe2009/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02920naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001600171245015900187300001600346520116000362650004201522650001001564650001301574650001301587650001301600650001301613650001201626650001101638650003801649650002201687650003001709650002001739650003101759650003101790650003501821650001001856650005601866650003901922650007601961653000802037653000802045653001902053700001302072700001802085700001502103773011502118852000902233856009202242930003302334946001102367655001202378IND4418915720221119164723.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441891572DNAL7 a193889482pmid7 a10.1111/j.1365-3024.2009.01105.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSTEAR, M.J.10aGenetic variation in resistance to mixed, predominantly Teladorsagia circumcincta nematode infections of sheep: from heritabilities to gene identification  ap. 274-282.  aIn cool temperate areas, such as Scotland, sheep are infected by a variety of nematodes but the dominant nematode is Teladorsagia circumcincta. Resistant animals have one or more of the following features: fewer adult nematodes, more inhibited larvae, shorter adult nematodes and decreased production of nematode eggs. In lambs at the end of the first grazing season, the heritability of adult worm length is very strong, whereas the heritability of egg production is moderate. The heritability of worm number is low while there is no detectable genetic variation in the number of inhibited larvae. The major mechanisms underlying resistance to T. circumcincta appear to be the IgA mediated suppression of worm growth and the mast cell mediated regulation of worm number. Mast cell responses are slow to develop, possibly because they are responsible for protein loss and reduced growth of the host. Two genes have been repeatedly associated with resistance to T. Circumcincta: the MHC class II DRB1 locus on chromosome 20 and the interferon-γ locus on chromosome 3. Although the causative mutations are still unknown both genes are plausible candidates. 3apathological processes and conditions 3asheep 3aNematoda 3agenetics 3aimmunity 3abreeding 2aAnimals 2aFemale 2aGenetic Predisposition to Disease 2aGenetic Variation 2aHLA-DR Antigensxgenetics 2aHLA-DRB1 Chains 2aHost-Parasite Interactions 2aInterferon-gammaxgenetics 2aParasite Egg Countxveterinary 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitology. 2aTrichostrongyloideaxpathogenicity 2aTrichostrongyloidiasisxgeneticsximmunologyxparasitologyxveterinary. 0aMHC 0aIgA 0aIgE interferon1 aBoag, B.1 aCATTADORI, I.1 aMURPHY, L.0 tParasite immunology.g2009 May, v. 31, no. 5 p.274-282dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0141-98387nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3024.2009.01105.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03164naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001400182245004600196300001600242500010000258500002400358520160800382650001301990650002202003650001402025650001102039650002002050650000902070650002502079650001102104650003302115650003102148650003402179650002102213650001702234650002402251653002302275700001702298700001302315700001502328773014002343852000902483856008502492930003302577945002502610946001102635655001202646IND4440491820221119164537.0100727e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444049182DNAL7 a205695222pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651100017952doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aRomeo, J.10aPhysical activity, immunity and infection  ap. 390-399.  aPaper presented at the 3rd International Immunonutrition Workshop / edited by Ascension Marcus.  aIncludes references  aDuring the last few decades, scientific evidence has confirmed a wide range of health benefits related to regular physical activity. How physical activity affects the immune function and infection risk is, however, still under debate. Commonly, intensive exercise suppresses the activity and levels of several immune cells, while other immune functions may be stimulated by moderate physical activity. With this knowledge, the understanding of the relationship between different levels of physical activity on the immune function has been raised as a potential tool to protect health not only in athletes but also in the general population; the mechanisms that translate a physically active lifestyle into good health continue to be investigated. Reviewing the literature, although several outcomes (i.e. the mechanisms by which different levels and duration of physical activity programmes affect numerous cell types and responses) remain unclear, given that the additional benefits encompass healthy habits including exercise, the use of physical activity programmes may result in improved health of elderly populations. Moderate physical activity or moderate–regulated training may enhance the immune function mainly in less fit subjects or sedentary population and the pre-event fitness status also seems to be an important individual factor regarding this relationship. Although adequate nutrition and regular physical activity habits may synergistically improve health, clinical trials in athletes using nutritional supplements to counteract the immune suppression have been inconclusive so far. 3aimmunity 3aphysical activity 3ainfection 3ahumans 3ahuman nutrition 2aDiet 2aExercisexphysiology 2aHumans 2aInfectionsxphysiopathology. 2aMotor Activityximmunology 2aPhysical Exertionxphysiology 2aPhysical Fitness 2aRisk Factors 2aSedentary Behavior. 0aliterature reviews1 aWarnberg, J.1 aPozo, T.1 aMarcos, A.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2010 Aug., v. 69, no. 3 p.390-399dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651100017953Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/09/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03522naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100002500129245008100154300001600235500001500251520181500266650001902081650002502100650003702125650002202162650001802184650002102202650001802223650002302241650002002264650001102284650002502295650002002320650004102340650001502381650002402396650003502420650002102455650002102476650002302497650004302520650004002563650003302603650004802636650001202684653001502696653001102711653001202722700001702734700001602751700001602767773007102783852000902854930003302863945001302896946001102909655001202920IND2325820020221119164714.0020305e200104  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232582002DNAL7 a113897542pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFischer-Iglesias, C.10aAuxin distribution and transport during embryonic pattern formation in wheat  ap. 115-129.  a2019-12-05  aInhibitors of auxin polar transport disrupt normal embryogenesis and thus specific spatial auxin distribution due to auxin movement may be important in establishing embryonic pattern formation in plants. In the present study, the distribution of the photoaffinity labeling agent tritiated 5-azidoindole-3-acetic acid ([3H],5-N3IAA), an analog of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), was visualized in zygotic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) embryos grown in vitro and in planta, and used to deduce auxin transport pathways in these embryos. This study provides the first direct evidence that the distribution of auxin, here [3H],5-N3IAA, is heterogeneous and changes during embryo development. In particular, the shift from radial to bilateral symmetry was correlated with a redistribution of [3H],5-N3IAA in the embryo. Furthermore, in bilaterally symmetrical embryos, that is, embryos in the late transition stage or older, the localization of [3H],5-N3IAA was altered by N-1-naphthylphthalamic acid, a specific inhibitor of auxin polar transport. No significant effect was observed in radially symmetrical embryos, that is, globular embryos, or very early transition embryos. Thus, the shift from radial to bilateral symmetry is associated with the onset of active, directed auxin transport involved in auxin redistribution. A change in the distribution of [3H],5-N3IAA was also observed in morphologically abnormal embryos induced on media supplemented with auxin or auxin polar transport inhibitors. By means of a microscale technique, free IAA concentration was measured in in vitro- and in planta-grown embryos and was found to increase during development. Therefore, IAA may be synthesized or released from conjugates in bilaterally symmetrical embryos, although import from surrounding tissues cannot be excluded. 3aembryo (plant) 3adevelopmental stages 3atranslocation (plant physiology) 3aTriticum aestivum 3aembryogenesis 3aplant morphology 3aculture media 3aindole acetic acid 2aAffinity Labels 2aAzides 2aBiological Transport 2aBody Patterning 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHerbicides 2aIn Vitro Techniques 2aIndoleacetic Acidsxmetabolism 2aIsotope Labeling 2aMicroradiography 2aModels, Biological 2aPhthalimidesxantagonists & inhibitors 2aPlant Growth Regulatorsxmetabolism 2aSeedsxcytologyxmetabolism. 2aTriticumxcytologyxembryologyxmetabolism. 2aTritium 0ainhibitors 0aauxins 0aanalogs1 aSundberg, B.1 aNeuhaus, G.1 aJones, A.M.0 tplant journal.g2001 Apr., v. 26, no. 2 p.115-129x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02783naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100002100178245013600199300001800335500002400353506007600377520104500453506003701498650001101535650001101546650001101557650001401568650002001582650003701602650001701639650002401656650001001680650002701690650003801717650001001755650001801765650002001783650001801803650001101821650001101832650004101843650004501884650001601929700001801945700002101963700002601984700002802010773010502038852000902143856007702152655001202229IND4443162020221207104714.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444316202DNAL7 a206640182pmid7 aPMC29451742pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-06702doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYeung, Edwina H.10aRacial Differences in the Association Between Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin and Adiposity in Premenopausal Women: The BioCycle study  ap. 2274-2276.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between measures of adiposity and sex hormone- binding globulin (SHBG) and to evaluate whether such associations differ by race. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Adiposity was measured by anthropometry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry among women (146 white, 50 black, and 25 Asian) aged 18-44 years in the BioCycle study. SHBG was repeatedly measured over one to two menstrual cycles. The ratio of trunkal to leg fat (T/L) was used to assess upper to lower body adiposity. RESULTS: Among whites, all adiposity measures were significantly and inversely associated with SHBG. Among blacks, BMI (β = -0.032), waist circumference (β = -0.016), and T/L (β = -0.033) were significantly associated with SHBG, whereas total and trunkal fat were not (P interaction with race <0.04). Among Asians, measures of central and upper body fat were significantly associated with SHBG (e.g., T/L, β = -0.84) but not BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Associations between SHBG and adiposity differ by race among premenopausal women.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsians 3aBlacks 3aWhites 3aadiposity 3abody mass index 3adual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 3apremenopause 3awaist circumference 3awomen 2aAbsorptiometry, Photon 2aAdiposityxethnologyxphysiology. 2aAdult 2aBlack People. 2aBody Mass Index 2aWhite People. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aPremenopausexethnologyxmetabolism. 2aSex Hormone-Binding Globulinxmetabolism 2aYoung Adult1 aZhang, Cuilin1 aHediger, Mary L.1 aWactawski-Wende, Jean1 aSchisterman, Enrique F.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.2274-2276dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-06703Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03597naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100003300178245013600211300001800347500002400365500001500389506007600404520153900480506003702019650001402056650001002070650002302080650005302103650001702156650004302173650001002216650001202226650001302238650001302251650002002264650002202284650001402306650001002320650006502330650001102395650001102406650000902417650003202426650001602458650002702474650001202501650001702513651001802530651001102548651002602559653000902585653001602594700002502610700001702635700002802652700003302680700001902713773010502732852000902837856007702846655001202923IND4443161720221207105648.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444316172DNAL7 a206280892pmid7 aPMC29451712pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-09922doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelasco Mondragon, Hector E.10aDiabetes Risk Assessment in Mexicans and Mexican Americans: Effects of parental history of diabetes are modified by adiposity level  ap. 2260-2265.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-05  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Parental diabetes history is a well-known risk factor for type 2 diabetes and considered strong evidence for a genetic basis of type 2 diabetes. Whether this relationship is affected by other known risk factors, specifically obesity, remains unclear, possibly due to a relative paucity of lean diabetic patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This issue was investigated using data from a high-risk population from Mexico (National Health Survey 2000, n = 27,349), with observations replicated using U.S. citizens of Mexican descent from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2002 and 2003-2004 (n = 1,568). RESULTS: As expected, positive parental diabetes was a significant risk factor for type 2 diabetes, regardless of age, sex, or adiposity level. However, positive parental diabetes conferred greater risk in leaner individuals than in their overweight peers (P = 0.001). In other words, the effect of BMI on type 2 diabetes risk was smaller in the presence of parental diabetes history. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that parental diabetes is a stronger risk factor for type 2 diabetes in the absence of obesity. Thus, studies in lean diabetic patients could help identify type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes. This study reinforces the concept that parental diabetes and BMI are independent type 2 diabetes risk factors and suggests that glycemic screening may be helpful in assessing type 2 diabetes risk in individuals with parental diabetes history, regardless of their overweight status.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ascreening 3apeers 3aat-risk population 3aNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 3arisk factors 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3agenes 3aobesity 3apatients 3aMexicans 3abody mass index 3aMexican Americans 3aadiposity 2aAdult 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xepidemiologyxetiologyxgenetics. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aMale 2aMexican Americansxgenetics 2aMiddle Aged 2aObesityxcomplications 2aParents 2aRisk Factors 3aUnited States 3aMexico 0aMexicoxepidemiology. 0arisk 0arisk groups1 aCharlton, R.

The nutritional factor, zinc, may remodel these changes with subsequent healthy ageing, because zinc improves the inflammatory/immune response as shown by in vitro and in vivo studies. The intracellular zinc homeostasis is regulated by buffering metallothioneins (MT) and zinc transporters (ZnT and ZIP families) that mediate the intracellular zinc signalling assigning to zinc a role of ‘second messenger’. In ageing, the intracellular zinc homeostasis is altered, because high MT are unable to release zinc and some zinc transporters deputed to zinc influx (ZIP family) are defective leading to low intracellular zinc content for the immune efficiency. Physiological zinc supplementation in the elderly improves these functions. However, the choice of old subjects for zinc supplementation has to be performed in relation to the specific genetic background of MT and IL-6, because the latter is involved both in MTmRNA and in intracellular zinc homeostasis. Old subjects carrying GG genotypes (C–carriers) in the IL-6–174G/C locus display high IL-6, low intracellular zinc content, impaired innate immunity and enhanced MT. Old subjects carrying GC and CC genotypes (C+carriers) display satisfactory intracellular zinc content, adequate innate immunity and are more prone to reach longevity. Zinc supplementation in old C–carriers restores natural killer cell cytotoxicity and zinc status. The genetic variations of the IL-6−174G/C locus when associated with those of the MT1A+647A/C locus are useful tools for the choice of old people for zinc supplementation. 3alongevity 3ahumans 3azinc 3ainflammation 3ametallothionein 3aimmunology 3agenotype 3agenetic variation 3adietary mineral supplements 2aAged 2aAgingximmunology 2aCarrier Proteinsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aDietary Supplements 2aGenetic Variationximmunology 2aHumans 2aImmunityxphysiology 2aInterleukin-6xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aMetallothioneinxgeneticsximmunologyxmetabolism. 2aZincximmunologyxmetabolism. 0asenescence 0aliterature reviews1 aMalavolta, M.1 aCostarelli, L.1 aGiacconi, Riccardo.1 aCipriano, C.1 aPiacenza, F.1 aTesei, S.1 aBasso, A.1 aPierpaoli, S.1 aLattanzio, F.0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2010 Aug., v. 69, no. 3 p.290-299dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651100018623Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/09/06  aNon-US 7aarticle03072naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152072000900161072000900170072000900179100001800188245011700206300001600323500002400339520156500363650003001928650001601958650002401974650001901998650001302017650002102030650001402051650001102065650003602076650002302112650002502135650002002160650002602180653001902206653002102225653002602246700001602272773012402288852000902412856007602421930003302497945002502530946001102555655001202566IND4381969020221119164604.0060716e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438196902DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00432.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aL300 0aL001 0aF6001 aPelletier, Y.10aBehavioural responses of the Colorado potato beetle to trichomes and leaf surface chemicals of Solanum tarijense  ap. 125-130.  aIncludes references  aWild Solanum species constitute a source of resistance to several pests and diseases of potato. Several species of wild tuber-bearing potato have been identified as resistant to the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), including Solanum tarijense Hawkes (Solanaceae). Our objective was to determine the mechanism of resistance of S. tarijense to the Colorado potato beetle and, because the resistance is limited to the adult stage of the insect, to study the host selection behaviour on resistant plants. In the field, Colorado potato beetles demonstrated a unique behaviour when in contact with S. tarijense, abandoning the plant by falling to the ground after a few minutes. The abundant trichomes on the leaves of S. tarijense induced the falling behaviour. However, on S. tarijense feeding remained low even after the trichomes were mechanically removed. Observations demonstrated that the normal sequence of behaviour leading to feeding was interrupted before adult beetles fed on S. tarijense leaves. Feeding experiments using volatile and non-volatile fractions of leaf surface extracts identified a phagodeterrent effect of the volatile fraction. Our results contrast with a similar evaluation of the mode of resistance of Solanum berthaultii Hawkes, a close relative of S. tarijense, on which some feeding occurred and adults did not show falling behaviour. This study presents information on S. tarijense as a new source of resistance to the Colorado potato beetle that can be used for potato breeding. 3aLeptinotarsa decemlineata 3ahost plants 3aSolanum berthaultii 3awild relatives 3apotatoes 3afeeding behavior 3atrichomes 3aleaves 3achemical constituents of plants 3avolatile compounds 3aantifeeding activity 3apest resistance 3aresistance mechanisms 0ahost selection 0afalling behavior 0asources of resistance1 aDutheil, J.0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2006 Aug., v. 120, no. 2 p.125-130dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00432.x3electronic resource  a20061117b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02557naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245006900167300001600236500002400252520141800276650001301694650001601707650000901723650001001732650001401742650001701756650000901773650001101782650002101793650001501814650001601829650001001845650001401855650002501869650001301894650001801907700002101925700001801946773010201964852000902066856004802075655001202123IND4416347620221119164523.0090213e200903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441634762DNAL7 a10.1007/s11738-008-0238-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEkmekçi, Yasemin12aA crop tolerating oxidative stress induced by excess lead: maize  ap. 319-330.  aIncludes references  aTwo 14-day-old seedlings of maize (Zea mays L.) cultivars (3223 and Vero) were exposed to different concentrations of lead [0, 2, 5 and 8 mM Pb(NO₃)₂·4H₂O] for 8 days. Exposure of maize cultivars to excess Pb resulted in a significant root growth inhibition though shoot growth and absolute water content remained less affected. The results of chlorophyll a fluorescence indicated that the highly toxic Pb level affected photochemical efficiency in 3223, while no significant effect was observed in the Vero. At the highly toxic Pb concentration, higher membrane leakage was observed in 3223 leaves than that of Vero. This result was related to the accumulation of Pb. On the other hand, the results suggested that there were similar responses in total soluble POD and GR activities with increasing Pb concentrations between both cultivars. But APX activity significantly decreased at highly toxic Pb level in the Vero while a significant increase observed in the 3223. However, SOD activity in 3223 significantly decreased at the highly toxic Pb concentration compared with that at 2 mM Pb concentration. The results of the present study indicated that, Vero withstands excess Pb with its higher Pb accumulation capacity in roots and better upregulated protective mechanisms compared to 3223. Therefore, Vero is more tolerant to Pb toxicity compared to 3223 which was found to be a less tolerant cultivar. 3aZea mays 3achlorophyll 3acorn 3acrops 3acultivars 3afluorescence 3alead 3aleaves 3aoxidative stress 3aperoxidase 3aroot growth 3aroots 3aseedlings 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atoxicity 3awater content1 aTanyolaç, Deniz1 aAyhan, Beycan0 tActa physiologiae plantarum.g2009 Mar., v. 31, no. 2 p.319-330dSpringer-Verlagx0137-58817nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-008-0238-3 7aarticle02979naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134072000900152100002100161245004300182300001600225500002400241520174900265650001802014650003102032650002602063650002102089650001502110650003802125650002702163653001902190653002002209653002102229653002002250700002102270773012402291852000902415856007602424930003302500945002502533946001102558655001202569IND4381969320221119164708.0060716e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438196932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00442.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF8211 aJasrotia, Poonam13aAn immuno-marking technique for thrips  ap. 155-160.  aIncludes references  aRabbit immunoglobulin G (R-IgG) was used successfully as an external mark for thrips. Females of both Thrips tabaci Lindeman and Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) were marked with 1 mg ml⁻¹ R-IgG solution with 1%'Tween 20' by the contact exposure method. Determining the retention of the mark was by running the rinsing solution of individual thrips in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The sandwich ELISA method was used with an additional biotin-avidin step. The threshold for a positive marking score was defined as three times the mean optical density readings of the negative control thrips. Under laboratory conditions, on bean pods, all marked thrips scored positive up to 6 days after marking (DAM). When marked thrips were kept in the laboratory on marigold flowers for 2 days, they all scored positive. When marked and unmarked thrips were placed together on these flowers, the mark was transferred to 10-20% of the unmarked thrips and they became positive. Under field conditions, on sticky traps covered with water-base glue, 100, 80, and 20% of the marked T. tabaci scored positive by the 3rd, 6th, and 9th DAM, respectively. Under the same conditions 100, 90, and 10% of the marked F. occidentalis scored positive by the 3rd, 6th, and 9th DAM, respectively. The retention of the R-IgG decreased significantly under conditions of wetness and high humidity. After 6 days on chive plants kept at 80-100% r.h., all marked thrips scored negative while on plants kept at 40-60% r.h., 85% of the marked thrips scored positive. Rabbit IgG can be used as an external marker for thrips. The suitability of this marking method for dispersal studies of these important pests needs to be evaluated. 3aThrips tabaci 3aFrankliniella occidentalis 3aanimal identification 3aimmunoglobulin G 3abiomarkers 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3amark-recapture studies 0ainsect marking 0aprotein marking 0amarker retention 0amarker transfer1 aBen-Yakir, David0 tEntomologia experimentalis et applicata.g2006 Aug., v. 120, no. 2 p.155-160dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0013-87037nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.2006.00442.x3electronic resource  a20061117b20061202c00000000  aINDdNZMe2006/11/17  aNon-US 7aarticle02246naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002300145245014300168300001400311520129100325651001401616653001601630653002501646700002001671700002001691773010701711852000901818856008501827930003301912946001101945655001201956IND4415725920221119164402.0090130e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441572592DNAL7 a10.1007/s10236-008-0164-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWakelin, Sarah L. 14aThe influence of initial conditions and open boundary conditions on shelf circulation in a 3D ocean-shelf model of the North East Atlantic  ap. 67-81.  aData from climatology (World Ocean Atlas) and two large scale operational ocean models (Forecasting Ocean Assimilation Model (FOAM), UK Met. Office and the Navy Coastal Ocean Model (NCOM), US Naval Research Laboratory) are used to give initial and open boundary conditions for a northeast Atlantic implementation of the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Model System (POLCOMS). We study the effects of using the different datasets on the temperature fields and the circulation. On the continental shelf, comparisons of POLCOMS output with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sea surface temperature data suggest that the effect of using different ocean model initial and boundary conditions is small and that, after 15 months of model time, the impact of the different initial conditions is negligible. Stronger evidence of influence is seen in the deeper oceanic regions of the domain. Volume fluxes through sections governing flow into and out of the North Sea, through the Irish Sea and along the shelf edge show that the impact of the different boundary conditions is small on the shelf but significant elsewhere. These results are contrasted with the use of climatology to assess the value of these Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment ocean model products. 3aNorth Sea 0aNE Atlantic 0aOcean-shelf exchange1 aHolt, Jason T. 1 aProctor, Roger 0 tOcean dynamics.g2009 Feb., v. 59, no. 1 p.67-81dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1616-73417nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10236-008-0164-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20090130b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02892naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002600135245013100161300001600292520181300308650001702121650001802138653002702156653001902183700002902202700002802231700003102259700003202290773011602322852000902438856007502447930003302522946001102555655001202566IND4412100220221119164523.0081031s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441210022DNAL7 a10.1071/EN080312doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeyakumar, Paramsothy10aCopper and zinc spiking of biosolids: effect of incubation period on metal fractionation and speciation and microbial activity  ap. 347-354.  aEnvironmental context. Global sewage sludge (biosolids) production is increasing as a result of rapidly growing human population and ensuing industrial activities. Disposal of this waste is becoming a serious environmental issue because the high levels of heavy metals in biosolids can upset soil microbial activity and nutrient balance when the waste is added to forest or agricultural lands. In the present study, a biosolid matrix was spiked with copper and zinc as a model for an environmental scenario. The findings of the present study are applicable to environmental regulations that seek to protect agriculture land, human and animal health, and soil and drinking water quality, in scenarios where biosolids are applied to soil. Abstract. Biosolids were amended separately with three levels of copper and zinc sulfate, and anaerobically incubated for 117 days. Copper in the unamended-biosolids solid phase was mainly found in the organic and residual fractions (85-95%). Copper addition decreased the percentage of Cu in these fractions and increased the percentage of Cu in the oxide and specifically adsorbed fractions. Zinc in the solid phase was mainly associated with the oxide (35-65%), specifically adsorbed (25-30%), and the exchangeable fractions (10-40%). Relatively, all Cu in the solution phase was complexed with organic matter; Zn was present mainly as Zn²⁺ and as an electrically neutral ion pair, ZnSO₄⁰. Metals were almost completely incorporated into the biosolids matrix by Day 55. Dehydrogenase activity was reduced by 50% (EC₅₀, effective concentration for 50% activity reduction) at the total solution-phase Cu and Zn concentrations of 0.1 and 20 mg L⁻¹, respectively, and solid-phase exchangeable Cu and Zn concentrations of 410 and 670 mg kg⁻¹, respectively. 3aheavy metals 3asewage sludge 0adehydrogenase activity 0ametal toxicity1 aLoganathan, Paripurnanda1 aSivakumaran, Sivalingam1 aAnderson, Christopher W.N.1 aMcLaren, R.

However, enhancing endogenous sgp130 via alternative splicing of the gp130 gene has not yet been tested. We found that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), an anti-inflammatory compound found in green tea, inhibits IL-1β-induced IL-6 production and transsignaling in RA synovial fibroblasts by inducing alternative splicing of gp130 mRNA, resulting in enhanced sgp130 production. Results from in vivo studies using a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model showed specific inhibition of IL-6 levels in the serum and joints of EGCG-treated rats by 28% and 40%, respectively, with concomitant amelioration of rat adjuvant-induced arthritis. We also observed a marked decrease in membrane-bound gp130 protein expression in the joint homogenates of the EGCG-treated group. In contrast, quantitative RT-PCR showed that the gp130/IL-6Rα mRNA ratio increased by ~2-fold, suggesting a possible mechanism of sgp130 activation by EGCG. Gelatin zymography results showed EGCG inhibits IL-6/soluble IL-6R-induced matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity in RA synovial fibroblasts and in joint homogenates, possibly via up-regulation of sgp130 synthesis. The results of these studies provide previously undescribed evidence of IL-6 synthesis and transsignaling inhibition by EGCG with a unique mechanism of sgp130 up-regulation, and thus hold promise as a potential therapeutic agent for RA.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3aanti-inflammatory activity 3ainflammation 3afibroblasts 3ainterleukin-1 3ainterleukin-6 3amessenger RNA 3aalternative splicing 3amembrane proteins 3areceptors 3aprotein synthesis 3ametalloproteinases 3aenzyme activity 3atherapeutics 3asignal transduction 3arheumatoid arthritis 3arats 0aglycoprotein gp130 0aepigallocatechin-3-gallate1 aMarotte, Hubert1 aKwan, Kevin1 aRuth, Jeffrey H.1 aCampbell, Phillip L.1 aRabquer, Bradley J.1 aPakozdi, Angela1 aKoch, Alisa E.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14692-14697dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08026751053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/10  aOther US 7aarticle03312naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001700184245009300201300002000294506007600314520156900390506003701959650002501996650000802021650001502029650001302044650001002057650001102067650002102078650001202099650001402111650001502125650002902140650002602169700002402195700002502219700002602244700002102270700001502291700002502306700001902331700002802350700002002378700002202398700002302420773017702443852000902620856008302629930003302712946001302745655001202758IND4410684120221207104717.0080926e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068412DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08065101052doi7 aPMC25672042pmcid7 a187871272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLammens, Tim10aAtypical E2F activity restrains APC/CCCS⁵²A² function obligatory for endocycle onset  ap. 14721-14726.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe endocycle represents an alternative cell cycle that is activated in various developmental processes, including placental formation, Drosophila oogenesis, and leaf development. In endocycling cells, mitotic cell cycle exit is followed by successive doublings of the DNA content, resulting in polyploidy. The timing of endocycle onset is crucial for correct development, because polyploidization is linked with cessation of cell division and initiation of terminal differentiation. The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) activator genes CDH1, FZR, and CCS52 are known to promote endocycle onset in human, Drosophila, and Medicago species cells, respectively; however, the genetic pathways governing development-dependent APC/CCDH¹/FZR/CCS⁵² activity remain unknown. We report that the atypical E2F transcription factor E2Fe/DEL1 controls the expression of the CDH1/FZR orthologous CCS52A2 gene from Arabidopsis thaliana. E2Fe/DEL1 misregulation resulted in untimely CCS52A2 transcription, affecting the timing of endocycle onset. Correspondingly, ectopic CCS52A2 expression drove cells into the endocycle prematurely. Dynamic simulation illustrated that E2Fe/DEL1 accounted for the onset of the endocycle by regulating the temporal expression of CCS52A2 during the cell cycle in a development-dependent manner. Analogously, the atypical mammalian E2F7 protein was associated with the promoter of the APC/C-activating CDH1 gene, indicating that the transcriptional control of APC/C activator genes by atypical E2Fs might be evolutionarily conserved.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aDNA 3aDrosophila 3aMedicago 3agenes 3ahumans 3aleaf development 3amitosis 3aoogenesis 3apolyploidy 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aBoudolf, Véronique1 aKheibarshekan, Leila1 aPanagiotis Zalmas, L.1 aGaamouche, Tarik1 aMaes, Sara1 aVanstraelen, Marleen1 aKondorosi, Eva1 aLa Thangue, Nicholas B.1 aGovaerts, Willy1 aInzé, D.q(Dirk)1 aDe Veylder, Lieven0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14721-14726dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08065101053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03229naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002000152245010500172300001600277520160800293650001101901650001301912650001301925650002301938650001501961650002501976650001302001650002202014650001502036650001202051650001802063650001002081650002502091650001202116651001902128653002402147653002302171653001702194653002202211653001002233653002002243653002202263700001802285700002202303700002302325700002002348700002102368700002702389773010202416852000902518856009202527930003302619946001102652655001202663IND4418242120221119164324.0090327e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441824212DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.00918.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWilson, Mark W.14aThe importance of pre-thicket conifer plantations for nesting Hen Harriers Circus cyaneus in Ireland  ap. 332-343.  aHen Harriers Circus cyaneus are threatened across much of their range and their conservation requires appropriate habitat management. The locations of 148 Hen Harrier nests found in the Republic of Ireland during national breeding surveys in 2000 and 2005 were used to assess nest-site selection. The distribution of these nests was compared to distributions of randomly located points to investigate selection at the scale of the nest-site and landscape. The main nesting habitats selected were pre-thicket stage of first and, particularly, second rotation plantations, mostly of exotic conifers. There was no evidence that the area of post-closure plantations negatively affected Hen Harrier nest distribution. There was a positive correlation across study areas between changes in numbers of Hen Harrier nests between 2000 and 2005 and changes in the area of pre-thicket second rotation plantations over the same period. The overall effect of plantation forests on breeding Hen Harriers in Ireland therefore appears to be positive. However, this study did not consider the effects of plantation habitats on breeding success. Improved grassland was strongly avoided as a nesting habitat. Furthermore, after controlling for the influence of nesting habitat on nest location, landscapes with a high percentage cover of improved grassland were also avoided. Further agricultural intensification of grassland in areas where Hen Harriers breed is likely to have a negative impact on this species. These results are required for the development of management strategies for the conservation of this species. 3aCircus 3abreeding 3aconifers 3aforest plantations 3agrasslands 3ahabitat conservation 3ahabitats 3aintensive farming 3alandscapes 3anesting 3anesting sites 3anests 3areproductive success 3asurveys 3aIrish Republic 0acommercial forestry 0aconifer plantation 0aconservation 0ahabitat selection 0aheath 0asecond rotation 0aupland management1 aIRWIN, SANDRA1 aNORRISS, DAVID W.1 aNewton, Stephen F.1 aCollins, Kevin.1 aKelly, Thomas C.1 aO'Halloran, J.q(John)0 tIbis.g2009 Apr., v. 151, no. 2 p.332-343dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-10197nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.00918.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090327b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03654naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166072001700184100001800201245011900219300002000338500001500358506007600373520159300449506003702042650002502079650001102104650001402115650001002129650002702139650002102166650001602187650001202203650002102215650001802236653003202254653005502286653002102341700002602362700002002388700002002408700001902428700002002447700002102467700002402488700002002512700002602532700002302558700002502581700002302606700002502629700002202654773017702676852000902853856008302862930003302945945002502978946001303003655001203016IND4410684220221207104719.0080926e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068422DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08050891052doi7 aPMC25671932pmcid7 a187997492pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Two Arabidopsis genes are putative homologues of the recently identified yeast 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydratase (PHS1), the third enzyme of the elongase complex. We showed that Arabidopsis PASTICCINO2 (PAS2) was able to restore phs1 cytokinesis defects and sphingolipid long chain base overaccumulation. Conversely, the expression of PHS1 was able to complement the developmental defects and the accumulation of long chain bases of the pas2-1 mutant. The pas2-1 mutant was characterized by a general reduction of VLCFA pools in seed storage triacylglycerols, cuticular waxes, and complex sphingolipids. Most strikingly, the defective elongation cycle resulted in the accumulation of 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA intermediates, indicating premature termination of fatty acid elongation and confirming the role of PAS2 in this process. We demonstrated by in vivo bimolecular fluorescence complementation that PAS2 was specifically associated in the endoplasmic reticulum with the enoyl-CoA reductase CER10, the fourth enzyme of the elongase complex. Finally, complete loss of PAS2 function is embryo lethal, and the ectopic expression of PHS1 led to enhanced levels of VLCFAs associated with severe developmental defects. Altogether these results demonstrate that the plant 3-hydroxy-acyl-CoA dehydratase PASTICCINO2 is an essential and limiting enzyme in VLCFA synthesis but also that PAS2-derived VLCFA homeostasis is required for specific developmental processes.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3alyases 3aphenotype 3aseeds 3along chain fatty acids 3atriacylglycerols 3alipogenesis 3amutants 3aepicuticular wax 3asphingolipids 0avery long chain fatty acids 0avery long chain hydroxy fatty acyl-CoA dehydratase 0alipid metabolism1 aMichaelson, Louise V.1 aHaslam, Richard1 aBellec, Yannick1 aGissot, Lionel1 aMarion, Jessica1 aCosta, Marco da.1 aBoutin, Jean-Pierre1 aMiquel, Martine1 aTellier, Frédérique1 aDomergue, Frederic1 aMarkham, Jonathan E.1 aBeaudoin, Frederic1 aNapier, Johnathan A.1 aFaure, Jean-Denis0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14727-14731dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08050891053Available from publisher's Web site  a20081010b20081101c00000000  aINDdRHFe2008/10/10  aOther US 7aarticle02960naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001800129245008700147300001600234500001500250520141800265650002801683650001801711650001201729650002101741650001401762650001801776650002701794650001301821650001001834650001201844650001801856650003201874650002501906650001101931650002001942650002801962650003001990650001402020650004102034650004602075650001902121653002402140653001402164653001802178653001102196700001602207700001402223773008902237852000902326930003302335945001302368946001302381655001202394IND2207485120221119164217.0001025e200009  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220748512DNAL7 a110290642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCollins, L.J.10aUse of RNA secondary structure for studying the evolution of RNase P and RNase MRP  ap. 194-204.  a2019-12-05  aSecondary structure is evaluated for determining evolutionary relationships between catalytic RNA molecules that are so distantly related they are scarcely alignable. The ribonucleoproteins RNase P (P) and RNase MRP (MRP) have been suggested to be evolutionarily related because of similarities in both function and secondary structure. However, their RNA sequences cannot be aligned with any confidence, and this leads to uncertainty in any trees inferred from sequences. We report several approaches to using secondary structures for inferring evolutionary trees and emphasize quantitative tests to demonstrate that evolutionary information can be recovered. For P and MRP, three hypotheses for the relatedness are considered. The first is that MRP is derived from P in early eukaryotes. The next is that MRP is derived from P from an early endosymbiont. The third is that both P and MRP evolved in the RNA-world (and the need for MRP has since been lost in prokaryotes). Quantitative comparisons of the pRNA and mrpRNA secondary structures have found that the possibility of an organellar origin of MRP is unlikely. In addition, comparison of secondary structures support the identity of an RNase P-like sequence in the maize chloroplast genome. Overall, it is concluded that RNA secondary structure is useful for evaluating evolutionary relatedness, even with sequences that cannot be aligned with confidence. 3ainterspecific variation 3aribosomal RNA 3aanimals 3agenetic distance 3aphylogeny 3aribonucleases 3amolecular conformation 3abacteria 3afungi 2aAnimals 2aBase Sequence 2aEndoribonucleasesxgenetics 2aEvolution, Molecular 2aHumans 2aModels, Genetic 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aNucleic Acid Conformation 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Catalyticxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 16Sxchemistryxgenetics. 2aRibonuclease P 0aspecies differences 0aevolution 0acatalytic rna 0aplants1 aMoulton, V.1 aPenny, D.0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g2000 Sept., v. 51, no. 3 p.194-204x0022-28447nnas  aDNAL  a20001204b20001212c00000000  aINDdRHF  aOther US 7aarticle04073naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100001800182245008800200300001800288500013700306500002400443500001500467520242600482650001002908650002202918650002702940650001402967650002702981650001403008650002303022650002603045650002203071650003203093650002103125650001403146650002903160650001903189653001603208653002303224700002203247700001803269773009303287852000903380856008503389930003303474945002503507946001103532655001203543IND4440466720221119164236.0100727e201007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444046672DNAL7 a224446062pmid7 a10.1017/S175173111000042X2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL5001 aLourenço, M.14aThe role of microbes in rumen lipolysis and biohydrogenation and their manipulation  ap. 1008-1023.  aPaper presented at the XIth International Symposium on Ruminant Physiology, held on 6-9 September 2009, in Clermont-Ferrand, France.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aDespite the fact that the ruminant diet is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), ruminant products – meat, milk and dairy – contain mainly saturated fatty acids (SFA) because of bacterial lipolysis and subsequent biohydrogenation of ingested PUFA in the rumen. The link between SFA consumption by man and coronary heart disease is well established. In contrast, ruminant products also contain fatty acids that are known to be beneficial to human health, namely conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs). The aims of research in this field have been to understand the microbial ecology of lipolysis and biohydrogenation and to find ways of manipulating ruminal microbes to increase the flow of PUFA and CLA from the rumen into meat and milk. This review describes our present understanding of the microbial ecology of ruminal lipid metabolism, including some apparently anomalous and paradoxical observations, and the status of how the metabolism may be manipulated and the possible consequential effects on other aspects of ruminal digestion. Intuitively, it may appear that inhibiting the ruminal lipase would cause more dietary PUFA to reach the mammary gland. However, lipolysis releases the non-esterified fatty acids that form the substrates for biohydrogenation, but which can, if they accumulate, inhibit the whole process. Thus, increasing lipase activity could be beneficial if the increased release of non-esterified PUFA inhibited the metabolism of CLA. Rumen ciliate protozoa do not carry out biohydrogenation, yet protozoal lipids are much more highly enriched in CLA than bacterial lipids. How could this happen if protozoa do not metabolise PUFA? The answer seems to lie in the ingestion of plant organelles, particularly chloroplasts, and the partial metabolism of the fatty acids by contaminating bacteria. Bacteria related to Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens are by far the most active and numerous biohydrogenating bacteria isolated from the rumen. But do we misunderstand the role of different bacterial species in biohydrogenation because there are uncultivated species that we need to understand and include in the analysis? Manipulation methods include dietary vegetable and fish oils and plant-derived chemicals. Their usefulness, efficacy and possible effects on fatty acid metabolism and on ruminal microorganisms and other areas of their metabolism are described, and areas of opportunity identified. 3arumen 3aprotein synthesis 3abiochemical mechanisms 3acellulose 3atriacylglycerol lipase 3alipolysis 3arumen fermentation 3asaturated fatty acids 3abiotransformation 3apolyunsaturated fatty acids 3abiohydrogenation 3aruminants 3aconjugated linoleic acid 3arumen bacteria 0afatty acids 0aliterature reviews1 aRamos-Morales, E.1 aWallace, R.J.0 tAnimal.g2010 July, v. 4, no. 7 p.1008-1023dCambridge University Pressx1751-73117nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S175173111000042X3Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/09/10  aNon-US 7aarticle02180naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001400184245012500198300002000323506007600343520079400419506003701213650001601250650001501266650001701281650002201298650001901320650002401339650001701363700001501380700001901395700001901414700002401433773017501457852000901632856008301641930003301724946001301757655001201770IND4411258520221207095820.0081010e20081007xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441125852DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08069901052doi7 aPMC25631102pmcid7 a188321752pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Jie10aPhotochemistry and electron-transfer mechanism of transition metal oxalato complexes excited in the charge transfer band  ap. 15235-15240.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe photoredox reaction of trisoxalato cobaltate (III) has been studied by means of ultrafast extended x-ray absorption fine structure and optical transient spectroscopy after excitation in the charge-transfer band with 267-nm femtosecond pulses.

Data presented here strongly suggest that both of these metal oxalato complexes operate under similar photoredox reaction mechanisms where the primary reaction involves the dissociation of a metal-oxygen bond.

Previously, we found that aminoacyl tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 1 (AIMP1) activated macrophages and dendritic cells to enhance Th1 responses. Herein, we manipulated this property to improve Th1 immune responses in vivo by constructing a mammalian expression plasmid (pAnti-CD3sFv/AIMP1) encoding AIMP1 fused to the anti-CD3 single-chain Fv (sFv), the smallest unit of the antibody that interacts with the CD3ε region of the T-cell receptor. Intramuscular injection of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized BALB/c mice with pAnti-CD3sFv/AIMP1 DNA adjuvant increased the OVA-specific, interferon-γ production by their CD4⁺ T cells and the levels of anti-OVA immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) isotype in their sera. Furthermore, the pAnti-CD3sFv/AIMP1 DNA adjuvant decreased interleukin-4 production and anti-OVA IgE levels in the OVA-injected mice. Importantly, the pAnti-CD3sFv/AIMP1 was more efficient than a mixture of pAnti-CD3sFv and pAIMP1 in inducing OVA-specific Th1 immune responses and also in inhibiting OVA-specific Th2 responses during antigen priming. These studies indicated that the pAnti-CD3sFv/AIMP1 fusion DNA adjuvant enhanced Th1 immune responses in antigen-sensitized mice. 0aaminoacyl t-RNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein 1 0aanti-CD3 0aDNA adjuvant 0aT cell 0aT helper cell response1 aO'Sullivan, Insug1 aKim, Eugene1 aPark, Sang Gyu1 aHwang, Seung Yong1 aCho, Daeho1 aKim, Tae-sung.0 tImmunology.g2009 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.84-91dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02880.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02428naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245012400127300001600251520161300267650001001880650002801890650001701918650001001935650002001945653002001965773008501985852000902070930003302079945001302112946001302125655001202138IND2203848420221119164303.0000414e199904  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220384842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFerkin, M.H.10aAttractiveness of opposite-sex odor and responses to it vary with age and sex in meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus)  ap. 757-769.  aCurrent models suggest that among short-lived mammals, such as rodents, older adults are less attractive to the opposite sex and spend less time associated with the opposite sex than do younger adults. The objective of this study was to test two hypotheses in three different age groups of meadow voles. The first hypothesis is that 3- to 5 month old voles produce scents that are more attractive to opposite sex conspecifics than those of 7- to 12 month old and 14- to 18 month old voles. The second hypothesis is that 3- to 5 month old voles spend more time than either 7- to 12 month old or 14- to 18 month old voles investigating the scents of an opposite sex conspecific. The first experiment shows that when choosing between two conspecifics, females prefer the odor of the older male within each pair and that males prefer the odor of the 7- to 12 month old females to those of either 3- to 5 month old or 14- to 18 month old females. Thus, the data did not support the first hypothesis. The second experiment shows that the 14-to 18 month old males spent more time investigating female odors than did either the 3- to 5 month old or 7- to 12 month old males and that 7- to 12 month old females spent more time investigating male odors than did the 3- to 5 month old and 12- to 18 month old females. These data did not support the second hypothesis. Overall, older adult male meadow voles are more interested in and attractive to females than are younger adult males. The present data raise questions as to whether current models predict the age-related effects on the behavior of short-lived mammals. 3avoles 3aMicrotus pennsylvanicus 3ascent glands 3aodors 3asex attractants 0aage differences0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1999 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.757-769x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03112naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001200184245009400196300002000290506007600310520112000386506003701506650000801543650003301551650001901584650001301603650000901616650002001625650001001645650001701655650001101672650001501683650000901698650002201707650002201729650001601751650002201767650001401789650001801803700002201821700002601843700001701869700002001886700002701906700001501933700002001948700002001968700002401988700001702012700002302029700001902052700002402071700002102095700001902116773017702135852000902312856008302321930003302404946001302437655001202450IND4410682220221207111422.0080926e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068222DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08072191052doi7 aPMC25671472pmcid7 a187945262pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu, Xin12aA catechol-O-methyltransferase that is essential for auditory function in mice and humans  ap. 14609-14614.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have identified a previously unannotated catechol-O-methyltranferase (COMT), here designated COMT2, through positional cloning of a chemically induced mutation responsible for a neurobehavioral phenotype. Mice homozygous for a missense mutation in Comt2 show vestibular impairment, profound sensorineuronal deafness, and progressive degeneration of the organ of Corti. Consistent with this phenotype, COMT2 is highly expressed in sensory hair cells of the inner ear. COMT2 enzymatic activity is significantly reduced by the missense mutation, suggesting that a defect in catecholamine catabolism underlies the auditory and vestibular phenotypes. Based on the studies in mice, we have screened DNA from human families and identified a nonsense mutation in the human ortholog of the murine Comt2 gene that causes nonsyndromic deafness. Defects in catecholamine modification by COMT have been previously implicated in the development of schizophrenia. Our studies identify a previously undescribed COMT gene and indicate an unexpected role for catecholamines in the function of auditory and vestibular sense organs.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3acatechol O-methyltransferase 3acatecholamines 3adeafness 3aears 3aenzyme activity 3agenes 3ahomozygosity 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3amice 3amissense mutation 3amolecular cloning 3amutagenesis 3anonsense mutation 3aphenotype 3aschizophrenia1 aSchwander, Martin1 aMoresco, Eva Marie Y.1 aViviani, Pia1 aHaller, Claudia1 aHildebrand, Michael S.1 aPak, Kwang1 aTarantino, Lisa1 aRoberts, Amanda1 aRichardson, Heather1 aKoob, George1 aNajmabadi, Hossein1 aRyan, Allen F.1 aSmith, Richard J.H.1 aMüller, Ulrich.1 aBeutler, Bruce0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14609-14614dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08072191053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02239naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001300110245006400123300001600187500002300203500001500226520114900241650002201390650003001412650001401442650002401456650001701480650002001497650001301517650001301530650001301543650001701556651001601573651002001589651001001609653000801619653001401627653002701641700001801668773006601686852000901752939003301761946001101794655001201805IND9200538820221119164101.0920205e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920053882DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aIshi, T.10aChloroplast genome differentiation in Asian cultivated rice  ap. 818-826.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aRestriction endonuclease analysis of chloroplast DNA was carried out to clarify the chloroplast genome differentiation between Asian varieties of Oryza sativa. Based on the restriction fragment patterns obtained with six endonucleases, i.e., EcoRI, HindIII, PstI, PvuII, SmaI, and XhoI, chloroplast genomes of 68 local varieties from 15 Asian countries could be classified into five types (types 1, 3, 10, 11, and 12). Among these types, four length mutations and two base substitutions were found; these changes were located on the PstI physical map of rice chloroplast DNA. In a dendrogram showing genetic relationships among five chloroplast genomes, they are mainly divided into two groups, which we have named as the Japonica (types 1, 11, and 12) and Indica (types 3 and 10) chloroplast genome groups. Both groups are distributed widely in Asian countries. The Japonica isozyme group classified by J.C. Glaszmann (1985 Rice Genetics. International Rice Research Institute, Manila, Philippines. pp. 83-90) carries only the Japonica chloroplast genome, whereas the Indica isozyme group contains both Japonica and Indica chloroplast genomes. 3aSouthern blotting 3ageographical distribution 3acultivars 3arestriction mapping 3aOryza sativa 3achloroplast DNA 3amutation 3agenomics 3aisozymes 3achloroplasts 3aSouth Korea 3aSouth East Asia 3aIndia 0aDNA 0avarieties 0avariety classification1 aTsunewaki, K.0 tGenome =.g1991 Oct., v. 34, no. 5 p.818-826x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02071naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002500184245005800209300002000267506007600287520079400363506003701157650001401194650002401208650002301232650001101255650000801266650001401274650001001288700002501298700001801323700001701341773017701358852000901535856008301544930003301627946001301660655001201673IND4410682320221207111417.0080926e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068232DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08036521052doi7 aPMC25672152pmcid7 a187795702pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAlonso-Nanclares, L.10aGender differences in human cortical synaptic density  ap. 14615-14619.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCertain cognitive functions differ in men and women, although the anatomical and functional substrates underlying these differences remain unknown. Because neocortical activity is directly related with higher brain function, numerous studies have focused on the cerebral cortex when searching for possible structural correlates of cognitive gender differences. However, there are no studies on possible gender differences at the synaptic level. In the present work we have used stereological and correlative light and electron microscopy to show that men have a significantly higher synaptic density than women in all cortical layers of the temporal neocortex. These differences may represent a microanatomical substrate contributing to the functional gender differences in brain activity.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acognition 3aelectron microscopy 3agender differences 3ahumans 3amen 3aneocortex 3awomen1 aGonzalez-Soriano, J.1 aRodriguez Jr.1 aDeFelipe, J.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14615-14619dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08036521053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03664naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100002100179245013500200300001600335500002400351500001500375520175600390650001702146650002202163650001702185650001702202650001702219650001302236650002002249650001502269650004202284650004202326650001402368650004302382650003802425650001702463650004002480650004102520650003902561650003902600650003602639650006502675650004702740653001902787653002302806700001602829773008802845852000902933856007502942930003303017945002503050946001103075655001203086IND4382002020221119164251.0060717e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438200202DNAL7 a165246052pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF6001 aArrieta-Baez, D.10aModeling suberization with peroxidase-catalyzed polymerization of hydroxycinnamic acids: Cross-coupling and dimerization reactions  ap. 743-753.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aAn anionic potato peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.7, APP) thought to be involved in suberization after wounding was isolated from slices of Solanum tuberosum in order to elucidate the first steps of dehydrogenative polymerization between pairs of different hydroxycinnamic acids (FA, CafA, CA and SA) present in wound-healing plant tissues. Use of a commercial horseradish peroxidase (HRP) - H2O2 catalytic system gave the identical major products in these coupling reactions, providing sufficient quantities for purification and structural elucidation. Using an equimolar mixture of pairs of hydroxycinnamic acid suberin precursors, only caffeic acid is coupled to ferulic acid and sinapic acid in separate cross-coupling reactions. For the other systems, HRP and APP reacted as follows: (1) preferentially with ferulic acid in a reaction mixture that contained p-coumaric and ferulic acids; (2) with sinapic acid in a mixture of p-coumaric and sinapic acids; (3) with sinapic acid in a mixture of ferulic and sinapic acids; (4) with caffeic acid in a reaction mixture of p-coumaric and caffeic acids. The resulting products, isolated and identified by NMR and MS analysis, had predominantly β-β-γ-lactone and β-5 benzofuran molecular frameworks. Five cross-coupling products are described for the first time, whereas the β-O-4 dehydrodimers identified from the caffeic acid and sinapic acid cross-coupling reaction are known materials that are highly abundant in plants. These reactivity trends lead to testable hypotheses regarding the molecular architecture of intractable suberin protective plant materials, complementing prior analysis of monomeric constituents by GC-MS and polymer functional group identification from solid-state NMR, respectively. 3acaffeic acid 3aSolanum tuberosum 3asinapic acid 3aferulic acid 3adimerization 3apotatoes 3aenzyme activity 3aperoxidase 2aBenzofuransxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aCaffeic Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCatalysis 2aCoumaric Acidsxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCross-Linking Reagentsxchemistry 2aDimerization 2aFree Radical Scavengersxmetabolism 2aGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry 2aHorseradish Peroxidasexmetabolism 2aLactonesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aPeroxidasexchemistryxisolation & purificationxmetabolism. 2aSolanum tuberosumxenzymologyxmetabolism. 0acoumaric acids 0achemical reactions1 aStark, R.E.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Apr., v. 67, no. 7 p.743-753dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.0263electronic resource  a20061027b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03375naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100001600185245014600201300001600347500022800363500002400591520162000615650001402235650002002249650001802269650002202287650001002309650002002319650001502339650001502354650001602369650002302385650001502408650002202423653001702445700001902462700001802481700001702499700001502516700001302531700001902544773011902563852000902682856007302691930003302764945002502797946001102822655001202833IND4382004320221119164208.0060717e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438200432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0132doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL200 0aM001 0aL6001 aGomiero, A.13aAn ecotoxicoproteomic approach (SELDI-TOF mass spectrometry) to biomarker discovery in crab exposed to pollutants under laboratory conditions  ap.

This approach was used to evaluate the protein profile of crabs exposed to various pollutants. Two different exposure experiments were performed: spider crabs (Hyas araneus) were exposed for 3 weeks to diallyl phatalate (DAP), bisphenol A (BisA) and polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE-47), while shore crabs (Carcinus maeanas) were exposed to crude oil, crude oil spiked with alkylphenols (APs) and 4-nonylphenol (NP). Gender and species-related protein pattern alterations were observed and compared to controls. Results showed different responses to pollutants by the two species. Major disruption in protein peak expression was observed in samples exposed to mixtures of pollutants, i.e. oil spiked with APs. Compared to shore crab, spider crab species showed a lower degree of response in terms of number of altered protein peaks following exposure. In general, female individuals of both species showed a larger number of significantly altered proteins compared to males. Data analysis by non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) was performed. Bi-dimesional-MDS plots revealed a good separation of groups for both spider and shore crabs. In some cases, a good discrimination can also be observed between the two genders within each treatment. Results highlight the potential of crabs as sentinel organisms for the aquatic environment. The results indicate that SELDI-ToF technology is a powerful tool to discover protein expression signatures for different pollutants and sex dependent responses. 3apetroleum 3awater pollution 3aecotoxicology 3amass spectrometry 3acrabs 3aCarcinus maenas 3abiomarkers 3apollutants 3axenobiotics 3aphenolic compounds 3aproteomics 3aprotein synthesis 0aHyas araneus1 aPampanin, D.M.1 aBjornstad, A.1 aLarsen, B.K.1 aProvan, F.1 aLyng, E.1 aAndersen, O.K.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 June 1, v. 78, no. 1 p.S34-S41dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0133electronic resource  a20070108b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/04  aNon-US 7aarticle02462naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245006600145300001600211500002300227500001500250520110400265650004501369650001701414650003001431650001301461650002201474650002701496650003101523650002001554650002301574650002101597650003001618650003201648650002301680650003001703650004601733653002201779653001101801653003701812653002401849773006601873852000901939939003301948946001101981655001201992IND9200537420221119164100.0920204e199110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920053742DNAL7 a16833282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGillet, E.M.10aGenetic analysis of nuclear DNA restriction fragment patterns  ap. 693-703.  aSummary in French.  a2019-12-04  aRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in the broad sense is the analysis of differences in restriction fragment pattern produced by defined target segments within or between cell compartments, cell types, etc., in a single individual or in different individuals. Thus both molecular hybridization and DNA amplification by two-primer extension using the polymerase chain reaction can define target segments for RFLP analysis. The two techniques are outlined with special consideration of characteristics important for genetic analysis. The mode of inheritance of restriction fragment patterns as a prerequisite for their use as genetic markers in inheritance studies is explained, leading to criticism of common usage. The importance of internal restriction sites for the determination of allelic variation is stressed. It is shown that, if target segments are under the control of a single nuclear diploid restriction fragment locus, then complete reconstruction of all parental target segments requires controlled crosses between individuals of like restriction fragment pattern. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aforest trees 3apolymerase chain reaction 3acrossing 3agenetic variation 3ainheritance (genetics) 3anucleic acid hybridization 3agenetic markers 2aBlotting, Southern 2aCrosses, Genetic 2aGenetic Markersxgenetics 2aGenetic Variationxgenetics 2aMutationxgenetics 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aPolymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length 0aallelic variation 0aplants 0agenetic techniques and protocols 0acontrolled crossing0 tGenome =.g1991 Oct., v. 34, no. 5 p.693-703x0831-27967nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03035naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001500188245015200203300001600355500002400371520118200395650002201577650001701599650001901616650001701635650001301652650001501665650002101680650002001701650001901721650001601740650003101756650004001787650004801827650002101875650004001896650002101936650002101957650004201978650004402020650003302064650001702097650001302114653001402127700001402141700002002155700001702175773008802192852000902280856007502289930003302364945002502397946001102422655001202433IND4382000720221119164634.0060717e200604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438200072DNAL7 a165199112pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF3001 aTasgin, E.10aEffects of salicylic acid and cold treatments on protein levels and on the activities of antioxidant enzymes in the apoplast of winter wheat leaves  ap. 710-715.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of salicylic acid (SA) and cold on apoplastic protein levels and activities of apoplastic catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were investigated in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Dogu-88) leaves. The plants were grown with and without 10 μM SA treatment at both control (20/18 °C for 30 and 45-day) and cold (10/5 °C for 30-day and 5/3 °C for 45-day) acclimatisations. Molecular masses of the apoplastic polypeptides were shown ranging in size from 20 to 66 kDa on SDS-PAGE. Accumulation and pattern of the polypeptides were changed by both SA and cold. It is observed that CAT, POX and PPO activities at 45-day control leaves were higher than at 30-day. When the activities with SA and cold treatments are compared to their controls, CAT activities were decreased while POX and PPO activities were increased by both the treatments. When the activities with cold + SA treatment are compared to their cold treatments, CAT and POX activities were decreased while PPO activity was increased by SA. It is concluded that exogenous SA can be involved in cold tolerance by regulating apoplastic proteins and antioxidant enzyme activities. 3aTriticum aestivum 3awinter wheat 3aplant proteins 3aantioxidants 3acatalase 3aperoxidase 3acatechol oxidase 3aenzyme activity 3asalicylic acid 3acold stress 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aCatalasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCatechol Oxidasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aCold Temperature 2aElectrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel 2aMolecular Weight 2aOxidative Stress 2aPeroxidasexdrug effectsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxdrug effectsxenzymology. 2aSalicylic Acidxpharmacology 2aTime Factors 2aTriticum 0aapoplasts1 aAtici, O.1 aNalbantoglu, B.1 aPopova, L.P.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Apr., v. 67, no. 7 p.710-715dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.0223electronic resource  a20061027b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle01714naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245013800163300001600301500002400317520062200341650001800963650001600981650001300997650002601010650001701036700002001053700002101073700002101094700002001115700002001135773012701155852000901282856008501291655001201376IND4443194320221119164558.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444319432DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925100300532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarsky, E.

Among all the compounds, riligustilide, displayed weak progesterone-like activity (EC50 approximately 81 μM), whereas, (3Z')-(3a'R,6'R,3R,6R,7R)-3,8-dihydro-6.6',7.3a'-diligustilide (Mr: 382, EC50 approximately 90 nM), was found to be a potent and specific activator of the progesterone receptor. Levistolide A, although having a very similar plenary structure, was inactive indicating the importance of stereochemistry of chiral centers and flexibility of butylidene side chain for progestogenic activity. These bioactive phthalides and their parent extracts (EC50 approximately 8 μg/ml) may have utility for treatment of conditions requiring progesterone action. 3aphytochemicals 3ahormone receptors 3amedicinal plants 3aprogesterone 3aphthalides 3aLigusticum 3aspectral analysis 3achemical structure 2aBiological Assay 2aDimerization 2aDrugs, Chinese Herbal 2aGenes, Reporter 2aLigusticumxchemistry 2aMagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy 2aPhthalic Anhydridesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Extractsxchemistry 2aProgestinsxchemistryxisolation & purificationxpharmacology. 2aReceptors, Progesteronexmetabolism 2aRhizomexchemistry 2aStereoisomerism 0aLigusticum chuaxiong 0aprogestational hormones 0aApiaceae1 aGong, Y.H.1 aYong, E.L.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Apr., v. 67, no. 7 p.728-734dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2006.01.0243electronic resource  a20061027b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle03173naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245010400124300001600228520215800244650001702402650002302419650001202442650001002454650002302464650002102487650002302508650002502531650001702556650001602573650002702589700001402616700001602630773008502646852000902731930003302740945001302773946001302786655001202799IND2321455320221119164342.0010611e200003  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232145532DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmura, H.10aFloral scent of Osmanthus fragrans discourages foraging behavior of cabbage butterfly, Pieris rapae  ap. 655-666.  aField observations revealed that flowers of Osmanthus fragrans attract few insect species despite their strong scent and vivid coloration (yellowish orange). Floral volatiles of the plant were thus examined for suspected repellency to Pieris rapae, a potential visitor that never visits this flower. The influence of odor components on the foraging behavior of adult butterflies was assessed by two behavioral bioassays: proboscis extension reflex (PER) in response to olfactory stimuli and the frequency of visits to artificial flowers. In the PER bioassays, a binary mixture composed of a test material and 2-phenylethanol (a positive standard compound) was used, and the negative effect of test materials was appraised based on the degree of suppression caused compared with the original PER performance evoked by 2-phenylethanol alone. Isopentane extract of the flower exhibited significant deterrency in the PER test and remarkable repellency in the flower-visiting experiment, thereby suggesting the presence of a repellent(s) in the floral volatiles. Fractionation of the extract by silica gel column chromatography yielded an active fraction (based on PER performance), which, upon GC and GC-MS analyses, was found to consist of gamma-decalactone, beta-ionone, and linalool oxide (LO) isomers (furanosides and pyranosides) as major components together with small amounts of linalool and alpha-ionone. Gamma-Decalactone was strongly deterrent in the PER test, and beta-ionone and all LO isomers were weakly deterrent, while the other compounds exhibited no deterrency. In the flower-visiting tests, gamma-decalactone showed notable repellency, whereas beta-ionone had no repellent effect. Among the LO isomers, at least furanosides (cis/trans mixture) and cis-pyranoside were found to be weakly repellent. On the other hand, the butterfly showed strong to weak EAG responses to LO furanosides, cis-LO pyranoside, gamma-decalactone, and beta-ionone in decreasing order of intensity. The present results clearly indicate that the repellency of a compound is correlated with its deterrent effect on PER but not necessarily with antennal sensitivity. 3aPieris rapae 3aOsmanthus fragrans 3aflowers 3aodors 3ainsect attractants 3afeeding behavior 3avolatile compounds 3achemical composition 3aantifeedants 3ahost plants 3aplant-insect relations1 aHonda, K.1 aHayashi, N.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2000 Mar., v. 26, no. 3 p.655-666x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle01302naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245009400166300001600260500002400276500001500300520027700315650001000592650001200602650001600614650002200630650001200652653001600664700002100680700002300701700001900724773012700743852000900870856008500879655001200964IND4443194520221119164248.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444319452DNAL7 a10.3103/S00963925100300772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarsukova, T.

We compared the effects of 1,4- and 1,8-cineole on two weedy plant species by monitoring germination, mitosis, root and shoot growth, chlorophyll content, and photosynthetic efficiency. 1,4-Cineole severely inhibited growth of roots and shoots, causing cork-screw shaped morphological distortion, whereas 1,8-cineole caused a decrease in root growth and germination rates. Chlorophyll fluorescence data (yield and F(v)/F(m)) indicated that 1,4-cineole caused significantly higher stress (P less than or equal to 0.001) to photosynthesis when compared to controls. Mitotic index data showed that 1,8-cineole severely decreased (P less than or equal to 0.001) all stages of mitosis when compared with controls, while 1,4-cineole only caused a decrease in the prophase stage (P less than or equal to 0.05).

This revealed considerable differences between the sexes and between populations and differences in the pattern of sexual dimorphism between populations. The presence of sexual dimorphism and the extent of differences between populations suggests that divergence has been driven by sexual selection acting through a contact pheromone on the cuticle. However, those lipids that differ most between the sexes are not the same as those that vary the most between populations, suggesting that sexual selection alone is not responsible for driving divergence in cuticular composition. We also examined differences in cuticular composition with adult age, revealing that the proportion of all but one of the 14 lipid classes we identified changes significantly with age in at least one population. Overall the pattern of variation with age is fairly consistent across populations, with the proportion of shorter-chain compounds increasing with age. 3aChorthippus parallelus 3achemical composition 3ahydrocarbons 3agender differences 3aEurope 0aage differences 0avariation 0acuticle 0aculticular hydrocarbons1 aBuckley, S.H.1 aPritchard, V.L.1 aButlin, R.K.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2000 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.257-278x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle04127naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001700188245013700205300001600342500002400358500001500382520169700397650004502094650001802139650001902157650001102176650003002187650002202217650004302239650001702282650002502299650001902324650001802343650001802361650004102379650004002420650004702460650003702507650002602544650002202570650002802592650002802620650003902648650004402687650003302731650002602764650002702790653001402817653002802831653001502859653002102874653002802895653002802923700001602951700001402967700001402981700001702995700001503012700002003027700001803047700002203065700001703087773008803104852000903192856007503201930003303276945002503309946001103334655001203345IND4381990120140723000000.0060717e200602  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199012DNAL7 a164266512pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.12.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF7001 aBertea, C.M.10aPCR and PCR-RFLP of the 5S-rRNA-NTS region and salvinorin A analyses for the rapid and unequivocal determination of Salvia divinorum  ap. 371-378.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aSalvia divinorum Epling & Játiva-M. is a perennial herb belonging to the Lamiaceae family; its active ingredient, the neoclerodane diterpene salvinorin A, is a psychotropic molecule that produces hallucinations. A comparative evaluation of S. divinorum fresh and dried leaves, S. officinalis fresh leaves, and dried powdered leaves claimed to be S. divinorum was done. HPLC-MS data confirmed the presence of salvinorin A in both S. divinorun leaf extracts and the powdered leaves, whereas no salvinorin A was found in S. officinalis. The non-transcribed spacer (NTS) in the 5S-rRNA gene of all leaf samples and the dried powdered leaves was amplified by PCR using a pair of primers located at the 3' and 5' ends of the coding sequence of 5S-rRNA gene. The resulting PCR products (about 500 bp for S. divinorum and 300 bp for S. officinalis) were gel purified, subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector and sequenced. By aligning the isolated nucleotide sequences, great diversities were found in the spacer region of the two species. Specific S. divinorum primers were designed on the sequence of the 5S-rRNA gene spacer region. In addition, a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method was applied using NdeI and TaqI restriction enzymes. An NdeI site, absent in S. officinalis, was found in S. divinorum NTS region at 428-433 bp. For TaqI, multiple sites (161-164, 170-173, and 217-220 bp) were found in S. officinalis, whereas a unique site was found in S. divinorum (235-238 bp). The results of this work show that the combined use of analytical chemical (HPLC-MS) and molecular (DNA fingerprinting) methods lead to the precise and unequivocal identification of S. divinorum. 3arestriction fragment length polymorphism 3aribosomal RNA 3aphytochemicals 3aSalvia 3apolymerase chain reaction 3achemical analysis 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3aditerpenoids 3anucleotide sequences 3aplant taxonomy 3achemotaxonomy 2aBase Sequence 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDNA Restriction Enzymesxmetabolism 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxanalysisxgenetics. 2aDiterpenesxanalysisxchemistry. 2aDiterpenes, Clerodane 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aPolymerase Chain Reactionxmethods 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5Sxanalysisxgenetics. 2aSalviaxchemistryxgenetics. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTranscription, Genetic 0aLamiaceae 0amolecular sequence data 0asalvinorin 0aSalvia divinorum 0aneoclerodane diterpenes 0anon-transcribed spacers1 aLuciano, P.1 aBossi, S.1 aLeoni, F.1 aBaiocchi, C.1 aMedana, C.1 aAzzolin, C.M.M.1 aTemporale, G.1 aLombardozzi, M.A.1 aMaffei, M.E.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Feb., v. 67, no. 4 p.371-378dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.12.0063electronic resource  a20061011b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/11  aNon-US 7aarticle02403naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002400184245009400208300002000302506007600322520100600398506003701404650003101441650001301472650001501485650002301500650001801523650001101541650001301552700001501565700002201580700001801602700001801620700002801638773017701666852000901843856008301852930003301935946001301968655001201981IND4410680720221207104630.0080926e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068072DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08074491052doi7 aPMC25336802pmcid7 a187871202pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMacLeod, Megan K.L.10aCD4 memory T cells divide poorly in response to antigen because of their cytokine profile  ap. 14521-14526.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImmunological memory is a hallmark of adaptive immunity, and understanding T cell memory will be central to the development of effective cell-mediated vaccines. The characteristics and functions of CD4 memory cells have not been well defined. Here we demonstrate that the increased size of the secondary response is solely a consequence of the increased antigen-specific precursor frequency within the memory pool. Memory cells proliferated less than primary responding cells, even within the same host. By analyzing the entry of primary and memory cells into the cell cycle, we found that the two populations proliferated similarly until day 5; after this time, fewer of the reactivated memory cells proliferated. At this time, fewer of the reactivated memory cells made IL-2 than primary responding cells, but more made IFNγ. Both these factors affected the low proliferation of the memory cells, because either exogenous IL-2 or inhibition of IFNγ increased the proliferation of the memory cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aantigens 3acell cycle 3aimmunologic memory 3ainterleukin-2 3amemory 3avaccines1 aMcKee, Amy1 aCrawford, Frances1 aWhite, Janice1 aKappler, John1 aMarrack, P.q(Philippa)0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14521-14526dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08074491053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03634naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180100001800189245012200207300001600329500002400345500001500369520186700384650002202251650001102273650001802284650002402302650001102326650002502337650000902362650002002371650000902391650001502400650001902415650003202434650001202466650003402478650002402512650001102536650000902547650002002556650002302576650003302599651001002632651001002642653001002652653002102662700001702683700001502700700001502715773012402730852000902854856007602863930003302939945002502972946001102997655001203008IND4381976520140723000000.0060716e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438197652DNAL7 a168820912pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2006.00598.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL1001 aGicheha, M.G.10aEvaluation of the efficiency of alternative two-tier nucleus breeding systems designed to improve meat sheep in Kenya  ap. 247-257.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA deterministic approach was used to genetically and economically evaluate the efficiency of five two-tier nucleus breeding systems for meat sheep in Kenya. The nucleus breeding systems differed in terms of whether the system was closed or open, in the type of animals that were involved in the movement of genetic superiority and in the number of selection pathways in each system. These systems were compared under four alternative breeding objectives based on monetary genetic gain and profit per ewe. The first objective simulated a situation where the flock size cannot be increased due to non-feed related constraints (FLOCK). The second specifically assumed that the flock size is restricted due to limited amount of feed resources (FEED). The third and fourth objectives assumed that sheep performed only tangible roles (TR) and both tangible and intangible roles (IR) in the production system respectively. Monetary genetic gains were highest for all objectives in an open nucleus system with a certain proportion of commercial-born ewes being introduced in the nucleus while at the same time utilizing young rams from the nucleus to breed sires and dams for the nucleus and commercial sector (ONyre). Utilizing young rams in a closed nucleus system for the dissemination of superior genes resulted in higher annual monetary genetic gain than utilization of old rams. Profit per ewe was significantly higher for FLOCK and IR in ONyre. In a closed system that allowed for downward movement of dams from the nucleus to the commercial sector to breed sires and dams, profit per ewe was highest for FEED and TR. The success of a nucleus breeding system should also focus on the profitability and logistics of establishing it. The implication of these results on the choice of two-tier nucleus breeding systems for the improvement of meat sheep is discussed. 3asimulation models 3amutton 3aprofitability 3agenetic improvement 3aflocks 3aartificial selection 3aewes 3aanimal breeding 3arams 3aanimal age 3abreeding value 2aAnimal Husbandryxeconomics 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aComputer Simulation 2aFemale 2aMale 2aMeatxstandards 2aSelection, Genetic 2aSheepxgeneticsxphysiology. 3aKenya 0aKenya 0asheep 0abreeding methods1 aKosgey, I.S.1 aBebe, B.O.1 aKahi, A.K.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2006 Aug., v. 123, no. 4 p.247-257dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2006.00598.x3electronic resource  a20061018b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02383naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245015300183300001600336520087800352650002701230650001301257650001401270650004701284650001401331650002601345650001101371650005401382650004001436650004701476650001501523650001701538653001801555700002201573700002601595700002301621700002101644773013401665852000901799856008501808930003301893946001101926655001201937IND4415108820221119164238.0090120e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441510882DNAL7 a182835492pmid7 a10.1007/s10661-008-0205-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeybek, Zuhal 10aProfiling of environmental Legionella pneumophila strains by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA method isolated from geographically nearby buildings  ap. 323-327.  aLegionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) which is also known as etiologic agent Legionnaires Disease lives in natural water and man made water systems.

Three of these strains were isolated from buildings located in a short distance. 3aLegionella pneumophila 3abacteria 3abuildings 3arandom amplified polymorphic DNA technique 3aserotypes 2aArchitecture as Topic 2aHumans 2aLegionella pneumophilaxclassificationxgenetics. 2aLegionnaires' Diseasexmicrobiology 2aRandom Amplified Polymorphic DNA Technique 2aSerotyping 2aWater Supply 0aRAPD analysis1 aTüretgen, Irfan 1 aKimiran Erdem, Ayten 1 aFiloğlu, Gönül 1 aÇotuk, Ayşın 0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2009 Feb., v. 149, no. 1-4 p.323-327dDordrecht : Springer Netherlandsx0167-63697nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0205-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090120b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03514naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153072000900171072000900180072000900189100002100198245011800219300001600337500002400353500001500377520175500392650001302147650002402160650002402184650001502208650002602223650001302249650001702262650001502279650001902294650002302313650002202336650001202358650003402370650001102404650002102415650003402436650002002470650000902490650001702499651001202516653002702528653002502555700001402580700001502594700001302609773012402622852000902746856007602755930003302831945002502864946001102889655001202900IND4381976420140723000000.0060716e200608  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438197642DNAL7 a168820902pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0388.2006.00596.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL200 0aL100 0aX1001 aBugislaus, A.-E.14aThe use of a random regression model to account for change in racing speed of German trotters with increasing age  ap. 239-246.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aIn a genetic analysis of German trotters, the performance trait racing time per km was analysed by using a random regression model on six different age classes (2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-year-old and older trotters; the age class of 3-year-old trotters was additionally divided by birth months of horses into two seasons). The best-fitting random regression model for the trait racing time per km on six age classes included as fixed effects sex, race track, condition of race track (fitted as second-order polynomial on age), distance of race and each driver (fitted as first-order polynomial on age) as well as the year-season (fitted independent of age). The random additive genetic and permanent environmental effects were fitted as second-order polynomials on age. Data consisted of 138 620 performance observations from 2373 trotters and the pedigree data contained 9952 horses from a four-generation pedigree. Heritabilities for racing time per km increased from 0.01 to 0.18 at age classes from 2- to 4-year-old trotters, then slightly decreased for 5 year and substantially decreased for 6-year-old horses. Genetic correlations of racing time per km among the six age classes were very high (rg = 0.82-0.99). Heritability was h² = 0.13 when using a repeatability animal model for racing time per km considering the six age classes as fixed effect. Breeding values using repeatability analysis over all and within age classes resulted in slightly different ranking of trotters than those using random regression analysis. When using random regression analysis almost no reranking of trotters over time took place. Generally, the analyses showed that using a random regression model improved the accuracy of selection of trotters over age classes. 3apedigree 3agenetic correlation 3aregression analysis 3aracehorses 3aadditive gene effects 3avelocity 3aheritability 3aanimal age 3abreeding value 3aracing performance 2aAgingxphysiology 2aAnimals 2aBreedingxeconomicsxmethods. 2aFemale 2aGaitxphysiology 2aHorsesxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aLogistic Models 2aMale 2aTime Factors 3aGermany 0arepeatability analysis 0astatistical analysis1 aRoehe, R.1 aWillms, F.1 aKalm, E.0 tJournal of animal breeding and genetics.g2006 Aug., v. 123, no. 4 p.239-246dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-26687nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0388.2006.00596.x3electronic resource  a20061018b20061102c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/28  aNon-US 7aarticle02817naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001500152245013600167300001600303500002800319520150500347650002701852650001901879650002001898650001401918653001901932653001501951700002101966700001801987700001602005700002202021700001602043700001702059700002402076700002602100700001502126700001902141773012302160852000902283856009202292946001102384655001202395IND4415871420221119164332.0090206s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441587142DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01472.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aManos, Jim10aGene expression characteristics of a cystic fibrosis epidemic strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa during biofilm and planktonic growth  ap. 107-114.  aPublisher supplied data  aEpidemic Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been identified in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients worldwide. The Australian Epidemic Strain-2 (AES-2) infects up to 40% of patients in three eastern Australian CF clinics. To investigate whether AES-2 isolates from chronically infected CF adults differentially express well-conserved genes potentially associated with transmissibility, we compared the transcriptomes of planktonic and biofilm-grown AES-2, infrequent P. aeruginosa clones and the reference P. aeruginosa PAO1 using the Affymetrix PAO1 array. The most interesting findings emerged from comparisons of planktonic and biofilm AES-2. AES-2 biofilms upregulated Type III secretion system genes, but downregulated quorum-sensing (QS)-regulatory genes, except lasR, QS-regulated, oxidative-stress and iron-storage genes. QS-regulated and iron-storage genes were downregulated to a greater extent in AES-2 biofilms compared with infrequent clone and PAO1 biofilms, suggesting enhanced anaerobic respiration in AES-2. Chitinase and chitin-binding protein maintained high expression in AES-2 biofilms compared with infrequent clone and PAO1 biofilms. Planktonic AES-2 upregulated QS regulators and QS-regulated genes, iron acquisition and aerobic respiration genes, and had high expression of Group III Type IV pilA compared with low expression of Group I Type IV pilA in infrequent clones. Together, these properties may enhance long-term survival of AES-2 in CF lung and contribute to its transmissibility. 3aPseudomonas aeruginosa 3aquorum sensing 3acystic fibrosis 3ainfection 0aepidemic clone 0amicroarray1 aArthur, Jonathan1 aRose, Barbara1 aBell, Scott1 aTingpej, Pholawat1 aHu, Honghua1 aWebb, Jeremy1 aKjelleberg, Staffan1 aGorrell, Mark Douglas1 aBye, Peter1 aHarbour, Colin0 tFEMS microbiology letters.g2009 Mar., v. 292, no. 1 p.107-114dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0378-10977nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2008.01472.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle02247naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245014200125300001600267520129800283650002101581650002401602650001001626650001701636650002101653650001401674650001901688651001601707700001901723700001401742773008501756852000901841930003301850945001301883946001301896655001201909IND2321364520221119164225.0010606e200001  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232136452DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aViette, M.10aPreference for acyanogenic white clover (Trifolium repens) in the vole Arvicola terrestris. II. Generalization and further investigations  ap. 101-122.  aTwo series of cafeteria tests involving six varieties of Trifolium repens were conducted to confirm the preference of fossorial Arvicola terrestris for acyanogenic white clover (T. repens) and to investigate their responses to repeated exposures to toxic plants. The animals were offered the choice between two bunches of freshly harvested white clover. In 261 simple choice tests, 160 individuals were tested for various combinations of three acyanogenic and three cyanogenic varieties. They showed a clear preference for the acyanogenic morphs, both in comparisons between opposite cyanotypes and in two control situations involving either self-comparisons or comparisons between similar cyanotypes. In 320 repeated choice tests, 40 voles assigned to three groups (comparisons between opposite cyanotypes and control comparisons between similar cyanotypes) were tested eight times for the same alternative. They showed a persistent preference for the acyanogenic morph and significantly reduced their total food consumption when they had a strictly cyanogenic diet. In the latter case, they stored or wasted more plant material than in the other treatments. These voles also ingested high amounts of cyanide which suggests good detoxification abilities and a possible habituation to cyanide. 3aTrifolium repens 3afeeding preferences 3avoles 3acyanogenesis 3ahydrogen cyanide 3acultivars 3arodent control 3aSwitzerland1 aTettamanti, C.1 aSaucy, F.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g2000 Jan., v. 26, no. 1 p.101-122x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20010801b20010808c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02361naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100001700197245007000214300001600284500002400300500001500324520044100339650002600780650001000806650001900816650001400835650002100849650001700870650001700887650002200904650002500926650002300951650001200974650003200986650006001018650003201078650004001110650002101150650004801171650002901219651001301248653002301261653002601284653002201310653001801332700001601350700001901366700001801385700002001403700001501423700002001438773008801458852000901546856007501555930003301630945002501663946001101688655001201699IND4381993220221119164449.0060717e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199322DNAL7 a163214102pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.10.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL823 0aX3801 aKenmogne, M.10aFive labdane diterpenoids from the seeds of Aframomum zambesiacum  ap. 433-438.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFive labdane diterpenoids, (3-5), zambesiacolactone A (7) and zambesiacolactone B (8), were isolated from the seeds of Aframomum zambesiacum (Baker) K.

Recent studies have shown relationships between H. pylori and extra-digestive diseases, and the presence of H. pylori in the middle ear and upper respiratory tract has been reported. However, the role of H. pylori in middle ear disease remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that H. pylori whole-cell protein directly induces macrophage migration inhibitory factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 2, interleukin 1β and tumor necrosis factor α in middle ear epithelium in mice, and severe proliferation of inflammatory cells was observed in middle ear cavity inoculated with H. pylori whole-cell protein. In addition, trans-tympanic injection of macrophage migration inhibitory factor up-regulated expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 in the middle ear. These findings indicate that H. pylori infection causes immunological inflammation in middle ear epithelium, and H. pylori may play a significant role in otitis media. 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aotitis media 2aAnimals 2aAntigens, Bacterialximmunology 2aBiomarkersxanalysis. 2aChemokine CXCL2xanalysis 2aEar, Middle 2aHelicobacter Infectionsximmunology 2aHelicobacter pyloriximmunology 2aInterleukin-10xanalysis 2aInterleukin-1betaxanalysis 2aMacrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factorsxanalysisximmunology. 2aMale 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aModels, Animal 2aOtitis Mediaximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aTransforming Growth Factor betaxanalysis 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxanalysis 0acytokine 0amacrophage inflammatory protein 2 0amacrophage migration inhibitory factor1 aOkano, M.1 aFukushima, K.1 aNomiya, S.1 aKataoka, Y.1 aNomiya, R.1 aAkagi, H.1 aNishizaki, K.0 tClinical and experimental immunology.g2008 Oct., v. 154, no. 1 p.134-140dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0009-91047nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2249.2008.03740.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080912b20081011c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03865naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245013600197300001800333500002400351506007600375520166200451506003702113650002302150650002002173650002502193650001302218650001202231650001702243650001802260650003602278650001302314650001502327650001702342650001302359650001402372650000902386650001702395650003202412650001002444650004402454650003502498650002502533650006702558650003802625650001102663650006302674650001102737650003402748650002502782650000902807650001602816650002402832650003902856700002802895700002102923700002102944700002302965773010502988852000903093856007703102655001203179IND4443161320221207100802.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444316132DNAL7 a206640162pmid7 aPMC29451672pmcid7 a10.2337/dc10-06332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Todd T.10aAssociation Between Systemic Inflammation and Incident Diabetes in HIV-Infected Patients After Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy  ap. 2244-2249.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: To determine whether systemic inflammation after initiation of HIV-antiretroviral therapy (ART) is associated with the development of diabetes.

Stored plasma samples at treatment initiation (week 0) and 1 year later (week 48) were assayed for levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the soluble receptors of tumor necrosis factor-α (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2). RESULTS: Case subjects were older than control subjects (median age 41 vs. 37 years, P = 0.001), but the groups were otherwise comparable. Median levels for all markers, except hs-CRP, decreased from week 0 to week 48. Subjects with higher levels of hs-CRP, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 at 48 weeks had an increased odds of subsequent diabetes, after adjustment for baseline marker level, age, BMI at week 48, CD4 count at week 48 (< vs. >200 cells/mm³), and indinavir use (all Ptrend [less-than or equal to] 0.05). After further adjustment for week 48 glucose, effects were attenuated and only sTNFR1 remained significant (odds ratio, highest quartile vs. lowest 23.2 [95% CI 1.28-423], P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Inflammatory markers 48 weeks after ART initiation were associated with increased risk of diabetes. These findings suggest that systemic inflammation may contribute to diabetes pathogenesis among HIV-infected patients.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aC-reactive protein 3abody mass index 3acase-control studies 3adiabetes 3aglucose 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-6 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3anecrosis 3aodds ratio 3apathogenesis 3apatients 3areceptors 3arisk 3atherapeutics 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 2aAdult 2aAnti-Retroviral Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aC-Reactive Proteinxmetabolism 2aCase-Control Studies 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xepidemiologyxetiologyximmunology. 2aEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay 2aFemale 2aHIV Infectionsxcomplicationsxdrug therapyxepidemiology. 2aHumans 2aInflammationxphysiopathology 2aInterleukin-6xblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aProspective Studies 2aTumor Necrosis Factor-alphaxblood1 aTassiopoulos, Katherine1 aBosch, Ronald J.1 aShikuma, Cecilia1 aMcComsey, Grace A.0 tDiabetes care.g2010 Oct., v. 33, no. 10 p.2244-2249dAmerican Diabetes Associationx0149-59927nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2337/dc10-06333Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03477naa a2200601 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179100001500188245012900203300001600332500002400348500001500372520161500387650001802002650002202020650002102042650001602063650001002079650001102089650001402100650002202114650002402136650005102160650005202211650002902263650006602292650003702358651001002395653003002405653002302435653001502458653002502473653002502498653002402523700001402547700001402561700001702575700001602592700001402608773008802622852000902710856007502719930003302794945002502827946001102852655001202863IND4381991320221119164458.0060717e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199132DNAL7 a164276682pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.12.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF600 0aF1001 aJordan, M.10aIn vitro shoot and root organogenesis, plant regeneration and production of tropane alkaloids in some species of Schizanthus  ap. 570-578.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA rapid in vitro propagation system leading to formation of shoots from callus, roots, and plantlets was developed for Schizanthus hookeri Gill. (Solanaceae), an endemic Chilean plant. The genus Schizanthus is of particular interest due to the presence of several tropane alkaloids. So far, in vitro propagation of species of this genus has not been reported. Propagation of S. hookeri consisted of two phases, the first one for callus initiation and shoot formation and the second for rhizogenesis and plantlet regeneration. From a single callus that rapidly increased in cell biomass (from approximately 50 mg to approximately 460 mg/culture tube [25 x 130 mm] in 60 days) in the presence of 2.69 μM NAA and 2.22 μM BA, more than 10 shoots/callus explant were formed. From the latter, approx. twenty plantlets formed after 90-110 days shoot subculture in medium devoid of growth regulators that favored root formation. Ten alkaloids ranging from simple pyrrolidine derivatives to tropane esters derived from angelic, tiglic, senecioic or methylmesaconic acids were obtained from in vitro regenerated plantlets. One of them, 3α-methylmesaconyloxytropane, was not previously described. The same growth conditions, as well as other growth regulator levels tested, were required to induce callus and root formation in S. grahamii Gill. Root organogenesis occurred despite a high level of BA vs. NAA used, (i.e., 4.44 μM BA and 0.54 μM NAA); however no shoot formation was achieved. In the case of S. tricolor Grau et Gronbach, only callus formation was obtained in the presence of various growth regulators. 3aorganogenesis 3atropane alkaloids 3amicropropagation 3aSchizanthus 3aroots 3ashoots 2aIsomerism 2aMass Spectrometry 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Rootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aPlant Shootsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aRegenerationxphysiology 2aSolanaceaexclassificationxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aTropanesxchemistryxmetabolism. 3aChile 0amethylmesaconyloxytropane 0aplant regeneration 0aSolanaceae 0aSchizanthus grahamii 0aSchizanthus tricolor 0aSchizanthus hookeri1 aHumam, M.1 aBieri, S.1 aChristen, P.1 aPoblete, E.1 aMunoz, O.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Mar., v. 67, no. 6 p.570-578dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.12.0073electronic resource  a20061027b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02977naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001600145245008400161300001600245500002400261520170400285650001201989650001402001650002002015650002302035650001602058650001702074650000902091650001602100650001802116650002502134650003002159650001902189650002802208650001402236650001702250651001802267700002202285700002102307700001802328700001702346773009902363852000902462856004802471655001202519IND4424972620221119164300.0090821e200909  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442497262DNAL7 a10.1007/s11032-009-9279-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yihua10aGenetic characterization of powdery mildew resistance in U.S. hard winter wheat  ap. 141-152.  aIncludes references  aPowdery mildew significantly affects grain yield and end-use quality of winter wheat in the southern Great Plains. Employing resistance resources in locally adapted cultivars is the most effective means to control powdery mildew. Two types of powdery mildew resistance exist in wheat cultivars, i.e., qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative resistance is controlled by major genes, is race-specific, is not durable, and is effective in seedlings and in adult plants. Quantitative resistance is controlled by minor genes, is non-race-specific, is durable, and is predominantly effective in adult plants. In this study, we found that the segregation of powdery mildew resistance in a population of recombinant inbred lines developed from a cross between the susceptible cultivar Jagger and the resistant cultivar 2174 was controlled by a major QTL on the short arm of chromosome 1A and modified by four minor QTLs on chromosomes 1B, 3B, 4A, and 6D. The major QTL was mapped to the genomic region where the Pm3 gene resides. Using specific PCR markers for seven Pm3 alleles, 2174 was found to carry the Pm3a allele. Pm3a explained 61% of the total phenotypic variation in disease reaction observed among seedlings inoculated in the greenhouse and adult plants grown in the field and subjected to natural disease pressure. The resistant Pm3a allele was present among 4 of 31 cultivars currently being produced in the southern Great Plains. The genetic effects of several minor loci varied with different developmental stages and environments. Molecular markers associated with these genetic loci would facilitate incorporating genetic resistance to powdery mildew into improved winter wheat cultivars. 3aalleles 3acultivars 3agenetic markers 3agenetic resistance 3agrain yield 3ainbred lines 3aloci 3amajor genes 3amature plants 3aphenotypic variation 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apowdery mildew 3aquantitative trait loci 3aseedlings 3awinter wheat 3aUnited States1 aHunger, Robert M.1 aCarver, Brett F.1 aZhang, Hailin1 aYan, Liuling0 tMolecular breeding.g2009 Sept., v. 24, no. 2 p.141-152dSpringer Netherlandsx1380-37437nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11032-009-9279-6 7aarticle04658naa a2200769 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170072000900179072000900188100002000197245016400217300001600381500002400397500001500421520231500436650002202751650002302773650002402796650001602820650001602836650001102852650002102863650002002884650001802904650001702922650001502939650001702954650000902971650001302980650002602993650001203019650003003031650002703061650002403088650002703112650003703139650005003176650004203226650000903268650001903277650002403296650004503320650002703365650003303392650000903425650001703434650003103451650004903482651001703531653002503548653001903573653001303592700001703605700001303622773008803635852000903723856007503732930003303807945002503840946001103865655001203876IND4381992320221119164502.0060717e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199232DNAL7 a164340722pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.11.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS200 0aL600 0aX3801 aOjewole, J.A.O.10aVasodilatory and hypoglycaemic effects of two pyrano-isoflavone extractives from Eriosema kraussianum N.

E. Br. (Fabaceae) and other Eriosema species (Zulu indigenous umbrella name of "uBangalala") are effective remedies for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and/or impotence. In order to scientifically appraise the significance and contribution of Eriosema kraussianum to its ethnomedical use as "uBangalala" and "VIAGRA substitute", the present study was undertaken to investigate the vasodilatory and hypoglycaemic properties of the two main bioactive chemical compounds [Kraussianone-1 (K1), and Kraussianone-2 (K2), Drewes, S.E., Horn, M.M., Munro, O.Q., Dhlamini, J.T.B., Meyer, J.J.M., Rakuambo, N.C., 2002. Pyrano-isoflavones with erectile-dysfunction activity from Eriosema kraussianum. Phytochemistry 59 739-747.] obtained from E. kraussianum, in experimental rat models, using sildenafil citrate (VIAGRA) as the reference drug for comparison. The two E. kraussianum rootstock constituents (K1 and K2, 20-80 mg/kg p.o.) caused dose-dependent and significant (P < 0.05-0.001) hypoglycaemia in rats. Relatively low to high concentrations of the plant's extracts (K1 and K2, 100-2000 μg/ml) always produced biphasic effects on rat isolated portal veins. K1- and K2-provoked responses of the isolated portal veins always consisted of concentration-related initial transient, but significant (P < 0.05), contractions of the venous muscle preparations, followed by secondary, longer-lasting, highly significant (P < 0.01-0.001) relaxations of the venous muscle strips. Sildenafil citrate (VIAGRA, 5-100 μg/ml) always produced concentration-related and highly significant relaxations of the rat isolated portal veins. Unlike K1 and K2 (20-80 mg/kg p.o.), however, sildenafil citrate (VIAGRA, 100 mg/kg p. o.) only caused slight and insignificant (P > 0.05) reductions in the blood glucose levels of the experimental animals used. On the other hand, glibenclamide (10 mg/kg p.o.) induced highly significant (P < 0.05-0.001), marked reductions in the blood glucose concentrations of the rats. The findings of this laboratory animal study indicate that the two hydro-ethanol extractives of E. kraussianum (K1 and K2) possess hypoglycaemic and secondary, vasorelaxant effects in the experimental paradigms used. 3aglucose tolerance 3avasodilator agents 3ahypoglycemic agents 3aisoflavones 3aportal vein 3apyrans 3amedicinal plants 3aglycemic effect 3ablood glucose 3ahuman health 3arootstocks 3avasodilation 3arats 3aEriosema 3aanimal disease models 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aDisease Models, Animal 2aFabaceaexchemistry 2aGlucose Tolerance Test 2aHypoglycemiaxchemically induced 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aIsoflavonesxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aMale 2aModels, Animal 2aMolecular Structure 2aPlant Extractsxchemistryxpharmacology. 2aPlant Rootsxchemistry 2aPlants, Medicinalxchemistry 2aRats 2aRats, Wistar 2aVasodilationxdrug effects 2aVasodilator Agentsxchemistryxpharmacology. 3aSouth Africa 0aEriosema kraussianum 0aphytochemicals 0aFabaceae1 aDrewes, S.E.1 aKhan, F.0 tPhytochemistry.g2006 Mar., v. 67, no. 6 p.610-617dPergamon Pressx0031-94227nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.11.0193electronic resource  a20061027b20061102c00000000  aINDdRSCe2006/10/27  aNon-US 7aarticle02764naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001400129245012000143300001600263520095200279650002501231650002801256650001601284650002601300650002501326650002601351650001101377650001701388650002101405650004801426650003501474650001801509650001801527650002001545650002701565650001601592650002701608650004801635650003101683650004701714650001101761650004201772650003001814650004901844650002101893653001201914653001501926653002701941700002601968700001601994700001502010773007102025852000902096930003302105945001302138946001102151655001202162IND2325712920221119164259.0020228e200110  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND232571292DNAL7 a117227652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, L.10aAnalysis of heat-shock transcription factor-DNA binding in Arabidopsis suspension cultures by UV laser crosslinking  ap. 217-223.  aCrosslinking techniques are important in examining protein-DNA interactions in living cells. Formaldehyde and UV light emitted by conventional lamps are the most commonly used crosslinking agents. The crosslinking step is followed by immunoprecipitation of specific protein-DNA adducts, and by analysis and quantification of the co-immunoprecipitated DNA. There are a few reported cases of fruitful in vivo protein-DNA crosslinking experiments, but not in plants. In this report, we analyse the binding of heat-shock transcription factor (HSF) to heat-shock promoters in intact Arabidopsis cells. Efficient protein-DNA crosslinking by irradiation of Arabidopsis suspension culture tissue was achieved using UV laser pulses. In addition, methods for immunoprecipitation and detection of the co-immunoprecipitated DNA are reported. Our results suggest that Arabidopsis HSFs immunoreactive for HSF1 antibodies bind constitutively to the HSP18.2 gene. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3acell suspension culture 3aheat stress 3atranscription factors 3aDNA-binding proteins 3aultraviolet radiation 3alasers 3aformaldehyde 3apromoter regions 2aArabidopsisxphysiologyxradiation effects. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgenetics 2aBase Sequence 2aBinding Sites 2aCells, Cultured 2aCross-Linking Reagents 2aDNA Primers 2aDNA, Plantxmetabolism 2aDNA-Binding Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFormaldehydexpharmacology 2aHeat-Shock Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aLasers 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPolymerase Chain Reaction 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aUltraviolet Rays 0abinding 0aevaluation 0abiochemical techniques1 aEggers-Schumacher, G.1 aSchoffl, F.1 aPrandl, R.0 tplant journal.g2001 Oct., v. 28, no. 2 p.217-223x0960-74127nnas  aDNAL  a20020501b20020507c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle02968naa a2200829 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187072000900196100002000205245003300225300001800258500002400276500001500300520067500315650001300990650002301003650001001026650001901036650004301055650001401098650001301112650001901125650001001144650000901154650001001163650002301173650002901196650001701225650001401242650001201256650001301268650001601281650002301297650002001320650001601340650002501356650001001381650002601391650001101417650002501428650002301453650002501476650001201501650003301513650002501546650003801571650002701609650003701636653002301673653001401696653001801710653001901728653003801747653001501785653002001800700002101820700001801841773009901859852000901958856009001967930003302057945002502090946001102115655001202126IND4440534920221119164610.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444053492DNAL7 a202232402pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.02.0122doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL300 0aL001 0aL600 0aL4001 aŠobotník, Jan10aChemical warfare in termites  ap. 1012-1021.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe rapid development of analytical methods in the last four decades has led to the discovery of a fascinating diversity of defensive chemicals used by termites.

Most isolates (99/105; 94.3%) were resistant to nalidixic acid and resistant/intermediately resistant to fluoroquinolones, and 63.8% (67/105) of the isolates were resistant to three or more antimicrobials. Forty-two quinolone-resistant isolates, of which the quinolone resistance-determining regions of the gyrA genes were sequenced, contained a substitution of a Ser to a Phe or Tyr at position 83 (71.4%), or a substitution of an Asp to an Asn, Gly, or Tyr at position 87 (28.6%). Fifty-seven sulphamethoxazole-resistant isolates were tested for the presence of class 1 integrons by polymerase chain reaction, and their resistance gene cassettes were analysed by sequencing. Three different class 1 integrons containing the resistance-gene insert aadA (52.6%; n=30), aadB (12.3%; n=7), or aadB-aadA (12.3%; n=7) were identified. Most isolates harbouring the integron containing aadB-aadA displayed resistance to all three aminoglycosides tested and also showed increased resistance to fluoroquinolones. These findings suggest that fluoroquinolone resistance may be epidemiologically linked to multiple aminoglycoside resistance. 3analidixic acid 3agenes 3aintegrins 3astrains 3aaminoglycosides 3asulfamethoxazole 3aSalmonella Gallinarum 3amultiple drug resistance 3arisk assessment 3afowl typhoid 3apathotypes 3adefense mechanisms 3aepidemiological studies 3aminimum inhibitory concentration 3aquinolones 3achickens 3aamino acid substitution 3agenetic variation 2aAmino Acid Substitution 2aAnimals 2aAnti-Bacterial Agentsxpharmacologyxtherapeutic use. 2aChickensxmicrobiology 2aDNA Gyrasexchemistryxgenetics. 2aDNA Primers 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aGlycine 2aMicrobial Sensitivity Tests 2aPhenotype 2aPoultry Diseasesxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aQuinolonesxpharmacology 2aSalmonella Infections, Animalxdrug therapyxgeneticsxmicrobiology. 2aSalmonella entericaxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 2aSerine 2aSulfamethoxazolexpharmacology 2aTyrosine 3aSouth Korea 0aKorea (South) 0amutation 0aantimicrobial agents 0aSalmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Gallinarum 0aanti-infective agents1 aKim, Aeran1 aJung, Byeong Y.1 aHer, Moon1 aJeong, Wooseog1 aCho, Young M.1 aOh, Jae Y.1 aLee, Young J.1 aKwon, Jun H.1 aKwon, Yong K.0 tAvian pathology.g2010 June, v. 39, no. 3 p.201-205dWorld Veterinary Poultry Association.x0307-94577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/030794510037672613Available from publisher's Web site  a20101104b20101204c00000000  aINDd4CTe2010/09/22  aNon-US 7aarticle02674naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002000135245021400155300001600369520129900385650002601684650002301710650002701733650001001760650002001770650001801790650001201808650001201820650001701832650002701849650001301876653001001889653002101899700002501920700002201945700002301967773013401990852000902124856007502133930003302208946001102241655001202252IND4410930520221119164702.0081003s2008    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441093052DNAL7 a10.1071/RD071772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHaydon, Lisa J.10aExpression of mRNAs encoding oestrogen receptor (ER) α and ERβ, androgen receptor and progesterone receptor during gonadal and follicular development in the marsupial brushtail possum (Trichosurus vulpecula)  ap. 335-349.  aThe objective of the present study was to determine which ovarian cells express mRNAs for oestrogen (ERα and ERβ), androgen (AR) and progesterone (PR) receptors during ovarian and follicular development in the brushtail possum. Expression of ERα and/or ERβ mRNA was observed from birth, initially in cells of the blastema, then in the medullary cords from Day 20. ERα was expressed in the oocytes and granulosa cells of secondary and antral follicles. Preovulatory follicles did not express ERα mRNA, although their oocytes were not examined for any gene. ERβ mRNA was observed in oocytes at all follicular stages examined, but was not consistently observed in granulosa or theca cells. Expression of AR mRNA before Day 40 was very faint; thereafter, expression was observed in the medullary cords, peaking between Days 60 and 120. Oocytes, granulosa cells and theca of secondary and antral, but not preovulatory, follicles expressed AR mRNA. PR mRNA was expressed throughout the gonad by Day 20. Granulosa cells of some secondary and antral follicles and theca of antral follicles expressed PR mRNA. Thus, the expression of mRNAs encoding steroidogenic receptors in a time- and cell-specific manner supports a role for steroids in the process of ovarian follicular formation and growth. 3aTrichosurus vulpecula 3aestrogen receptors 3afollicular development 3agenes 3agranulosa cells 3amessenger RNA 3aoocytes 3apossums 3aprogesterone 3aprogesterone receptors 3asteroids 0aovary 0asteroid receptor1 aJuengel, Jennifer L.1 aThomson, Brian P.1 aEckery, Douglas C.0 tReproduction, fertility, and development.g2008, v. 20, no. 3 p.335-349dCollingwood, Victoria: CSIRO Publishingx1031-36137nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1071/RD071773Available from publisher's Web site  a20081005b20081101c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01283naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008500126300001400211520041900225650002200644650002300666650000800689650002600697650001400723650001600737650001800753650001000771650001600781700001600797773009100813852000900904939003300913946001100946655001200957IND9205818420221119164707.0920918e199201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920581842DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPovey, S.R.10aNo oviposition plasticity in Sitophilus oryzae (L.)

However, it is not yet clear whether complementarity in root space exploration is a universal characteristic of multi-species woody communities. In a temperate broad-leaved forest with a mosaic of species-poor and species-rich stands, we tested two hypotheses related to putative below-ground 'overyielding' in more diverse forests, (1) that species mixture results in a partial spatial segregation of the fine root systems of different species, and (2) that stand fine root biomass increases with tree species diversity. We investigated 12 stands either with one, three, or five dominant tree species (4 replicate stands each) under similar soil and climate conditions for stand fine root biomass and spatial root segregation in vertical and horizontal direction in the soil. Fine roots of different tree species were identified using a morphological key based on differences in colour, periderm surface structure, and branching patterns. In species-poor and species-rich stands, and in all tree species present, fine root density (biomass per soil volume) decreased exponentially with soil depth at very similar rates. Stand fine root biomass in the densely rooted upper soil (0-40 cm depth) was not significantly different between stands with 1, 3 or 5 dominant tree species. We conclude that 'below-ground overyielding' in terms of higher fine root biomasses in species-rich stands as compared to monospecific ones does not occur in these broad-leaved forests which most likely results from a missing complementarity in vertical rooting patterns of the present tree species. 3abiomass 3abranching 3aclimate 3acolor 3adeciduous forests 3aecosystems 3aperiderm 3aroot systems 3arooting 3aroots 3asoil depth 3aspecies diversity 3atrees1 aLeuschner, Christoph1 aRyan, Nicholas T.1 aHertel, Dietrich0 tTrees.g2009 Oct., v. 23, no. 5 p.941-950dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-009-0336-x 7aarticle02944naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146072000900164072000900173100002500182245005100207300001600258500010000274500002400374520125700398650001501655650001301670650002001683650003001703650002601733650002501759650001901784650001201803650001501815650002301830650002201853650001101875650003501886650002701921650001501948650008501963650002502048653002302073700001502096773014002111852000902251856008502260930003302345945002502378946001102403655001202414IND4440492520221119164118.0100727e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444049252DNAL7 a205408232pmid7 a10.1017/S00296651100017582doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT300 0aX3801 aMacDonald, Thomas T.10aProbiotics and the immune response to vaccines  ap. 442-446.  aPaper presented at the 3rd International Immunonutrition Workshop / edited by Ascension Marcus.  aIncludes references  aProbiotics are bacteria, but sometimes fungi, which when taken by the oral route may give some health benefits.

As further and better controlled clinical studies have appeared, some specific probiotics also appear to have beneficial effects in perhaps preventing and reducing the duration of symptoms due to acquired upper respiratory tract infections. In an attempt to explain these effects, attention has turned to the effects of some specific probiotics on the immune system. There is evidence that some specific probiotics can alter monocyte and natural killer cell function in the blood. Evidence is also accumulating that taking some specific probiotics can boost antibody responses to oral and systemically administered vaccines. The effect when shown is modest and is not always seen in different studies to all vaccines, but there is enough of a trend to make the area worthy of further investigation, particularly to tease out the mechanisms involved. 3aprobiotics 3avaccines 3aimmune response 3adigestive system diseases 3aClostridium difficile 3abacterial infections 3ahuman diseases 3aelderly 3aantibodies 3adisease prevention 2aAntibodiesxblood 2aHumans 2aInfluenza Vaccinesximmunology 2aLeukocytesxphysiology 2aProbiotics 2aRespiratory Tract Infectionsxcomplicationsxmicrobiologyxprevention & control. 2aVaccinesximmunology 0aliterature reviews1 aBell, Iona0 tProceedings of the Nutrition Society.g2010 Aug., v. 69, no. 3 p.442-446dCABI Pub. on behalf of the Nutrition Societyx0029-66517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S00296651100017583Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd6CTe2010/09/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02168naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002700092040001800119100002100137245003200158300001600190500002400206500002300230520116100253650001101414650001001425650001701435650000801452650001701460650001501477650002501492650001601517650001801533773009001551852000901641856007701650856009101727655001201818IND4443362320221119164708.0101015s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444336232DNAL7 a10.4141/CJSS090322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGroenevelt, P.H.10aHydrostatics of frozen soil  ap. 403-408.  aIncludes references  aSummary in French.  aAn outline is presented of the relations between the energy status of water and the content of liquid water and ice in frozen soils. The theory formulates the dependence of the soil moisture characteristic (moisture retention curve) of a frozen soil on the load pressure and the temperature. This formulation requires the definition of the envelope-pressure potentials and the frost potentials of the soil moisture and the ice present in the soil. These potentials are expressed in terms of the void ratio, the moisture ratio, the ice ratio, the moisture ratio equivalent, and the ice ratio equivalent. The relations between these variables are intrinsic properties of the porous medium. They have to be determined by experiment or deduced from indirect measurements. The present theory facilitates such deductions. The measurement of the equilibrium soil moisture and ice pressures in frozen soil is more difficult than the measurement of the volume ratios. Thus, it may be advantageous to deduce the former from the latter. Some data from the literature are used to demonstrate the use of indirect measurements in order to obtain the required properties. 3aenergy 3afrost 3afrozen soils 3aice 3aporous media 3asoil water 3asoil water potential 3atemperature 3awater content0 tCanadian journal of soil science.g2010 Aug., v. 90, no. 3 p.403-408x0008-42717nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.4141/CJSS090323Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://pubs.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/aic-journals/cjss.html3Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02104naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245004700186300001800233500002400251520088400275650000801159650002001167650001701187650001501204650001701219650001201236650001201248650000901260650002201269650002301291650001801314650001501332650002401347650001801371650002101389650001801410650001701428650001001445650003201455773009701487852000901584856005301593655001201646IND4402084720221119164542.0080227e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440208472DNAL7 a174754802pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2007.02.0412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFasina, O.O.10aPhysical properties of peanut hull pellets  ap. 1259-1266.  aIncludes references  aPeanut hull (peanut pods and waste materials from processing of peanuts) was pelleted through a 3/16-in.

Bioassays reveal that tannic acid at concentrations of 0.1-6 mM is significantly more toxic for C. pipiens than for Aedes taxa, and A. aegypti is more sensitive than A. albopictus and A. rusticus. Comparison of the rank order of sensitivity among taxa with the associated levels of cytochrome P-450, esterase, and glutathione-S-transferase activities suggests that cytochrome P-450 and esterases may be involved in the detoxification of tannins. A possible involvement of these detoxifying enzymes is also revealed in vivo by the synergistic effects of S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (esterase inhibitor) and piperonyl butoxide (P-450 inhibitor). The differential sensitivity to tannins among taxa is discussed in terms of ecological implications within mosquito communities from alpine hydrosystems, where the acquisition of tannins-detoxifying enzymatic systems may be considered as a key innovation. 3aAedes albopictus 3aAedes aegypti 3aCulex pipiens 3atannins 3acytochrome P-450 3aglutathione transferase 3aesterases 0aovicides and larvicides 0aaedes rusticus 0alarvicidal activity1 aCuany, A.1 aPautou, M.P.1 aMeyran, J.C.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1999 Mar., v. 25, no. 3 p.537-548x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20000501b20000508c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02844naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002600092040001800118100002000136245013600156300001600292500002400308520158100332650002401913650002501937650001001962650002401972650001101996650001302007650001102020650001702031650001002048650001402058650001102072650000902083650001302092650003202105650001902137650001002156700002602166700001902192773011402211852000902325856007602334655001202410IND4443268220221119164457.0101001s2010    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444326822DNAL7 a10.1002/rra.13132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAsaeda, Takashi10aSpatial and temporal tree colonization in a midstream sediment bar and the mechanisms governing tree mortality during a flood event  ap. 960-976.  aIncludes references  aReduced disturbances in regulated rivers can result in stable tree colonisation in downstream reaches. We examined spatial and temporal tree colonisation on a midstream sediment bar, focussing on three dominant taxa: Salix spp. (primarily Salix gilgiana), Robinia pseudoacacia and Albizia julibrissin. We developed allometric relationships for tree height, tree age and tree diameter at breast and knee height, as well as relationships between above and below-ground biomass. The spatial profiles for all individual trees of these taxa were obtained before and after a major flood in September 2007. Pre-flood data indicate that R. pseudoacacia colonize the highest elevations, A. julibrissin lower elevations and Salix spp. the lowest elevations of the three taxa. The oldest trees at each elevation were found to have survived 1.8-2.5 m inundation in past floods. Results of investigations subsequent to the flood event in September 2007 suggest that trees can survive flooding as long as their roots remain embedded in the soil. Individuals of Salix spp. experienced higher levels of inundation, but showed the greatest survival. This is probably due to morphological acclimations, particularly deep root systems and high elasticity of shoots. Considering inundation depths, erosion depths and sediment particle sizes in tree habitats, we found that sediment mobilization was the major cause of tree mortality. Thus, the ability of Salix spp. to colonize coarse sediments greatly contributed to its survival, as coarse sediments result in significantly less tractive force. 3aAlbizia julibrissin 3aRobinia pseudoacacia 3aSalix 3abelowground biomass 3afloods 3ahabitats 3arivers 3aroot systems 3aroots 3asediments 3ashoots 3asoil 3atree age 3atree and stand measurements 3atree mortality 3atrees1 aGomes, Pattiyage I.A.1 aTakeda, Eisuke0 tRiver research and applications.g2010 Oct., v. 26, no. 8 p.960-976dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltd.x1535-14597nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rra.13133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02728naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008200128300001600210500001500226520174000241650001501981650000901996650002002005650001002025650002502035650002602060650001002086650003602096650002302132653001602155653001402171700001602185773008502201852000902286930003302295945001302328946001302341655001202354IND2202464120221119164414.0000210e199902  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220246412DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRoberts, J.L.10aEffect of Euphorbia esula on sheep rumen microbial activity and mass in vitro  ap. 297-314.  a2019-12-05  aMost large herbivores avoid the invasive weed leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.), possibly because the plant contains secondary compounds including terpenoids and condensed tannins. On the other hand, E. esula has high nutritive value based on traditional measures such as crude protein, fiber, and dry matter disappearance and is consumed by sheep and goats. Our objective was to determine if material from undefoliated and previously defoliated E. esula shoots, mixed in different proportions with grass hay, adversely affects sheep rumen microbial activity and mass in vitro. Material from undefoliated and previously defoliated E. esula shoots was collected in June, July, and August 1994 near Grass Range, Montana. Usually, increasing levels of E. esula leaves and flowers in the mixtures increased in vitro dry matter and neutral detergent fiber disappearances (DMD, NDFD), microbial gas production, and microbial purine concentrations. In contrast, increasing levels of E. esula stems in the mixtures decreased DMD, NDFD, microbial gas production, and microbial purine concentrations. Rumen microbial gas production and purine concentrations were higher with leaves from previously defoliated than undefoliated shoots. In contrast, rumen microbial gas production and DMD were lowest for stems from previously defoliated shoots; these responses correlated with high concentrations of condensed tannins in stems of previously defoliated plants. In early summer, the high nutritive value of E. esula appears to offset any potential negative effects associated with secondary compounds. In late summer, microbial response appears more sensitive to the presence of secondary compounds, when nutritive value of this plant is declining. 3aterpenoids 3adiet 3aEuphorbia esula 3asheep 3arumen microorganisms 3asecondary metabolites 3aweeds 3achemical constituents of plants 3amicrobial activity 0arumen gases 0anutrition1 aOlson, B.E.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1999 Feb., v. 25, no. 2 p.297-314x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02753naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004400092040001800136100002100154245012200175300001400297500002400311500001500335520161100350650001101961650001901972650002501991650001402016650001602030650001202046650001802058650002102076650001602097650000902113650002102122653001502143700002002158773012302178852000902301856005702310655001202367IND4461148420221119164207.0110805e199401  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446114842DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1095-8339.1994.tb01924.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDINES, TREVOR D.10aDifferential cell enlargement and its possible implication for resupination in Lemboglossum bictoniense (Orchidaceae)  ap. 67-79.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aChanges in the structural features of cell populations in the pedicel of Lemboglossum bictoniense (Bateman ex. Lindley) Halbinger were examined by means of light microscopy in relation to resupination, a twisting of the pedicel through 180o prior to flower opening. Serial sections in transverse and longitudinal planes were taken from pre-resupinate and fully resupinate pedicels of flowers from a single inflorescence, and comparisons made between the tissues. The pedicel is a prismatic cylinder flattened on three sides, producing three distinct ribS. Each rib contains one central vascular bundle enclosed by cortical parenchyma. Intervening cortical parenchyma forms flanks external to a central core of three vascular bundles, each of which is split into three distinct traces at this level. Resupination is accompanied by axial and radial expansion of cortical parenchyma. Specialized raphide-bearing cells in the cortex expand axially doubling their length in the ground parenchyma. These raphide cells are localized in the rib cortex, and their expansion is reflected in greater elongation of the ribs relative to flank areas. The extra rib length is accommodated by a lateral displacement (twisting) of the ribs around the central axis of the pedicel. Tissue distortion is reduced by cell division, expansion of intercellular spaces and a radial contraction of pith parenchyma. Raphide cell elongation could be a contributing factor in pedicel twisting. The direction of resupination may be controlled by the organization of these cells into arcs on one or other side of the rib vascular bundle. 3acortex 3ainflorescences 3aintercellular spaces 3aflowering 3acell growth 3apedicel 3acell division 3alight microscopy 3aOrchidaceae 3aribs 3avascular bundles 0aparenchyma1 aBell, Adrian D.0 tBotanical journal of the Linnean Society.g1994 Jan., v. 114, no. 1 p.67-79dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0024-40747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1095-8339.1994.tb01924.x 7aarticle03600naa a2200673 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001900196245021700215300001800432500002400450520143700474650002601911650001601937650002701953650001501980650002101995650002502016650001002041650001102051650002302062650001902085650001002104650001702114650002402131650002202155650001702177650001602194650001502210650001202225650003102237650004302268650004802311650004802359650001402407650002802421650002402449650002602473650003102499650002202530653002402552653003802576700001302614700002002627773009902647852000902746856009002755930003302845945002502878946001102903655001202914IND4440540120221119164350.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444054012DNAL7 a203712482pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.03.0322doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL600 0aL001 0aF8211 aNgumbi, Esther10aElectroantennogram (EAG) responses of Microplitis croceipes and Cotesia marginiventris and their lepidopteran hosts to a wide array of odor stimuli: Correlation between EAG response and degree of host specificity  ap. 1260-1268.  aIncludes references  aIn order to test whether the electroantennogram (EAG) response spectrum of an insect correlates to its degree of host specificity, we recorded EAG responses of two parasitoid species with different degrees of host specificity, Microplitis croceipes (specialist) and Cotesia marginiventris (generalist), to a wide array of odor stimuli including compounds representing green leaf volatiles (GLVs), herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV), ecologically irrelevant (not used by the parasitoid species and their hosts for host location) plant volatiles, and host-specific odor stimuli (host sex pheromones, and extracts of host caterpillar body and frass). We also tested the EAG responses of female moths of the caterpillar hosts of the parasitoids, Heliothis virescens and Spodoptera exigua, to some of the odor stimuli. We hypothesized that the specialist parasitoid will have a narrower EAG response spectrum than the generalist, and that the two lepidopteran species, which are similar in their host plant use, will show similar EAG response spectra to plant volatiles. As predicted, the specialist parasitoid showed greater EAG responses than the generalist to host-specific odor and one HIPV (cis-3-hexenyl butyrate), whereas the generalist showed relatively greater EAG responses to the GLVs and unrelated plant volatiles. We detected no differences in the EAG responses of H. virescens and S. exigua to any of the tested odor. 3aMicroplitis croceipes 3aparasitoids 3aCotesia marginiventris 3ahost range 3ahost specificity 3aelectroantennography 3aodors 3aleaves 3avolatile compounds 3aphytochemicals 3ahosts 3ahost seeking 3aHeliothis virescens 3aSpodoptera exigua 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aherbivores 2aAnimals 2aElectrophysiologyxmethods 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxphysiology 2aLarvaxchemistryxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aMothsxchemistryxparasitologyxphysiology. 2aOdorants. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistry 2aSpecies Specificity 2aStimulation, Chemical 2aVolatile Organic Compounds 2aWaspsxphysiology 0agreen leaf volatile 0aherbivore-induced plant volatiles1 aChen, Li1 aFadamiro, Henry0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.1260-1268dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.03.0323Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/17  aNon-US 7aarticle01909naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245010200128300001300230520103700243650001401280650001301294650002301307650002301330650001501353650003701368653001401405653002601419773008201445852000901527930003301536945001301569946001301582655001201595IND2202440220221119164329.0000209e199901  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220244022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaldwin, I.T.10aInducible nicotine production in native Nicotiana as an example of adaptive phenotypic plasticity  ap. 3-30.  aNicotine, an inducible defense in a number of Nicotiana species, exemplifies adaptive phenotypic plasticity. The mechanisms responsible for its production are reviewed, and the induced character states are characterized allometrically in order to understand how inducibility changes over ontogeny responds to environmental variables that influence plant growth, and to relate inducible production to plant fitness correlates. The empirical evidence for fitness costs and benefits of inducible nicotine production are considered, and the physiological and ecological mechanisms potentially responsible for the costs are considered. An intimate understanding of the plant's natural history is an essential prerequisite to understanding these costs and benefits. Inducible nicotine production is just one of many traits that are altered after herbivore attack, and the cost-benefit model provides a valuable heuristic framework in which to understand the selective factors responsible for the maintenance of inducibly expressed traits. 3aNicotiana 3anicotine 3adefense mechanisms 3ainduced resistance 3aherbivores 3agenotype-environment interaction 0ainduction 0aphenotypic expression0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1999 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.3-30x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03921naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002800133040001800161100002000179245013900199300001800338500002400356506007600380520180900456506003702265650002202302650001202324650001402336650001702350650000902367650001302376650001102389650001402400650001602414650001502430650000702445650001502452650001102467650001202478650001302490650002402503650006202527650003702589650002802626650005002654650006302704650005302767650002302820650002402843700002102867700001902888700002102907700002402928700002002952700002602972700001902998700002303017700001703040773011503057852000903172856007803181655001203259IND4419583220221207100642.0090424e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441958322DNAL7 a192869152pmid7 aPMC26716182pmcid7 a10.1093/jxb/erp0342doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFührs, Hendrik10aCharacterization of leaf apoplastic peroxidases and metabolites in Vigna unguiculata in response to toxic manganese supply and silicon  ap. 1663-1678.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aPrevious work suggested that the apoplastic phenol composition and its interaction with apoplastic class III peroxidases (PODs) are decisive in the development or avoidance of manganese (Mn) toxicity in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.). This study characterizes apoplastic PODs with particular emphasis on the activities of specific isoenzymes and their modulation by phenols in the Mn-sensitive cowpea cultivar TVu 91 as affected by Mn and silicon (Si) supply. Si reduced Mn-induced toxicity symptoms without affecting the Mn uptake. Blue Native-PAGE combined with Nano-LC-MS/MS allowed identification of a range of POD isoenzymes in the apoplastic washing fluid (AWF). In Si-treated plants Mn-mediated induction of POD activity was delayed. Four POD isoenzymes eluted from the BN gels catalysed both H₂O₂-consuming and H₂O₂-producing activity with pH optima at 6.5 and 5.5, respectively. Four phenols enhanced NADH-peroxidase activity of these isoenzymes in the presence of Mn²⁺ (p-coumaric=vanillic>>benzoic>ferulic acid). p-Coumaric acid-enhanced NADH-peroxidase activity was inhibited by ferulic acid (50%) and five other phenols (50-90%). An independent component analysis (ICA) of the total and apoplastic GC-MS-based metabolome profile showed that Mn, Si supply, and the AWF fraction (AWFH₂O, AWFNaCl) significantly changed the metabolite composition. Extracting non-polar metabolites from the AWF allowed the identification of phenols. Predominantly NADH-peroxidase activity-inhibiting ferulic acid appeared to be down-regulated in Mn-sensitive (+Mn, -Si) and up-regulated in Mn-tolerant (+Si) leaf tissue. The results presented here support the previously hypothesized role of apoplastic NADH-peroxidase and its activity-modulating phenols in Mn toxicity and Si-enhanced Mn tolerance.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aVigna unguiculata 3acowpeas 3acultivars 3aferulic acid 3agels 3aisozymes 3aleaves 3amanganese 3ametabolites 3ametabolome 3apH 3aperoxidase 3aphenol 3asilicon 3atoxicity 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aFabaceaexdrug effectsxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aManganesexmetabolismxtoxicity. 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeroxidasesxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Leavesxchemistryxenzymologyxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aPlant Proteinsxchemistryxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSequence Alignment 2aSiliconxmetabolism1 aGötze, Stefanie1 aSpecht, André1 aErban, Alexander1 aGallien, Sébastien1 aHeintz, Dimitri1 aVan Dorsselaer, Alain1 aKopka, Joachim1 aBraun, Hans Peter.1 aHorst, W.

In a binary choice test in a small (35-cm-diam.) arena, females discriminated between a plant and a laminated card model, laying many more eggs on the plant. Observations of females showed that the greater number of eggs laid on the plant were primarily due to on-plant behaviors, with females spending significantly more time per visit on the plant than on the model. Interestingly, females landed a similar number of times on the plant as on the model, suggesting that volatile chemicals from the plant did not influence host-finding. This observation was further supported by wind-tunnel studies, in which females showed little or no upwind flight activity in response to plants and laid similar numbers of eggs on upwind and downwind plants. Leaf surface texture, a combination of smoothness and fine structure (consisting of the midvein and other raised leaf veins), was found to stimulate egg laying by females. Methanol, dichloromethane, and pentane extracts were made of the waxes on the leaf surface. Of these three extracts, only the nonpolar (pentane) one stimulated egg laying by females. Although we did not find a role for volatile plant chemicals in host finding, they appeared to stimulate increased egg laying when the female was on the plant. It appears likely that these chemical and tactile stimuli in C japonica are general stimuli, which may be found in a large number of plants and, in combination with the feeding preferences of the larva, may explain the generalist herbivorous nature of this pest. 3aEpiphyas postvittana 3ahost seeking 3aoviposition 3aoviposition attractants 3aCamellia japonica 3aleaves 3asurfaces 3atexture 0astimuli 0aleaf surfaces 0atactile stimuli1 aHoward, A.J.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1998 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.1251-1275x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02573naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002600145245006600171300001600237520159300253653002101846653002601867653002301893653002301916700001901939700002501958700002001983773011602003852000902119856008502128930003302213946001302246655001202259IND4392833220221119164217.0070702e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439283322DNAL7 a10.1007/s00239-006-0151-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTunstall, Narelle E. 10aSelective Pressures on Drosophila Chemosensory Receptor Genes  ap. 628-636.  aThe evolution and patterns of selection of genes encoding 10 Drosophila odorant receptors (Or) and the sex pheromone receptor Gr68a were investigated by comparing orthologous sequences across five to eight ecologically diverse species of Drosophila. Using maximum likelihood estimates of dN/dS ratios we show that all 11 genes sampled are under purifying selection, indicating functional constraint. Four of these genes (Or33c, Or42a, Or85e, and Gr68a) may be under positive selection, and if so, there is good evidence that 12 specific amino acid sites may be under positive selection. All of these sites are predicted to be located either in loop regions or just inside membrane spanning regions, and interestingly one of the two sites in Gr68a is in a similar position to a previously described polymorphism in Gr5a that causes a shift in sensitivity to its ligand trehalose. For three Ors, possible evidence for positive selection was detected along a lineage. These include Or22a in the lineage leading to D. mauritiana and Or22b in the lineage leading to D. simulans. This is of interest in light of previous data showing a change in ligand response profile for these species in the sensory neuron (ab3A) which expresses both Or22a and Or22b in D. melanogaster. In summary, while the main chemosensory function and/or structural integrity of these 10 Or genes and Gr68a are evolutionarily preserved, positive selection appears to be acting on some of these genes, at specific sites and along certain lineages, and provides testable hypotheses for further functional experimentation. 0aOdorant receptor 0aChemosensory receptor 0aDrosophila species 0aPositive selection1 aSirey, Tamara 1 aNewcomb, Richard D. 1 aWarr, Coral G. 0 tJournal of molecular evolution.g2007 June, v. 64, no. 6 p.628-636dNew York : Springer-Verlagx0022-28447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00239-006-0151-63Available from publisher's Web site  a20070702b20070802c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02336naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008700124300001400211520131500225650001601540650002801556650001601584650001101600650001801611650002601629650002101655650002101676650001401697650001901711650002101730651001601751700001601767700001601783773008301799852000901882930003301891945001301924946001301937655001201950IND2202440620221119164327.0000209e199901  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220244062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDegen, T.10aPatterns of oviposition stimulants for carrot fly in leaves of various host plants  ap. 67-87.  aUndamaged leaves of 12 host-plant species differing widely in acceptability to ovipositing carrot flies were extracted with a microwave-assisted method with hexane as solvent. The highly stimulatory diethyl ether fraction obtained by separation on a silica gel column was semiquantitatively analyzed by GC-MS for previously identified oviposition stimulants of the carrot fly (phenylpropenes, fluranocoumarins, polyacetylenes). Various plant species exhibited widely differing profiles of these compounds. In choice assays, moderate numbers of eggs were deposited underneath surrogate leaves sprayed with fractions that contained high amounts of just one type of compound and low amounts of the other two types. Only fractions with medium to high levels of at least two compound classes elicited strong ovipositional responses (e.g., phenylpropenes and polyacetylenes in Daucus carota, furanocoumarins and polyacetylenes in Heracleum sphondylium and Conium maculatum). None of the examined plants contained high quantities of all three compound classes.

However, they could not explain adequately the observed preference hierarchy of the carrot fly for the host-plant species. 3aPsila rosae 3aoviposition attractants 3ahost plants 3aleaves 3aDaucus carota 3aHeracleum sphondylium 3aConium maculatum 3aphenylpropanoids 3acoumarins 3apolyacetylenes 3ahost preferences 3aSwitzerland1 aBuser, H.R.1 aStadler, E.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1999 Jan., v. 25, no. 1 p.67-87x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02338naa a2200517 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100002100179245007500200300001600275500002400291500001500315520067600330650002301006650001201029650001801041650002201059650002301081650004501104650005301149650005101202650005001253650003601303650002401339650005001363651001301413653001701426653002101443653003001464653002301494700001601517700001501533700001901548773008801567852000901655856007501664930003301739945002501772946001101797655001201808IND4381998220221119164251.0060717e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199822DNAL7 a163102322pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.10.0092doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aKanchanapoom, T.10aLignan, phenolic and iridoid glycosides from Stereospermum cylindricum  ap. 516-520.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA lignan glycoside [(+)-cycloolivil 4'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside], a phenolic glycoside [3,4-dimethoxyphenyl 1-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 to 6)-β-d-glucopyranoside] and a iridoid glycoside (stereospermoside) were isolated from the leaves and branches of Stereospermum cylindricum, together with (+)-cycloolivil, (+)-cycloolivil 6-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, (-)-olivil, (-)-olivil 4-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, (-)-olivil 4'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, vanilloloside, decaffeoyl-verbascoside, isoverbascoside, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl 1-O-β-D-xylopyranosyl-(1 to 6)-β-D-glucopyranoside, ajugol, verminoside, and specioside.

Treatment periods lasted 28 d after a 10-d adaptation period. Experiment 1 was replicated three times, and Exp. 2 was replicated twice, with eight Holstein steers in each replicate (average BW = 185 kg). Feed intake (FI), rectal temperature (RT), and respiration rate (RR) were recorded daily, and heart rate (HR) and infrared temperatures at the ear canal (ECT), ear tip (ETT), pastern (PT), coronary band (CBT), and tail tip (TT) were recorded weekly. Consumption of INF and FF/ET compared with FF diets decreased (P < .10) FI, HR, ECT, PT, CBT, and TTT and elevated (P < .10) RT and RR by 2.8, 2.77 kg/d; 17, 23 beats/min; .8, 1.1 degrees C; .9, 1.1 degrees C; .8, .9 degrees C; 1.1, 2.6 degrees C; .3, .5 degrees C; and 8, 8 breaths/min; respectively. Ear-tip temperature was reduced (P < .10) 1.6 degrees C by consumption of INF but not by consumption of FF/ET. Reduction of peripheral temperatures is indicative of reduced blood How to peripheral areas as a result of vasoconstriction. The ADG of steers consuming INF (-.64 kg/d) and FF/ET (-.47 kg/d) diets were decreased (P < .001) compared with .76 and .56 kg/d for the FF diets in Exp. 1 and 2, respectively. These results suggest that consumption of ergotamine, an ergot alkaloid produced by Acremonium coenophialum, induced physiological changes similar to those observed in cattle suffering from fescue toxicosis. 3aheart rate 3adiet 3aFestuca arundinacea 3aEpichloe coenophiala 3aergotism 3aambient temperature 3abody temperature 3asteers 3afeed intake 3aergot alkaloids 2aAnimal Feedxmicrobiology 2aAnimals 2aBody Temperature 2aCattlexphysiology 2aEating 2aErgotaminexadministration & dosagexpharmacology. 2aFood Microbiology 2aHeart Rate 2aMale 2aPoaceaexmicrobiology 2aRespiration 2aTemperature 2aWeight Gain 0acattle 0aNeotyphodium coenophialum 0arespiration rate1 aSchmidt, S.P.1 aMarple, D.N.1 aRahe, C.H.1 aSteenstra, J.R.0 tJournal of animal science.g1992 Aug., v. 70, no. 8 p.2501-2509x0021-88127nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02732naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092024002200134024001900156040001800175100002000193245012200213300001400335520146800349650001401817650001601831650002501847650001801872700001801890700001801908700002501926700001901951700002101970700002001991700002002011700001502031700002502046773010602071852000902177856009202186930003302278946001102311655001202322IND4413596820221119164225.0081212e200901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441359682DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02878.x2doi7 aPMC26326962pmcid7 a185577902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRückert, René10aInterleukin-15 stimulates macrophages to activate CD4⁺ T cells: a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis?  ap. 63-73.  aInterleukin-15 (IL-15) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is overexpressed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a disease characterized by activation of monocytes/macrophages (MΦ), and by expansion of autoreactive CD4⁺ T cells. We hypothesized that IL-15 plays a major role for this expansion of CD4⁺ T cells and modulates the phenotype of monocytes/MΦ and their interaction with CD4⁺ T cells. Here, we show that IL-15 enhances the proliferation of CD4⁺ T cells from patients with RA in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cocultures. To further dissect the underlying mechanisms, we employed MΦ from IL-15⁻/⁻ or IL-15 transgenic mice. These were induced to differentiate or were stimulated with IL-15. Here we show that addition of IL-15 during differentiation of MΦ (into 'IL-15MΦ') and overexpression of IL-15 by MΦ from IL-15tg mice leads to increased levels of major histocompatibility complex class II expression. This resulted in enhanced stimulation of antigen-specific CD4⁺ T cells in vitro and was accompanied by reduced messenger RNA expression in MΦ for immunosuppressive SOCS3. The proliferation rates of IL-15MΦ and IL-15tgMΦ were high, which was reflected by increased p27Kip¹ and reduced p21Waf¹ levels. In view of high serum and synovial levels of IL-15 in patients with RA, our data suggest the possibility that this excess IL-15 in RA may stimulate monocytes/MΦ to activate the characteristic autoreactive CD4⁺ T cells in RA. 3acytokines 3amacrophages 3arheumatoid arthritis 3aT-lymphocytes1 aBrandt, Katja1 aErnst, Martin1 aMarienfeld, Kathleen1 aCsernok, Elena1 aMetzler, Claudia1 aBudagian, Vadim1 aBulanova, Elena1 aPaus, Ralf1 aBulfone-Paus, Silvia0 tImmunology.g2009 Jan., v. 126, no. 1 p.63-73dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0019-28057nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2567.2008.02878.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20081212b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02420naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004100111040001800152072000900170100001300179245008100192300001600273500002400289500001500313520066800328650002600996650001901022650002101041650001701062650001101079650002201090650001501112650002301127650004901150650005301199650005601252650003601308650002201344650002401366650002701390650002401417651001001441653001301451653001801464653001701482653001801499700001101517700001301528700001101541700001301552700001201565773008801577852000901665856007501674930003301749945002501782946001101807655001201818IND4381996220221119164532.0060717e200603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438199622DNAL7 a164266482pmid7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2005.11.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aS2001 aWang, J.10aHydroquinone diglycoside acyl esters from the stems of Glycosmis pentaphylla  ap. 486-491.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aFour hydroquinone diglycoside acyl esters, glypentosides A-C (1-3) and seguinoside F (4), were isolated from the stems of Glycosmis pentaphylla.

Our aim was to determine the mRNA and protein expression of PLA2-IIA during prostate cancer progression in localized and metastatic prostate tumors. We evaluated the prognostic significance of PLA2-IIA expression in biochemical recurrence, clinical recurrence and disease-specific survival after surgical treatment. The expression of PLA2-IIA was examined by immunohistochemistry and chromogenic in situ hybridization in tissue microarrays of radical prostatectomy specimens and advanced/metastatic carcinomas. The expression data were analyzed in conjunction with clinical follow-up information and clinicopathological variables. The mRNA and protein expression of PLA2-IIA was significantly increased in Gleason pattern grade 2-4 carcinomas compared with benign prostate (p-values 0.042-0.001). In metastases, the expression was significantly lower than in local cancers (p=0.001). The PLA2-IIA expression correlated positively with Ki-67 and α-methylacyl CoA racemase (AMACR) expression. The prognostic evaluation revealed decreased PLA2-IIA protein expression among patients who had died of prostate cancer. In conclusion, PLA2-IIA expression is increased in carcinoma when compared with benign prostate. However, metastatic carcinoma showed decreased expression of PLA2-IIA when compared with primary carcinomas. PLA2-IIA may serve as a marker for highly proliferating, possibly poorly differentiated prostate carcinomas.

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a crucial role in the production of volatile sulfur compounds in wine. In this respect, H₂S is a necessary intermediate in the assimilation of sulfur by yeast through the sulfate reduction sequence with the key enzyme being sulfite reductase. In this study, we used a classical mutagenesis method to develop and isolate a series of strains, derived from a commercial diploid wine yeast (PDM), which showed a drastic reduction in H₂S production in both synthetic and grape juice fermentations. Specific mutations in the MET10 and MET5 genes, which encode the catalytic α- and β-subunits of the sulfite reductase enzyme, respectively, were identified in six of the isolated strains. Fermentations with these strains indicated that, in comparison with the parent strain, H₂S production was reduced by 50-99%, depending on the strain. Further analysis of the wines made with the selected strains indicated that basic chemical parameters were similar to the parent strain except for total sulfite production, which was much higher in some of the mutant strains. 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3adiploidy 3afermentation 3agenes 3agrape juice 3ahydrogen production 3ahydrogen sulfide 3amutagenesis 3amutants 3aoff flavors 3asulfates 3asulfur 3awine industry 3awine yeasts 3awines 2aAmino Acid Substitutionxgenetics 2aDNA Mutational Analysis 2aDNA, Fungalxchemistryxgenetics. 2aHydrogen Sulfidexmetabolism 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation, Missense 2aOxidoreductases Acting on Sulfur Group Donorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aSaccharomyces cerevisiaexenzymologyxgenetics. 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSulfite Reductase (NADPH)xgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aWinexanalysisxmicrobiology. 0ahydrogen sulfide production 0aMET10 0aMET5 0asulfite reductase1 aHeinrich, Anthony1 aPretorius, Isak S.1 aSwiegers, Jan H.0 tFEMS yeast research.g2009 May, v. 9, no. 3 p.446-459dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1567-13567nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1567-1364.2009.00489.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02580naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245008500124300001800209520169600227650002101923650001701944650001101961650001401972650001901986650002302005650003602028700001602064700001902080773008702099852000902186930003302195945001302228946001302241655001202254IND2199810220221119164605.0990721e199807  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219981022DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVokou, D.10aEssential-oil-mediated interactions between oregano plants and Helicidae grazers  ap. 1187-1202.  aAromatic plants dominate in Mediterranean-type ecosystems. They often produce remarkable quantities of essential oils containing high amounts of phenolic isoprenoids, such as thymol and carvacrol. The purpose of this work was to examine the interactions between commonly occurring aromatic plants in the Mediterranean environment and their snail grazers. The aromatic plants used were two Origanum vulgare subspecies, subsp. hirtum and subsp. vulgare. They differ in the content and the qualitative composition of their essential oil; subsp. hirtum contains a much larger amount and is rich in phenolic compounds. Their effect on the foraging behavior of three snail species, native in Greece, was studied; the snail species were Helix lucorum, H. aspersa, and Eobania vermiculata. The snails' responses to different food sources, raw or processed, with or without essential oils, were evaluated during the different stages of the foraging cycle. During the encounter stage, snails were more repelled than attracted when close to phenol-rich foods. During the acceptance stage, all snail species tended to reject food types that contained high concentrations of subsp. hirtum essential oil. At the feeding stage, subsp. hirtum essential oil caused reduction of daily consumption rates. Overall, the essential oil of O. vulgare subsp. vulgare did not produce any marked change in the snails' behavior. In contrast, that of O. vulgare subsp. hirtum had a repellent effect, particularly when present in naturally occurring high concentrations. Among the snail species, H. lucorum, which does not share the same biotope with O. vulgare subsp. hirtum, was the least tolerant to its essential oil. 3aOriganum vulgare 3aantifeedants 3asnails 3aHelicidae 3aessential oils 3aphenolic compounds 3achemical constituents of plants1 aTziolas, M.1 aBailey, S.E.R.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1998 July, v. 24, no. 7 p.1187-1202x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a19990901b19990909c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle02676naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001900145245007800164300001600242520152400258653001801782653003101800653003101831700001701862700001801879700001701897700001401914700001601928700001601944700001901960700001601979700002101995700002102016773011502037852000902152856008502161930003302246946001102279655001202290IND4414000120221119164556.0081219e200902  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441400012DNAL7 a10.1007/s00277-008-0591-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRuan, Guo-Rui 10aNucleophosmin mutations in Chinese adults with acute myelogenous leukemia  ap. 159-166.  aRecently, mutations in the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene were detected in 50-60% of adult acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients, mainly with a normal karyotype. In this study, we detected typical NPM1 mutations (types A, B, D) in untreated Chinese AML patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) followed by sequence analysis. The detection rate of NPM1 mutations in 220 AML patients was 16.4%, including 107 (14.2%) with the French-American-British (FAB) subtype M2, 43 (2.3%) with M3, and 52 (30.8%) with M4/M5. Only one case each with an NPM1 mutation was detected in four M0, seven M1, five M6, and two M7 cases. Eight patients were followed up after treatment, and five patients in hematologic remission continued to test negative for NPM1 mutations within 2-14 months of follow-up. Sequence analysis revealed that all the 36 positive cases were heterozygous for the mutation with 4-bp insertions at nt 959; the 36 cases included 29 (80.6%) cases with type A, four (11.1%) cases with type B, and one rare DD-3 mutation. We also detected two new mutations, namely, CTCG and CAAG insertions, named BJ-01 and BJ-02, respectively. Further, 38.9% (14/36) patients with NPM1 mutations simultaneously exhibited internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene, and 66.7% (22/33) patients did not express CD34. The results demonstrated that RQ-PCR was a reliable and sensitive method for detecting NPM1 mutations, for screening AML, and for the quantitative analysis of minimal residual diseases. 0aNPM1 mutation 0aAcute myelogenous leukemia 0aReal-time quantitative PCR1 aLi, Jin-Lan 1 aQin, Ya-Zhen 1 aLi, Ling-Di 1 aXie, Min 1 aChang, Yan 1 aZhang, Yan 1 aLiu, Yan-Rong 1 aJiang, Bin 1 aChen, Shan-Shan 1 aHuang, Xiao-Jun 0 tAnnals of hematology.g2009 Feb., v. 88, no. 2 p.159-166dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0939-55557nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00277-008-0591-83Available from publisher's Web site  a20081219b20090206c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03823naa a2200745 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151072000900169072000900178072000900187100001400196245011900210300001800329500002400347500001500371520145300386650002801839650002201867650001801889650001801907650001901925650001501944650001601959650005201975650003102027650002002058650002202078650001002100650002502110650003102135650002002166650002502186650001202211650004602223650003802269650002602307650002602333650005402359650001702413650005402430650001902484650005202503650002702555650002402582650002202606650001402628651001002642653002402652653004202676653002802718700001702746700001902763700001602782773009902798852000902897856009002906930003302996945002503029946001103054655001203065IND4440539320221119164450.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444053932DNAL7 a203469512pmid7 a10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.03.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL821 0aL002 0aL2001 aZhang, Yi10aDifferential gene expression of the honey bees Apis mellifera and A. cerana induced by Varroa destructor infection  ap. 1207-1281.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aVarroa destructor mite is currently the most serious threat to the world bee industry. Differences in mite tolerance are reported between two honey bee species Apis mellifera and Apis cerana. Differential gene expression of two honey bee species induced by V. destructor infection was investigated by constructing two suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries, as first steps toward elucidating molecular mechanisms of Varroa tolerance. From the SSH libraries, we obtained 289 high quality sequences which clustered into 132 unique sequences grouped in 26 contigs and 106 singlets where 49 consisted in A. cerana subtracted library and 83 in A. mellifera. Using BLAST, we found that 85% sequences had counterpart known genes whereas 15% were undescribed. A Gene Ontology analysis classified 51 unique sequences into different functional categories. Eight of these differentially expressed genes, representative of different regulation patterns, were confirmed by qRT-PCR. Upon the mite induction, the differentially expressed genes from both bee species were different, except hex 110 gene, which was up-regulated in A. cerana but down-regulated in A. mellifera, and Npy-r gene, which was down-regulated in both species. In general, most of the differential expression genes were involved in metabolic processes and nerve signaling. The results provide information on the molecular response of these two bee species to Varroa infection. 3ainterspecific variation 3asequence analysis 3aDNA libraries 3aectoparasites 3aApis mellifera 3ahoney bees 3aApis cerana 3areverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 3agene expression regulation 3agene expression 3aVarroa destructor 3agenes 3anucleotide sequences 3anucleic acid hybridization 3apest resistance 2aAnalysis of Variance 2aAnimals 2aBeesxgeneticsxmetabolismxparasitology. 2aComparative Genomic Hybridization 2aComputational Biology 2aDNA Primersxgenetics 2aGene Expression Regulationxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aGene Library 2aHost-Parasite Interactionsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aImmunoblotting 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aSpecies Specificity 2aSpectrophotometry 2aVarroidae 0aChina 0aspecies differences 0asuppression subtractive hybridization 0amolecular sequence data1 aLiu, Xuejiao1 aZhang, Wenqing1 aHan, Richou0 tJournal of insect physiology.g2010 Sept., v. 56, no. 9 p.1207-1281dPergamonx0022-19107nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2010.03.0193Available from publisher's Web site  a20101019b20101108c00000000  aINDd2CTe2010/09/17  aNon-US 7aarticle03997naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176072000900185100001500194245010900209300001600318500022800334500002400562500001500586520210900601650002002710650001402730650002202744650001002766650002002776650001602796650001502812650001702827650002302844650001702867650001502884650001902899650002002918650002102938650002302959651001402982653003302996653003103029700001903060700001403079700001703093700001503110773011903125852000903244856007303253930003303326945002503359946001103384655001203395IND4382005320221119164530.0060717e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438200532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aL600 0aM001 0aL2001 aSturve, J.10aEffects of North Sea oil and alkylphenols on biomarker responses in juvenile Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua)  ap.

In the present study, juvenile Atlantic cod were exposed to North Sea oil, nonylphenol and a combination of the North Sea oil and an alkylphenol mixture in a flow-through system. A suite of hepatic biomarkers were analysed. Exposure to North Sea oil resulted in strong induction of CYP1A protein levels and EROD activities. Exposure to nonylphenol, on the other hand, resulted in decreased CYP1A levels and EROD activities. Thus, nonylphenol appears to down-regulate CYP1A expression in Atlantic cod. Combined exposure to North Sea oil with an alkylphenol mixture resulted in lower EROD induction, compared to that in fish exposed to North Sea oil alone. This difference was not statistically significant, but still we believe that the alkylphenols have inhibited CYP1A activities in the fish which may have compromised CYP1A mediated metabolism of other xenobiotics, including PAH. CYP3A protein levels were lower, compared to controls, in fish exposed to nonylphenol and the combination of North Sea oil and alkylphenol mixture. In contrast, the oil alone had no effect on CYP3A protein content. North Sea oil exposure, alone or in combination with alkylphenols, caused oxidative stress observed as elevated levels of GSSG content and GR and CAT activities. Interestingly, exposure to nonylphenol resulted in a marked depletion of total glutathione levels. This apparent depletion may be a consequence of increased conjugation of glutathione to nonylphenol followed by excretion. An increase in conjugation enzyme GST activity was observed in the nonylphenol exposed group, although the difference was not significant. No sign of oxidative damage, measured as lipid peroxidation, was observed in any of the exposures experiments. This study suggests that North Sea oil may lead to oxidative stress and altered CYP1A and CYP3A expression. Alkylphenols, present in produced water, resulted in decreased CYP1A and CYP3A protein expression in Atlantic cod. 3awater pollution 3apetroleum 3aprotein synthesis 3aliver 3aprotein content 3axenobiotics 3abiomarkers 3aGadus morhua 3alipid peroxidation 3agenotoxicity 3acod (fish) 3agene induction 3aenzyme activity 3aoxidative stress 3aphenolic compounds 3aNorth Sea 0aethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase 0agene expression regulation1 aHasselberg, L.1 aFalth, H.1 aCelander, M.1 aForlin, L.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 June 1, v. 78, no. 1 p.S73-S78dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0193electronic resource  a20070108b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle03197naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245011900171300001800290500002400308520201100332650002502343650002402368650001502392650001902407650001302426650002202439650001502461650001202476650001402488650002202502650001502524650001902539651001902558651001402577700002102591700001902612773009202631852000902723856005502732655001202787IND4391559720221119164244.0070522e200706  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439155972DNAL7 a10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15217.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGeho, Ellen M.10aQuantifying ecological filters: the relative impact of herbivory, neighbours, and sediment on an oligohaline marsh  ap. 1006-1016.  aIncludes references  aThe objective of this experiment was to quantify the relative importance of herbivory, interactions with neighbours and sediment addition as filters in controlling the species present in an oligohaline marsh in southeastern Louisiana, USA. We planted 16 species of wetland plants in 3x3 m plots either inside or outside herbivore exclosures, with or without presence of established vegetation, and with or without added sediment. These species, representing 12 families and diverse morphologies, included herbaceous and woody plants. At the end of the growing season above- and below ground biomass were measured. In cleared plots (no neighbours) inside herbivore exclosures, 12 of the 16 species grew well, indicating that they could tolerate the physical conditions in the habitat. Competition significantly reduced the biomass of four of these species (A. calamus, C. occidentalis, P. hemitomon, P. cordata), suggesting that it is the strongest species-specific filter operating in the marsh. These results confirm the general consensus that competition from existing plants is the strongest filter operating in high biomass habitats, and further imply that competition has the potential to remove 33% of the species from the community. Facilitation occurred for one species, R. corniculata. Herbivory had the largest general effect of reducing biomass, as determined in the full ANOVA model, but on a species-specific basis, significantly reduced the biomass of only two species (T. distichum, T. domingensis). These results support the emerging view that herbivory is an important filter in coastal wetlands. Although several other studies have argued for the importance of sedimentation in controlling plant species composition in wetlands, we found no effect of sediment addition. Competition and herbivory appear to be two critical biological filters that control plant composition of coastal wetlands, and they must be considered in future studies and restoration efforts along the Gulf of Mexico. 3aanalysis of variance 3abelowground biomass 3abiofilters 3agrowing season 3ahabitats 3aherbaceous plants 3aherbivores 3amarshes 3asediments 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3awetland plants 3aGulf of Mexico 3aLouisiana1 aCampbell, Daniel1 aKeddy, Paul A.0 tOikos.g2007 June, v. 116, no. 6 p.1006-1016dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx0030-12997nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2007.0030-1299.15217.x 7aarticle02959naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100001600184245009400200300002000294506007600314520134800390506003701738650003201775650001301807650001601820650003201836650001201868650003701880650001201917650002001929650002401949650002601973650003101999700002302030700001802053700002402071700002002095700002402115700002302139773017702162852000902339856008302348930003302431946001302464655001202477IND4410681320221207100632.0080926e20080923xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441068132DNAL7 a10.1073/pnas.08047451052doi7 aPMC25672172pmcid7 a187871152pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, Il-Man10aβ-Blockers alprenolol and carvedilol stimulate β-arrestin-mediated EGFR transactivation  ap. 14555-14560.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent evidence suggests that binding of agonist to its cognate receptor initiates not only classical G protein-mediated signaling, but also β-arrestin-dependent signaling. One such β-arrestin-mediated pathway uses the β₁-adrenergic receptor (β₁AR) to transactivate the EGFR. To determine whether β-adrenergic ligands that do not activate G protein signaling (i.e., β-blockers) can stabilize the β₁AR in a signaling conformation, we screened 20 β-blockers for their ability to stimulate β-arrestin-mediated EGFR transactivation. Here we show that only alprenolol (Alp) and carvedilol (Car) induce β₁AR-mediated transactivation of the EGFR and downstream ERK activation. By using mutants of the β₁AR lacking G protein-coupled receptor kinase phosphorylation sites and siRNA directed against β-arrestin, we show that Alp- and Car-stimulated EGFR transactivation requires β₁AR phosphorylation at consensus G protein-coupled receptor kinase sites and β-arrestin recruitment to the ligand-occupied receptor. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of Src and EGFR blocked Alp- and Car-stimulated EGFR transactivation. Our findings demonstrate that Alp and Car are ligands that not only act as classical receptor antagonists, but can also stimulate signaling pathways in a G protein-independent, β-arrestin-dependent fashion.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aG-protein coupled receptors 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3abeta-adrenergic antagonists 3aligands 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3amutants 3aphosphorylation 3asignal transduction 3asmall interfering RNA 3atranscriptional activation1 aTilley, Douglas G.1 aChen, Juhsien1 aSalazar, Natasha C.1 aWhalen, Erin J.1 aViolin, Jonathan D.1 aRockman, Howard A.0 tProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.g2008 Sept. 23, v. 105, no. 38 p.14555-14560dNational Academy of Sciencesx0027-84247nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.08047451053Available from publisher's Web site  a20080926b20081011c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01837naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001400110245007800124300001600202520094400218650002901162650002701191650001901218650001401237653001701251653002101268653002201289653003201311700001501343773008501358852000901443930003301452945001301485946001301498655001201511IND2203849920221119164139.0000414e199904  nyu|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220384992DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKim, J.Y.10aEversible pheromone gland in a melolonthine beetle, Holotrichia parallela  ap. 825-833.  aThe morphology of an eversible pheromone gland of a melolonthine beetle, Holotrichia parallela (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Melolonthinae), was characterized. Through careful dissection of the gland and GC-MS analysis of tissue extracts, we determined that the pheromone is produced in the posterior part of a ball-shaped sac exposed during female calling. Light microscope observation of the posterior part of the gland revealed a layer of cuticular epithelium composed of columnar cells, which was assigned as the tissue involved in pheromone production. Other morphological features, such as a soft cuticular layer adjacent to the epithelium and groups of retractor muscles attached to the gland, were characterized according to their functions. Paired accessory glands, which in some other melolonthine species house symbiotic bacteria that produce a sex attractant, were found not to be involved in pheromone production in H. parallela. 3aHolotrichia (Coleoptera) 3aanatomy and morphology 3asex pheromones 3asecretion 0alocalization 0aaccessory glands 0atissue morphology 0aphenomone-producing tissues1 aLeal, W.S.0 tJournal of chemical ecology.g1999 Apr., v. 25, no. 4 p.825-833x0098-03317nnas  aDNAL  a20000702b20000711c00000000  aINDdLDP  aOther US 7aarticle03118naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003900092040001800131072000900149072000900158072000900167072000900176100002300185245010000208300001600308500022800324500002400552500001500576520139700591650002001988650001402008650003502022650001502057650001702072650001702089650001102106650002502117650001702142650001302159650001502172650001402187650002002201650002302221651001402244653001802258700001602276700001402292773011902306852000902425856007302434930003302507945002502540946001102565655001202576IND4382004920221119164154.0060717e20060601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND438200492DNAL7 a10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0172doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW000 0aL810 0aM001 0aL6001 aMartin-Skilton, R.10aEndocrine alteration in juvenile cod and turbot exposed to dispersed crude oil and alkylphenols  ap.

As potential markers of endocrine alteration, key enzymatic activities involved in both synthesis (17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases and P450 aromatase) and metabolism (liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) and sulfotransferases) of steroids were assessed together with circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol in plasma. NP-exposed turbot had lower ovarian P450 aromatase, lower levels of testosterone and estradiol in plasma, and lower glucuronidation rates of sex steroids than those from the control group. In contrast, higher liver UGT-testosterone, and a trend towards higher P450 aromatase was detected in oil-exposed specimens. Those exposed to the combination oil + alkylphenols had lower levels of estradiol in plasma than controls, and no significant effects on any the enzymatic activities tested was observed. All these alterations were more evident in turbot than in cod. In fact, apart from a higher glucuronidation rate of estradiol detected in the liver of NP-exposed cod, no significant differences were observed between control and exposed cod. 3awater pollution 3apetroleum 3aendocrine-disrupting chemicals 3abiomarkers 3aGadus morhua 3ablood plasma 3aturbot 3aScophthalmus maximus 3atestosterone 3atoxicity 3acod (fish) 3aestradiol 3aenzyme activity 3aphenolic compounds 3aNorth Sea 0aPsetta maxima1 aThibaut, R.1 aPorte, C.0 tAquatic toxicology.g2006 June 1, v. 78, no. 1 p.S57-S64dElsevier/North Holland Biomedical Pressx0166-445X7nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2006.02.0173electronic resource  a20070108b20070202c00000000  aINDdGAYe2007/01/05  aNon-US 7aarticle02817naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245011500156300001800271500002000289520144200309592002801751650001501779650001501794650001201809650001101821650001201832650001501844650001301859650001801872650001201890650001301902650001501915650001601930650002401946650001101970650001401981700001201995700001902007700001802026700001902044700002102063700002002084773014902104856007302253852000902326655001202335IND60592808620221121060320.0180413e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059280862DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.54672doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShang, Dawei10aEnhanced NH3 capture by imidazolium‐based protic ionic liquids with different anions and cation substituents  ap. 1228-1236.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Ionic liquids have become potential absorbents to treat exhausted gases containing NH₃, which threatens the living environment of human beings. RESULTS: In this study, 10 kinds of protic and conventional ILs were synthesized and characterized and their densities, viscosities and thermal decomposition temperatures measured. The NH₃ solubility in ILs from the vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) experiments revealed that the chain length of cations had little influence on the NH₃ solubility of the protic ILs because of the high NH₃ capacities in protic ILs resulting from protic hydrogen atom compared with conventional ILs. The 2‐H atom on the cation influenced the NH₃ solubility in both protic and conventional ILs with different trends as the pressure was increased. Considering the effect of anions with the same cation [Bim]⁺, the order of NH₃ solubility in protic ILs was [Bim][NTf₂] > [Bim][SCN] > [Bim][NO₃]. Dynamic absorption of NH₃ in [Eim][NTf₂] preliminarily revealed that the absorption was fast under ambient pressure and through 5 cycles of absorption and desorption, the NH₃ absorption ability remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the NH₃ solubility and the structures of both protic and conventional ILs was revealed, indicating the protic ILs as an alternative material for the treatment of NH₃‐containing exhaust gases. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorbents 3aabsorption 3aammonia 3aanions 3acations 3adesorption 3ahydrogen 3aionic liquids 3aliquids 3anitrates 3asolubility 3atemperature 3athermal degradation 3avapors 3aviscosity1 aBai, Lu1 aZeng, Shaojuan1 aDong, Haifeng1 aGao, Hongshuai1 aZhang, Xiangping1 aZhang, Suojiang0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1228-1236dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02791naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001400151245008900165300001600254520154300270592002801813650002101841650001501862650002601877650002201903650001501925653003501940653001301975653003001988653000802018653001702026653002502043653003402068653002602102700001802128700001902146700001802165773010302183856008602286852000902372655001202381IND60526464120221120052715.0190408e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052646412DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMa, Liang10aMIKE SHE modeling of ecohydrological processes: Merits, applications, and challenges  ap. 137-149.  aMIKE SHE is one of the most extensively used physically based distributed hydrological models that are capable of credibly interpreting the response mechanism of ecohydrological processes to ecosystem components and organization. However, implementing MIKE SHE in integrated catchment modeling is a complex task requiring an experienced modeling team with skills in a variety of disciplines, making it difficult for scientists without a background in hydrology or computer science to utilize this useful model. This review, from the perspective of ecology and environmental science, illustrates the important role of a physically based distributed model as a solution to issues related to ecohydrological processes, offering a major discussion of issues that received little attention from the previous reviewers and that would interest researchers without a hydrology background. The inevitable and possible difficulties confronting these potential users at the beginning and early stages of utilizing the model are also brought to light, with suggestions for solutions. This paper offers a brief review of MIKE SHE development and elaborates its main merits, key problems, and research on the model's theories and practices implemented by scholars. Lingering problems in current solutions are analyzed, and potential approaches to solutions are proposed. We hope that this paper provides some practical advice to researchers who want to initiate study of water issues related to modeling ecohydrological processes by employing MIKE SHE.  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer science 3aecosystems 3aenvironmental science 3ahydrologic models 3awatersheds 0aDistributed hydrological model 0aMIKE SHE 0aEcohydrological processes 0aPUC 0aEquifinality 0aUncertainty analysis 0aHydrological process analysis 0aCalibration framework1 aHe, Chunguang1 aBian, Hongfeng1 aSheng, Lianxi0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Nov., v. 96 p.137-149dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.01.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02532naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001800166245008500184300001800269520122800287592002801515650002101543650001601564650001501580650002501595650002501620650002301645650002201668650001401690650002001704650001101724650002101735650002101756650000901777650001501786650003201801650001601833700002101849700002301870773010301893856008101996852000902077655001202086IND60081851820221120180041.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008185182DNAL7 a250015902pmid7 a10.1007/s11033-014-3537-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Meetul10aOptimization of conditions for expression of recombinant interferon-γ in E.coli  ap. 6537-6543.  aInterferon gamma (IFN-γ) is an important immunoregulatory cytokine that has a central role against viral and bacterial infections. In this study, the cDNA encoding 141 amino acids of mature IFN-γ from mice splenocytes was cloned in a prokaryotic expression vector pQE 30. Optimization of expression conditions resulted in high IFN-γ protein. Western blot showed that recombinant IFN-γ was specifically recognized by its counterpart anti-mouse IFN-γ antibodies. In vitro dose-dependent studies, with A549 and HeLa cell lines, showed that cloned IFN-γ was safe and had no effect on cell proliferation. The protein prediction and analysis using SOPMA program, revealed that IFN-γ had 80 α-helices, 8 β-turns jointed by 9 extended strands and 44 random coils. A total of four major clusters were observed with murine IFN-γ sharing 39 % homology with human IFN-γ. Pair-wise alignment studies with human revealed 26 % identity and 43.3 % similarity. The recovery of bioactive proteins from inclusion bodies (IBs) is a complex process and various protocols have been developed.

Various compounds present in exudates of host plants trigger haustorium development. The two most effective haustorium inducing factors (HIFs) known for the parasitic plant Triphysaria versicolor (T. versicolor) are peonidin, an antioxidant flavonoid, and 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone (DMBQ), an oxidative stress agent. To date, two genes involved in haustorium initiation in T. versicolor have been identified: TvQR1, a quinone oxidoreductase that generates the active HIF from DMBQ, and TvPirin, a transcription co-factor that regulates several other DMBQ- responsive and –non-responsive genes. While the expression of these genes in response to DMBQ is well characterized, their expression in response to peonidin is not. In addition, the pattern of polymorphisms in these genes is unknown, even though nucleotide changes in TvQR1 and TvPirin may have contributed to the ability of T. versicolor to develop haustoria. To gain insights into these aspects, we investigated their transcriptional responses to HIFs and non-HIF and their natural nucleotide diversity. RESULTS: Here we show that TvQR1 and TvPirin are transcriptionally upregulated by both DMBQ and peonidin in T. versicolor roots. Yet, while TvQR1 also responded to juglone, a non-HIF quinone with toxicity comparable to that of DMBQ, TvPirin did not. We further demonstrate that TvPirin encodes a protein shorter than the one previously reported. In the T. versicolor natural population of Northern California, TvQR1 exhibited remarkably higher molecular diversity and more recombination events than TvPirin, with the highest non-synonymous substitution rate in the substrate recognition and catalytic domain of the TvQR1 protein. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TvQR1 and TvPirin have most likely evolved highly distinct roles for haustorium formation. Unlike TvPirin, TvQR1 might have been under diversifying selection to maintain a diverse collection of polymorphisms, which might be related to the recognition of an assortment of HIF and non-HIF quinones as substrates for successful haustorial establishment in a wide range of host plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahost range 3aparasitic plants 3aparasitism 3atoxicity 3aroots 3ahost plants 3atranscription (genetics) 3agene expression 3agenes 3aactive sites 3aflavonoids 3agenetic variation 3aAngiospermae 3anutrients 3ajuglone 3aantioxidants 3aoxidative stress 3aCalifornia 0aMagnoliophyta1 aAlbrecht, Huguette1 aTsuchimatsu, Takashi1 aGrossniklaus, Ueli0 tBMC plant biology.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.28-28dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-13-283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02430naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003100151245013600182300001600318520109200334592002801426650002401454650001201478650000901490650001801499650001101517650001601528650002401544650001301568650001601581651001501597653002501612653003001637653001501667653001601682653002201698653002601720700003001746700002101776773010401797856008601901852000901987655001201996IND60565748820221117065855.0190318e201709  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056574882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.fishres.2017.03.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAllen Akselrud, Caitlin I.10aExploring model structure uncertainty using a general stock assessment framework: The case of Pacific cod in the Eastern Bering Sea  ap. 104-120.  aAn assessment framework is developed that allows analysts to conduct stock assessments for fish and invertebrate stocks based on age-, size- and age-size-structured population dynamics models. The size-structured model is nested within the age-size-structured model. The framework can use catch, discard, index of abundance, size- and age-composition, conditional age-at-length, mean length-at-age, and tagging data to estimate model parameters. It is used to explore the sensitivity of key model outputs for Pacific cod in the Eastern Bering Sea by applying model configurations that use the same data, same likelihood functions, and same data weighting schemes. Base model configurations using the three model types all fit the available data adequately, but the age-structured model fits the data better than the size-structured model. Variation in estimates of spawning biomass and the overfishing level was higher among model-types than within model-types. This result highlights the need for assessment analysts to focus more on applying and presenting results for multiple models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGadus macrocephalus 3abiomass 3afish 3ainvertebrates 3amodels 3aoverfishing 3apopulation dynamics 3aspawning 3auncertainty 3aBering Sea 0aAge-structured model 0aAge-size-structured model 0aAssessment 0aPacific cod 0aPlatoon-structure 0aSize-structured model1 aPunt, A.

Plants have developed highly flexible mechanisms to deal with drought, including organ‐ and developmental stage‐specific responses. In young leaves, growth is repressed as an active mechanism to save water and energy, increasing the chances of survival but decreasing yield. Despite its importance, the molecular basis for this growth inhibition is largely unknown. Here, we present a novel approach to explore early molecular mechanisms controlling Arabidopsis leaf growth inhibition following mild drought. We found that growth and transcriptome responses to drought are highly dynamic. Growth was only repressed by drought during the day, and our evidence suggests that this may be due to gating by the circadian clock. Similarly, time of day strongly affected the extent, specificity, and in certain cases even direction of drought‐induced changes in gene expression. These findings underscore the importance of taking into account diurnal patterns to understand stress responses, as only a small core of drought‐responsive genes are affected by drought at all times of the day. Finally, we leveraged our high‐resolution data to demonstrate that phenotypic and transcriptome responses can be matched to identify putative novel regulators of growth under mild drought.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3acircadian rhythm 3adiurnal variation 3adrought 3aenergy 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3agrowth retardation 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3astress response 3atranscriptome 3awater stress1 aClaeys, Hannes1 aVan den Broeck, Lisa1 aInzé, D.q(Dirk),0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2017 Feb., v. 40, no. 2 p.180-189dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.128093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03655naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245011400168300001600282520190000298592002802198650001902226650001902245650002002264650001502284650001302299650002502312650002002337650002702357650001402384650001202398650001802410650001402428650002102442650001502463650003702478650001302515650002502528650001002553650002102563650001302584653002902597653001902626653002202645653001602667700001502683700001702698700001602715700001902731700002102750700001602771700001802787700002002805700001802825773010202843856008702945852000903032655001203041IND60545684820221121122619.0160902e20150401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054568482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.0842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarkas, J.14aThe impact of TiO2 nanoparticles on uptake and toxicity of benzo(a)pyrene in the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis)  ap. 469-476.  aNanoparticles are emerging contaminants of concern. Knowledge on their environmental impacts is scarce, especially on their interactive effects with other contaminants. In this study we investigated effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NP) on the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) and determined their influence on the bioavailability and toxicity of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), a carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Blue mussels were exposed to either TiO2NP (0.2 and 2.0mgL−1) or B(a)P (20μgL−1) and to the respective combinations of these two compounds. Aqueous contaminant concentrations, the uptake of Ti and B(a)P into mussel soft tissue, effects on oxidative stress and chromosomal damage were analyzed. The uncoated TiO2NP agglomerated rapidly in the seawater. The presence of TiO2NP significantly reduced the bioavailability of B(a)P, shown by lowered B(a)P concentrations in exposure tanks and in mussel tissue. The activities of antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were impacted by the various exposure regimes, indicating oxidative stress in the contaminant exposure groups. While SOD activity was increased only in the 0.2TiO2NP exposure group, CAT activity was enhanced in both combined exposure groups. The GPx activity was increased only in the groups exposed to the two single compounds. In hemocytes, increased chromosomal damage was detected in mussels exposed to the single compounds, which was further increased after exposure to the combination of compounds. In this study we show that the presence of TiO2NP in the exposure system reduced B(a)P uptake in blue mussels. However, since most biomarker responses did not decrease despite of the lower B(a)P uptake in combined exposures, the results suggest that TiO2NP can act as additional stressor, or potentially alters B(a)P toxicity by activation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMytilus edulis 3abenzo(a)pyrene 3abioavailability 3abiomarkers 3acatalase 3aenvironmental impact 3aenzyme activity 3aglutathione peroxidase 3ahemocytes 3amussels 3ananoparticles 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stress 3aphosphorus 3apolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 3aseawater 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atanks 3atitanium dioxide 3atoxicity 0aEngineered nanoparticles 0aBenzo(a)pyrene 0aCombined exposure 0aBlue mussel1 aBergum, S.1 aNilsen, E.W.1 aOlsen, A.J.1 aSalaberria, I.1 aCiesielski, T.M.1 aBączek, T.1 aKonieczna, L.1 aSalvenmoser, W.1 aJenssen, B.M.0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 511 p.469-476dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.0843Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02357naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245010200170300001600272520090500288592002801193650003401221650002501255650002501280650001701305650001801322650001401340650002901354650002501383650001901408650001101427650002301438650003201461650001801493650002201511650000901533650001401542653002501556653001801581653002501599653002501624700001601649700001701665700001401682773010701696856005101803852000901854655001201863IND50075878120221120104014.0140410e20120501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587812DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2011.5580162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiaoqiang10aChemical composition and antioxidant activity of the essential oil of Schisandra chinensis fruits  ap. 842-849.  aThis study was designed to examine the composition and in vitro antioxidant activity of the essential oil of Schisandra chinensis fruits. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to determine the composition of the essential oil. Forty components were identified, representing 90.80% of the oil; ylangene (37.72%), β-himachalene (10.46%) and α-bergamotene (8.57%) were the main components. Antioxidant and radical-scavenging properties were evaluated by means of 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay and β-carotene bleaching assay. In the DPPH assay, IC₅₀ value of the S. chinensis essential oil was determined as 4.17 mg mL⁻¹. In the β-carotene bleaching assay, the essential oil (1.0 mg mL⁻¹) exhibited 25.89% inhibition against linoleic acid oxidation. In both systems, antioxidant capacity of butylated hydroxytoluene was also determined in parallel experiments.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aSchisandra chinensis 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3abeta-carotene 3ableaching 3abutylated hydroxytoluene 3achemical composition 3aessential oils 3afruits 3agas chromatography 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3alinoleic acid 3amass spectrometry 3aoils 3aoxidation 0aSchisandra chinensis 0aessential oil 0achemical composition 0aantioxidant activity1 aZhang, Ying1 aZu, Yuangang1 aYang, Lei0 tNatural product research.g2012 May 1, v. 26, no. 9 p.842-849dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2011.558016  aDNAL 7aarticle02754naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245008900169300001300258520137800271592002801649650002001677650000901697650002301706650002001729650001401749650001401763650001501777650001601792650001401808650001201822650001201834650002001846650002501866650002001891650001801911650001201929650001001941650002301951653001601974653001901990653001002009653002902019653002602048773009602074856008102170852000902251655001202260IND60480332020221122051209.0160127e20090611xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048033202DNAL7 a10.2478/v10086-009-0001-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMazurkiewicz, Jan10aUtilization of domestic plant components in diets for common carp Cyprinus carpio L.  ap. 5-39.  aThe aim of this work was to determine the possibilities of substituting domestic plant protein ingredients for fish meal in complete diets in rearing different age/size groups of carp, Cyprinus carpio L. at high intensification. The mixture of legume seeds and extracted rapeseed meal used in the studies can partially replace fish meal in complete diets for carp, while the effective level of fish meal replacement was varied and depended on the carp age/size group. Introducing mixtures of plant components up to 26 and 22%, respectively, to the diets of carp early juveniles and juveniles did not adversely affect rearing results. The best results in rearing two-year old and market carp were obtained using diets that contained mixtures of plant components of 32 and 27%, respectively. Analyses were performed on the dependence between the share of plant protein in the dietary protein of the individual diets and the mean individual weight of carp and the values of the feed conversion ratio. This provided the basis for the conclusion that plant protein can comprise from 30-35% of the total protein pool in the diets of carp early juveniles and juveniles, while the maximum allowable share in the diets of two-year old and market carp is 45%. The experimental diet used in the feeding of market carp did not have an impact on the sensory properties of the fish meat.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCyprinus carpio 3acarp 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3afish meal 3afish meat 3agroup size 3aingredients 3ajuveniles 3alegumes 3amarkets 3anutritive value 3aplant source protein 3aprotein content 3arapeseed meal 3arearing 3aseeds 3asensory properties 0acommon carp 0afish nutrition 0adiets 0aplant protein components 0afish meal replacement0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2009 June 11, v. 17, no. 1 p.5-39dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10086-009-0001-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01801naa a2200241 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003300094040001800127100002400145245005900169300001800228520102400246592002801270650000901298650001101307650001501318773012601333856007901459852000901538655001201547IND60312851920221123042259.0150714e20140606xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6031285192DNAL7 a10.1126/science.12549062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaychunas, Glenn A.10aDisrupting dissolving ions at surfaces with fluid flow  ap. 1094-1095.  aAqueous dissolution processes are not well understood on the molecular scale (1), and this has led to controversy, notably in geochemical systems (2 , 3). Charging of a solid surface, either by substitution of ions with a different valence (e.g., Ca2 ⁺ for Na ⁺) or by chemical binding of charged species from solution, orients the dipole moments of nearby water molecules. On the solution side of these dipoles, oppositely charged ions collect (4) and an electrical double layer (EDL) of different charges forms. Two prevailing assumptions about the EDL have been that water molecules and ions near the surface are not substantially perturbed by solution flow and that surfaces with low solubility have negligible effects on chemistry within the EDL. These notions are upset by the results reported on page 1138 of this issue by Lis et al. (5), who show both EDL sensitivity to flow-induced interface shear and substantial changes in surface charges as a result of dissolution processes on low-solubility surfaces.  aPublisher supplied data 3aions 3asodium 3asolubility0 tScience.g2014 June 6, v. 344, no. 6188 p.1094-1095dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.12549063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04158naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100002200164245012200186300001800308500001500326520209300341592002802434650001402462650001002476650001002486650001502496650001402511650001802525650001702543650003602560650001502596650001402611650001102625650001002636650002002646650002102666650001202687650003302699650002902732650001502761650004702776650001002823650002702833650002602860650004902886650002402935650002102959650001502980650001002995650004803005650001803053651001203071651002703083653002203110700002503132700003003157700002503187700002803212700002403240700002503264773011403289856004803403852000903451655001203460IND4471072420221120050639.0120626e201208  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447107242DNAL7 a222465402pmid7 a10.1007/s11250-011-0067-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOgundiyi, Alex I.10aPrevalence of mange among West African Dwarf sheep and goats and associated haematological and biochemical parameters  ap. 1263-1269.  a2019-12-06  aThis study was carried out to assess the prevalence of mange in sheep and goats in five local government areas (LGAs) of Ogun State in South Western Nigeria. A total of 4,973 sheep and 7,902 goats of West African Dwarf breeds were sampled of which only 4 (0.08%) of sheep and 42 (0.53%) of goats were confirmed positive for mange infestation. In all the LGAs sampled, Odeda LGA had the highest concentration of sheep (39%) and goats (51%) while Abeokuta South had the least percentage of sheep (1%) and goats (1%). All the mange-infested cases in sheep were recorded in just one LGA (Ewekoro) which constituted 0.24% of the population within the location. For goats, three out of five LGAs namely: Obafemi Owode, Ewekoro and Abeokuta North had prevalence of 1.46%, 0.53% and 0.72% respectively. There was no significant (P > 0.05) difference between non-infested and infested animals in terms of packed cell volume (31.79 ± 0.87% vs. 31.41 ± 1.13%), haemoglobin (10.51 ± 0.21 g/100 ml vs. 10.28 ± 0.37 g/100 ml) and red blood cells (8.71 ± 0.29 × 1012/l vs. 9.40 ± 0.37 × 1012/l). The infested group however showed significantly (P < 0.01) higher white blood cells count (7.60 ± 0.22 × 109/l) than the non-infested animals (6.81 ± 0.17 × 109/l). Neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil and monocyte as well as chloride were not significantly affected by the health status of the animals. There existed significant (P < 0.01) difference between non-infested and infested animals in terms of total protein (5.42 ± 0.16 vs. 4.75 ± 0.20 g/dl), sodium (137.98 ± 1.53 vs. 128.92 ± 1.92 mEq/l) and potassium (4.04 ± 0.14 vs. 3.46 ± 0.18 mEq/l). It can be concluded from this study that the prevalence of mange mite infestation varied with location and was generally low or absent in some of the LGAs considered. Goats were particularly more susceptible to mange infestation than sheep. More concerted effort is needed to control mange in order to avoid spread since it is a contagious disease.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasophils 3asheep 3agoats 3ahematocrit 3achlorides 3aanimal health 3aerythrocytes 3aWest African Dwarf (goat breed) 3ahemoglobin 3apotassium 3asodium 3amange 3aleukocyte count 3alocal government 2aAnimals 2aBlood Cell Countxveterinary 2aBlood Proteinsxanalysis 2aDemography 2aGoat Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aGoats 2aHematocritxveterinary 2aHemoglobinsxanalysis 2aMite Infestationsxepidemiologyxveterinary. 2aModels, Statistical 2aPotassiumxblood 2aPrevalence 2aSheep 2aSheep Diseasesxepidemiologyxparasitology. 2aSodiumxblood 3aNigeria 0aNigeriaxepidemiology. 0amite infestations1 aBemji, Martha Nchang1 aAdebambo, Olufunmilayo A.1 aDipeolu, Morenike A.1 aOnagbesan, Okanlawon M.1 aJames, Ikechwuku J.1 aOsinowo, Olusegun A.0 tTropical animal health and production.g2012 Aug., v. 44, no. 6 p.1263-1269dSpringer-Verlagx0049-47477nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11250-011-0067-z  aDNAL 7aarticle02535naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001800151245012200169520113800291592002801429650000801457650001301465650001601478650001101494650002101505650001401526650002101540650001601561650001801577650003301595650002101628650001301649653001001662653001701672653002001689653001201709700001701721700003201738700001801770700001801788700001701806700005601823773009101879856008601970852000902056655001202065IND60724136720221120102041.0220124e20210501xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1220582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiao, Xianjiu10aProximity hybridization triggered hybridization chain reaction for label-free electrochemical homogeneous aptasensors  aA label-free homogeneous electrochemical aptasensor was developed for detection of thrombin based on proximity hybridization triggered hybridization chain reaction induced G-quadruplex formation. Thrombin promoted the formation of a complex via the proximity hybridization of the aptamer DNA strands, which unfolded the molecular beacon, the stem part of molecular beacon as a primer to initiate the hybridization chain reaction process. Thus, with the electrochemical indicator hemin selectively intercalated into the multiple G-quadruplexes, a significant electrochemical signal drop is observed, which is dependent on the concentration of the target thrombin. Thus, using this“signal-off” mode, label-free homogeneous electrochemical strategy for sensitive thrombin assay with a detection limit of 44 fM is realized. Furthermore, this method also exhibits additional advantages of simplicity and low cost, since both expensive labeling and sophisticated probe immobilization processes are avoided. Its high sensitivity, acceptable accuracy, and satisfactory versatility of analytes led to various applications in bioanalysis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aaccuracy 3aaptasensors 3aassays 3achemical species 3adetection 3aelectrochemistry 3aexhibitions 3ahybridization 3ahybridization chain reaction 3aoligonucleotides 3athrombin 0aHemin 0aG-quadruplex 0aElectrochemical 0aSensors1 aZhang, Caiyi1 aMachuki, Jeremiah Ong'achwa1 aWen, Xiaoqing1 aChen, Duankai1 aTang, Qianli1 aGao, Fenglei1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9367-83680 tTalanta.g2021 May 01, v. 226 p.122058-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11742x0039-91407nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2020.1220583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02261naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245006600155300001800221500002000239520100500259592002801264650001701292650001801309650001901327650002101346650001201367650001301379650002501392650001801417650001501435650001101450700002901461700001701490700004201507700002201549700001701571700002001588773014901608856007301757852000901830655001201839IND60592809220221121135505.0180413e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059280922DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.54882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMateo, Sara10aEffect of sludge age on microbial consortia developed in MFCs  ap. 1290-1299.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: This work is focused on the assessment of the performance of mini‐scale air‐breathing microbial fuel cells (MFCs), by monitoring the evolution of the bio‐electrogenic activity for a period of 40 days and by comparing the microorganisms populations developed in each of the MFCs after this period. RESULTS: Five MFCs were operated at sludge ages ranging from 1.4 to 10.0 days. Results showed the superb performance of the MFC operating under a sludge age of 2.5 days. Desulfuromonas, Syntrophothermus, Solitalea, Acholeplasma, Propionicimonas, Desulfobacula and Sphaerochaeta are proposed as potentially responsible for the bio‐electrogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: Microbial population analysis through Illumina amplicon sequencing demonstrated that despite all MFCs being seeded with the same mixed culture inoculum, the biological cultures developed in the suspension and the biofilm are completely different and depend strongly on sludge age. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcholeplasma 3aDesulfobacula 3aDesulfuromonas 3aSyntrophothermus 3abiofilm 3ainoculum 3amicrobial fuel cells 3amixed culture 3amonitoring 3asludge1 aZamorano‐López, Nuria1 aBorras, Luis1 aFernandez‐Morales, Francisco Jesús1 aCañizares, Pablo1 aSeco, Aurora1 aRodrigo, Manuel0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1290-1299dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03112naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001500153245013700168500001900305520156700324592002801891650002201919650002201941650001601963650002201979650001602001650002502017650001702042650002202059650001602081650001602097650001102113650001102124650001902135650002502154650001702179651001002196653002502206653002502231653002202256653002102278653003702299700001902336700001802355700001702373773011902390856008802509852000902597655001202606IND60719955320221118072823.0210401e20210315xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071995532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Yao10aOccurrence and fate of linear alkylbenzenes and their potential as environmental molecular markers in highly urbanized river systems  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aRapid industrialization, urbanization, and population growth have led to the common occurrence of black-stinking urban rivers. Assessing regional anthropogenic influences is beneficial to develop effective remediation strategies. This study comprehensively investigated the occurrence and fate of linear alkylbenzenes (LABs) as molecular markers of anthropogenic influences in three media (filtered water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and sediment) in a highly urbanized river (Baihaimian River) in Guangzhou, South China. The concentrations of LABs ranged from 41 to 215 ng/L in the dissolved phase, from 7122 to 46,640 ng/g dry weight in the SPM phase, and from 73 to 3650 ng/g dry weight in surface sediments (0–10 cm depth). The spatial distribution of LABs was probably affected by the surrounding environment, river flux, and sediment properties. No biotransformation of LABs in water samples and a slight biotransformation in sediments were observed. Significant correlations were found between total nitrogen, ammonia nitrogen, and LABs in river water, indicating the same domestic wastewater sources. The positive correlation between total organic carbon (TOC) and LABs in sediments suggested that TOC worked as the controlling factor for the redistribution of LABs and that local sewage discharge was the dominant TOC input. The total mass inventory of LABs in sediment in Baihaimian River was 21 kg. The total mass of LABs released into Baihaimian River was 183 kg per year, among them, 63% was discharged into the adjacent Liuxi River.  aPublisher supplied data 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiotransformation 3aenvironment 3aindustrialization 3ainventories 3amunicipal wastewater 3aparticulates 3apopulation growth 3aremediation 3ariver water 3arivers 3asewage 3atotal nitrogen 3atotal organic carbon 3aurbanization 3aChina 0aLinear alkylbenzenes 0aBlack-stinking river 0aMolecular markers 0aSewage pollution 0aHydrophobic organic contaminants1 aLiu, Liangying1 aLiu, Guoqiang1 aGong, Yanyan0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 15, v. 760 p.143946-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439463Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02182naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100006100139245005700200300001600257500001400273500002000287520101400307592002801321596004701349650001701396650001801413650001601431650001601447650001801463650001501481700005401496700006401550773013601614856007301750852000901823655001201832IND60710602120221120035422.0200912e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071060212DNAL7 a10.1111/ahe.125182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDu Cheyne, Charis1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8675-805214aThe complex TIE between macrophages and angiogenesis  ap. 585-596.  aNAL-light  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aMacrophages are primarily known as phagocytic immune cells, but they also play a role in diverse processes, such as morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration. In this review, we discuss the influence of macrophages on angiogenesis, the process of new blood vessel formation from the pre‐existing vasculature. Macrophages play crucial roles at each step of the angiogenic cascade, starting from new blood vessel sprouting to the remodelling of the vascular plexus and vessel maturation. Macrophages form promising targets for both pro‐ and anti‐angiogenic treatments. However, to target macrophages, we will first need to understand the mechanisms that control the functional plasticity of macrophages during each of the steps of the angiogenic cascade. Here, we review recent insights in this topic. Special attention will be given to the TIE2‐expressing macrophage (TEM), which is a subtype of highly angiogenic macrophages that is able to influence angiogenesis via the angiopoietin–TIE pathway.  aPublisher supplied data  a1S22818NcFonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek 3aangiogenesis 3ablood vessels 3ahomeostasis 3amacrophages 3amorphogenesis 3aplasticity1 aTay, Hanna1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6354-46921 aDe Spiegelaere, Ward1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2097-84390 tAnatomia, histologia, embryologia.g2020 Sept., v. 49, no. 5 p.585-596dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl3895878x0340-20967nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahe.125183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03863naa a2200673 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245016400172300001400336520198100350592002802331650001202359650001402371650001102385650001502396650001102411650001202422650000902434650001902443650001502462650000802477650002202485650001202507650001502519650001202534650001402546650002502560650001302585650001902598650000902617650001302626650002502639650002402664650002202688650001102710650001602721651001802737651001702755653001902772653001202791653001202803653001402815653001802829653001202847653001702859653001702876700002302893700002502916700002002941700001902961773010302980856008503083852000903168655001203177IND60634342620221119231209.0190530e201904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063434262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDezutter, Thibaud10aMismatch between microalgae and herbivorous copepods due to the record sea ice minimum extent of 2012 and the late sea ice break-up of 2013 in the Beaufort Sea  ap. 66-77.  aThe unprecedented pace of warming of the Arctic Ocean affects a wide range of pelagic processes, from primary production to fish recruitment. Sequential sediment traps deployed on oceanographic moorings at the Beaufort Sea shelf break were used to investigate the impact of variations in physical conditions on the phenology of microalgae and herbivorous copepods. Water temperature, salinity, microalgal fluxes, and zooplankton fluxes were monitored over 6 of the 7 annual cycles from September 2009 to September 2016 with a hiatus from September 2013 to August 2014. Satellite-derived sea ice concentration and snow depth were retrieved for the same period. For 5 of the 6 cycles, a consistent interval between the vernal abundance of the Calanus species (C. glacialis and C. hyperboreus), the export of the ice alga Nitzschia frigida, and peak in nauplii abundance and diatom export, reflected a match between microalgae and herbivorous copepods. Drastic changes in water temperatures and ice conditions during the 2012–2013 cycle affected this synchronization. In 2012, the record sea ice minimum extent led to anomalously high upper water temperatures during autumn and winter that led to a shoaling of the vertical distribution of C. hyperboreus females and to the production of their nauplii at shallower depths several weeks before diatom export. Due to several oceanic and atmospheric forcing, the record sea ice minimum extent was followed in 2013 by a rebound in ice cover that delayed snowmelt, sea ice melt, and ice algae export. This delay resulted in a mismatch between C. glacialis females and N. frigida fluxes and in fewer C. glacialis nauplii in June and July 2013. These mismatch events likely had a negative impact on Calanus recruitment and on the subsequent transfer of energy to carnivorous zooplankton and fish. It is crucial to maintain mooring deployments to accurately assess the wide range of effects of climate warming on the marine ecosystems.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCalanus 3aNitzschia 3aautumn 3acarnivores 3aenergy 3afemales 3afish 3aglobal warming 3aherbivores 3aice 3amarine ecosystems 3amelting 3amicroalgae 3anauplii 3aphenology 3aprimary productivity 3asalinity 3asediment traps 3asnow 3asnowmelt 3aspatial distribution 3aspecies recruitment 3awater temperature 3awinter 3azooplankton 3aArctic region 3aBeaufort Sea 0aMatch-mismatch 0aCopepod 0aDiatoms 0aIce algae 0aSediment trap 0aMooring 0aBeaufort Sea 0aArctic Ocean1 aLalande, Catherine1 aDufresne, Christiane1 aDarnis, Gérald1 aFortier, Louis0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Apr., v. 173 p.66-77dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03149naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100003100153245009400184300001600278520176300294592002802057650000802085650001802093650001602111650001902127650002302146650002002169650001402189650001702203650002502220650002102245650001502266650001602281650000902297650001002306651001102316653003102327653001602358653001602374700002802390700002402418700003502442773010602477856008702583852000902670655001202679IND60545521820221117173933.0160902e20140401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054552182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKonstantopoulou, Sophia S.10aIndoor air quality in a bar/restaurant before and after the smoking ban in Athens, Greece  ap. 136-143.  aIn this study we compared indoor air pollutant concentrations in a bar/restaurant in Greece before and after the enactment of a smoking ban legislation of 2008. This was done to investigate whether the separation of the venue into smoking and non-smoking areas will have an impact on workers and customers from secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure (null hypothesis). The study was completed within an 8-month period beginning in March 2010 and ending on November 2010. We compared the average of the measured PM0.1 concentrations in the smoking zones between the pre-ban and post-ban periods. Overall reduction in the number of particles was 18% between pre-ban and post-ban periods. The mean of the 36 total CO2 measurements for the pre- and the post-ban period was 611ppm. We calculated the ventilation rates per occupant (Vo in l/s/occ) and found it to be higher in the post-ban period (19.4l/s/occ), thus complying with the ASHARAE standard for Vo of 15l/s/occ at maximum occupancy, than in the pre-ban period (10.7l/s/occ). The mean of the 36 total CO measurements for the pre-ban period was 2ppm. CO measurements in the post-ban period were less than the detection limit of 1ppm. Emissions of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde weren't detected in any of the zones. It was observed there was about 50% distribution of pollutants from the smoking zones to the smoke-free zones. The smoking ban effect on the occupancy levels was initially reduced by 16%, but based on other similar studies this transition period will be followed by an increase in the occupancy.Passive smoking and associated risks were significantly reduced but not totally eliminated, indicating the need for stronger enforcement or complete partition between smoking and non-smoking areas.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3aair pollution 3aair quality 3acarbon dioxide 3aconsumers (people) 3adetection limit 3aemissions 3aformaldehyde 3alaws and regulations 3anitrogen dioxide 3apollutants 3arestaurants 3arisk 3asmoke 3aGreece 0aSecond hand smoke exposure 0aSmoking ban 0aAir quality1 aBehrakis, Panagiotis K.1 aLazaris, Andreas C.1 aNicolopoulou-Stamati, Polyxeni0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Apr. 01, v. 476-477 p.136-143dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100006200142245007300204300001800277500002000295520166500315592002801980596004902008596008002057596003802137650001202175650001202187650001102199650001502210650001802225650002102243650001102264650001402275650000902289650001302298650001102311650002402322650002202346651001202368700005502380700001902435700001802454700005902472700002102531700001902552700006002571773012602631856007702757852000902834655001202843IND60788041820221118114249.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804182DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0222412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOmidvar, Hamidreza1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8124-726410aRapid Modification of Urban Land Surface Temperature During Rainfall  ap. 4245-4264.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThis paper examines runoff dynamics and heat transfer during rainfall over urban surfaces, in particular pavements. A kinematic wave approach is combined with heat storage and transfer schemes to develop a model for pervious and impervious pavements. The resulting framework is a numerical prognostic model that can simulate the temperature fields in the subsurface and runoff layers to capture the rapid cooling of the surface, as well as the thermal pollution advected in the runoff. Extensive field measurements are conducted over several types of experimental pavements in Arizona to probe the physics and then to validate the model. The experimental data and the model results are in good agreement, and their joint analysis elucidates the physics of the rapid heat transfer from the subsurface to the runoff. A demonstrative application of the model over a (hypothetical) parking lot, with impervious or pervious asphalt, is then presented. It illustrates that the rate of ground surface temperature cooling for the impervious pavement is lower than the pervious one (where infiltration is very effective at removing heat). Finally, the analysis of the energy budgets unravels the relative importance of the various physical mechanisms in transferring heat from the subsurface to the runoff and the atmosphere. This transfer is dominated by terms associated with water flux and subsurface heat extraction, while latent, sensible, and radiative heat fluxes are minor contributors. The findings underline the importance of including rainfall‐induced cooling in geophysical models that seek to study urban heat islands or urban precipitation modification.  aPublisher supplied data  aW911NF‐15‐1‐0003cArmy Research Office  a1444758cU.S. National Science Foundation's Sustainability Research Network  cPrinceton Environmental Institute 3abitumen 3acooling 3aenergy 3ageophysics 3aheat transfer 3amodel validation 3amodels 3apavements 3arain 3aresearch 3arunoff 3asurface temperature 3athermal pollution 3aArizona1 aSong, Jiyun1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9483-05011 aYang, Jiachuan1 aArwatz, Gilad1 aWang, Zhi‐Hua1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9155-86051 aHultmark, Marcus1 aKaloush, Kamil1 aBou‐Zeid, Elie1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6137-81090 tWater resources research.g2018 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.4245-4264dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017WR0222413Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02863naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005600148245018100204300002000385500001900405520151200424592002801936596006501964596006502029650001302094650002102107650001402128650001402142650001302156700001602169700001902185700001502204700001702219700001202236700001202248773012502260856008302385852000902468655001202477IND60700450920221121202235.0200702e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070045092DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04962-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Yanjun1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6175-781410aInsights into the elevated electrochemical performance and kinetic characteristics of magnesium-substituted Na3V2−xMgx(PO4)3/C with superior rate capability and long lifespan  ap. 13141-13156.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aNa₃V₂(PO₄)₃ has been pursued to be a prospective cathode for SIBs because of its outstanding structural stability. Nevertheless, the extensive application of Na₃V₂(PO₄)₃ is impeded by its poor electronic conductivity and inferior Na⁺ migration ability. Herein, a promising Mg-doped Na₃V₂₋ₓMgₓ(PO₄)₃/C composite is prepared by a facile carbon-thermal reduction route. The substitution of magnesium onto vanadium site downsizes the particle, providing shorter pathway for the migration of Na⁺ and electron. The introduction of Mg²⁺ generates beneficial holes to facilitate the electronic diffusion efficiently. A superior electrochemical performance of Na₃V₁.₉₃Mg₀.₀₇(PO₄)₃/C sample can be achieved due to the multiple synergetic effects. It delivers a high specific capacity of 113.5 mAh g⁻¹ at 0.1 C. A high reversible capacity of 95 mAh g⁻¹ can be obtained at 10 C rate, and the retention is 84.6% after 1000 cycles. Moreover, a comprehensive GITT analysis is conducted to give a better understanding of the elevated electrochemical properties for Na₃V₁.₉₃Mg₀.₀₇(PO₄)₃/C: The migration of Na⁺ suffers from the intense interactions arising from the phase transfer during the potential plateau (~ 3.4 V). The minimum values of DNₐ₊ at ~ 3.4 V for Na₃V₁.₉₃Mg₀.₀₇(PO₄)₃/C are one order magnitude higher than that of undoped sample, implying the improved kinetics from magnesium substitution.  aPublisher supplied data  a201901D211217cNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province  a201801D121284cNatural Science Foundation of Shanxi Province 3acathodes 3aelectrochemistry 3alongevity 3amagnesium 3avanadium1 aZheng, Run,1 aWang, Yanzhong1 aWang, Chao1 aHe, Zhenfeng1 aLi, Dan1 aGuo, Li0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 27 p.13141-13156dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04962-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02581naa a2200553 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245006200165300001400227520102000241592002801261650002101289650001501310650001601325650001401341650001001355650002201365650001301387650001401400650001201414650001301426650001401439650004801453653000701501653001301508653001001521653000901531653000801540653001101548653003001559653001301589653004301602653002801645653003601673653004101709700002501750700001701775700001801792700002001810700002201830773007201852856008201924852000902006655001202015IND60552444320221118025410.0161021e20150210xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055244432DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKumar, Ashok10aHuntington's disease: An update of therapeutic strategies  ap. 91-97.  aHuntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant triplet repeat genetic disease, which results in progressive neuronal degeneration in the neostriatum and neocortex, and associated functional impairments in motor, cognitive, and psychiatric domains. Although the genetic mutation caused by abnormal CAG expansion within the htt gene on chromosome 4p16.3 is identified, the mechanism by which this leads to neuronal cell death and the question of why striatal neurones are targeted both remain unknown. Patients manifest a typical phenotype of sporadic, rapid, involuntary control of limb movement, stiffness of limbs, impaired cognition and severe psychiatric disturbances. There have been a number of therapeutic advances in the treatment of HD, such as fetal neural transplantation, RNA interference (RNAi) and transglutaminase inhibitors (Tgasei). Although there is intensive research into HD and recent findings seem promising, effective therapeutic strategies may not be developed until the next few decades.  aPublisher supplied data 3aRNA interference 3acell death 3achromosomes 3acognition 3agenes 3agenetic disorders 3amutation 3aneocortex 3aneurons 3apatients 3aphenotype 3aprotein-glutamine gamma-glutamyltransferase 0aHD 0ahtt gene 0aHDACi 0aRNAi 0aASO 0aTgasei 0aHuntington's disease (HD) 0ahtt gene 0aHistone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) 0aRNA interference (RNAi) 0aAntisense oligonucleotide (ASO) 0aTransglutaminase inhibitors (Tgasei)1 aKumar Singh, Sandeep1 aKumar, Vijay1 aKumar, Dinesh1 aAgarwal, Sarita1 aRana, Manoj Kumar0 tGene.g2015 Feb. 10, v. 556 p.91-97dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0223Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02796naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245011200164300002000276500001900296520153200315592002801847596005901875596006501934650001501999650001702014650002502031650001402056650001902070700001402089700001602103700001502119700005602134700001502190773012502205856008302330852000902413655001202422IND60700451020221121172936.0200702e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070045102DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04958-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Minmin10aFinely modulating the morphology and composition of CuxNi1−x for enhanced microwave absorption capability  ap. 12953-12968.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aSome inevitable disadvantages (being thick and heavy with narrow broadband) restrict the application of Cu-based absorbers in microwave absorption field, which can be overcome by finely modulating the morphology and component of 1D structures. Here, we reported ethylenediamine-steered in situ two-step reduction reactions, which allowed the tunable preparation of CuₓNi₁₋ₓ (x = 0, 0.005, 0.02, 0.0344, 0.0934, 0.1581, 0.2243, and 1) composites with continuously tunable components and morphology varying from smooth rods to urchin-like rods and microspheres. The recombination of Ni with Cu into CuₓNi₁₋ₓ composites can tune crystallite size, inner stress, lattice constant, component, shape as well as properties. The CuₓNi₁₋ₓ (x = 0.0344–0.1581) composites exhibited stronger and wider absorption band under a lower filling mass fraction and thinner sample than other Cu-based absorbers. Due to the combined action of double dielectric relaxation, double magnetic resonances, high attenuation, and good impedance match. The optimal microwave absorption capability (MACs) was achieved for Cu₀.₀₃₄₄Ni₀.₉₆₅₆ microspheres with a maximum RL value of − 67.5 dB at 14.74 GHz and a broad frequency band (99% attenuation) of 15.41 GHz, corresponding to 1.7–10 mm sample thickness. Owing to tunable saturation magnetization and excellent MACs, the CuₓNi₁₋ₓ composites can work as a kind of promising absorber for applications in electronic equipment and devices.  aPublisher supplied data  a51672252cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aLY14B010001cNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province 3aabsorption 3acrystallites 3aelectronic equipment 3amagnetism 3amicroparticles1 aChen, Yue1 aWei, Haiyan1 aKe, Lifeng1 aTong, Guoxiu1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8772-12511 aWu, Wenhua0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 27 p.12953-12968dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04958-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03791naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001400148245017000162300001800332520180900350592002802159596007902187596007902266596006302345650000802408650001802416650001602434650000902450650001302459650001002472650001302482650001602495650001902511650001702530650001102547650001402558650002502572650001102597650002202608650002002630650001602650650001402666700001402680700001802694700001602712700002002728700001902748700001802767700001302785700001602798700001702814700001502831700002002846700001402866700005402880773013902934856008303073852000903156655001203165IND60710602520221120035221.0211021e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071060252DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03632-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZeng, Wei10aIdentification of a genomic region controlling thermotolerance at flowering in maize using a combination of whole genomic re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis  ap. 2797-2810.  aKEY MESSAGE : A novel genomic region controlling thermotolerance at flowering was identified by the combination of whole genomic re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis in maize. The increasing frequency of extreme high temperature has brought a great threat to the development of maize throughout its life cycle, especially during the flowering phase. However, the genetic basis of thermotolerance at flowering in maize remains poorly understood. Here, we characterized a thermotolerant maize ecotype Abe2 and dissected its genetic basis using a F₂:₈ recombinant inbred line (RIL) population generated from a cross between Abe2 and B73. After continuous high temperature stress above 35 °C for 17 days, Abe2 and B73 show distinct leaf scorching phenotype under field conditions. To identify the genomic regions associated with the phenotypic variation, we applied a combination of whole genomic re-sequencing and bulked segregant analysis, and revealed 10,316,744 SNPs and 1,488,302 InDels between the two parental lines, and 2,693,054 SNPs and 313,757 InDels between the two DNA pools generated from the thermos-tolerant and the sensitive individuals of the RIL, of which, 108,655 and 17,853 SNPs may cause nonsynonymous variations. Finally, a 7.41 Mb genomic region on chromosome 1 was identified, and 7 candidate genes were annotated to participate in high temperature-related stress response. A candidate gene Zm00001d033339 encoding a serine/threonine protein kinase was proposed to be the most likely causative gene contributing to the thermotolerance at flowering by involving in stomatal movement (GO: 0010119) via Abscisic acid (ABA) pathway (KO04075). This work could provide an opportunity for gene cloning and pyramiding breeding to improve thermotolerance at flowering in maize.  aPublisher supplied data  a2016YFD0101803cThe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a2017YFD0301301cthe National Key Research and Development Program of China  a31670264cthe National Natural Science Foundation of China 3aDNA 3aabscisic acid 3achromosomes 3acorn 3aecotypes 3agenes 3agenomics 3aheat stress 3aheat tolerance 3ainbred lines 3aleaves 3aphenotype 3aphenotypic variation 3aserine 3astomatal movement 3astress response 3atemperature 3athreonine1 aShi, Jian1 aQiu, Chunhong1 aWang, Yunhe1 aRehman, Shamsur1 aYu, Shuaishuai1 aHuang, Shijie1 aHe, Chen1 aWang, Wanyi1 aChen, Hongyi1 aChen, Chen1 aWang, Chuanhong1 aTao, Zhen1 aLi, Peijin1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1579-75530 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Oct., v. 133, no. 10 p.2797-2810dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03632-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02723naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002400147245011000171300001800281520173500299592002802034650001202062650001702074650001002091650001602101650001002117651001602127651001102143700002502154700001902179700001502198773008202213856008102295852000902376655001202385IND50069242720221121151256.0150208e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006924272DNAL7 a10.1007/s00468-013-0887-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDüthorn, Elisabeth10aInfluence of micro-site conditions on tree-ring climate signals and trends in central and northern Sweden  ap. 1395-1404.  aTree-ring chronologies are important indicators of pre-instrumental, natural climate variability. Some of the longest chronologies are from northern Fennoscandia, where ring width measurement series from living trees are combined with series from sub-fossil trees, preserved in shallow lakes, to form millennial-length records. We here assess the recent ends of such timeseries by comparing climate signals and growth characteristics in central and northern Sweden, of (1) trees growing at lakeshore micro-sites (representing the source of sub-fossil material of supra-long chronologies), with (2) trees collected in dryer micro-sites several meters “inland”. Calibration trials reveal a predominating June–September temperature signal in N-Sweden and a weaker but significant May–September precipitation signal in C-Sweden. At the micro-site level, the temperature signal in N-Sweden is stronger in the lakeshore trees compared to the inland trees, whereas the precipitation signal in C-Sweden remains unchanged among the lakeshore and inland trees. Tree-rings at cambial ages >40 years are also substantially wider in the lakeshore micro-site in C-Sweden, and juvenile rings are more variable (and wider) in the dryer micro-site in N-Sweden (compared to the adjacent micro-sites). By combining the data of the various micro-sites with relict samples spanning the past 1,000 years, we demonstrate that growth rate differences at the micro-site scale can affect the low frequency trends of millennial-length chronologies. For the supra-long chronologies from northern Fennoscandia, that are derived from sub-fossil lake material, it is recommended to combine these data with measurement series from only lakeshore trees.  aPublisher supplied data 3aclimate 3agrowth rings 3alakes 3atemperature 3atrees 3aScandinavia 3aSweden1 aHolzkämper, Steffen1 aTimonen, Mauri1 aEsper, Jan0 tTrees.g2013 Oct., v. 27, no. 5 p.1395-1404dSpringer-Verlagx0931-18907nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-013-0887-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03287naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001400153245014100167300001600308520213000324592002802454650001502482650001502497650001902512650002302531650001802554650001702572650001702589650001402606700001802620700002602638700001602664700001402680700001902694773010202713856008902815852000902904655001202913IND60561580020221118003430.0170119e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056158002DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b021082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYuan, Bin10aPermeability Reduction of Berea Cores Owing to Nanoparticle Adsorption onto the Pore Surface: Mechanistic Modeling and Experimental Work  ap. 795-804.  aThis paper examines an integrated approach to study the permeability alteration resulting from nanofluid flow through porous media. Hydrophilic nanostructure particles (NSPs) are dispersed in the brine stream at 0.05, 0.2, and 0.5 wt % concentrations and injected into several oil-wet Berea sandstones. The pressure drops across the cores and the effluent nanoparticle concentrations are monitored. To quantify the nanoparticle adsorption/detachment and straining behavior and associated effects on formation permeability, analytical mechanistic models are derived using the method of characteristics. The interplay between nanoparticles and rocks is described by the classical particle filtration theory coupled with the maximum adsorption concentration model. All of the necessary parameters, e.g., the maximum adsorption concentrations, reversible or detachment adsorption concentrations, nanoparticle adsorption and straining rates, and corresponding formation damage coefficients, are characterized. The experimental results indicate that nanoparticle adsorption and straining (i.e., the maximum adsorption concentration and nanoparticle adsorption straining rates) are enhanced along with the increase of the nanoparticle injection concentration. As a result, the breakthrough of injected nanoparticles is delayed, the steady-state effluent concentration decreases, and the pressure drop increases more rapidly. The nanoparticle adsorption consists of reversible and irreversible adsorption. During post-flush, the reversible nanoparticle concentrations are enhanced by the increase of nanoparticle concentrations. In practice, this paper contributes to the following applications: (1) Lab experiments are applied to highlight the effects of nanoparticle adsorption, straining, and detachment behaviors on the formation damage. (2) The analytical mechanistic model provides physical insights to quantify nanofluid flow performance and can be extended to optimize the treatment of nanofluid application (e.g., injection concentrations) while considering both the loss of nanoparticles and their induced formation damage.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3afiltration 3ahydrophilicity 3amechanistic models 3ananoparticles 3apermeability 3aporous media 3asandstone1 aWang, Wendong1 aMoghanloo, Rouzbeh G.1 aSu, Yuliang1 aWang, Kai1 aJiang, Miaolun0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.795-804dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b021083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03239naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245009900173500002200272520196500294592002802259650001802287650001302305650002602318650001002344650002202354650001402376650001502390653001802405653001302423653002602436653001302462653001202475653001402487653001302501700006702514700002102581700002902602773009202631856008502723852000902808655001202817IND60634342820221119231241.0190326e20190225xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063434282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchmidt, Christina10aNew insights from the deep: Meiofauna in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench and adjacent abyssal plain  aPre-press version  aCommunity and abundance patterns of meiofauna and Harpacticoida in the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench, that’s trench slope and adjacent abyssal plain lay in the North-Western Pacific were investigated in relation to environmental variables. Overall, Nematoda was the dominant taxon of the meiofauna community (93%), followed by Copepoda (3%). Nineteen harpacticoid families and 1 subfamily were found, whereby the family Ameiridae was most abundant in the study area. Within eight selected (sub)families (Argestidae, Aegisthidae, Ancorabolidae, Canthocamptidae, Cletodidae, Cylindropsyllinae, Parameiropsidae, Zosimeidae) 27 genera were found, with Zosime and Mesocletodes being most abundant. Dispersion effects characterized the meiofauna community abundances, while the Harpacticoida communities in the hadal and abyssal areas of the slope were distinct. The main dissimilarities observed in the two sites were abundances of Nematoda, Ameiridae, Zosime and Mesocletodes. Food availability, sediment composition and water depth are environmental drivers structuring the investigated communities in the abyssal and hadal. For the trench slope, no correlations with the investigated environmental variables were found. Very likely variables other than the investigated ones act as environmental drivers for the trench slope (e.g. topography). Furthermore, a tendency of meiofauna to increase in total abundances was detected with increasing depth in the deeper stations starting at 6000 m. In contrast, total Harpacticoida abundances decrease with depth. Considering the abundance of Harpacticoida families and genera individually, the abundance of some taxa decreased in the trench slope but increased in the hadal (Zosimeidae, Miraciidae, Argestidae, Parameiropsis, Zosime). Diversity indices based on Harpacticoida genus and family level were not distinguishable with the exception of equitability (J) at the genus level (abyssal vs hadal; trench slope vs hadal).  aPublisher supplied data 3aHarpacticoida 3aNematoda 3aenvironmental factors 3afauna 3afood availability 3asediments 3atopography 0aHarpacticoida 0aCopepoda 0aNorth-Western Pacific 0aDeep Sea 0aBenthos 0aAbundance 0aKuramBio1 aSattarova, Valentina V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4716-78901 aKatrynski, Laura1 aMartínez Arbizu, Pedro,0 tProgress in oceanography.g2019 Feb. 25, dElsevier LtdwJournal:11761x0079-66117nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02789naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003200147245022200179300001600401520100000417592002801417650001101445650002201456650002201478650002201500650001801522650002101540650003201561650001201593650001801605650004301623651001101666653000801677653001001685653002201695653000901717653000901726653000901735653001301744653000801757653000901765653000801774653000801782653002201790653001901812653003601831653001701867653001901884700001901903700003101922700005501953773011202008856008202120852000902202655001202211IND60612316320221121184110.0190415e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061231632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 ade Cássia Lemos Lima, Rita10aBrazilian insulin plant as a bifunctional food: Dual high-resolution PTP1B and α-glucosidase inhibition profiling combined with HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR for identification of antidiabetic compounds in Myrcia rubella Cambess  ap. 444-451.  aSix species of Myrcia, commonly known as 'insulin plants' in Brazil, were assessed for their potential as functional foods. Thus, dual high-resolution α-glucosidase/PTP1B inhibition profiling and HPLC-HRMS-SPE-NMR analysis were used to identify the antidiabetic constituents of the crude ethyl acetate extract of M. rubella Cambess. A total of 31 compounds were identified, including seven α-glucosidase inhibitors with IC50 values between 0.6 and 22.4 μM: 4,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid, isoquercitrin, quercetin-3-O-β-d-glucuronide, kaempferol-3-O-(6″-galloyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-(6″-malonyl)-glucopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-(6″-(E)-feruloyl)-β-d-glucopyranoside, and quercetin-3-O-(2″-(E)-sinapoyl)-glucopyranoside as well as three strong PTP1B inhibitors with IC50 values between 0.4 and 3.1 μM: kaempferol-3-O-α-l-rhamnoside, astragalin, and arjunolic acid.

The risks of violence and damage, or significant delays and cancellations in infrastructure development, are rife in these states. Thus, least-cost planning processes must explicitly address the inherent risks. While there are numerous statistical methods for dealing with decision making under uncertainty, few of them have been applied to power system planning and tailored for these situations. We present a general theoretical framing of the issue and illustrate application of a very simple method to a case study of the Republic of South Sudan. We find that, in general, the resilience aspects, combined with modular and incremental benefits of distributed generation technologies and systems, emerge as attractive options if the various risks of infrastructure development are included in modelling techniques.  aPublisher supplied data 3acase studies 3adecision making 3aenergy 3ainfrastructure 3amodels 3aplanning 3arisk 3astatistical analysis 3auncertainty 3aviolence 3aSudan 0aC6 0aO2 0aQ4 0aFragile and conflict states 0aEnergy planning 0aPower systems1 aCaṭṭopādhyāẏa, Debabrata,0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2016 June, v. 32 p.110-120dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2016.02.0113Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02601naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100005400148245011200202300002000314500001900334520132900353592002801682596005901710596005901769650001101828650001301839650001301852650001501865650002101880650001901901650003801920700001701958700001801975700001701993773012502010856008302135852000902218655001202227IND60700451120221121172927.0200702e202009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070045112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10853-020-04939-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Xiao1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7675-851812aA novel fabrication technique of toughened TiC-based solid solution cermets using mechanochemical synthesis  ap. 12776-12788.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aCeramic–metal composite powders (Ti,M)C-Ni (M = Mo, W and Ta) were prepared from elemental powders using a one-step mechanochemical synthesis method through high-energy ball milling. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the resulting cermets were also investigated. The analytical results revealed that ball milling of Ti-M-C-Ni elemental powders triggered a combustion reaction between Ti and C. The reaction resembled a fast sintering process which facilitated alloy elements atoms dissolve into the newly formed TiC, synthesizing the (Ti,M)C-Ni composite powders. The microstructure of the sintered (Ti,M)C-Ni cermets consisted of the core-rim structure grains and homogenous grains. High-resolution transmission electron microscope analysis results revealed that there was a misorientation between the ceramic phase and the binder phase in the cermets, but the interface between the core and the rim was coherent. The cermets exhibited mechanical properties that were comparable to conventionally produced cermets, particularly in fracture toughness which was as high as 12.45 MPa m¹/². The excellent cohesion between the Ni binder and the (Ti,M)C solid solution and the reduction in the interfacial stress in ceramic grains were believed to be responsible for the enhanced toughening of the cermets.  aPublisher supplied data  a51905194cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2017M612447cPostdoctoral Research Foundation of China 3aalloys 3aceramics 3acohesion 3acombustion 3amechanochemistry 3amicrostructure 3atransmission electron microscopes1 aYao, Zhenhua1 aXiong, Weihao1 aXu, Jianfeng0 tJournal of materials science.g2020 Sept., v. 55, no. 27 p.12776-12788dSpringer USwJournal:jnl4392857x0022-24617nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10853-020-04939-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01491naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002400187245009700211300001800308506007600326520023700402592002800639506003700667650002700704650003500731650001600766650001100782650002500793650002100818700002000839700002000859700002200879773012700901856008001028852000901108655001201117IND60117655020221207101836.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011765502DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00384-132doi7 aPMC37075992pmcid7 a237885502pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGrüning, Björn A.10aDraft Genome Sequence of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Strain Tü57, Producer of Avilamycin  ap. e00384-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHere we present the draft genome sequence of Streptomyces viridochromogenes Tü57.

Photocatalysis has shown much promise in the disinfection of water/wastewater, because photocatalysis does not produce toxic by-products, and is driven by green solar energy. There are however several drawbacks that are curbing the prevalence of photocatalytic disinfection applications: one, the efficiency of photocatalysts may limit popular utilization; two, the water characteristics may present some challenges to the process. TiO₂-based photocatalysts may be readily improved if composited with noble metals or carbon nanomaterials. Noble metals give TiO₂-based composites a higher affinity for dissolved oxygen, and induce plasmonic and Schottky effects in the TiO₂; carbon nanomaterials with a tunable structure, on the other hand, give the composites an improved charge carrier separation performance. Other than photocatalyst materials, the characteristics of water/wastewater is another crucial factor in the photocatalysis process. Also examined in this review are the crucial impacts that water characteristics have on photocatalysts and their interaction with bacteria. Accordingly, strategies to address the challenge of water characteristics on photocatalytic disinfection are explored: one, to modify the semiconductor conduction band to generate long-lifetime reactive species; two, to improve the interaction between bacteria and photocatalysts.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3adisinfection 3adissolved oxygen 3aenvironment 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3asemiconductors 3asolar energy 3atoxicity 3awastewater 0aCarbon nanomaterial 0aNoble metal 0aPhotocatalytic disinfection 0aStrategic solution 0aTiO2 0aWater characteristic1 aKumar, Ashutosh1 aKhan, Musharib1 aLo, Irene M.C.0 tScience of the total environment.g2021 Mar. 01, v. 758 p.143953-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.1439533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01719naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002200187245015400209300001800363506007600381520031200457592002800769506003700797650002600834650002700860650001100887650001100898650002500909650001400934651001100948700002300959700001800982700002101000700001701021700002301038700002001061773012701081856008001208852000901288655001201297IND60117655120221207101842.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011765512DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00387-132doi7 aPMC36954262pmcid7 a238140302pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMcDonald, Ryan R.10aDraft Genome Sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes Strain 06BA18369, a Human Pathogen Associated with Skin and Soft Tissue Infections in Northern Canada  ap. e00387-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe report the draft sequence of Streptococcus pyogenes 06BA18369 (emm type 41.2, sequence type 579 [ST579]), isolated from a skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) mixed with Staphylococcus aureus.

At 5 mg/mL, Cgh from L. mutabilis inhibited dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity (DPP-IV) (100%), and increased (p < 0.05) 6.5-fold the glucose uptake in a dual-layered enterocyte/adipocyte culture system compared to untreated cells, through an enhancement of glucose transporter type-4 translocation. In this model, insulin-induced glucose uptake was potentiated by addition of L. mutabilis hydrolysates. Also, Cgh L. mutabilis hydrolysates decreased (p < 0.05) by 50% gluconeogenesis in a dual-layered enterocyte/hepatocyte system and reduced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression. These data showed that L. mutabilis hydrolysates can affect glucose metabolism inhibiting DPP-IV enzymatic activity, improving insulin receptor sensitivity and inhibiting hepatic gluconeogenesis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLupinus mutabilis 3aadipocytes 3adipeptidyl-peptidase IV 3aenzyme activity 3agluconeogenesis 3aglucose 3aglucose transporters 3ahydrolysates 3ahydrolysis 3ainsulin receptors 3alegumes 3amechanism of action 3amodels 3apeptides 3aAndes region 0aCg 0aCgh 0aSCgh 0aSGDh 0aGamma-conglutin 0aLupinus mutabilis Sweet 0aDiabetes 0aGlucose uptake 0aGlucose production1 aLuna-Vital, Diego A.1 aFornasini, Marco1 aBaldeón, Manuel E.1 aGonzalez de Mejia, Elvira0 tJournal of functional foods.g2018 June, v. 45 p.339-347dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0213Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03845naa a2200589 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002300153245018500176300001400361520199700375592002802372650002202400650002102422650001902443650001502462650001002477650001102487650002902498650002502527650001702552650001902569650002902588650001302617650002602630650001302656650001902669650001402688650002402702650001702726650002702743650002402770650001002794650001502804650001702819651001002836653000802846653001502854653001002869653001402879653001302893700006002906700006002966700001703026773010403043856008703147852000903234655001203243IND60545522120221117174002.0160902e20140301xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054552212DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1332doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGirgenti, Vincenzo10aFrom “farm to fork” strawberry system: Current realities and potential innovative scenarios from life cycle assessment of non-renewable energy use and green house gas emissions  ap. 48-53.  aIn this study, we analysed the environmental profile of the strawberry industry in Northern Italy. The analysis was conducted using two scenarios as reference systems: strawberry crops grown in unheated plastic tunnels using currently existing cultivation techniques, post-harvest management practices and consumption patterns (scenario 1) and the same strawberry cultivation chain in which some of the materials used were replaced with bio-based materials (scenario 2). In numerous studies, biodegradable polymers have been shown to be environmentally friendly, thus potentially reducing environmental impacts. These materials can be recycled into carbon dioxide and water through composting. Many materials, such as Mater-BI® and PLA®, are also derived from renewable resources. The methodology chosen for the environmental analysis was a life cycle assessment (LCA) based on a consequential approach developed to assess a product's overall environmental impact from the production system to its usage and disposal. In the field stage, a traditional mulching film (non-biodegradable) could be replaced with a biodegradable product. This change would result in waste production of 0kg/ha for the bio-based product compared to 260kg/ha of waste for polyethylene (PE). In the post-harvest stage, the issue addressed was the use and disposal of packaging materials. The innovative scenario evaluated herein pertains to the use of new packaging materials that increase the shelf life of strawberries, thereby decreasing product losses while increasing waste management efficiency at the level of a distribution platform and/or sales outlet. In the event of product deterioration or non-sale of the product, the packaging and its contents could be collected together as organic waste without any additional processes because the packaging is compostable according to EN13432. Scenario 2 would achieve reductions of 20% in the global warming potential and non-renewable energy impact categories.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiobased products 3abiodegradability 3acarbon dioxide 3acomposting 3acrops 3aenergy 3aenvironmental assessment 3aenvironmental impact 3afarm to fork 3aglobal warming 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3aindustry 3alife cycle assessment 3amulching 3aorganic wastes 3apackaging 3apackaging materials 3apolyethylene 3apostharvest technology 3arenewable resources 3asales 3ashelf life 3astrawberries 3aItaly 0aLCA 0aStrawberry 0aWaste 0aPackaging 0aMulching1 aPeano, Cristiana1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8860-01391 aBaudino, Claudio1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7224-08421 aTecco, Nadia0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Mar. 01, v. 473-474 p.48-53dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1333Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03092naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001200148245014600160300001800306520159200324592002801916596001901944650001901963650001801982650001702000650001502017650001402032650002702046650001602073650001402089650001602103650001802119650001402137650001602151650001802167650002002185650001402205650001802219700001602237700001402253700001502267700001602282700001402298700005502312773013902367856008302506852000902589655001202598IND60710602820221120035409.0211021e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6071060282DNAL7 a10.1007/s00122-020-03636-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhu, Le10aEffect of germination potential on storage lipids and transcriptome changes in premature developing seeds of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.)  ap. 2839-2852.  aKEY MESSAGE : We provided a gene pool of moderate size for selecting or manipulating the candidate genes that favour the acquisition of seed dormancy, shedding light on the elevation of seed oil content in oilseed rape by blocking lipid degradation in developing seeds. In oilseed rape, the association between the germination potential of premature seeds and the final level of seed lipids, and the underlying mechanism, is elusive. Here, we investigated phenotypic differences in the germination percentage of premature seeds in a collection of oilseed rape cultivars. We compared the dynamic lipid accumulation between the deep-, moderate- and non-dormant genotypes and compared the transcriptomes of the seeds at 40 days after pollination between multiple pairs of deep- and non-dormant genotypes. We identified a wide range of differences in germination percentage of premature seeds and the association between the germination potential and the change of fatty acid content at late stage of seed maturation. The comparisons of transcriptomes between deep- and non-dormant seeds revealed the genetic basis for the dormant difference, e.g. the different expression levels of the genes involved in gibberellic and abscisic acid biosynthesis and/or signalling, fatty acid metabolic pathways, and the structure of seed cell wall. We provided a gene pool of moderate size for selecting or manipulating the candidate genes that favour the acquisition of seed dormancy, shedding light on the elevation of seed oil content in oilseed rape by blocking lipid degradation in developing seeds.  aPublisher supplied data  a31671597cNSFC 3aBrassica napus 3aabscisic acid 3abiosynthesis 3acell walls 3acultivars 3afatty acid composition 3afatty acids 3agene pool 3agermination 3alipid content 3aphenotype 3apollination 3aseed dormancy 3aseed maturation 3aseed oils 3atranscriptome1 aZhao, Xinze1 aXu, Ying,1 aWang, Qian1 aWang, Haoyi1 aWu, Dezhi1 aJiang, Lixi1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8579-07630 tTheoretical and applied genetics.g2020 Oct., v. 133, no. 10 p.2839-2852dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:jnl2874x0040-57527nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00122-020-03636-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04046naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094024003000121040001800151100002400169245014300193300001600336500002000352520250800372592002802880650001802908650002102926650002202947650001102969650002302980650003003003650001903033650000903052650001203061650001203073650001503085650002103100650001103121650001103132650001603143650001503159650001003174650001703184650001003201650001303211651003103224700002703255700001803282773012103300856007303421961001303494852000903507655001203516IND60571265920221118234656.0170712e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057126592DNAL7 a10.1111/eea.125732doi7 a10.1111/eea.125732chorus  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWheeler, Gregory S.10aQuarantine host range of Bikasha collaris, a potential biological control agent of Chinese tallowtree (Triadica sebifera) in North America  ap. 184-196.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aChinese tallowtree, Triadica sebifera (L.) Small (Euphorbiaceae), is one of the worst invasive weeds of the southeastern USA impacting coastal wetlands, forests, and natural areas. Traditional mechanical and chemical controls have been unable to limit the spread, and this invasive species continues to expand its range. A proposed biological control candidate, the flea beetle Bikasha collaris (Baly) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), shows high specificity for the target weed Chinese tallowtree. Results from a series of no‐choice and choice feeding tests of B. collaris adults and larvae indicated that this flea beetle was highly specific to Chinese tallowtree. The larvae of B. collaris feed by tunneling in the roots, whereas the adults feed on the leaves of Chinese tallowtree. A total of 77 plant taxa, primarily from members of the tallow plant family Euphorbiaceae, were tested in numerous test designs. Larval no‐choice tests indicated that larvae completed development only on two of the non‐target taxa. Of 80 B. collaris larvae fed roots of Hippomane mancinella L. and 50 larvae fed roots of Ricinus communis L., two and three larvae completed development, respectively. The emerging adults of these five larvae died within 3 days without reproducing. Larval choice tests also indicated little use of these non‐target taxa. Adult no‐choice tests indicated little leaf damage by B. collaris on the non‐targets except for Ditrysinia fruticosa (Bartram) Govaerts & Frodin and Gymnanthes lucida Sw. When given a choice, however, B. collaris adults consumed much less of the non‐targets D. fruticosa (7.4%) and G. lucida (6.1%) compared with the control leaves. Finally, no‐choice oviposition tests indicated that no eggs were produced when adults were fed all non‐target taxa, except those fed G. lucida. These B. collaris adults fed G. lucida leaves produced an average of 4.6 eggs compared with 115.0 eggs per female when fed Chinese tallowtree. The eggs produced from adults fed G. lucida were either inviable or the emerging larvae died within 1 day. These results indicate that the flea beetle B. collaris was unable to complete its life cycle on any of the non‐target taxa tested. If approved for field release, B. collaris will be the first biological control agent deployed against Chinese tallowtree in the USA. This flea beetle may play an important role in suppressing Chinese tallowtree and contribute to the integrated control of this invasive weed.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChrysomelidae 3aRicinus communis 3aTriadica sebifera 3aadults 3abiological control 3abiological control agents 3achoice feeding 3aeggs 3afemales 3aforests 3ahost range 3ainvasive species 3alarvae 3aleaves 3aoviposition 3aquarantine 3aroots 3aweed control 3aweeds 3awetlands 3aSoutheastern United States1 aSteininger, M.

Cultivar GA 10 showed higher, IGP 76 and No. 71 moderate, and IGPN 2004 least reduction in percent seed germination given PEG stress treatments (0, 10 and 20%). A similar pattern was observed for decreased growth and water content of the seedlings and plants of the cultivars exposed to both kinds of water-deficit stresses. The productivity (number of capitula per plant, number of seeds per capitula and 1,000-seed weight) and total chlorophyll content of cultivar IGPN 2004 was significantly higher in comparison to other cultivars given different FC% treatments (100, 80 and 60%). Significantly higher accumulation of proline, glycine betaine and total soluble sugars and lower damage to membrane lipids under increased water-deficit stress (i.e., at 80 and 60% FC) conditions in cultivar IGPN 2004 suggested its more tolerance capacity to water-deficit stress in comparison to other cultivars. Besides, antioxidant enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and guaiacol peroxidase) partially demonstrated variations in the tolerance of the cultivars to water-deficit stress. The results suggest that cultivar IGPN 2004 could be considered as more tolerant, and IGP 76 and No. 71 as moderately tolerant, whereas GA 10 was more sensitive to water-deficit stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGuizotia abyssinica 3aascorbate peroxidase 3abetaine 3acatalase 3achlorophyll 3acultivars 3adrought 3aenzyme activity 3afield capacity 3alipids 3aperoxidase 3aseed germination 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3asugars 3asuperoxide dismutase 3awater content1 aLokhande, V.

On the other hand, they play different roles in the provision of Ecosystem Services (ES). Therefore, identifying and understanding the relationships between species and humans, and the delivery of ES is crucial for sustainable management of the environment. The objectives of this study were to identify ecological functions of birds and mammals and its conflicts with human activities reported by previous articles in the Pampas region; and to link these ecological functions as indicators of the potential ES provided by these species. We performed two systematic and structured searches of articles using Scopus bibliographic database, one for the ecological functions and the second one for conflicts. From the first search, we found 145 studies and 34% of them reported ecological functions, 78% were about birds and the rest about mammals. The Regulation and Maintenance ES were the most reported type and involved the provision of nutrients and pest control, with birds of prey and carnivorous mammals as the most mentioned groups. Provisioning ES were related to the provision of leather from legal hunting and genetic material, and Cultural ES were associated to species conservation. From the conflict search, we found 23 studies that mentioned negative interactions in the Pampas region, mostly with birds and associated to agricultural production damages. Many species mentioned as important ES providers, are also involved in conflicts, causing some discomfort to people. Therefore, the integration of wildlife, with its benefits and damages, could be a powerful argument to achieve the coexistence of wildlife into a landscape shaped by anthropogenic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagroecosystems 3acarnivores 3adatabases 3ahumans 3alandscapes 3aleather 3apeople 3apest control 3awildlife 3aArgentina 0aBenefits 0aConflicts 0aHuman-wildlife coexistence 0aBirds 0aMammals1 aBernad, Lucía1 aPedrana, Julieta0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106576-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1065763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01953naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245006300164300001600227520085500243592002801098650001101126650001301137650001401150650001101164651001201175653003201187653001201219653001501231653001801246653001401264700001801278700002101296700002301317773014801340856008201488852000901570655001201579IND60607389520221121191457.0180904e201604  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6060738952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.esd.2016.01.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEzeoha, Abel10aRelevance lost? The Petroleum Equalization Fund in Nigeria  ap. 152-162.  aThis paper traces the origins of the Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF) in Nigeria and describes the environment in which it has operated. The paper argues that the PEF has failed to live up to its mandate of equalizing the prices of petroleum products across the country. This is in part because such equalization schemes create arbitrage opportunities which are always prone to exploitation. The rentier nature of the Nigerian state and the prevalence of corruption in the country have added fodder to such exploitations. The consequence of the above is that PEF has simply become one of the inefficient channels of subsidizing the price of petroleum products in Nigeria. This paper therefore recommends that the starting point in the efforts by the Nigerian government to undertake petrol subsidy reform in the country should be to abolish the PEF.  aPublisher supplied data 3aforage 3agasoline 3apetroleum 3aprices 3aNigeria 0aPetroleum Equalization Fund 0aNigeria 0aCorruption 0aRentier State 0aArbitrage1 aIgwe, Anthony1 aOnyeke, Chibueze1 aUche, Chibuike U.,0 tEnergy for sustainable development.g2016 Apr., v. 31 p.152-162dElsevier Inc.aInternational Energy InitiativewJournal:12424x0973-08267nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.esd.2016.01.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02830naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245013200164300001600296520118500312592002801497650003401525650002001559650002501579650002301604650002501627650001701652650002201669650002101691650001501712650001701727650002101744650003101765650002701796653002301823653002601846653002501872653002901897653002901926700002101955700001601976700002001992700001602012700001802028700001802046700001802064700001502082773011202097856008202209852000902291655001202300IND60612316820221121063758.0190415e201806  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061231682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xue-Gui10aBioactive constituents from Medicago sativa L. with antioxidant, neuroprotective and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities  ap. 371-380.  aMedicago sativa L. is an important source of functional foods and supplements, which can improve human health. The present work was carried out to search for potential antioxidants from M. sativa to treat neurodegeneration. Four new isoflavane glycosides (1–4) were isolated from M. sativa, along with seven known compounds (5–11). Their structures including absolute configurations were elucidated by multi-spectroscopic data analyses, chemical methods, and quantum chemical ECD calculations. The compounds (1–11) were tested for their antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) and Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. All the isolated compounds displayed different degrees of antioxidant effects. Meanwhile, some isolates also possessed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activities. A possible mechanism of interaction between the active compounds and AChE was also investigated by molecular docking studies. Furthermore, compounds (1–6 and 10–11) exhibited potent neuroprotective effects against H2O2-induced cellular damage in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aMedicago sativa 3aacetylcholinesterase 3aactive ingredients 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aenzyme inhibition 3afunctional foods 3aglycosides 3ahuman health 3amolecular models 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneuroprotective effect 0aMedicago sativa L. 0aIsoflavane glycosides 0aAntioxidant activity 0aAChE inhibitory activity 0aNeuroprotective activity1 aHuang, Ming-Yuan1 aGao, Pin-Yi1 aLiu, Chang-Feng1 aSun, Yu-Qiu1 aLv, Meng-Chao1 aYao, Guo-Dong1 aZhang, Li-Xin1 aLi, Dan-Qi0 tJournal of functional foods.g2018 June, v. 45 p.371-380dElsevier LtdwJournal:J000000142x1756-46467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2018.04.0253Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03191naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245014700165300001600312520162100328592002801949650003701977650001602014650002402030650001402054650001702068650002602085650002002111650001202131650002202143650002302165650001002188650003102198650001402229650002202243650002202265650001002287650002002297700002102317700001902338700001602357700002102373700002102394700003002415700002302445700001902468773009602487856008102583852000902664655001202673IND60520727720221118000502.0160522e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052072772DNAL7 a10.1007/s13225-015-0341-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoppe, Björn10aLinking molecular deadwood-inhabiting fungal diversity and community dynamics to ecosystem functions and processes in Central European forests  ap. 367-379.  aFungi play vital roles in the decomposition of deadwood due to their secretion of various enzymes that break down plant cell-wall complexes. The compositions of wood-inhabiting fungal (WIF) communities change over the course of the decomposition process as the remaining mass of wood decreases and both abiotic and biotic conditions of the wood significantly change. It is currently not resolved which substrate-related factors govern these changes in WIF communities and whether such changes influence the deadwood decomposition rate. Here we report a study on fungal richness and community structure in deadwood of Norway spruce and European beech in temperate forest ecosystems using 454 pyrosequencing. Our aims were to disentangle the factors that correspond to WIF community composition and to investigate the links between fungal richness, taxonomically-resolved fungal identity, and microbial-mediated ecosystem functions and processes by analyzing physico-chemical wood properties, lignin-modifying enzyme activities and wood decomposition rates. Unlike fungal richness, we found significant differences in community structure between deadwood of different tree species. The composition of WIF communities was related to the physico-chemical properties of the deadwood substrates. Decomposition rates and the activities of lignin-modifying enzymes were controlled by the succession of the fungal communities and competition scenarios rather than fungal OTU richness. Our results provide further insights into links between fungal community structure and microbial-mediated ecosystem functions and processes.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFagus sylvatica subsp. sylvatica 3aPicea abies 3acommunity structure 3adead wood 3adecayed wood 3aecological succession 3aenzyme activity 3aenzymes 3aforest ecosystems 3afungal communities 3afungi 3aphysicochemical properties 3asecretion 3asequence analysis 3atemperate forests 3atrees 3awood properties1 aPurahong, Witoon1 aWubet, Tesfaye1 aKahl, Tiemo1 aBauhus, Jürgen,1 aArnstadt, Tobias1 aHofrichter, M.q(Martin),1 aBuscot, François,1 aKrüger, Dirk,0 tFungal diversity.g2016 Mar., v. 77, no. 1 p.367-379dSpringer Netherlandsx1560-27457nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-015-0341-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03474naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245012800169300001600297520197800313592002802291650001802319650002802337650001302365650002102378650001502399650002702414650001802441650001402459650001002473650001202483650001402495650001202509653000702521653000902528653000802537653000802545653000802553653000902561653000802570653002502578653003802603653001102641653002302652653002802675700002002703700002402723700002002747773007402767856008202841852000902923655001202932IND60552444820221118025302.0161021e20150125xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055244482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0282doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMorita, Shinichi10aAnalysis of spatiotemporal expression and function of the single-minded homolog in the branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna  ap. 335-345.  aIn insect Drosophila melanogaster, ventral midline cells are crucial to formation of the central nervous system (CNS) and have roles in the specification of ectodermal neuroblasts. Notably, midline cells also have more recently recognized roles in the formation of the higher crustacean Parhyale dorso-ventral axis. The single-minded is a master regulator of ventral midline cells and is required for these functions. Recently sim expression patterns have been reported in various arthropods. These results suggest that the midline precursors evolved from ventral neuroectoderm of common ancestor Mandibulata. However, sim function has been only analyzed in few organisms. To investigate whether these functions of sim, the gene encoding Single-minded, are conserved among insects and crustaceans, we examined the embryonic expression pattern of a lower crustacean Daphnia sim homolog (dma sim) and analyzed the function of dma sim during embryonic development. The Dma Sim protein was expressed in the ventral neuroectoderm (like in onychophoran and chelicerate) and midline (like in mandibulatan). In addition to this conserved ventral neuroectoderm and midline expression, Dma Sim was expressed outside the ventral midline; it was expressed in maxilla 2, presumptive shell glands, and other tissues. To investigate dma sim function, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit dma sim in Daphnia embryos. Embryos subjected to dma sim RNAi exhibited improper axon tract formation and abnormal limb and ventral development. Furthermore, RNAi-mediated knockdown of dma slit, a putative Dma Sim target gene, resulted in similar embryonic phenotypes. These results indicated that dma sim might be required for proper dma slit-mediated ventral development in addition to being required for a conserved role in the ventral midline. Our findings indicated that sim homologs might have provided different developmental functions to ventral midline cells during metazoan evolution.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDaphnia magna 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aParhyale 3aRNA interference 3aarthropods 3acentral nervous system 3aembryogenesis 3aevolution 3agenes 3ainsects 3aphenotype 3atissues 0abp 0acDNA 0aPCR 0aORF 0aDIG 0aFITC 0aNHS 0aVentral midline cell 0aVentral neuroectoderm development 0aNeuron 0aExpression pattern 0aRNA interference (RNAi)1 aShiga, Yasuhiro1 aTokishita, Shinichi1 aOhta, Toshihiro0 tGene.g2015 Jan. 25, v. 555 p.335-345dElsevier B.V.x0378-11197nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2014.11.0283Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03361naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005600142245013300198300001800331500002000349520186800369592002802237596003802265596004702303596004702350650004102397650001902438650002302457650001502480650001202495650001502507650001302522650001502535650001502550650001602565650001602581650001502597650001202612700006202624700001702686773012602703856007702829852000902906655001202915IND60788042520221118114956.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804252DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0211472doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRajib, Adnan1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2302-142110aRationale and Efficacy of Assimilating Remotely Sensed Potential Evapotranspiration for Reduced Uncertainty of Hydrologic Models  ap. 4615-4637.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe objective of this study is to systematically attribute sources of evapotranspiration uncertainty in a hydrologic model and accordingly propose a remote sensing‐based solution. Using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for three U.S. watersheds, representing different geophysical settings, this study first addresses the effects of parameter equifinality, energy‐related weather input uncertainty, and limited process representation on evapotranspiration simulation. Remotely sensed 8‐day total actual evapotranspiration (AET) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used as a reference to evaluate the model outcome. Results indicate the likelihood of a pseudo‐accurate model showing high streamflow prediction skill despite severely erroneous spatiotemporal dynamics of AET. As a remedial measure, a hybrid daily potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimate, derived from MODIS, is directly ingested at each hydrologic response unit of the model to create a new configuration called SWAT‐PET. A key contribution is the modified SWAT source code that integrates the model (i.e., SWAT‐PET) with an automatic remote sensing data processor. The underlying notion is that remotely sensed PET works as a surrogate of actual vegetation dynamics, biophysical processes, and energy balance, without overruling the model's built‐in soil moisture accounting. Noticeably, increased accuracy of soil moisture, AET, and streamflow in SWAT‐PET, compared to independent sources of observations/reference estimates (i.e., field sensor, satellite, and gauge stations), approves the efficacy of the proposed approach toward improved physical consistency of hydrologic modeling. While the idea is tested for a past period, the ultimate goal is to improve near‐real‐time hydrologic forecasting once such PET estimates become available.  aPublisher supplied data  cNational Science Foundation (NSF)  aOCI‐1148090cNational Science Foundation  aOCI‐1041379cNational Science Foundation 3aSoil and Water Assessment Tool model 3aenergy balance 3aevapotranspiration 3ageophysics 3ahybrids 3aprediction 3aresearch 3asatellites 3asoil water 3astream flow 3auncertainty 3avegetation 3aweather1 aMerwade, Venkatesh1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5518-28901 aYu, Zhiqiang0 tWater resources research.g2018 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.4615-4637dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2017WR0211473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094024002200124024001900146040001800165100002600183245009200209506007600301520115700377592002801534506003701562650001101599650001801610650001601628650001101644650001901655650002401674650002301698650001601721650001201737650002101749700002401770773011801794856007601912852000901988655001201997IND60654570320221207074249.0190725e20190719xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065457032DNAL7 a10.3390/foods80702672doi7 aPMC66784282pmcid7 a313310212pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRomán Masedo, Laura,10aStructural Basis of Resistant Starch (RS) in Bread: Natural and Commercial Alternatives  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBread is categorized as having a high amount of rapidly digested starch that may result in a rapid increase in postprandial blood glucose and, therefore, poor health outcomes. This is mostly the result of the complete gelatinization that starch undergoes during baking. The inclusion of resistant starch (RS) ingredients in bread formulas is gaining prominence, especially with the current positive health outcomes attributed to RS and the apparition of novel RS ingredients in the market. However, many RS ingredients contain RS structures that do not resist baking and, therefore, are not suitable to result in a meaningful RS increase in the final product. In this review, the structural factors for the resistance to digestion and hydrothermal processing of RS ingredients are reviewed, and the definition of each RS subtype is expanded to account for novel non-digestible structures recently reported. Moreover, the current in vitro digestion methods used to measure RS content are critically discussed with a view of highlighting the importance of having a harmonized method to determine the optimum RS type and inclusion levels for bread-making.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abaking 3ablood glucose 3abreadmaking 3abreads 3agelatinization 3ahot water treatment 3ain vitro digestion 3aingredients 3amarkets 3aresistant starch1 aMartinez, Mario  M.0 tFoods.g2019 July 19, v. 8, no. 7dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:21651x2304-81587nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods80702673Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03301naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001300153245009300166300001800259520164400277592002801921650001101949650001601960650001501976650001201991651001102003651001202014653000802026653001002034653000902044653000702053653000802060653000902068653000702077653000902084653003702093653000902130653000802139653000802147653000702155653000802162653001802170653002202188653002402210653002502234700001102259700005902270700005802329700002102387700001502408700001402423700001802437700001702455700001502472773010402487856008702591852000902678655001202687IND60545522620221117173935.0160902e20140215xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054552262DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1382doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZuo, Fei10aTemporal and spatial variability of traffic-related noise in the City of Toronto, Canada  ap. 1100-1107.  aThe majority of studies that assessed population-level exposure to traffic-related noise were conducted in European countries and less is known about the exposure to traffic noise in North America, particularly in Canadian cities. This study explored the temporal and spatial variability of traffic noise in the City of Toronto, the largest city in Canada. We conducted two cycles of intensive field measurement campaign to collect real-time measurements of traffic noise at 554 locations across Toronto between June 2012 and January 2013. At each site, we collected measurements for a period of 30min during daytime. Repeated measurements were made in cycle two at 62 locations randomly selected from cycle one, which exhibited high correlation (Pearson's correlation coefficient (r): 0.79). In addition, continuous measurements of noise were recorded for seven days at ten sites. We observed that noise variability was predominantly spatial in nature, rather than temporal: spatial variability accounted for 60% of the total observed variations in traffic noise. Traffic volume, length of arterial road, and industrial area were three most important variables, explaining the majority of the spatial variability of noise (R2=0.68 to 0.74, depending on the cycle). In comparison to the 16-h equivalent sound level guideline for outdoor locations set out by the Ministry of the Environment of the Province of Ontario, 80% of our sampled locations exceeded this guideline (i.e. 55 dBA,16h). These findings suggested ubiquitous traffic noise exposure across Toronto and that noise variability was explained mostly by spatial characteristics.  aPublisher supplied data 3acities 3acorrelation 3aguidelines 3atraffic 3aEurope 3aOntario 0aAIC 0aANOVA 0aCCHS 0aCI 0adBA 0aDMTI 0aEU 0aINLA 0aLeq (T), Leq 16h, Leq 8h, Leq 1h 0aMCMC 0aMOE 0aSLM 0aUS 0aWHO 0aTraffic noise 0aField measurement 0aSpatial variability 0aTemporal variability1 aLi, Ye1 aJohnson, Steven1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4344-89831 aJohnson, James1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7818-29571 aVarughese, Sunil1 aCopes, Ray1 aLiu, Fuan1 aWu, Hao Jiang1 aHou, Rebecca1 aChen, Hong0 tScience of the total environment.g2014 Feb. 15, v. 472 p.1100-1107dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2013.11.1383Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03338naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245010400166520174700270592002802017650001602045650001202061650001402073650002302087650002302110650001102133650001502144650001402159650001202173650001702185650002102202650001402223650000902237650001402246650001602260650001102276651001002287653000802297653000802305653004002313653001102353653002202364653005002386700001902436700001602455700001602471700001602487700001602503700001602519700001302535700001102548773010702559856008502666852000902751655001202760IND60686537520221119131947.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068653752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1142802doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHe, Liqiang10aOn-road emission measurements of reactive nitrogen compounds from heavy-duty diesel trucks in China  aEmissions of major reactive nitrogen compounds, including nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and ammonia (NH₃), from heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) place substantial pressure on air quality for many large cities in China. To control nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions from HDDVs, selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems have been widely used since the China IV standards. To investigate the impacts of aftertreatment technologies and driving conditions on real-world emissions of reactive nitrogen compounds, a portable emissions measurement system was employed to test eighteen heavy-duty diesel trucks in China. The results showed that the China IV and China V HDDVs with appropriate SCR functionality could reduce NOX emissions by 36% and 53%, respectively, compared to the China III results, although their real-world emissions were still higher than the corresponding emission limits for regulatory engine tests. For these HDDVs, five samples were tested with NH₃ emissions, ranging from 1.67 ppm to 51.49 ppm. The NH₃ emission rates tended to significantly increase under high-speed driving conditions. The results indicate that the current SCR technology may have certain risks in exceeding the future China VI NH₃ limit. However, five China IV/V HDDVs were found to have SCR temperature sensors that were intentionally tampered with, resulting in comparable or even higher NOX emissions and zero NH₃ emissions. Increased NO₂ emissions due to the adoption of diesel oxidation catalysts and diesel particulate filters were also found from our experiments. This study highlights the importance of enhancing in-use compliance requirements and eliminating aftertreatment tampering for China IV and China V HDDVs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair quality 3aammonia 3acatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical reduction 3acities 3acompliance 3aemissions 3afilters 3anitric oxide 3anitrogen dioxide 3aoxidation 3arisk 3atampering 3atemperature 3atrucks 3aChina 0aNOX 0aNH3 0aSelective catalytic reduction (SCR) 0aDiesel 0aVehicle emissions 0aPortable emissions measurement systems (PEMS)1 aZhang, Shaojun1 aHu, Jingnan1 aLi, Zhenhua1 aZheng, Xuan1 aCao, Yihuan1 aXu, Guangyi1 aYan, Min1 aWu, Ye0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114280-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1142803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02418naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100002200153245011000175300001600285520132400301592002801625650000901653650002001662650001101682650000901693650001901702650001201721650001901733650001101752650001301763650001301776650001301789700002201802700002001824773010201844856008901946852000902035655001202044IND60561580720221118003352.0170119e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056158072DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b021962doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSakurovs, Richard10aRearrangement in Brown Coal Microstructure upon Drying As Measured by Ultrasmall-Angle Neutron Scattering  ap. 231-238.  aSmall-angle scattering can supply information about the microporosity of wet materials, unlike techniques such as gas sorption and mercury porosimetry. In this study, we applied the ultrasmall-angle neutron scattering (USANS) technique to compare the microstructure of brown coals before and after drying and after rewetting the dried coal, in the size range from 25 nm to 10 μm. We found that scattering of neutrons from brown coal is substantially greater when dried than when wet. Because we found that materials that shrink uniformly on all size scales must scatter neutrons to a lesser extent when dried than when wet, the microstructure of brown coal must be different when it is wet from when it is dry. This difference in the brown coal microstructure is on sizes of <100 nm. The change in the microstructure is probably due to clustering of the molecules making up the brown coal into locally denser regions when the coal is dried, which is consistent with the gel structure model for wet brown coal. Brown coal that had been heat-treated wet at 300 °C showed no evidence of such a restructure after being dried. We also found that D₂O extensively penetrates pores of brown coal, even in the brown coal that had been heat-treated, and that the nature of the pores in the wet coal varies with the pore size.  aPublisher supplied data 3acoal 3adeuterium oxide 3adrying 3agels 3aheat treatment 3amercury 3amicrostructure 3amodels 3aneutrons 3aporosity 3asorption1 ade Campo, Liliana1 aRehm, Christine0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.231-238dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b021963Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02154naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245011700171500001900288520101600307592002801323650001201351650001501363650001001378650001701388650001101405651001001416653001701426653002501443653003701468653003401505700001701539700001301556700001501569773010101584856008601685852000901771655001201780IND60700117320221120124703.0201111e202010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070011732DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Qingtian10aInfluence of methodological choices on results of macrofaunal functional feeding diversity and evenness analyses  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aMethodological choices made when studying functional feeding groups (FFGs) may influence the outcome of feeding diversity analyses and of the ecological quality assessment. We assessed the impact of select methodological choices based on seasonal macrobenthos surveys carried out in Bohai Bay, China. Results of the paired-sample t test showed that the choice to remove rare species from analyses had influence on the outcome of ecosystem evaluations based on FFG diversity (t = 2.328, p = 0.023). On the other hand, although results at some stations indicated that the removal of rare species did not affect feeding diversity and ecological assessment, it increased the research effort. Evenness feeding diversity calculated from FFG biomass data showed a remarkably different spatio-temporal distribution from that of values based on abundance data, with no clear relationship between the two. If biomass data are used to estimate FFG diversity, a revised ecological assessment scale may need to be developed.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afauna 3arare species 3at-test 3aChina 0aMacrobenthos 0aFunctional diversity 0aEvenness feeding diversity index 0aEcological quality assessment1 aGong, Zijuan1 aLi, Jing1 aHu, Guikun0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106623-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03508naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100005800142245009900200300001800299500002000317520185000337592002802187596006602215596003202281650001502313650002002328650001402348650001602362650002102378650001402399650001302413650001302426650002402439650002502463650002202488651001102510700005702521700005902578700005602637700005702693700005902750700001702809773012602826856007702952852000903029655001203038IND60788042720221118115005.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804272DNAL7 a10.1029/2017WR0223532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKurylyk, B.

Heat has been previously applied as a submarine groundwater tracer using an analytical solution to a heat flow equation assuming steady state conditions and homogeneous thermal conductivity. These assumptions are often violated in shallow seabeds due to ocean bottom temperature changes or sediment property variations. Here heat tracing analysis techniques recently developed for terrestrial settings are applied in concert to examine the influences of groundwater flow, ocean temperature changes, and seabed thermal conductivity variations on deep‐ocean sediment temperature profiles. Temperature observations from the sediment and bottom ocean water on the Scotian Slope off eastern Canada are used to demonstrate how simple thermal methods for tracing groundwater can be employed if more comprehensive techniques indicate that the simplifying assumptions are valid. The spatial distribution of the inferred groundwater fluxes on the slope suggests a downward groundwater flow system with recharge occurring over the upper‐middle slope and discharge on the lower slope. We speculate that the downward groundwater flow inferred on the Scotian Slope is due to density‐driven processes arising from underlying salt domes, in contrast with upward slope systems driven by geothermal convection. Improvements in the design of future submarine hydrogeological studies are proposed for thermal data collection and groundwater flow analysis, including new equations that quantify the minimum detectable flux magnitude for a given sensor accuracy and profile length.  aPublisher supplied data  c(Canadian) Federal Program of Energy Research and Development  cFisheries and Oceans Canada 3aconvection 3adata collection 3aequations 3agroundwater 3agroundwater flow 3aheat flow 3aresearch 3aseawater 3asediment properties 3athermal conductivity 3awater temperature 3aCanada1 aIrvine, D.

This work aims to assess heavy metal ecological risk in XKS using a potential ecological risk (PER) index and detect the responses of the soil bacterial community under heavy metal stress at different pH levels. The PER index indicated that antimony (Sb), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As) posed the most serious ecological risk at the sampling sites. We compared the effects of heavy metals on the structure of the microbial community under acidic and neutral conditions. Our results suggested significant differences between microbial community responses to heavy metals in acidic and neutral soils. Zinc (Zn) and lead (Pb) were the main heavy metal factors affecting the bacterial community under acidic conditions, whereas the effect of Sb, As, and chromium (Cr) exceeded them in neutral soils. This was possibly due to the different characteristics of heavy metals and their interactions with soil properties. The main genus were positively correlated with Sb, As, Zn, Pb, and Cd in both acidic and neutral soils, which may due to increasing resistance under conditions of long-time pollution. The results of our structural equation modeling indicated that the variations in the bacterial community structure were mainly explained by heavy metals in acidic and neutral soils. The soil nutrients and pH also had significant direct influences on the bacterial community under neutral conditions, as well as indirect effects due to their impact on heavy metals in neutral and acidic soils. Several heavy metal-resistant bacteria can be used for remediation under acid and neutral conditions.  aPublisher supplied data 3aantimony 3aarsenic 3abacterial communities 3acadmium 3achromium 3acommunity structure 3aequations 3aheavy metals 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3apH 3apollution 3aremediation 3arisk 3asoil bacteria 3azinc 3aChina 0aXikuangshan 0aHeavy metal 0aBacterial community 0aSoil pH 0aEcological risk assessment1 aWang, Yating1 aChen, Qi1 aLi, Yongshuang1 aGuo, Dongchu1 aNie, Xiaohong1 aPeng, Xiawei0 tEcological indicators.g2020 Oct., v. 117 p.106626-dElsevier LtdwJournal:6196x1470-160X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.1066263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01727naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002000187245010900207300001800316506007600334520035400410592002800764506003700792650004700829650002700876650001100903650001800914650004200932650002500974650001500999700001801014700001701032700001801049700001601067700001801083773012701101856008001228852000901308655001201317IND60117656020221207101836.0141126e20130627xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6011765602DNAL7 a10.1128/genomeA.00408-132doi7 aPMC36954322pmcid7 a238140362pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeong, Haeyoung10aGenome Sequence of the Vancomycin-Producing Amycolatopsis orientalis subsp. orientalis Strain KCTC 9412T  ap. e00408-13.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aAmycolatopsis orientalis is the producer of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic that is used for the treatment of serious infections with Gram-positive bacteria.

(Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae: Nymphalini). We presented six fat‐free diet pairs to larvae in a choice trial to determine the ‘intake target’. In addition, we fed larvae seven fat‐free single diets differing in dietary nutrient ratio in no‐choice trials to determine the rules of compromise they exhibit when constrained to a singular, sub‐optimal dietary source. In choice trials, caterpillars regulated nutrient intake to a ratio of 1 protein to 1.09 carbohydrate (1P:1.09C), exhibiting tighter regulation of protein than of carbohydrate. Furthermore, larvae from different diet pair treatments did not differ in pupal mass or stadium duration. In no‐choice experiments, larvae reduced consumption on increasingly protein‐biased diets and increased consumption on increasingly carbohydrate‐biased diets, relative to a 1P:1C ratio diet. Differences in carbohydrate consumption were much greater between no‐choice treatments than differences in protein consumption. Dietary nutrient ratio affected pupal mass when accounting for initial larval mass. Pupal mass decreased as nutrient ratio was shifted off of 1P:1C, but to a greater extent when the ratio was skewed toward carbohydrate. Stadium duration increased as nutrient ratio diverged from 1P:1C, being more pronounced when shifted toward carbohydrate than toward protein. Regulation to near 1P:1C is consistent with results found for other Lepidoptera, and the rule of compromise exhibited by V. cardui is consistent with that expected for a generalist herbivore.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVanessa cardui 3acarbohydrates 3afat-free diet 3aherbivores 3ainsect larvae 3anutrient intake 3apupae1 aThompson, S.

Silicon (Si) has become a potential limiting nutrient due to disproportionate nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicate inputs into these areas. The disrupted nutrient ratios can cause changes to metal sensitivity and accumulation in marine diatoms, an important group of eukaryotic phytoplankton that requires silicon for growth. In this study, we examined the effects of Si availability on the metal sensitivity in the diatom P. tricornutum. We found that Si starvation dramatically compromised its cadmium, copper, and lead tolerances. Interestingly, multiple lines of evidence indicated that Si-enriched cells had higher metal adsorption and influx rates than Si-starved cells. Yet Si-enriched cells also had a greater ability to respond to and counteract metal toxicity via elevated expression of membrane and vacuolar metal transporters and greater antioxidant activities which scavenge reactive oxygen species created by metal stress.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhaeodactylum tricornutum 3aadsorption 3aanthropogenic activities 3aantioxidant activity 3acadmium 3acoastal water 3acopper 3alead 3ametal tolerance 3anitrogen 3anutrients 3aphosphorus 3aphytoplankton 3areactive oxygen species 3asilicates 3asilicon 3astoichiometry 3atoxicity 3atransporters 3avacuoles 0aDiatom 0aSilicon 0aMetal bioaccumulation 0aMetal transporter 0aMetal toxicity1 aMa, Jie1 aChen, Fengyuan1 aZou, Yue1 aWei, Yang1 aZhong, Huan1 aPan, Ke0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114331-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1143313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01460naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001500140245012200155300002000277520035900297592002800656650002400684650002000708650001400728650002900742650001100771650001500782700001500797700001200812700001500824700001500839700001800854700001900872773012400891856007401015852000901089655001201098IND60642162220221119235236.0190506e20171024xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064216222DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra09053f2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShen, Chao10aIodobenzene-catalyzed synthesis of aryl sulfonate esters from aminoquinolines via remote radical C–O cross-coupling  ap. 49436-49439.  aA simple and efficient approach is established for the iodobenzene-catalyzed synthesis of aryl sulfonate esters from aminoquinolines via remote radical C–O cross-coupling in the absence of any transition metal catalysts.

However, the effective utilization of this resource could be enabled by production of syngas (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, etc.) from lignite through gasification. Tar in the syngas generated using the fluidized bed gasifier must be removed, and the tar composition should be considered for the design of effective tar removal equipment. A new analysis and analytical methods of the tar were developed herein. Gas chromatograph mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and field desorption mass spectrometry (FD-MS) were used in combination to analyze the tar obtained during steam gasification of lignite at 1123 K using a laboratory-scale fluidized bed gasifier. The low-boiling-point components were previously identified by GC/MS. However, the combined use of GC/MS and FD-MS in the new approach presented herein enabled elucidation of the overall composition of tar, including the high-boiling-point components.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon monoxide 3adesorption 3afluidized beds 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3agasification 3ahydrogen 3alignite 3asteam 3asynthesis gas 3aJapan1 aMurakami, Takahiro1 aYasuda, Hajime0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.249-254dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b022103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03997naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001900153245014000172300001600312520259300328592002802921650002502949650002302974650001602997650001403013650000903027650001503036650001103051650000903062650000703071650001403078650001103092650002103103650002003124650001903144650002203163650002003185650001603205700001803221700001803239700001803257700002603275700001403301773010203315856008903417852000903506655001203515IND60561581120221118003319.0170119e20170119xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056158112DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.energyfuels.6b022162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNguele, Ronald10aInteractions between Formation Rock and Petroleum Fluids during Microemulsion Flooding and Alteration of Heavy Oil Recovery Performance  ap. 255-270.  aIn situ emulsification/solubilization is an oil recovery technique routinely used to mobilize residual oil after the secondary oil production (waterflooding). The oil is produced after a subsequent reduction of interfacial tension between stranded crude oil and water in the reservoir. Herein, a recovery method is presented for heavy crude oils whose scheme consists of injection of a fully solubilized (or emulsified) oil. Theoretically, the fully solubilized oil, referred hereinafter as microemulsion formulation, reduces the viscous forces that keep residual oil stranded. Different microemulsion formulations were prepared ex situ from two heavy oils (API 11.5 and 16.6), micellar slugs (formulated from cationic Gemini surfactant), and low-saline water (0.1 wt % NaCl). Tertiary heavy oil recovery consisted of displacing residual oil from a waterflooded core by a specific microemulsion formulation followed by low-saline water, which acted as buffer solution. Thirty-one percent of initial oil-in-place (IOIP) was recovered from the waterflooded core by microemulsion followed by an incremental oil recovery of about 20% of IOIP with chase water. The oil recovery efficiency by microemulsion and chase water floodings was lowered to 15 and 28%, respectively, in a strong oil-wet core (i.e., non waterflooded core). Despite the promising results presented herein, the performance of the microemulsion formulations and thus the oil recovery efficiency were found to be strongly dependent on (1) the nature of the core, i.e., its mineralogy, (2) the wetting state of plug, and (3) the chemical composition advancing fluid. The microemulsion formulations prompted a series of chemical reactions which subsequently altered their performance as a displacing agent. Ion tracking analysis of the effluent fractions showed that the pH and concentration in divalent and/or monovalent ions were also altered at each stage of production. When the plug was not waterflooded, the oil was produced along with a deposit of sludge and a high emulsion cut. However, the use of preflush enriched with an alkali (Na₂CO₃) was found to abate both effects. Furthermore, the spectral analysis of effluent fractions revealed the formation of calcium bridges which are thought to alter the efficiency of microemulsion formulations. Also, a series of chemical schemes are proposed in this investigation to support these results. Lastly, this investigation proposes a simplified electrostatic model that explains further the formation of clusters which were promoted by propagation of displacing fluids.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical composition 3achemical reactions 3aemulsifying 3aemulsions 3aions 3amineralogy 3amodels 3aoils 3apH 3apetroleum 3asludge 3asodium carbonate 3asodium chloride 3asolubilization 3aspectral analysis 3asurface tension 3asurfactants1 aSasaki, Kyuro1 aSugai, Yuichi1 aOmondi, Brian1 aSaid Al-Salim, Hikmat1 aUeda, Ryo0 tEnergy & Fuels.g2017 Jan. 19, v. 31, no. 1 p.255-270dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-50297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facs.energyfuels.6b022163Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03553naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245011400210520173400324592002802058650001202086650002402098650002202122650002302144650002302167650002302190650001902213650001202232650001602244650001602260650002402276650002202300650001702322650001002339650001902349650001802368650001202386650001802398650001702416650001002433650001302443650002002456650001602476653001602492653001602508653001702524653002102541653001702562653001602579700002902595700001802624700002002642700002002662700002002682700002402702773010702726856008502833852000902918655001202927IND60686537820221119132014.0200809e202007  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068653782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1143532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuuskonen, Hannu1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5609-768X10aDo whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus) larvae show adaptive variation in the avoidance of microplastic ingestion?  aThe presence of microplastics in aquatic ecosystems has recently received increased attention. Small plastic particles may resemble natural food items of larval fish and other aquatic organisms, and create strong selective pressures on the feeding traits in exposed populations. Here, we examined if larval ingestion of 90 μm polystyrene microspheres, in the presence of zooplankton (Artemia nauplii, mean length = 433 μm), shows adaptive variation in the European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus). A full-factorial experimental breeding design allowed us to estimate the relative contributions of male (sire) and female (dam) parents and full-sib family variance in early feeding traits, and also genetic (co)variation between these traits. We also monitored the magnitude of intake and elimination of microplastics from the alimentary tracts of the larvae. In general, larval whitefish ingested small numbers of microplastics (mean = 1.8, range = 0–26 particles per larva), but ingestion was marginally affected by the dam, and more strongly by the full-sib family variation. Microsphere ingestion showed no statistically significant additive genetic variation, and thus, no heritability. Moreover, microsphere ingestion rate covaried positively with the ingestion of Artemia, further suggesting that larvae cannot adaptively avoid microsphere ingestion. Together with the detected strong genetic correlation between food intake and microplastic intake, the results suggest that larval fish do not readily possess additive genetic variation that would help them to adapt to the increasing pollution by microplastics. The conflict between feeding on natural food and avoiding microplastics deserves further attention.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArtemia 3aCoregonus lavaretus 3aanimal adaptation 3aaquatic ecosystems 3aat-risk population 3aavoidance behavior 3adams (mothers) 3afemales 3afish larvae 3afood intake 3agenetic correlation 3agenetic variation 3aheritability 3amales 3amicroparticles 3amicroplastics 3anauplii 3aoral exposure 3apolystyrenes 3asires 3avariance 3awater pollution 3azooplankton 0aFish larvae 0aPolystyrene 0aMicrospheres 0aParental effects 0aAccumulation 0aElimination1 aSubiron i Folguera, Joan1 aKortet, Raine1 aAkkanen, Jarkko1 aVainikka, Anssi1 aJanhunen, Matti1 aKekäläinen, Jukka0 tEnvironmental pollution.g2020 July, v. 262 p.114353-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl41014x0269-74917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.1143533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004600094040001800140100001500158245014900173300001400322520156700336592002801903650001001931650002101941650001501962650002201977650001401999650001702013650003102030650001602061653001602077653000902093653002002102653002402122653002802146700002202174700002402196700002202220773009902242856009302341852000902434655001202443IND60634343920221119231359.0190328e20190415xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6063434392DNAL7 a10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.02.0102doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aArai, Yuka10aIdentification of isoforms of calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatases which suppress full-type hyperactivation in bull ejaculated spermatozoa  ap. 46-53.  aIn bull spermatozoa, extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation, which is characterized by the asymmetrical beating in whole parts of the middle/principal pieces, is suppressed by calyculin A-sensitive protein phosphatases. The aim of this study was to identify isoforms of these protein phosphatases. Ejaculated spermatozoa were used for the investigation on effects of protein phosphatase inhibitors (calyculin A with high specificity for both of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, and okadaic acid with relatively higher specificity for protein phosphatase 2A than protein phosphatase 1) on the induction of extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation by incubation with CaCl2 and cAMP analog (cBiMPS). They were also used for the immunodetection of protein phosphatases 1α, 1β, 1γ, 2Aα and 2Aβ. Percentages of full-type hyperactivated spermatozoa significantly increased after incubation with calyculin A (10 nM) in a concentration-dependent manner of CaCl2 (0–3.42 mM), though only minor increases in the percentages of full-type hyperactivated spermatozoa were observed after incubation with okadaic acid (10 nM). Moreover, the immunodetection of protein phosphatase isoforms showed sperm connecting piece and flagellum included protein phosphatases 1α and 1γ, but did not do the other isoforms. These results suggest that calyculin A-sensitive and okadaic acid-less sensitive protein phosphatases (1α and 1γ) are suppressors for the extracellular Ca2+-dependent full-type hyperactivation in bull ejaculated spermatozoa.  aPublisher supplied data 3abulls 3acalcium chloride 3acyclic AMP 3aenzyme inhibitors 3aflagellum 3aokadaic acid 3aphosphoprotein phosphatase 3aspermatozoa 0aCalyculin A 0acAMP 0aHyperactivation 0aProtein phosphatase 0aProtein phosphorylation1 aSakase, Mitsuhiro1 aFukushima, Moriyuki1 aHarayama, Hiroshi0 tTheriogenology.g2019 Apr. 15, v. 129 p.46-53dElsevier Inc.wJournal:jnl5209x0093-691X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2019.02.0103Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02548naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002700147245011600174300001600290520150300306592002801809650001301837650002601850650001201876650001201888650001201900650001301912650001401925650002501939700003501964700002701999773009402026856008102120852000902201655001202210IND60080199120221121192022.0150316e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008019912DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-014-1163-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOlvera Vargas, Miguel,10aEnvironmental filters and patterns of tree regeneration in high altitude sub-tropical Quercus-dominated forests  ap. 711-721.  aWe investigated how environmental variables explain patterns of tree regeneration in high altitude sub-tropical Quercus-dominated forests by: (1) determining whether the seedling and sapling communities show non-random spatial patterns of floristic composition; (2) identifying which environmental variables explain the observed patterns of floristic composition; (3) examining if similarity in floristic composition is related to similarity in environmental variables. We used data gathered in permanent plots established across 10 km in high altitude sub-tropical Quercus-dominated forests. Our analyses consisted of unconstrained ordination analyses (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) to characterize the spatial patterns of floristic composition; constrained ordination analyses (Canonical correspondence analysis) to assess the contribution of environmental variables in explaining patterns of floristic composition and, the simple and partial Mantel test to correlate the floristic composition similarity to environmental similarity. Our results provided evidence of non-random spatial patterns of floristic distribution due to structured environmental filters such as canopy-related variables, litter, grazing and aspect. Floristic compositional similarity did not depend on geographical distance between sites or on differences in their environment; therefore a number of plots were similar in floristic composition, in both seedlings and saplings, but have no environmental similarity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaltitude 3abotanical composition 3afilters 3aforests 3agrazing 3asaplings 3aseedlings 3astatistical analysis1 aFigueroa-Rangel, Blanca Lorena1 aGuzmán, Ramón Cuevas0 tEcological research.g2014 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.711-721dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1163-03Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01264naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245003700166300001600203520030700219592002800526650001800554650001100572650004400583650001800627653001800645653002900663653001800692653001500710653001600725700001700741773010800758856005100866852000900917655001200926IND50075875420221122045134.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587542DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2010.5418862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJeelani, S.10aTriterpenoids from Arctium lappa  ap. 654-658.  aPhytochemical investigation of the leaves of Arctium lappa led to the isolation of two triterpenoids, characterised by NMR, IR and MS as 3α-hydroxylanosta-5,15-diene and 3α-acetoxy-hop-22(29)-ene. 3α-hydroxylanosta-5,15-diene is a new triterpenoid and is isolated for the first time from this genus.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArctium lappa 3aleaves 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3atriterpenoids 0aArctium lappa 0atetracyclic triterpenoid 0aantibacterial 0aantifungal 0acarminative1 aKhuroo, M.A.0 tNatural product research.g2012 Apr. 1, v. 26, no. 7 p.654-658dTaylor & Francis Groupx1478-64277nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14786419.2010.541886  aDNAL 7aarticle03701naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005600151245012600207300001400333520210400347592002802451650001302479650000802492650001202500650002202512650003002534650002302564650002702587650002502614650001502639650001402654650001502668650001502683650001102698650001802709650001502727653002402742653002602766653002202792653003302814653002502847700001602872700001702888700005202905700001402957700001602971773010102987856008603088852000903174655001203183IND60526461820221120040924.0190408e201603  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6052646182DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.12.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xiaoou1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7040-538310aOptimizing the operation of combined oxidation pond-constructed wetland ecosystems used for treating composite wastewater  ap. 64-76.  aGiven few studies refer to the employment of constructed wetlands to polish secondary effluent and purify runoff simultaneously prior to replenishment of surface water, lab-scale combined oxidation pond-constructed wetland ecosystems used for treating the composite wastewater were established in this study, and the effects of four factors, each at four levels, on the treatment efficiency of the system were investigated through orthogonal experiment. The tested factors were (i) ratio of five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) to chemical oxygen demand (CODCr) (abbreviation B/C) in the influent, (ii) aeration position, (iii) aeration intensity (expressed as air/water ratio), and (iv) hydraulic residence time (HRT). Results showed that the sequence and degree of the influence of the tested factors were HRT**>aeration intensity**>aeration position*>B/C for CODCr removal, HRT**>aeration position*≈aeration intensity*>B/C for ammonia (NH4+-N) removal, HRT**>B/C**>aeration position**>aeration intensity** for total nitrogen (TN) removal and HRT**>aeration intensity>aeration position≈B/C for total phosphorus (TP) removal (* denotes significant influence (0.01<p<0.05) and ** denotes extremely significant influence (p≤0.01)). Although the optimal operating conditions for CODCr, NH4+-N, TN and TP removal in the system were quite different from each other, the comprehensive optimal operating conditions (B/C≈0.30, surface aeration, aeration intensity=3:1, HRT=2.0d) obtained by the comprehensive balance method for the operation of the whole system proved to be feasible and practicable, under which the average concentration removal percentages were 80.81%, 75.97%, 82.38% and 80.95% for CODCr, NH4+-N, TN and TP, respectively. Moreover, the wetland columns accounted for the greatest removal of pollutants in the combined system, while the oxidation pond conferred a buffer capacity to the system by allowing for high loading fluctuations and pre-treated the influent as well. This study also offers references for the analysis of the results of the multi-index orthogonal test.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaeration 3aair 3aammonia 3aammonium nitrogen 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abuffering capacity 3achemical oxygen demand 3aconstructed wetlands 3aecosystems 3aoxidation 3aphosphorus 3apollutants 3arunoff 3asurface water 3awastewater 0aConstructed wetland 0aOrthogonal experiment 0aAeration position 0aComprehensive balance method 0aComposite wastewater1 aTian, Yimei1 aZhao, Xinhua1 aWu, Qing1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0501-11261 aPeng, Sen1 aYan, Lijian0 tEcological engineering.g2016 Mar., v. 88 p.64-76dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11630x0925-85747nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.12.0293Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03649naa a2200637 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100001800153245013100171520175100302592002802053650002002081650001902101650001002120650002502130650001202155650001802167650002202185650001602207650001102223650001502234650001302249650001302262650002302275650002202298650002102320650001502341650001002356650002502366650001202391650001902403650001302422650001902435653002002454653001902474653002002493653001202513653002502525653002402550653002502574653002602599653001202625653001702637653001202654700002602666700002902692700002102721700006202742773009802804856008802902852000902990655001202999IND60724133520221120044559.0211213e202104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413352DNAL7 a10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1126452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCowan, Max F.10aVariation in production of cyanogenic glucosides during early plant development: A comparison of wild and domesticated sorghum  aDomestication has narrowed the genetic diversity found in crop wild relatives, potentially reducing plasticity to cope with a changing climate. The tissues of domesticated sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), especially in younger plants, are cyanogenic and potentially toxic. Species of wild sorghum produce lower levels of the cyanogenic glucoside (CNglc) dhurrin than S. bicolor at maturity, but it is not known if this is also the case during germination and early growth. CNglcs play multiple roles in primary and specialised metabolism in domesticated sorghum and other crop plants. In this study, the temporal and spatial distribution of dhurrin in wild and domesticated sorghum at different growth stages was monitored in leaf, sheath and root tissues up to 35 days post germination using S. bicolor and the wild species S. brachypodum and S. macrospermum as the experimental systems. Growth parameters were also measured and allocation of plant total nitrogen (N%) to both dhurrin and nitrate (NO₃⁻) was calculated. Negligible amounts of dhurrin were produced in the leaves of the two wild species compared to S. bicolor. The morphology of the two wild sorghums also differed from S. bicolor, with the greatest differences observed for the more distantly related S. brachypodum. S. bicolor had the highest leaf N% whilst the wild species had significantly higher root N%. Allocation of nitrogen to dhurrin in aboveground tissue was significantly higher in S. bicolor compared to the wild species but did not differ in the roots across the three species. The differences in plant morphology, dhurrin content and re-mobilisation, and nitrate/nitrogen allocation suggest that domestication has affected the functional roles of dhurrin in sorghum.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSorghum bicolor 3aclimate change 3acrops 3adevelopmental stages 3adhurrin 3adomestication 3agenetic variation 3agermination 3aleaves 3ametabolism 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3aplant biochemistry 3aplant development 3aplant morphology 3aplasticity 3aroots 3aspatial distribution 3atissues 3atotal nitrogen 3atoxicity 3awild relatives 0aSorghum bicolor 0aS. brachypodum 0aS. macrospermum 0aPoaceae 0aSecondary metabolite 0aCrop wild relatives 0aSeedling development 0aCyanogenic glucosides 0aNitrate 0aCyanogenesis 0aDhurrin1 aBlomstedt, Cecilia K.1 aMøller, Birger Lindberg1 aHenry, Robert J.1 aGleadow, Roslyn M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4756-04110 tPhytochemistry.g2021 Apr., v. 184 p.112645-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl44710x0031-94227nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.1126453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02809naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245014500164300001600309520155200325592002801877650002101905650001201926650001001938650001101948650000901959650001501968650001101983650002601994650001202020650001102032650002102043650000902064650001002073650001302083650001902096651001002115700001802125700001802143700001802161773009402179856008102273852000902354655001202363IND60080199220221121192049.0150316e201407  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008019922DNAL7 a10.1007/s11284-014-1164-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEmura, Naoko10aDimorphism of the seed-dispersing organ in a pantropical coastal plant, Scaevola taccada: heterogeneous population structures across islands  ap. 733-740.  aScaevola taccada is characterized by dimorphic fruits, with one type having cork and pulp (C-morph) and the other type having only pulp (NC-morph). Although within-individual dimorphism has not been observed, both morphs can occur at the same sites. The cork floats on seawater, and the pulp is eaten by birds. Thus, the morphs may have different seed dispersal abilities, via sea currents and birds, respectively. This study aimed to determine the functional characteristics of the dimorphic fruits. First, the potential seed dispersal ability of sea currents and birds was compared between the two fruits morphs by conducting a floating test and by measuring the proportions of different parts of the fruits, respectively. Next, the frequencies of the two morphs across different substrates (beaches, rocks, and cliffs) in the southern islands around Japan were analyzed. Most C-morph fruits remained floating for more than 180 days in a seawater tank, whereas all NC-morph fruits sank after approximately 1 week. The NC-morph fruits had a more pulp volume and less indigestible material than the C-morph fruits. Although both types of plants were found on many islands and all substrates, the C-morph was dominant on beaches, whereas the NC-morph was most frequent on cliffs. The frequencies of the morphs on different substrates might be influenced by the differences in their seed dispersal abilities. The two morphs may differ in fitness on different substrates. These findings improve our understanding of plant adaptations for dispersal.  aPublisher supplied data 3aScaevola taccada 3abeaches 3abirds 3acliffs 3acork 3adimorphism 3afruits 3afunctional properties 3aislands 3amorphs 3aplant adaptation 3apulp 3arocks 3aseawater 3aseed dispersal 3aJapan1 aDenda, Tetsuo1 aSakai, Miyuki1 aUeda, Keisuke0 tEcological research.g2014 July, v. 29, no. 4 p.733-740dSpringer-Verlagx0912-38147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-014-1164-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01634naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001400150245008900164300001400253520046400267592002800731650001400759650001300773650001100786650002000797650002300817650002200840650002500862650001300887650001900900653001400919653002000933653002900953653003000982700001801012700001801030773009401048856008501142852000901227655001201236IND60544340520221118041209.0190415e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054434052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2014.06.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Yang10aPermanent draft genome of the malachite-green-tolerant bacterium Rhizobium sp.

The highest percentage of motile sperm was noted in the semen samples from males held in basins, while the lowest percentage of motile sperm and the highest protein content was confirmed in the samples from spawners held in ponds. Sperm motility and the osmolality of the seminal plasma were low in all the spawner groups; this may indicate contamination with urine. As the content of protein rose in the plasma and the sperm concentration increased, so did their motility.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSander lucioperca 3abasins 3acages 3amales 3amilt 3aosmolality 3aosmotic pressure 3aponds 3aprotein content 3arearing 3aseminal plasma 3aseminal plasma proteins 3asperm concentration 3asperm motility 3aspermatozoa 3atanks 3aurine 0aPikeperch 0aMilt 0aHCG 0aSeminal Plasma 0aContaminated Semen1 aGlogowski, Jan1 aKowalski, Radosław1 aKucharczyk, Dariusz1 aTargońska, Katarzyna0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 1 p.93-100dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0008-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03081naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002600148245014100174300001600315520165400331592002801985650001002013650001502023650002002038650000902058650001002067650001202077650001602089650001802105650000902123650001902132650001202151650001202163650001102175650002102186653000802207653003102215653001102246653001302257653001702270700001802287700001902305700002102324700002102345773012902366856008302495852000902578655001202587IND60533762920221118221712.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053376292DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2014.07.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarmer-Dougan, Valeri10aBehavior of hearing or vision impaired and normal hearing and vision dogs (Canis lupis familiaris): Not the same, but not that different  ap. 316-323.  aThe article compared behavioral characteristics of dogs (Canis lupis familiaris) labeled as hearing and/or vision impaired by their owners with cohort dogs labeled as having normal hearing and vision (NHV) by their owners. The Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire, developed by Hsu and Serpell (2003), was used to survey owners. Four hundred sixty-one dog owners completed the online survey, with 183 of these being owners of hearing and/or vision impaired (HVI) dogs. Data analysis revealed that HVI dogs were reported by owners to show less aggression, less excitement, and were less likely to engage in behaviors, such as chasing of rabbits and rolling in feces than their normally hearing/seeing (NHV) cohorts. HVI dogs, however, were reported to be more likely to chew inappropriate objects, consume feces, bark excessively, and engage in greater licking behavior. When owners were surveyed about the type of training method used, owners of HVI dogs were found to be more likely to use hand signs, physical prompts, or combination of these training methods. Owners of NHV dogs reported being more likely than owners of HVI dogs to use gestures or report no formal training with their dogs. The data provide evidence that HVI dogs are as trainable as NHV dogs, can make excellent pets, and show behavior that is well within the parameters of NHV dog behavior. Still, because of their sensory limitations, specialized training methods and adaptations should be implemented with these dogs. This may limit HVI dogs to owners who are motivated, understand the sensory deficits, and are willing to engage in the modified training.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCanis 3aaggression 3aanimal behavior 3adogs 3afeces 3ahearing 3amastication 3apet ownership 3apets 3aquestionnaires 3arabbits 3asurveys 3avision 3avision disorders 0adog 0ahearing or vision impaired 0aC-BARQ 0abehavior 0atrainability1 aQuick, Amanda1 aHarper, Kelsey1 aSchmidt, Kirsten1 aCampbell, Daniel0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.316-323dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2014.07.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02666naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002800139245010700167300001800274500002000292520138000312592002801692650002101720650000801741650001701749650002001766650001301786650002001799650003001819650001101849650001401860650002101874650003301895650001101928650001001939700002001949700003301969700002002002700001602022773011202038856007302150852000902223655001202232IND60571550320221119082349.0170712e201612  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057155032DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.128402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTorres‐Ruiz, José M.10aDirect observation and modelling of embolism spread between xylem conduits: a case study in Scots pine  ap. 2774-2785.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aXylem embolism is one of the main processes involved in drought‐related plant mortality. Although its consequences for plant physiology are already well described, embolism formation and spread are poorly evaluated and modelled, especially for tracheid‐based species. The aim of this study was to assess the embolism formation and spread in Pinus sylvestris as a case study using X‐ray microtomography and hydraulics methods. We also evaluated the potential effects of cavitation fatigue on vulnerability to embolism and the micro‐morphology of the bordered pits using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to test for possible links between xylem anatomy and embolism spread. Finally, a novel model was developed to simulate the spread of embolism in a 2D anisotropic cellular structure. Results showed a large variability in the formation and spread of embolism within a ring despite no differences being observed in intertracheid pit membrane anatomical traits. Simulations from the model showed a highly anisotropic tracheid‐to‐tracheid embolism spreading pattern, which confirms the major role of tracheid‐to‐tracheid air seeding to explain how embolism spreads in Scots pine. The results also showed that prior embolism removal from the samples reduced the resistance to embolism of the xylem and could result in overestimates of vulnerability to embolism.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPinus sylvestris 3aair 3acase studies 3acell structures 3aembolism 3afluid mechanics 3amicro-computed tomography 3amodels 3amortality 3aplant physiology 3ascanning electron microscopy 3asowing 3axylem1 aCochard, Hervé1 aMencuccini, M.,q(Maurizio),1 aDelzon, Sylvain1 aBadel, Eric0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2016 Dec., v. 39, no. 12 p.2774-2785dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.128403Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01890naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002000140245018600160300001200346500002200358520072900380592002801109650003101137650002201168650001501190650001101205650001501216650001301231700002001244700002201264700003001286700002701316773011401343856007401457852000901531655001201540IND60642837320221118042334.0190508e200412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064283732DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027121162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNamboori, Seema10aErratum to: Enhanced functional and structural domain assignments using remote similarity detection procedures for proteins encoded in the genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv  ap. 445.  aPublished Erratum  aThe three-dimensional structure and subcellular localization of various domains and sub-domains of Rv1318c, a putative cyclase from Mycobacterium tubercolosis, are currently unknown from experimental studies. We have predicted that Rv1318c consists of five transmembrane helices (Namboori et al 2004). However, depending upon the algorithm for prediction and the parameters used, the predicted number of helices can vary. We have also suggested that the C-terminal cyclase domain of Rv1318c is located intracellularly; this is a conserved feature in the family of adenylyl/guanylyl cyclases. Recently it has been shown experimentally that Rv1318c is an adenylyl cyclase (Linder et al 2004; Eur. J.

Development of a relevant MCDA-method requires consideration of a number of key issues, e.g. (a) definition of assessment boundaries, (b) definition of performance scales, both temporal and spatial, (c) selection of relevant criteria (indicators) that facilitate a comprehensive sustainability assessment while avoiding double-counting of effects, and (d) handling of uncertainties. Adding to the complexity is the typically wide variety of inputs, including quantifications based on existing data, expert judgements, and opinions expressed in interviews. The SCORE (Sustainable Choice Of REmediation) MCDA-method was developed to provide a transparent assessment of the sustainability of possible remediation alternatives for contaminated sites relative to a reference alternative, considering key criteria in the economic, environmental, and social sustainability domains. The criteria were identified based on literature studies, interviews and focus-group meetings. SCORE combines a linear additive model to rank the alternatives with a non-compensatory approach to identify alternatives regarded as non-sustainable. The key strengths of the SCORE method are as follows: a framework that at its core is designed to be flexible and transparent; the possibility to integrate both quantitative and qualitative estimations on criteria; its ability, unlike other sustainability assessment tools used in industry and academia, to allow for the alteration of boundary conditions where necessary; the inclusion of a full uncertainty analysis of the results, using Monte Carlo simulation; and a structure that allows preferences and opinions of involved stakeholders to be openly integrated into the analysis. A major insight from practical application of SCORE is that its most important contribution may be that it initiates a process where criteria otherwise likely ignored are addressed and openly discussed between stakeholders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMonte Carlo method 3aattitudes and opinions 3aindustry 3ainterviews 3amodels 3amulti-criteria decision making 3aremediation 3asocial sustainability 3astakeholders 3auncertainty 3auncertainty analysis 0aSustainable remediation 0aContaminated sites 0aMulti-criteria decision analysis 0aUncertainty analysis 0aSocial sustainability 0aCost–benefit analysis1 aBack, Pär-Erik1 aSöderqvist, Tore,1 aNorrman, Jenny1 aBrinkhoff, Petra1 aNorbert, Tommy,1 aVolchko, Yevheniya1 aNorin, Malin1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0257-75621 aBergknut, Magnus1 aDöberl, Gernot0 tScience of the total environment.g2015 Apr. 01, v. 511 p.621-638dElsevier B.V.x0048-96977nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2014.12.0583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245008100168300001800249520166800267592002801935650002901963650002601992650001102018650001402029650002502043650002602068650002002094650000902114650001502123650002102138650000902159651001802168700002002186700002102206700002902227773008702256856004802343852000902391655001202400IND50059372620221120063932.0140131e201211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5005937262DNAL7 a10.1007/s10021-012-9564-92doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBarantal, Sandra10aNutrient and Carbon Limitation on Decomposition in an Amazonian Moist Forest  ap. 1039-1052.  aTropical forests determine global biogeochemical cycles to a large extent, but control factors for key ecosystem processes such as decomposition remain poorly understood. With a full-factorial C (cellulose), N (urea), and P (phosphate) fertilization experiment, we tested the relative importance of C and nutrient limitation on litter decomposition in a mature lowland moist forest of French Guiana. Despite the previously demonstrated litter C quality control over decomposition and the very low soil P content (0.1 mg g−1 of soil) at our study site, fertilization with C or P alone did not increase the decomposition of a wide range of litter types (N:P ratios between 20 and 80). Nitrogen fertilization alone also had no effect on decomposition. However, the combined fertilization with N and P resulted in up to 33.5% more initial litter mass lost, with an increasing effect with wider litter N:P ratios. Soil fauna strongly stimulated litter mass loss and enhanced nutrient fertilization effects. Moreover, nutrient effects on decomposition increased with additional C fertilization in the presence of fauna. Our results suggest that increased N availability is required for a positive P effect on decomposition in the studied P-poor tropical forest. Further stimulation of decomposition by C amendment through priming indicates energy limitation of decomposers that is co-determined by nutrient availability. The demonstrated intricate control of the key resources C, N, and P on decomposition calls for an intensified research effort on multiple resource limitation on key processes in tropical forests and how they change under multiple human impacts.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanthropogenic activities 3abiogeochemical cycles 3acarbon 3acellulose 3anitrogen fertilizers 3anutrient availability 3aquality control 3asoil 3asoil fauna 3atropical forests 3aurea 3aFrench Guiana1 aSchimann, Heidy1 aFromin, Nathalie1 aHättenschwiler, Stephan0 tEcosystems.g2012 Nov., v. 15, no. 7 p.1039-1052dSpringer-Verlagx1432-98407nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10021-012-9564-9  aDNAL 7aarticle01579naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245006800165300001600233520066000249592002800909650002000937650001800957650001800975650001100993700001901004700001601023700001801039773013001057856008101187852000901268655001201277IND60584597920221118032153.0171026e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058459792DNAL7 a10.1007/s10666-017-9552-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSong, Guofeng10aBlockwise AICc for Model Selection in Generalized Linear Models  ap. 523-533.  aThe corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) is a widely used tool in analyzing environmental and ecological data, and it outperforms the Akaike information criterion (AIC), especially in small-size samples. To take advantage of this property, we propose a modified version of the AICc in a generalized linear model framework, referred to as the blockwise AICc (bAICc). Compared with some other information criteria, extensive simulation results show that the bAICc performs well. We also analyzed two environmental datasets, one for snail survival and the other for fish infection, to illustrate the usefulness of this new model selection criterion.  aPublisher supplied data 3adata collection 3afish diseases 3alinear models 3asnails1 aDong, Xiaogang1 aWu, Jiafeng1 aWang, You-Gan0 tEnvironmental modeling and assessment.g2017 Dec., v. 22, no. 6 p.523-533dSpringer International Publishingx1420-20267nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10666-017-9552-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245011900168300001600287520162000303592002801923650001701951650002501968650001601993650001202009650001302021650003102034650001102065650000902076650001802085650001302103650001102116650001202127650001602139651001102155653001702166653001902183653002402202653002002226773009902246856008102345852000902426655001202435IND60480329520221119103335.0160127e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048032952DNAL7 a10.2478/s10086-008-0010-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRadtke, Grzegorz10aSome Characteristics of Lake Trout Salmo Trutta M.

Redds in the Upper WDA River System (North Poland)  ap. 119-134.  aObservations of lake trout, Salmo trutta m. lacustris L., spawning, including recording redd parameters, were conducted in the 2003-2004 to the 2007-2008 seasons at spawning grounds located in the upper Wda River system. Spawning was noted from mid October to early January at a temperature range of 1.1-10.8°C, but primarily within the 3.0-8.0°C range. Redds were measured following spawning in selected segments of the spawning grounds. The parameters measured were as follows: tailspill size, pot depth, water depth near the tailspill, water velocity above the tailspill. Substrate samples were taken from some of the redds in spring to determine particle size distribution. In total, 51 redds were measured, and substrate samples were collected from fifteen of them. The tailspill length ranged from 40-150 cm, and water depth was from 15 to 55 cm. The geometric mean diameter of the substrate (Dg) ranged from 3.0-17.4 mm, and the sand content (fraction < 1 mm) was from 3.0-36.5%. Water velocity above the redds ranged from 40 to 120 cm s⁻¹, and this differed significantly statistically among the streams investigated; the lowest rates were noted in the upper reaches of the system (Pilica). Furthermore, in this part of the system the mean geometrical diameter of the substrate was twofold smaller and the share of sand twofold higher than in the lower part of the river system. The size of the tailspills was positively correlated with female size, pot depth, and water velocity. In practical terms, it can be generalized that female length corresponded to approximately 55% of the tailspill diameter.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSalmo trutta 3aSalvelinus namaycush 3acorrelation 3afemales 3ageometry 3aparticle size distribution 3arivers 3asand 3asand fraction 3aspawning 3aspring 3astreams 3atemperature 3aPoland 0aSalmo Trutta 0aSpawning Redds 0aSubstrate Structure 0aRedd Dimensions0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 2 p.119-134dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0010-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02539naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001900148245010800167300001400275520123600289592002801525650004401553650001401597650001601611650001501627650004101642650001301683650001101696650001301707650001401720650001601734650002101750650001601771653001901787653001301806653001101819653001301830653000901843653000901852653000901861700001301870773010701883856008201990852000902072655001202081IND60565746320221117065718.0170626e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056574632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNair, Vaishakh10aProduction of guaiacols via catalytic fast pyrolysis of alkali lignin using titania, zirconia and ceria  ap. 31-39.  aThe present study is focused on unlocking value added phenolics such as guaiacol and its derivatives from alkali lignin via in situ catalytic fast pyrolysis using TiO2, CeO2 and ZrO2. TiO2 was synthesized by sol-gel technique and calcined at different temperatures, and CeO2 and ZrO2 were synthesized using combustion synthesis protocol. The catalysts were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, pore size distribution and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fast pyrolysis of physical mixtures of lignin and the catalysts were conducted in a micropyrolyzer and the products were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Seventeen phenolic compounds were quantified using pure standards. Guaiacol, methyl guaiacol, ethyl guaiacol, vinyl guaiacol and isoeugenol were the major phenolics produced at 500°C during catalytic fast pyrolysis. The yield of guaiacols with different catalysts followed the trend: sol-gel TiO2 (36–37wt.%)>ZrO2≈CeO2 (∼29wt.%)>Aeroxide TiO2 (26wt.%)>non-catalytic (18wt.%). The high selectivity of TiO2 to guaiacols is attributed to multiple interdependent properties such as presence of surface hydroxyl groups, favourable pore size distribution and crystalline phase.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acatalysts 3aceric oxide 3acombustion 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aguaiacol 3alignin 3aporosity 3apyrolysis 3atemperature 3atitanium dioxide 3avalue added 0aFast pyrolysis 0aCatalyst 0aLignin 0aGuaiacol 0aTiO2 0aCeO2 0aZrO21 aVinu, R.0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 May, v. 119 p.31-39dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02083naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100003100147245008900178300001600267520103000283592002801313650001101341650001401352650001601366650000901382650001401391650001201405650000901417650001001426653001201436653001401448653000901462653002201471700002701493773009901520856008101619852000901700655001201709IND60480329620221119103219.0160127e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048032962DNAL7 a10.2478/s10086-008-0011-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCzerniejewski, Przemysław10aFecundity Of Vendace, Coregonus Albula (L.), From Several Lakes In Western Pomerania  ap. 135-146.  aThe aim of the study was to determine individual absolute and relative fecundity in vendace, Coregonus albula (L.), populations from four Western Pomeranian lakes that differ morphometrically and trophically. The highest mean total length and individual weight were recorded in the fish from the mesotrophic lakes Ińsko (229.1 mm and 106.6 g, respectively) and Miedwie (228.1 mm and 105.1 g, respectively). The highest individual absolute fecundity in particular age groups as well as individual relative fecundity were noted in the fish from Lake Miedwie (6635-24620 eggs per female and 10756-11609 eggs per 100 g female body weight, respectively), while the lowest values of these parameters were confirmed in fish from Lake Glinna (4782-6087 eggs per female and 6406-6953 eggs per 100 g female body weight). A high, statistically significant correlation between absolute fecundity and total fish length and a slightly lower correlation between absolute fecundity and fish age were noted in all of the populations studied.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlbula 3aCoregonus 3abody weight 3aeggs 3afecundity 3afemales 3afish 3alakes 0aVendace 0aFecundity 0aLake 0aWestern Pomerania1 aWawrzyniak, Wawrzyniec0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 2 p.135-146dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0011-73Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02792naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092040001800120100001700138245010900155300001600264500001900280520135900299592002801658650001501686650001301701650002001714650001101734650001401745650001601759650001201775650002701787650001601814650001301830650001301843650001401856650002401870650000901894650003201903650001301935650001701948650001701965650001001982651001001992700001302002700001602015700001402031700001602045700001702061700001602078773010602094856004102200852000902241655001202250IND6036793420221120162022.0210616e201203  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND603679342DNAL7 a10.1093/pcp/pcs0032doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Xiuxia10aDrought-Induced Root Aerenchyma Formation Restricts Water Uptake in Rice Seedlings Supplied with Nitrate  ap. 495-504.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aPrevious studies demonstrated that ammonium nutrition results in higher water uptake rate than does nitrate nutrition under water stress, and thus enhances the tolerance of rice plants to water stress. However, the process by which water uptake is related to nitrogen form under water stress remains unknown. A hydroponic experiment with simulated water stress induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG6000) was conducted in a greenhouse to study the relationship between root aerenchyma formation and water uptake rate, such as xylem sap flow rate and hydraulic conductance, in two different rice cultivars (cv. ‘Shanyou 63’ hybrid indica and cv. ‘Yangdao 6’ indica, China). The results showed that root aerenchyma tissue increased in water-stressed plants of both cultivars fed by nitrate. No significant difference was found in root hydraulic conductivity and/or xylem sap flow rate between the two rice cultivars fed by ammonium regardless of water status, whereas these parameters decreased significantly in water-stressed plants fed by nitrate. It was concluded that aerenchyma that formed in the root cortex impeded the radial transport of water in the root cylinder and decreased water uptake in water-stressed rice plants fed by nitrate. Water transport occurred mainly through Hg-sensitive water channels in rice roots supplied with ammonium.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaerenchyma 3aammonium 3acell physiology 3acortex 3acultivars 3agreenhouses 3ahybrids 3ahydraulic conductivity 3ahydroponics 3anitrates 3anitrogen 3anutrition 3apolyethylene glycol 3arice 3aroot hydraulic conductivity 3asap flow 3awater stress 3awater uptake 3axylem 3aChina1 aLi, Yong1 aRen, Binbin1 aDing, Lei1 aGao, Cuimin1 aShen, Qirong1 aGuo, Shiwei0 tPlant & cell physiology.g2012 Mar., v. 53, no. 3 p.495-504dOxford University Pressx0032-07817nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pcp/pcs003  aDNAL 7aarticle02481naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245013400187300001600321500001500337520135700352592002801709650000901737650001501746650001701761650001001778650002201788650002001810651001301830651001401843651001401857651001301871653001501884700002201899773008401921856008102005852000902086655001202095IND60081849720221118055926.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008184972DNAL7 a252140202pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-014-9785-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShreve, Scott M.10aPopulation genetics of bisexual and unisexual populations of the scaly-winged bark louse Echmepteryx hageni (Insecta: Psocoptera)  ap. 405-418.  a2019-12-06  aThe scaly-winged bark louse, Echmepteryx hageni, exhibits a unique pattern of co-existence of apparently differnt reproductive modes. Unisexuality is widespread in eastern North America, while sexual populations are restricted to isolated rock out-croppings in southern Illinois and eastern Kentucky. Three of the four nuclear loci examined show greater genetic diversity in the unisexual form compared to the sexual form of E. hageni, in accordance with the pattern previously shown in mitochondrial genetic data. Neutrality tests of the nuclear loci indicate a consistent signal of demographic expansion in asexual populations, but not in sexual populations. There was evidence of inbreeding in the isolated sexual populations at three of the nuclear loci, and one locus had signs of gene specific balancing selection. However, there is no significant genetic differentiation between bisexual and unisexual populations, possibly due to the greater effective population size of nuclear loci relative to mitochondrial loci. The mitochondrial differentiation of E. hageni populations in the northwestern part of their range (Minnesota and Wisconsin) was also not reflected in the nuclear data. We present three hypotheses that may explain the disparity in observed nuclear and mitochondrial genetic diversity between the reproductive forms of E. hageni.  aPublisher supplied data 3aloci 3ainbreeding 3aunisexuality 3agenes 3agenetic variation 3apopulation size 3aIllinois 3aMinnesota 3aWisconsin 3aKentucky 0aPsocoptera1 aJohnson, Kevin P.0 tGenetica.g2014 Oct., v. 142, no. 5 p.405-418dSpringer-Verlagx0016-67077nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10709-014-9785-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02210naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245012900169300001600298520097100314592002801285650002401313650002001337650001201357650001101369650002601380650000901406650001701415650000901432650001401441650000901455653001701464653001201481653000901493653002101502653002001523700002701543700002901570773009901599856008101698852000901779655001201788IND60480329820221119103014.0160127e20081230xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6048032982DNAL7 a10.2478/s10086-008-0013-52doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBochenek, Izabela10aStudies on the Bioavailability of Heavy Metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn) from Bottom Sediments to Guppies, Poecilia Reticulata Peters  ap. 155-166.  aThe experiment was carried out to determine the potential of heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn) passing from bottom sediments to fish and to identify the correlations between concentrations of these metals in bottom sediments and those in fish. The study material consisted of guppies Poecilia reticulata Peters and bottom sediments with known concentrations of the determined metals in particular fractions. As result of the 60-day exposure of the fish to environments with bottom sediments containing various heavy metals loads, an increasing trend was observable for cadmium and lead concentrations in guppies. Comparative analysis showed that the degree of bottom sediment heavy metal contamination influenced concentrations of these in the guppies. It was found that even small changes in environmental conditions affected the release of metals from bottom sediments, which resulted in notable differences in the concentrations of the examined metals in the fish.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPoecilia reticulata 3abioavailability 3acadmium 3acopper 3aenvironmental factors 3afish 3aheavy metals 3alead 3asediments 3azinc 0aHeavy Metals 0aGuppies 0aFish 0aBottom Sediments 0aBioavailability1 aProtasowicki, Mikołaj1 aBrucka-Jastrzębska, Ewa0 tArchiwum rybactwa polskiego =.g2008 Dec. 30, v. 16, no. 2 p.155-166dVersitax2083-61397nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s10086-008-0013-53Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02806naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001600139245011500155300001600270500002000286520149000306592002801796650001601824650001101840650001501851650001301866650001601879650001501895650001901910650001701929650001701946650001401963700001601977700001501993700001202008700001502020700001802035700001902053700001602072700002702088700001302115700001702128773010902145856007302254852000902327655001202336IND60571550920221119081721.0170712e201701  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057155092DNAL7 a10.1111/pce.128542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Ying10aClathrin regulates blue light‐triggered lateral auxin distribution and hypocotyl phototropism in Arabidopsis  ap. 165-176.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPhototropism is the process by which plants grow towards light in order to maximize the capture of light for photosynthesis, which is particularly important for germinating seedlings. In Arabidopsis, hypocotyl phototropism is predominantly triggered by blue light (BL), which has a profound effect on the establishment of asymmetric auxin distribution, essential for hypocotyl phototropism. Two auxin efflux transporters ATP‐binding cassette B19 (ABCB19) and PIN‐formed 3 (PIN3) are known to mediate the effect of BL on auxin distribution in the hypocotyl, but the details for how BL triggers PIN3 lateralization remain poorly understood. Here, we report a critical role for clathrin in BL‐triggered, PIN3‐mediated asymmetric auxin distribution in hypocotyl phototropism. We show that unilateral BL induces relocalization of clathrin in the hypocotyl. Loss of clathrin light chain 2 (CLC2) and CLC3 affects endocytosis and lateral distribution of PIN3 thereby impairing BL‐triggered establishment of asymmetric auxin distribution and consequently, phototropic bending. Conversely, auxin efflux inhibitors N‐1‐naphthylphthalamic acid and 2,3,5‐triiodobenzoic acid affect BL‐induced relocalization of clathrin, endocytosis and lateralization of PIN3 as well as asymmetric distribution of auxin. These results together demonstrate an important interplay between auxin and clathrin function that dynamically regulates BL‐triggered hypocotyl phototropism in Arabidopsis.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis 3aauxins 3ablue light 3aclathrin 3aendocytosis 3ahypocotyls 3aphotosynthesis 3aphototropism 3aplant growth 3aseedlings1 aYu, QinQin,1 aJiang, Nan1 aYan, Xu1 aWang, Chao1 aWang, Qingmei1 aLiu, Jianzhong1 aZhu, Muyuan1 aBednarek, Sebastian Y.1 aXu, Jian1 aPan, Jianwei0 tPlant, cell and environment.g2017 Jan., v. 40, no. 1 p.165-176dJohn Wiley & Sons, Ltdx0140-77917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.128543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03202naa a2200565 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100001700139245013700156300001800293500002000311520144000331592002801771650002401799650001601823650003001839650001201869650001201881650001601893650002701909650002101936650001501957650002501972650001301997650001402010650001902024650000702043650001502050650003302065700002002098700002302118700002102141700002102162700002102183700002102204700001902225700002302244700002502267700002602292700002602318700002402344700002502368773014902393856007302542852000902615655001202624IND60592806920221122085508.0180413e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059280692DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.54872doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSaha, Amrita10aSimultaneous sequestration of nitrate and phosphate from wastewater using a tailor‐made bacterial consortium in biofilm bioreactor  ap. 1279-1289.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Municipal wastewater usually contains nitrate and phosphate as major contaminants, and if discharged untreated affects the health of the environment and human population. Currently available treatment technologies to treat municipal wastewater lose the essential growth nutrients ‘P’ and ‘N’ during treatment. This paper presents a strategy of simultaneous sequestration of nitrate and phosphate in biomass, by using a tailor‐made consortium in a biofilm reactor. RESULTS: The consortium comprising of three novel Bacillus strains in a fixed bed biofilm bioreactor maintained at ambient temperature showed reduction up to 94% of nitrate, 68% of phosphate, 93% of chemical oxygen demand, 97% of biochemical oxygen demand, 73% in total organic carbon while maintaining an effluent pH of 6.8 ± 0.02. Response surface methodology revealed maximum reduction at a flow rate of 1.97 L h‐¹ with 306.04 mg L‐¹ and 19.62 mg L‐¹ of initial nitrate and phosphate concentrations respectively. The system was scaled up from 4.5 L to 220 L with the same retention time of 2 h and operated with consistent performance for over 212 days. CONCLUSION: The treated wastewater met the criterion for reuse as non‐potable water for applications like irrigation and aquaculture, hence making it the fastest microbial process for simultaneous nitrate and phosphate removal from wastewater. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3aaquaculture 3abiochemical oxygen demand 3abiofilm 3abiomass 3abioreactors 3achemical oxygen demand 3ahuman population 3airrigation 3amunicipal wastewater 3anitrates 3anutrients 3aorganic carbon 3apH 3aphosphates 3aresponse surface methodology1 aBhushan, Shashi1 aMukherjee, Pallavi1 aChanda, Chaitali1 aBhaumik, Moumita1 aGhosh, Madhurima1 aSharmin, Jaweria1 aDatta, Poulami1 aBanerjee, Srimoyee1 aBarat, Parthasarathi1 aThakur, Ashoke Ranjan1 aGantayet, Lalit Mohan1 aMukherjee, Indranil1 aRay Chaudhuri, Shaon0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1279-1289dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.54873Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02544naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100007800148245007100226300001600297520132200313592002801635650002101663650000901684650002301693650001501716650001101731650001901742650001801761650000901779650001801788650000901806651001101815653002601826653002101852653002101873700003101894773012901925856008302054852000902137655001202146IND60533763620221118221940.0190412e201411  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053376362DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jveb.2014.08.0022doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález Ramírez, Mónica Teresa1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9058-962610aBenefits of dog ownership: Comparative study of equivalent samples  ap. 311-315.  aOwing to the inconclusive findings of research regarding the health benefits of pet ownership, we compared perceived health, stress, life satisfaction, happiness, and psychosomatic symptoms in dog owners and non–dog owners. As an attempt to overcome some earlier methodological issues, the sample consisted of 602 individuals from Mexico aged ≥18 years (377 dog owners and 225 non–dog owners). These 2 groups were equivalent in age, gender, educational level, marital status, employment, parental status, and the presence of chronic illness. The results indicated that, compared to non–dog owners, the dog owners' scores were significantly lower for psychosomatic symptoms and stress and were higher for general health, vitality, emotional role, absence of bodily pain, social functioning, and mental health. No significant difference between groups was found for life satisfaction, happiness, physical functioning, or physical role. Group differences might occur because individuals who perceive themselves to be healthier also choose to have a pet; nevertheless, 273 (72.6%) had owned a pet during the previous 5 years, and 86 (22.8% of the overall sample) reported that they had always owned dogs. In conclusion, the dog owners perceived themselves as healthier—but not happier—than non–dog owners.  aPublisher supplied data 3achronic diseases 3adogs 3aeducational status 3aemployment 3agender 3amarital status 3amental health 3apain 3apet ownership 3apets 3aMexico 0ahuman-dog interaction 0aperceived health 0aperceived stress1 aLandero Hernández, René,0 tJournal of veterinary behavior.g2014 Nov.,  Dec., v. 9, no. 6 p.311-315dElsevier Inc.wJournal:J000000117x1558-78787nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jveb.2014.08.0023Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03321naa a2200541 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100002700187245012300214300001200337500001500349506007600364520161900440592002802059506003702087650002802124650003002152650000902182650001402191650002602205650002802231650001002259650002702269650002202296650002302318650002102341650001302362650002202375650002002397650002602417653001002443700002002453700002102473700001802494700001902512700001802531700001802549700002002567773009102587856008002678852000902758655001202767IND60555751320221207050156.0161029e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055575132DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-13-2302doi7 aPMC39234412pmcid7 a243774982pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJayatilake, Dimanthi V10aGenetic mapping and marker development for resistance of wheat against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus  ap. 230.  a2019-12-06  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: The Rlnn1 locus, which resides on chromosome 7A of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) confers moderate resistance against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus neglectus. Prior to this research, the exact linkage relationships of Rlnn1 with other loci on chromosome 7A were not clear and there were no simple codominant markers available for selection of Rlnn1 in wheat breeding. The objectives of the research reported here were to (1) develop an improved genetic map of the Rlnn1 region of chromosome 7A and (2) develop molecular markers that could be used in marker-assisted selection to improve resistance of wheat against P. neglectus. RESULTS: A large-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance against P. neglectus was genetically mapped using a population of Excalibur/Kukri doubled haploid lines. This QTL coincides in position with the rust resistance gene(s) Lr20/Sr15, the phytoene synthase gene Psy-A1 and 10 molecular markers, including five new markers designed using wheat-rice comparative genomics and wheat expressed sequence tags. Two of the new markers are suitable for use as molecular diagnostic tools to distinguish plants that carry Rlnn1 and Lr20/Sr15 from those that do not carry these resistance genes. CONCLUSIONS: The genomic location of Rlnn1 was confirmed to be in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7A. Molecular markers were developed that provide simple alternatives to costly phenotypic assessment of resistance against P. neglectus in wheat breeding. In Excalibur, genetic recombination seems to be completely suppressed in the Rlnn1 region.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aquantitative trait loci 3amarker-assisted selection 3aloci 3aphenotype 3aroot lesion nematodes 3aexpressed sequence tags 3awheat 3aPratylenchus neglectus 3aTriticum aestivum 3achromosome mapping 3adoubled haploids 3agenomics 3aphytoene synthase 3agenetic markers 3agenetic recombination 0agenes1 aTucker, Elise J1 aBariana, Harbans1 aKuchel, Haydn1 aEdwards, James1 aMcKay, Alan C1 aChalmers, Ken1 aMather, Diane E0 tBMC plant biology.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.230-230dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-13-2303Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002200166245011700188300001600305520091000321592002801231650001501259650001401274650001101288650002501299650001201324700003001336700003001366700003301396773008401429856008101513852000901594655001201603IND60081850220221120202515.0141014e201410  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008185022DNAL7 a252237512pmid7 a10.1007/s10709-014-9791-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCordeiro, Juliana10aChromosomal evolution in the Drosophila cardini group (Diptera: Drosophilidae): photomaps and inversion analysis  ap. 461-472.  aDetailed chromosome photomaps are the first step to develop further chromosomal analysis to study the evolution of the genetic architecture in any set of species, considering that chromosomal rearrangements, such as inversions, are common features of genome evolution.

METHODS: We undertook a literature review concerning the roles and the importance of stakeholders in participatory processes, and the use of such processes in environmental and social LCAs (Biswas et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 3(4):184-190, 1998; Sonnemann et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 6(6):325-333, 2001; Baldo Int J Life Cycle Assess 7(5):269-275, 2002; James et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 7(3):151-157, 2002; Bras-Kapwijk Int J Life Cycle Assess 8(5):266-272, 2003; Mettier et al. Int J Life Cycle Assess 11(6):468-476, 2006). As part of the French National Research Agency Piscenlit project, we adapted the Principle, Criteria, Indicator (PCI) method (Rey-Valette et al. 2008), which is an assessment method of sustainable development, as a way to integrate the participatory approach into Social Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA) methodology, mainly at the impact definition stage. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Different views of participation were found in the literature; there is no consensual normative approach for the implication of stakeholders in LCA development. Some attempts have been made to integrate stakeholders into environmental LCAs but these attempts have not been generalized. However, they strongly emphasize the interrelationship between research on the growing integration of stakeholders and on the choice of stakeholders. We then propose criteria from stakeholder theory (Freeman 1984; Mitchell et al. Acad Manage Rev 22(4):853-886, 1997; Geibler et al. Bus Strat Environ 15:334-346, 2006) in order to identify relevant stakeholders for SLCA participatory approach. The adaptation of the PCI method to Principles, Impacts, and Indicators (PII) enables stakeholders to express themselves and hence leads to definitions of relevant social indicators that they can appropriate. The paper presents results regarding the selection of stakeholders but no specific results regarding the choice of impact categories and indicators. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Integrating a participatory approach into SLCAs is of interest at several levels. It enables various factors to be taken into account: plurality of stakeholder interests, local knowledge, and impact categories that make sense for stakeholders in different contexts. It also promotes dialogue and simplifies the search for indicators. However, it requires a multidisciplinary approach and the integration of new knowledge and skills for the SLCA practitioners.  aPublisher supplied data 3alife cycle assessment 3asocial environment 3astakeholders 3asustainable development0 tinternational journal of life cycle assessment.g2014 Aug., v. 19, no. 8 p.1506-1514dSpringer-Verlagx0948-33497nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11367-014-0758-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01963naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100002500140245010700165300001600272500001100288520098200299592002801281650002401309650001401333650001501347650003101362650002401393650001201417700002301429773011401452856007401566852000901640655001201649IND60642838220221118042241.0190508e200503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064283822DNAL7 a10.1007/BF027037092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChowdhury, Debashish10aEvolutionary ecologyin silico: Does mathematical modelling help in understanding ‘generic’ trends?  ap. 277-287.  aReview  aMotivated by the results of recent laboratory experiments, as well as many earlier field observations, that evolutionary changes can take place in ecosystems over relatively short ecological time scales, several ‘unified’ mathematical models of evolutionary ecology have been developed over the last few years with the aim of describing the statistical properties of data related to the evolution of ecosystems. Moreover, because of the availability of sufficiently fast computers, it has become possible to carry out detailed computer simulations of these models. For the sake of completeness and to put these recent developments in perspective, we begin with a brief summary of some older models of ecological phenomena and evolutionary processes. However, the main aim of this article is to review critically these ‘unified’ models, particularly those published in the physics literature, in simple language that makes the new theories accessible to a wider audience  aPublisher supplied data 3acomputer simulation 3acomputers 3aecosystems 3alaboratory experimentation 3amathematical models 3aphysics1 aStauffer, Dietrich0 tJournal of biosciences.g2005 Mar., v. 30, no. 2 p.277-287dSpringer IndiawJournal:jnl31976x0250-59917nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF027037093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02919naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003400094024002200128024001900150040001800169100001900187245014500206300001200351506007600363520151300439592002801952506003701980650001402017650000802031650002202039650001602061650001402077650002602091650001902117650001502136650002102151650001102172650001602183700002002199700003102219700002102250700002202271773009102293856008002384852000902464655001202473IND60555751520221207045614.0161029e201312  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055575152DNAL7 a10.1186/1471-2229-13-2192doi7 aPMC39300652pmcid7 a243544672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDyer, Robert J10aGenome size expansion and the relationship between nuclear DNA content and spore size in the Asplenium monanthes fern complex (Aspleniaceae)  ap. 219.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Homosporous ferns are distinctive amongst the land plant lineages for their high chromosome numbers and enigmatic genomes. Genome size measurements are an under exploited tool in homosporous ferns and show great potential to provide an overview of the mechanisms that define genome evolution in these ferns. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of genome size and the relationship between genome size and spore size within the apomictic Asplenium monanthes fern complex and related lineages. RESULTS: Comparative analyses to test for a relationship between spore size and genome size show that they are not correlated. The data do however provide evidence for marked genome size variation between species in this group. These results indicate that Asplenium monanthes has undergone a two-fold expansion in genome size. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings challenge the widely held assumption that spore size can be used to infer ploidy levels within apomictic fern complexes. We argue that the observed genome size variation is likely to have arisen via increases in both chromosome number due to polyploidy and chromosome size due to amplification of repetitive DNA (e.g. transposable elements, especially retrotransposons). However, to date the latter has not been considered to be an important process of genome evolution within homosporous ferns. We infer that genome evolution, at least in some homosporous fern lineages, is a more dynamic process than existing studies would suggest.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAsplenium 3aDNA 3achromosome number 3achromosomes 3aevolution 3aferns and fern allies 3anuclear genome 3apolyploidy 3aretrotransposons 3aspores 3atransposons1 aPellicer, Jaume1 aSavolainen, V.q(Vincent),1 aLeitch, Ilia J.,1 aSchneider, Harald0 tBMC plant biology.g2013 Dec., v. 13, no. 1 p.219-219dBioMed Centralx1471-22297nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2229-13-2193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02442naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002800148245010000176300001600276520098100292592002801273650004401301650001901345650002001364650004101384650002201425650001301447650001901460650001401479650001401493650001701507650001901524653001401543653001601557653002101573653001601594653001601610700004001626700002401666700003001690700003101720700002101751773010901772856008201881852000901963655001201972IND60565747120221117070114.0170626e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056574712DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColman, Maristela Denck10aEvolved gas analysis (TG-DSC-FTIR) and (Pyr-GC–MS) in the disposal of medicines (aceclofenac)  ap. 157-161.  aDuring the twentieth century the growth of industrialisation, urbanisation and populations culminated in huge areas of waste disposal worldwide. Consequently, the management of the disposal of medicines (expired or not) is important in order to minimise the possibility of environmental pollution. A sample of aceclofenac (purity=99.77% and m.p.=151.63°C) was analysed by TG-DSC-FTIR in nitrogen atmosphere. The TG-DSC curves showed two main stages of decomposition, with loss of organic matter generating carbonaceous derivatives as final residue. The use of coupled FTIR suggested the loss of CO, CO2 and/or 2-chloro-propanoic acid/2-chloro-butanoic acid. The use of fast pyrolysis (Pyr) coupled with GC–MS suggested that the main compounds that were released were 1-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-2-indolinone and 2,6-dichloro-N-(2-methylphenyl)–benzenamine. The differences in the results between the techniques were due to the experimental conditions used for each instrument.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3acarbon dioxide 3acarbon monoxide 3agas chromatography-mass spectrometry 3aindustrialization 3anitrogen 3aorganic matter 3apollution 3apyrolysis 3aurbanization 3awaste disposal 0aPyrolysis 0aAceclofenac 0aThermal analysis 0aTG-DSC-FTIR 0aPyr-GC–MS1 aLazzarotto, Simone Rosa da Silveira1 aLazzarotto, Marcelo1 aHansel, Fabrício Augusto1 aColman, Tiago André Denck1 aSchnitzler, Egon0 tJournal of analytical and applied pyrolysis.g2016 May, v. 119 p.157-161dElsevier B.V.x0165-23707nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaap.2016.03.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle00951naa a2200241 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245006200171300001600233520020900249592002800458650001600486650001300502650001400515773010400529856005500633852000900688655001200697IND4478334620221121195124.0120602e201206  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447833462DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1529-8817.2012.01168.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aColeman, A.

However, there are many questions about the economic properties of the oxy-combustion technique. In this paper, a detailed techno-economic evaluation study was performed on three typical power plants (2 Ã 300 MW subcritical, 2 Ã 600 MW supercritical, 2 Ã 1000 MW ultra supercritical), as conventional air fired and oxycombustion options in China, by utilizing the authoritative data published in 2010 for the design of coal-fired power plants. Techno-economic evaluation models were set up and costs of electricity generation, CO2 avoidance costs as well as CO2 capture costs, were calculated. Moreover, the effects of CO2 tax and CO2 sale price on the economic characteristics of oxy-combustion power plants were also considered. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for parameters such as coal sample, coal price, air separation unit price, flue gas treatment unit price, CO2 capture efficiency, as well as the air excess factor was conducted. The results revealed that: (1) because the oxy-combustion technique has advantages in thermal efficiency, desulfurization efficiency and denitration efficiency, oxy-combustion power plants will reach the economic properties of conventional air fired power plants if, (a) the CO2 emission is taxed and the high purity CO2 product can be sold, or (b) there are some policy preferences in financing and coal price for oxy-combustion power plants, or (c) the power consumption and cost of air separation units and flue gas treatment units can be reduced; (2) from subcritical plants to supercritical and finally ultra-supercritical plants, the economics are improving, regardless of whether they are conventional air fired power plants or oxy-combustion power plants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3acarbon dioxide 3acoal 3acombustion 3aelectricity 3afunding 3aissues and policy 3amodels 3apower plants 3aprices 3aChina1 aZhao, Haibo,1 aZheng, Chuguang,0 tChinese science bulletin.g2011 Nov., v. 56, no. 31 p.3333-3345dSpringer-Verlagx1001-65387nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11434-011-4707-5  aDNAL 7aarticle02383naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245008000172300001400252500001400266520105500280592002801335650001201363650001301375650001601388650002201404650001801426650000701444650001801451650001401469650001201483650001501495650001201510650001601522650001401538650001001552650001901562653002001581653002601601653001401627700002501641700002101666700002401687773009601711856008501807852000901892655001201901IND60724134820221120072643.0210305e202105  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6072413482DNAL7 a10.1016/j.powtec.2021.01.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMalta, Juliana O.10aCharacterization and stabilization of nano-metakaolin colloidal suspensions  ap. 43-55.  aNAL-light  aNanometric powders bear significant problems in the efficiency of dispersion. The ideal situation would be to ensure full nanoparticle separation in suspensions or composites matrix, which is hard to achieve due to the high reactivity and aggregation. This study evaluates the conditions to stabilize nano-metakaolin (NMK) in water suspension by analyzing the influence of solute concentration, pH, type and content of dispersants. Potentiometric titration curves, zeta potential and average particle size measurements were performed, along with rheological measurements, at different times: 0 h, 3 h, 6 h and 24 h. NMK particles showed the same tendency of surface charge distribution, regardless of solute concentration. The dispersed NMK particles presented two isoelectric points, attributed to the multiple arrangements they form when in suspension. Polycarboxylate (PC) was the dispersant that provided greater dispersion stability. Regarding the rheological and zeta potential measurements, the suspensions presented stability up to 24 h.  aPublisher supplied data 3aUrsidae 3acolloids 3adispersants 3aisoelectric point 3ananoparticles 3apH 3aparticle size 3aparticles 3apowders 3aseparation 3asolutes 3asuspensions 3atitration 3awater 3azeta potential 0aNano-metakaolin 0aColloidal suspensions 0aStability1 aOliveira, Lucas V.S.1 aUeki, Marcelo M.1 aBarreto, Ledjane S.0 tPowder technology.g2021 May, v. 383 p.43-55dElsevier B.V.wJournal:11732x0032-59107nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2021.01.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01380naa a2200337 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245007300170300001600243520031800259592002800577650002300605650001700628650001700645650004400662653004800706653002800754653001500782700001700797700001600814700001800830700001400848773010800862856005100970852000901021655001201030IND50075876720221120041253.0140410e20120401xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5007587672DNAL7 a10.1080/14786419.2010.5515132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYang, Dong-Juan12aA new ent-kaurane diterpenoid from Rabdosia pseudo-irrorata C.

Larvae were treated in a specific device at a temperature range of 46 to 70°C. Statistical analysis of the data demonstrated that the thermal survival kinetics was best represented by a 2-parameter Weibull model above 50°C. The mortality of larvae only occurs beyond a critical temperature of 41.6°C±2.5°C. A 2D axial-symmetric model of heat transfer (convection, microwave at 915MHz) was developed for cocoa bean and date palm. It was combined with the survival rate of larvae (Weibull model) and some z-values (from literature) are used for calculating a “food quality index” degradation kinetics. The intensive heating/convection process may not be adaptable for food products at low water activity due to high surface product temperatures. The use of microwave heating for date fruits and conventional hot air treatments for cocoa beans is recommended.  aPublisher supplied data 3asurvival rate 3amodels 3afood quality 3aheat transfer 3acocoa beans 3aair 3adried fruit 3adates (fruit) 3alarvae 3aWeibull statistics 3asurface temperature 3aEphestia kuehniella 3awater activity 3aheat treatment 0astatistical analysis1 aMéot, Jean-Michel,1 aCollignan, Antoine1 aBohuon, Philippe0 tFood research international.g2011 Jan., v. 44, no. 1 p.156-166dElsevier Ltdx0963-99697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2010.10.0473Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01828naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245007000166300001600236520046900252592002800721650003000749650000800779650001400787650002500801650002800826650001000854650000900864650001800873653001800891653000800909653001600917653001800933653001100951653001400962700001600976700001600992700001901008700002201027700001701049700001601066700005801082700001601140773009601156856008501252852000901337655001201346IND60544342020221119142329.0190415e201412  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6054434202DNAL7 a10.1016/j.margen.2014.07.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGomes, A.S.10aTranscriptome of the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus)  ap. 101-103.  aAlthough the Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) is an important commercial species, there is still a deficit with regard to the number of transcripts in the databases, which can be accessed and exploited for targeted candidate gene and pathway studies.

The pure and ZNPs doped FLC cells have been analyzed by means of dielectric spectroscopy, polarizing optical microscopy and electrical resistance/conductivity measurements. The memory behavior in ZNPs/FLC composite was confirmed by dielectric dispersion, electrical, and optical studies, whereas dielectric loss spectra confirmed the disappearance of the low-frequency relaxation peak, which appears due to the presence of ionic impurities in FLC materials. The observed memory effect has been attributed to minimization of the depolarization field and ionic charges, whereas the reduction of ionic effects has been attributed to the strong adsorption of ionic impurities on the surface of ZNPs. The ZNPs dispersed in FLCs may play a role in trapping the impurity ions (minimize the depolarization fields) under applied voltage and cause a better memory effect in ZNPs doped FLC material. Moreover, the ion adsorption capability of ZNPs is found to be almost independent of temperature as the value of resistance did not change remarkably on increasing the temperature. The reduction of ionic impurities of FLCs by doping ZNPs did not show degradation over time, as we repeated the experiments on the same sample cells after many days and did not find ionic effects in the ZNPs doped FLC materials. These studies would be helpful to provide an idea for designing ionic impurity-free memory devices.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acomputer hardware 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrical resistance 3aions 3alight microscopy 3aliquid crystals 3ananoparticles 3atemperature 3azirconium oxide1 aPrakash, Jai1 aGanguly, Prasun1 aBiradar, Ashok M.0 tRSC advances.g2013 Sept. 9, v. 3, no. 38 p.17166-17173dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26898x2046-20697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c3ra41964a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02756naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100002100148245015800169300001400327520136000341592002801701650001701729650001301746650001401759650002401773650001701797650002301814650001601837650001601853650002001869650001001889650001201899650001001911650001501921650002501936650002401961700002301985700002502008700001802033700002002051700002402071773011002095856008402205852000902289655001202298IND4478962820221121202406.0141112e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447896282DNAL7 a10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.06.0062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMohapatra, Sipra10aFenvalerate induced stress mitigation by dietary supplementation of multispecies probiotic mixture in a tropical freshwater fish, Labeo rohita (Hamilton)  ap. 28-37.  aFive experimental diets with various combinations of probiotics, namely T1 & T6 (basal feed (BF) without probiotics), T2 & T7 (BF+Bacillus subtilis+Lactococcus lactis), T3 & T8 (BF+L. lactis+Saccharomyces cerevisiae), T4 & T9(BF+B. subtilis+S. cerevisiae) and T5 & T10 (BF+B. subtilis+L. lactis+S. cerevisiae) were fed to Labeo rohita fingerlings for 30days. Treatment groups T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 were exposed to Fenvalerate, at a concentration of 1.79μgL⁻¹. The SOD and CAT activity was significantly affected (P<0.01) in fenvalerate treated groups. However, the supplementation of the three-probiotic mixture at equal concentration showed markedly reduced activity. Similarly, RBC, Hb, NBT, total protein and albumin values were reduced significantly (P<0.01) in the fenvalerate exposed fish as compared to the probiotic supplemented fish. Fenvalerate exposure also showed increased serum ALP, ACP and Bilirubin values (P<0.01) in comparison to the non-exposed fish. Histological observations of the gills, kidney and liver showed tissue degeneration after fenvalerate exposure, which however showed marked recovery on the three-probiotic mixture supplementation. Therefore, these results indicate that a mixture of multi-species probiotic supplementation in equal concentration acts beneficially in mitigating the stressful effects of fenvalerate.  aPublisher supplied data 3aLabeo rohita 3aalbumins 3abilirubin 3adietary supplements 3aerythrocytes 3aexperimental diets 3afenvalerate 3afingerlings 3afreshwater fish 3agills 3akidneys 3aliver 3aprobiotics 3asuperoxide dismutase 3atissue degeneration1 aChakraborty, Tapas1 aPrusty, Ashisa Kumar1 aKundan Kumar,1 aPani Prasad, K.1 aMohanta, Kedar Nath0 tPesticide biochemistry and physiology.g2012 Sept., v. 104, no. 1 p.28-37dElsevier Inc.x0048-35757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pestbp.2012.06.0063Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02675naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245017700161300001800338500002000356520134600376592002801722650002401750650001701774650001701791650002301808650002101831650001301852650002001865650002101885650001901906650001801925650001201943650001301955650001401968700002401982700002802006773014902034856007302183852000902256655001202265IND60592807620221122143312.0180413e201805  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6059280762DNAL7 a10.1002/jctb.55092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aApriceno, Azzurra10aDesign of a heterogeneous enzymatic catalyst on chitosan: investigation of the role of conjugation chemistry in the catalytic activity of a Laccase from Trametes versicolor  ap. 1413-1420.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aBACKGROUND: Three protocols are presented in order to immobilise a laccase (EC 1.10.3.2) from Trametes versicolor on chitosan. In particular, chitosan is functionalized with glutaraldehyde and epichlorohydrin to explore to what extent the conjugation of the enzyme is affected by a carbonyl‐ or epoxy‐modified surface, respectively. In addition, an oxidation procedure is tested to modify, for the first time, the carbohydrate moiety of the enzyme and exploit it for linking with the amine group of chitosan. RESULTS: The system in which laccase is directly conjugated to chitosan seems to be the best‐performing since it is able to maintain 100% of initial activity over a 30 day period and at least 50% of the starting activity after 3 catalytic cycles. CONCLUSION: The methods show the capability to develop three biocatalysts suitable for the immobilization of laccase. All of them provide covalent bonds that don't inactivate the enzyme through any conformational change and any distortion of the active pocket. Specifically, the oxidation procedure proves to be feasible for the preparation of stabilized glycoproteins without the introduction of foreign molecules, suggesting that the carbohydrate moiety of laccase does not appear to be closely related to the catalytic site of the protein. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry  aPublisher supplied data 3aCoriolus versicolor 3aactive sites 3abiocatalysts 3acatalytic activity 3achemical bonding 3achitosan 3aenzyme activity 3aepichlorohydrins 3aglutaraldehyde 3aglycoproteins 3alaccase 3amoieties 3aoxidation1 aGirelli, Anna Maria1 aScuto, Francesca Romana0 tJournal of chemical technology and biotechnology.g2018 May, v. 93, no. 5 p.1413-1420dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl39259x0268-25757nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jctb.55093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02749naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004100094040001800135100005500153245016900208520108800377592002801465650001501493650002001508650001101528650001901539650001401558650001301572650003001585650002101615650004901636650001101685650001001696650001201706650001301718650001801731650002101749650001901770650001401789650001101803653003901814653002101853653003801874653001401912653001601926700001501942700001701957700001301974700001601987773011902003856008802122852000902210655001202219IND60675497420221121163903.0191214e20200201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067549742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1349812doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZheng, Run,1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7651-577010aDevelopment of an efficient catalyst with controlled sulfur vacancies and high pyridine nitrogen content for the photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2 into methanol  aTo efficiently and selectively produce liquid hydrocarbon fuels, e.g., methanol, by CO2 photoelectrochemical reduction, CdS nanoparticles (NPs) anchored on the nitrogen-doped carbon particles (NCP) with core-shell dodecahedral porous structure were used as cathode catalysts. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicated that CdS/NCP treated at 500 °C had the maximum S-vacancies. The heterojunction generated between CdS with abundant S-vacancies and NCP with a high content of pyridinic N acted as synergistic catalyst for CO2 reduction. CdS/NCP-500 catalyst exhibited a selectivity of 77.3% towards methanol with a total carbon atom conversion rate of 3052 nmol·h−1·cm−2. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed that the S-vacancies decreased the energy barrier for CO2 conversion into methanol product. NCP, exhibiting a high adsorption capacity for CO2, allowed the conversion of COOH* into CO* (ΔE = −3.6 eV), which was then transferred to the CdS surface displaying abundant S-vacancies for the reduction into the methanol product.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadsorption 3acadmium sulfide 3acarbon 3acarbon dioxide 3acatalysts 3acathodes 3adensity functional theory 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aenergy 3afuels 3aliquids 3amethanol 3ananoparticles 3anitrogen content 3aphotochemistry 3apyridines 3asulfur 0aCO2 photoelectrochemical reduction 0aCdS/NCP catalyst 0aCore-shell dodecahedral framework 0aS-vacancy 0apyridinic N1 aYang, Xiao1 aXuan, Xiaoxu1 aLiu, Niu1 aZhou, Junhu0 tScience of the total environment.g2020 Feb. 01, v. 702 p.134981-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl4455x0048-96977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.1349813Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03241naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003000094040001800124100001200142245011500154300001800269500002000287520132100307592002801628596006901656596008901725596005901814596005901873596005901932596005901991596005402050596005902104596005802163596008002221650001502301650001702316650002202333650002102355650001302376650001002389700001202399700005302411700001102464700001202475700001102487700001402498700001102512773012602523856007702649852000902726655001202735IND60788040120221118114218.0220811e201807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6078804012DNAL7 a10.1029/2018WR0225552doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSun, Y.10aDevelopment of Multivariable Dynamic System Response Curve Method for Real‐Time Flood Forecasting Correction  ap. 4730-4749.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aError correction method is widely used to improve the performance of flood forecasting. The Dynamic System Response Curve method (DSRC) has been proposed as an error correction method to improve the performance of hydrological modeling. One of the critical problems is the unstable performance caused by the ill‐posed property of the model structure and the inability of estimating multiple variables. To address this problem, the original structure of DSRC was modified to enable the capability of estimating multiple variables. Using the variable forgetting factor recursive least squares algorithm (VFF‐RLS), we proposed an improved version of DSRC (VFF‐RLS‐MDSRC). The proposed method was tested in a synthetic case to examine the ability to correct state variables of a hydrological model. In addition, it was compared with the autoregressive technique in a real case study to evaluate the effects on the improvement of model performance. The results of the synthetic study indicate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of both the model output and the state variables. The results of the real case study indicate that the performance obtained by the proposed method tends to have a slower decline trend when increasing the lead time compared with autoregressive technique.  aPublisher supplied data  a2017B684X14cFundamental Research Funds for Central Universities  aKYCX17_0423cPostgraduate Research & Practice Innovation Program of Jiangsu Province  a51709077cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a41371048cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51479062cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a51709076cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  a2016YFC0402703cNational Key R&D Program of China  a2017M611679cNational Postdoctoral Foundation of China  a1701019AcPostdoctoral Foundation of Jiangsu Province  a201804cYellow River sediment Key Laboratory of Ministry of water resources 3aalgorithms 3acase studies 3ahydrologic models 3amodel validation 3aresearch 3awater1 aBao, W.1 aJiang, P.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8472-12211 aJi, X.1 aGao, S.1 aXu, Y.1 aZhang, Q.1 aSi, W.0 tWater resources research.g2018 July, v. 54, no. 7 p.4730-4749dJohn Wiley & Sons, LtdwJournal:jnl46306x0043-13977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2018WR0225553Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01836naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002800094040001800122100001600140245014500156300002000301520080800321592002801129650001801157650002301175650001801198650001901216650001901235650002101254650001901275700002001294773012501314856007401439852000901513655001201522IND60642159020221119233025.0190506e20170921xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064215902DNAL7 a10.1039/c7ra08982a2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aOelmann, S.10aSynthesis and unimolecular micellar behavior of amphiphilic star-shaped block copolymers obtained via the Passerini three component reaction  ap. 45195-45199.  aA series of new amphiphilic star-shaped block copolymers with hydrophobic cores and hydrophilic shells was synthesized, using the Passerini three component step-growth polymerization (Passerini-3CP).

In this paper, a novel system consisting of a front oscillating buoy type WEC and a rear fixed pontoon is proposed to improve the energy conversion performance of the original single pontoon breakwater -type WEC system by Ning et al. (2016). For the purpose of comparison, the experiments for both single pontoon system and two-pontoon system are conducted. Note that, to avoid the significant increase of the construction cost, the total pontoon volume (i.e., the displacement of the pontoon) of the proposed system remains the same with that of the single pontoon system. The two-pontoon system with different draft ratios d₁/d₂ (where d₁ and d₂ are the draft of the front pontoon and rear pontoon) are considered. The experiment shows that the system with smaller draft ratio gives more excellent energy conversion performance. The current controller-magnetic powder brake system is selected and used as the power take-off (PTO) system. The characteristics of the PTO system are investigated, which shows that the approximate Coulomb damping force can be simulated very well. The results also reveal that the proposed breakwater-type WEC with proper configuration improves the capture width ratio (CWR) effectively without compromising the coastal protection performance (i.e., the transmission coefficient KT < 0.5) in comparison with the single pontoon system. And the effective frequency range for the transmission coefficient (KT < 0.5) and CWR (η > 20%) can be broadened by improving the CWR in shorter waves.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy conversion 3apower take-offs 3awater power 0aWave energy converter 0aBreakwater 0aEnergy conversion efficiency 0aApproximate coulomb damping force 0aExperimental study1 aNing, Dezhi0 tEnergy.g2018 July 15, v. 155 p.226-233dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1893Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03036naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002000151245008700171500002200258520142700280592002801707650001301735650002001748650001601768650001601784650001401800650001401814650001801828650001201846650002101858650001801879650001201897650001301909650001701922650001601939653001701955653003001972653003402002653002102036653002202057653002702079653001702106700002402123700001902147700003202166700002502198700002102223700005702244773009802301856008602399852000902485655001202494IND60619738620221120033946.0190410e20181021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061973862DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0562doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSalminen, Hanna10aInfluence of spray drying on the stability of food-grade solid lipid nanoparticles  aPre-press version  aThis study investigated spray drying of food-grade solid lipid particles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) containing ω-3 fish oil. Stable SLN and NLC dispersions with tristearin as carrier lipid were formed by using a combination of Quillaja saponins and high-melting lecithin as emulsifiers. Our specific goal was to study the influence of four different spray drying inlet and outlet temperatures (Tinlet/outlet = 140–170 °C/65–95 °C) and two different maltodextrin types (DE 6 and DE 21) with different molecular weights as protective wall materials on the physical and polymorphic stability of the solid lipid particles. The results revealed that the low molecular weight maltodextrin DE 21 was a superior wall material in stabilizing the solid lipid particles. Moreover, the lipid particles spray dried at Tinlet/outlet of 140/65 °C exhibited the highest physical and polymorphic stability, whereas using higher Tinlet/outlet led to bigger particles which were more prone to polymorphic transition. This was also verified in a 71-day storage test. The findings were explained that by preventing the melting of the tristearin carrier lipid during spray drying, the crystallized lipid particles remained intact inside the amorphous maltodextrin layer and exhibited high physical and polymorphic stability. These findings are important for generating stable food-grade spray dried powders.  aPublisher supplied data 3aQuillaja 3acrystallization 3adispersions 3aemulsifiers 3afish oils 3alecithins 3amaltodextrins 3amelting 3amolecular weight 3ananoparticles 3apowders 3asaponins 3aspray drying 3atemperature 0aSpray drying 0aSolid lipid nanoparticles 0aNanostructured lipid carriers 0aω-3 fatty acids 0aQuillaja saponins 0aPolymorphic transition 0aMaltodextrin1 aAnkenbrand, Juliane1 aZeeb, Benjamin1 aBadolato Bönisch, Gabriela1 aSchäfer, Christian,1 aKohlus, Reinhard1 aWeiss, Jochen1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1669-15070 tFood research international.g2018 Oct. 21, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0563Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01929naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003100094040001800125100002700143245006300170300001300233520089600246592002801142650002701170650001301197650001901210650002001229650003501249650001501284650001001299653001301309653001701322653000801339653001501347653000701362773011201369856007701481852000901558655001201567IND60648573420221119233757.0190701e20190601xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6064857342DNAL7 a10.2478/jas-2019-00152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAbou-Shaara, Hossam F.10aGeographical Information System for Beekeeping Development  ap. 5-16.  aGeographical Information System (GIS) is a computer-based system that can perform analysis for various datasets in relation to specific geographical locations and has been widely applied in agriculture. So far, GIS has been used in relatively few studies related to honey bees and beekeeping, but this article aims to review those previously performed and to present trends to apply GIS in beekeeping and then to help and guide researchers to perform more studies utilizing it. GIS can clearly be utilized to select suitable locations for apiaries, to map bee plants, to study bee behavior, diseases and pests, and to predict the effects of climate change on honey bees beside other benefits for beekeeping. Many obstacles and problems facing beekeeping can be mapped and analyzed using GIS, and other techniques can be used with it to perform the required tasks as presented in this review.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeographical Locations 3aapiaries 3aclimate change 3adata collection 3ageographic information systems 3ahoney bees 3apests 0aapiaries 0abee colonies 0aGIS 0ahoney bees 0aRS0 tJournal of apicultural science.g2019 June 01, v. 63, no. 1 p.5-16dSciendowJournal:23086x2299-48317nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/jas-2019-00153Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100001800149245011900167300001400286520147800300592002801778653002301806653003201829653001501861653002401876653001601900653001201916700002201928700001601950700001701966700001801983700001902001700001702020773010402037856008302141852000902224655001202233IND60554900520221122102834.0161216e201611  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055490052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.msard.2016.09.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPetersen, ER.10aSoluble serum VCAM-1, whole blood mRNA expression and treatment response in natalizumab-treated multiple sclerosis  ap. 66-72.  aNatalizumab reduces disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). Natalizumab binds to the very late antigen-4 and inhibits vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1)-mediated transmigration of immune cells across the blood-brain-barrier. This is associated with decreased serum concentrations of soluble (s)VCAM-1 and an altered composition of immune cell-subsets in the blood.We aimed to examine if sVCAM-1 serum concentrations and whole blood mRNA expression levels of immune activation biomarkers is associated with disease activity in natalizumab-treated MS-patients.sVCAM-1 serum concentrations and whole blood mRNA expression were measured in blood samples from untreated RRMS-patients and from two independent groups of natalizumab-treated patients.sVCAM-1 serum concentrations and whole blood expression of HLX1 and IL1B mRNA were lower, whereas expression of EBI3 mRNA was higher in natalizumab-treated MS-patients. Five genes were differentially expressed in clinically unstable natalizumab-treated MS-patients in the discovery but not in the validation group.Decreased serum concentrations of sVCAM-1 and altered whole blood mRNA expression levels of a panel of immunomarkers, associated with natalizumab-treatment, are not sensitive markers of MS disease activity. However, decreased expression of pro-inflammatory HLX1 and IL1B and increased expression of immunoregulatory EBI3 may indicate a less pathogenic immune activation status in natalizumab-treated MS.  aPublisher supplied data 0aMultiple Sclerosis 0aDisease modifying therapies 0aImmunology 0aRelapsing/remitting 0aNatalizumab 0aSVCAM-11 aSøndergaard, HB.1 aOturai, AB.1 aJensen, PEH.1 aSorensen, PS.1 aSellebjerg, F.1 aBörnsen, L.0 tMultiple Sclerosis and Related Disorders.g2016 Nov., v. 10 p.66-72dElsevier B.V.x2211-03487nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2016.09.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01883naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001700150245008700167300001600254520068800270592002800958650001400986650001001000650001301010650002401023650001301047650002501060650001101085650001101096650002101107651001801128653002201146653002201168653002501190653002401215700001801239700001801257773013801275856005101413852000901464655001201473IND50088631720221119225122.0140414e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008863172DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2011.5869252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSingh, Kehar13aAn Error Corrected Almost Ideal Demand System for Crustaceans in the United States  ap. 271-284.  aWe have employed an error-corrected almost ideal demand system (ECAIDS) for major crustaceans at a disaggregated level in the United States.

Education of New Zealand consumers on the health benefits of sodium reduction and how this may be achieved would complement this approach.  aPublisher supplied data 3aadults 3ablood pressure 3achronic diseases 3aeducation 3afood purchasing 3ainterviews 3anutrition labeling 3apublic health 3apurchasing 3asodium 3aNew Zealand 0aFood labelling 0aSodium 0aConsumer behaviour 0aQualitative 0aNew Zealand1 aHoek, Janet0 tPublic health nutrition.g2014 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1138-1146dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800130010793Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02208naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245012900169300001400298520097600312592002801288650002401316650002701340650001501367650001301382650001401395650001501409650001501424650001301439650001501452653003301467653002001500653001701520653003001537653002101567700002201588773010401610856008701714852000901801655001201810IND60568689520221118223903.0190409e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6056868952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.0482doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVelvizhi, G.10aMulti-electrode bioelectrochemical system for the treatment of high total dissolved solids bearing chemical based wastewater  ap. 77-86.  aMulti-electrode bioelectrochemical treatment system (ME-BET; membrane less) consisting of six electrode assemblies (E1–E6) was designed and fabricated for the treatment of complex chemical based wastewater with high salt concentration. The performance was compared with single electrode assembly BET reactor (SE-BET). Enhanced TDS and COD removal was observed in ME-BET (32%; 56%) compared to SE-BET (15%; 23%) as a result of in situ bio-potential from multi-electrodes through the oxidation of organic substrate in the wastewater. Inorganic pollutants viz., nitrates (28%; 8%), sulphates (25%; 9%) and phosphates (20%; 7%) removal was higher in ME-BET in comparison with SE-BET and this was also supported with bioelectrogenic activity (584; 160mW/m3). The study infers that designing of compact reactors with multiple electrodes in a single system enhances the anodic reactions and enable effective treatment of complex wastewaters with simultaneous power production.  aPublisher supplied data 3abioelectrochemistry 3achemical oxygen demand 3aelectrodes 3anitrates 3aoxidation 3aphosphates 3apollutants 3asulfates 3awastewater 0aTotal dissolved solids (TDS) 0aElectron losses 0aDesalination 0aMicrobial fuel cell (MFC) 0aVoltage reversal1 aVenkata Mohan, S.0 tBioresource technology.g2017 Oct., v. 242 p.77-86dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl46263x0960-85247nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2017.05.0483Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01829naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002300150245012300173300001600296520066900312592002800981650001501009650002501024650002001049650001601069650001501085650001801100650001701118651001001135653001601145653001001161653004201171653002501213700001901238773013801257856005101395852000901446655001201455IND50088631820221119222806.0140414e20110701xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008863182DNAL7 a10.1080/08974438.2011.5873412doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMensah, Lena Dzifa10aEnhancing Access to the Global Food Manufacturing Value Chain: The Role of a Food Safety Technical Regulation in Ghana  ap. 247-270.  aDemonstrating compliance with food safety requirements of the global food economy is a prerequisite for access.

Vibrio cholerae O1 (n = 522) isolated during 2007–2010 from diarrheal patients at 10 different hospital laboratories in Nepal were characterized. Biochemical and serologic identifications showed that all the isolates belonged to serogroup O1, El Tor biotype. Except 72 isolates of Inaba serotype isolated in the year 2007, all the remaining isolates were of Ogawa serotype. All isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and furazolidone. Resistance to tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole were 21, 4, 16 and 90 % respectively. Seventy-seven of these isolates were selected for further characterization for ctxB gene and MLVA typing. Two different variants of classical type cholera toxin were observed. Ogawa strains from 2007 and 2010-Western Nepal outbreak harbored CTX-3 type cholera toxin, whereas Inaba serotypes in 2007 and the remaining Ogawa serotypes in 2008–2010 harbored CTX 3b-type toxin. MLVA analysis showed circulation of four different groups of altered V. cholerae O1 El Tor strains. Two different profiles were seen among 2007 Inaba (9, 3, 6, x, x) and Ogawa (10, 7, 6, x, x) isolates. The MLVA profile of 2008 and 2009 Ogawa isolates were similar to those of Inaba strains of 2007. Isolates from 2010 also showed three different MLVA profiles; profile 9, 3, 6, x, x in 3 isolates, 11, 7, 6, x, x among 2010 Western Nepal outbreak strains and profile 8, 3, 6, x, x among isolates from Butwal and Kathmandu.  aPublisher supplied data 3aVibrio cholerae O1 3aantibiotic resistance 3acholera 3acholera toxin 3aciprofloxacin 3aerythromycin 3afurazolidone 3agenes 3amonitoring 3analidixic acid 3apatients 3aserotypes 3atetracycline 2aBase Sequence 2aCholeraxdrug therapyxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aCholera Toxinxclassificationxgenetics. 2aDNA, Bacterialxgenetics 2aDrug Resistance, Bacterial 2aEpidemics 2aHumans 2aMolecular Epidemiology 2aPhenotype 2aSerotyping 2aVibrio cholerae O1xclassificationxdrug effectsxgeneticsxisolation & purification. 3aNepal 0aNepalxepidemiology.1 aKim, Dong Wook1 aClemens, John D.1 aMalla, Sarala1 aUpadhyaya, Bishnu Prasad1 aDumre, Shyam Prakash1 aShrestha, Sirjana Devi1 aAdhikari, Shailaja1 aSharma, Supriya1 aRijal, Nisha1 aShrestha, Sanjaya K.1 aMason, Carl1 aKansakar, Palpasa0 tWorld journal of microbiology & biotechnology.g2012 Aug., v. 28, no. 8 p.2671-2678dSpringer-Verlagx0959-39937nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-012-1077-3  aDNAL 7aarticle02103naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002500092040001800117100002200135245011200157300001800269500002000287520118500307592002801492650001401520650003201534650002401566650002401590700002001614773009901634852000901733856007101742655001201813IND4374044720221119212217.0170626e200509  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND437404472DNAL7 a10.1890/04-15242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYamauchi, Atsushi10aEffects of defense evolution and diet choice on population dynamics in a one‐predator–two‐prey system  ap. 2513-2524.  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aThe population dynamics of a one‐predator–two‐prey system were modeled. This model included the evolution of antipredator defense in the prey species and the optimal diet choice in the predator and was analyzed numerically using computer simulations. Results showed that defense evolution in the prey species tended to promote coexistence of the three species and, depending on parameters, reduced the amplitude of density fluctuations. Introducing optimal diet choice by the predator into the model also promoted coexistence and generally reduced density fluctuations. When the additive genetic variance for defense intensity was large (i.e., the evolutionary rate of defense was rapid), coexistence of the three species and stabilization of dynamics tended to be promoted. As a consequence, we concluded that (1) the evolution of antipredator defense can be an important factor in the persistence of a community, either with or without the optimal diet choice of predator; and (2) when population dynamics are combined with the evolutionary dynamics of trait development, the relative time scale of the two processes plays an important role in the stability of the system.  aPublisher supplied data 3apredation 3apredator-prey relationships 3afeeding preferences 3amathematical models1 aYamamura, Norio0 tEcology.g2005 Sept., v. 86, no. 9 p.2513-2524dEcological Society of Americax0012-96587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1890/04-15243Available from publisher's site 7aarticle02383naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004000111040001800151100001700169245007100186300001600257500001500273520107200288592002801360650001101388650002901399650001801428650001001446650001101456650000901467650001401476650002601490650002401516650001201540650002401552650001301576650002401589650002001613650002301633650002101656653001001677700002301687700002001710773008801730856008601818852000901904655001201913IND4465594620221120023212.0141110e201201  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446559462DNAL7 a221041012pmid7 a10.1016/j.biortech.2011.10.0772doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Xiaowei10aAlgae biodiesel has potential despite inconclusive results to date  ap. 803-806.  a2019-12-06  aA meta-analysis of several published life cycle assessments of algae-to-energy systems was developed to better understand the environmental implications of deploying this technology at large scales. Taken together, results from these six studies seemed largely inconclusive because of differences in modeling assumptions and system boundaries. To overcome this, the models were normalized using a generic pathway for cultivating algae in open ponds, converting it into biodiesel, and processing the nonlipid fraction using anaerobic digestion. Meta-analysis results suggest that algae-based biodiesel would result in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions on par with terrestrial alternatives such as corn ethanol and soy biodiesel. Net energy ratio and normalized greenhouse gas emissions were 1.4MJ produced/MJ consumed and 0.19kgCO₂-equivalent/km traveled, respectively. A scenario analysis underscores the extent to which breakthroughs in key technologies are needed before algae-derived fuels become an attractive alternative to conventional biofuels.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3agreenhouse gas emissions 3ameta-analysis 3aponds 3amodels 3acorn 3abiodiesel 3alife cycle assessment 3aanaerobic digestion 3aethanol 2aBacteriaxchemistry 2aBiofuels 2aComputer Simulation 2aEnergy Transfer 2aModels, Biological 2aModels, Chemical 0aAlgae1 aClarens, Andres F.1 aColosi, Lisa M.0 tBioresource technology.g2012 Jan., v. 104 p.803-806dElsevier Ltdx0960-85247nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biortech.2011.10.0773Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03413naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245021900208500001900427520162600446592002802072650004402100650001502144650002102159650003702180650001902217650002302236650001002259650001802269650001602287650002402303650003302327650002302360650003202383650001302415650002002428650001602448650003702464653002502501653004002526653001702566653001302583700002202596700002102618700002202639700002502661773011502686856008502801852000902886655001202895IND60707367820221120121932.0200913e20200927xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070736782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4614862doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSeidi, Shahram1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2385-701810aElectrochemically deposition of ionic liquid modified graphene oxide for circulated headspace in-tube solid phase microextraction of naphthalene from honey samples followed by on-line liquid chromatography analysis  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aIn this work, an inexpensive, fast, and selective ionic liquid modified graphene oxide (GO-IL) was synthesized and electrochemically deposited on the inner surface of a stainless-steel tube. Then, it was applied for circulated headspace in-tube solid-phase microextraction (CHS-IT-SPME) of naphthalene from honey samples. Next, the coated tube was replaced with the sample loop of a six-port injection valve for on-line desorption and further HPLC-UV analysis of naphthalene. The sorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Different parameters affecting the procedure efficiency, including extraction temperature, extraction time, salt concentration, and sample volume were optimized by central composite design and response surface methodology. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve was linear within the range of 0.3-200 ng mL⁻¹, with a regression coefficient of 0.9972. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were found to be 0.1 ng mL⁻¹ and 0.3 ng mL⁻¹, respectively. Intra-day and inter-day RSDs% for three replicate measurements of naphthalene at the concentration of 10 ng mL⁻¹ were obtained 3.9% and 5.0%, respectively. Also, good tube-to-tube reproducibility of 5.3% was achieved. Finally, the method was successfully applied for measuring trace amounts of naphthalene in honey samples. Relative recoveries were calculated within the range of 90.0-106.5%, indicating excellent efficiency of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3adesorption 3aelectrochemistry 3aenergy-dispersive X-ray analysis 3agraphene oxide 3aheadspace analysis 3ahoney 3aionic liquids 3anaphthalene 3aregression analysis 3aresponse surface methodology 3asalt concentration 3asolid phase microextraction 3asorbents 3astainless steel 3atemperature 3atransmission electron microscopy 0aCirculated headspace 0aIn-tube solid phase microextraction 0aIonic liquid 0aGraphene1 aAbolhasani, Hadis1 aRazeghi, Yasaman1 aShanehsaz, Maryam1 aManouchehri, Mahshid0 tJournal of chromatography.g2020 Sept. 27, v. 1628 p.461486-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl50504x0021-96737nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.4614863Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200517 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100003400151245013200185500002200317520113800339592002801477650002501505650002001530650001201550650001101562650001501573650001201588650001501600650001501615650002001630650001301650650001701663650001201680650002501692650001501717653002301732653001501755653002501770653002901795653002301824700002401847700003401871700003301905700003001938700002501968700002501993700005702018773009802075856008602173852000902259655001202268IND60619738920221120075545.0190410e20181021xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061973892DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0602doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFagundes, Mariane Bittencourt10aInsights in cyanobacteria lipidomics: A sterols characterization from Phormidium autumnale biomass in heterotrophic cultivation  aPre-press version  aSterol profiles were obtained from cyanobacteria Phormidium autumnale, cultivated in a heterotrophic system using three distinct sources of carbon: glucose, sucrose, and agroindustrial slaughterhouse wastewater.

Using wastewater as a carbon source, the microalgae biomass produced a diversity of sterols such as stigmasterol (455.3 μg g−1) and β-sitosterol (279.0 μg g−1). However, with glucose it is possible to produce ergosterol (1033.3 μg g−1). Squalene was found in all the cultures, with 1440.4 μg g−1, 225.4 μg g−1, and 425.6 μg g−1 for glucose, sucrose, and slaughterhouse wastewater biomasses, respectively. Several intermediate compounds from those sterols were found. These data provide the construction of the sterol metabolism according to the literature for P. autumnale heterotrophically cultured.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPhormidium autumnale 3abeta-sitosterol 3abiomass 3acarbon 3aergosterol 3aglucose 3ametabolism 3amicroalgae 3aslaughterhouses 3asqualene 3astigmasterol 3asucrose 3aultrasonic treatment 3awastewater 0aGas chromatography 0aMicroalgae 0aPhormidium autumnale 0aNon-saponified compounds 0aMetabolic pathways1 aFalk, Renata Bolzan1 aFacchi, Michelle Maria Xavier1 aVendruscolo, Raquel Guidetti1 aMaroneze, Mariana Manzoni1 aZepka, Leila Queiroz1 aJacob-Lopes, Eduardo1 aWagner, Roger1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6176-79130 tFood research international.g2018 Oct. 21, dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0603Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02471naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002700150245008400177300001600261520130100277592002801578650002701606650001801633650001701651650000901668650002101677650001701698650001001715650001601725653002701741653002001768653002001788653002101808700002601829700001901855700001601874773009001890856008401980852000902064655001202073IND60680007620221120202440.0200103e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068000762DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1932doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Gómez, P.A.10aFatigue analysis of the steam generator of a parabolic trough solar power plant  ap. 565-577.  aThis work proposes a methodology to perform the fatigue analysis of the steam generator of a parabolic trough power plant. The following methodology assumes cycling duty scenario (300 start-ups and shut downs per year). Two start-up operations of the steam generator are analyzed: evaporator temperature ramp and heat transfer fluid temperature ramp. Furthermore, a part load operation is studied.The results show that the most compromised parts of the steam generator are the reheater tubesheet for the TEMA CFU design, the steam drum-downcomer junction and the superheater nozzle. Besides, former reheater design (TEMA CFU) does not fulfil the 25-year lifetime condition. To overcome this problem, two alternative designs for the reheater are proposed: U-shell and two TEMA CFU in series. Finally, the lifetimes of TEMA NXU and kettle evaporator designs are compared. Our results show that TEMA NXU allows temperature ramps up to 9 °C/min without putting the steam generator lifetime at risk, whereas kettle temperature ramps greater than 5 °C/min do not fulfil the designed lifetime of 25 years.Respect to the load changes, the evaporator drum is the most stressed element. A 50% load change produces a damage equivalent to 60% of the damage produced by a daily start-up/shut-down cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3agenerators (equipment) 3aheat transfer 3apower plants 3arisk 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3asteam 3atemperature 0aParabolic trough plant 0aSteam generator 0aStress analysis 0aFatigue analysis1 aGómez-Hernández, J.1 aBriongos, J.V.1 aSantana, D.0 tEnergy.g2018 July 15, v. 155 p.565-577dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1933Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01932naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002600152245011900178300001600297520071000313592002801023650001001051650002101061650001201082650001701094650002401111650002001135650001601155653001301171653001901184653001701203653003901220653002501259700002401284700002401308773011801332856008701450852000901537655001201546IND50063985720221120084631.0190318e201306  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006398572DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2013.01.0292doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKazemi, Mohammad Amin10aMathematical modeling of crossflow microfiltration of diluted malt extract suspension by tubular ceramic membranes  ap. 926-933.  aThe practical application of microfiltration in brewing industry is hindered by severe membrane fouling and subsequent permeate flux decline.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the profitability of V2H installation, the optimal facility configuration and the energy performance of V2H, while considering a diversity of household types and storage facility options. We optimized the facilities and operation strategy of a residential energy system under many scenarios with different electricity demand profiles, automobile usage patterns and available areas for PV installation. The results showed that a V2H system should generally be installed instead of a stationary battery (SB), but combining a V2H system with a SB is more economical for households with long EV absence times. Additionally, V2H is profitable for households with short EV absence times, large available areas for PV installation and high electricity demand. Furthermore, V2H exhibits superior energy independence and energy-saving effects for households whose annual PV generation exceeds the yearly household electricity demand.  aPublisher supplied data 3aautomobiles 3abatteries 3aelectricity 3aenergy 3aenergy conservation 3aprofitability 3asolar energy 0aPhotovoltaics 0aElectric vehicle 0aVehicle-to-home 0aOptimization 0aResidential energy system 0aEV 0aFIT 0aGV 0aPCS 0aPV 0aSB 0aV2H1 aIkegami, Takashi1 aUemichi, Akane1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8436-04891 aAkisawa, Atsushi0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Nov., v. 178 p.745-756dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.06.0973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03591naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245016600168500002000334520231300354592002802667650001602695650001502711650002002726650001102746650001702757650002002774650002402794650001102818650002002829650001502849650002402864650002102888700003302909700002202942773015302964856007903117852000903196655001203205IND60772552820221121001514.0220404e202204  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077255282DNAL7 a10.1002/ejlt.2021002222doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKritiktsi, Evmorfia10aProposal for the Updating of the ISO 29841 Liquid Chromatographic Method for the Determination of Chlorophyll a and a′ Degradation Products in Virgin Olive Oil  aJOURNAL ARTICLE  aPyropheophytin a (PPPa) found in minute amounts in virgin olive oil under good manufacturing practice conditions and increasing as a function of storage temperature and length, has attracted the interest of scientists as a marker of quality. Certain bodies developing olive oil standards have adopted its content (% PPPaₘₐₓ < 17 throughout the shelf‐life of a product) as a quality criterion. The analytical protocol to examine product compliance is the ISO 29841 method. In the present work, green improvements are proposed through the use of a short column and vacuum in the solid‐phase sample extraction step. The preparation of handmade cartridges that can be reused without pretreatment at least six times reduces further the cost of analysis. The proposed protocol is repeatable and robust. In case fluorescence detection is used, selection of λₑₓ = 407 nm/λₑₘ = 672 nm instead of λₑₓ = 430 nm/λₑₘ = 670 nm increases detection sensitivity of the target compounds by 1.5‐ to 2.6‐fold. Fluorescence detection results in higher %PPPa values by 2% on average compared to those obtained with a diode array detector set at 410 nm. Present proposals and observations are expected to be of interest for the next edition of the ISO 29841:2009/AMD1:2016. Practical applications: The proposals made in the present study expedite significantly the analysis, thus, increasing the sample throughput even compared to other alternative fast approaches in the literature. The reduction of the use of chemicals adds to the modification of the ISO 29841 method to an analytical tool that abides by green and sustainable chemistry which is considered critical for “beyond the 2020 process.” The proposed chromatographic column updates the method as its effective use in an HPLC instrument provides comparable efficiency to a UHPLC one, and makes method transfer to the latter without adjustments. In this way, method adoption may be wider by analytical laboratories involved in virgin olive oil quality control. Finally, the identification of quantitative differences using different detection means (visible, fluorescence) for the first time, when addressed by the ISO committee, may assist the effective quality control and facilitate the virgin olive oil international trade.  aPublisher supplied data 3achlorophyll 3acompliance 3adetection limit 3adiodes 3afluorescence 3agreen chemistry 3ainternational trade 3alipids 3aquality control 3ashelf life 3astorage temperature 3avirgin olive oil1 aTsimidou, M.

The GO-MoS₂-coated capillary column was prepared by covalent immobilization method for the determination of seven sulfonamides. The baseline separation of seven sulfonamides was achieved by GO-MoS₂-coated capillary column. The linear range was 0.05-100 μg/mL for sulfisomidine, sulfathiazole, sulfamerazine, phthalylsulfathiazole and sulfacetamide, 0.1-100 μg/mL for sulfamonomethoxine and sulfachloropyridazine with a satisfactory correlation coefficients (R²) > 0.9994. This developed OT-CEC method was successfully applied to determinate of seven sulfonamides in environmental water and milk samples with good recoveries of 85.77% - 109.10% and 80.03% - 109.97%, respectively.

To better understand the benefits of microwave pretreatment on rapeseed processing, qualitative and quantitative analysis of sinapic acid derivatives is needed. In this study, the effect of microwave treatment on the content of sinapic acid derivatives in rapeseed and the effect of cold-press and solvent extraction on the content of sinapic acid derivatives in rapeseed meal were evaluated using ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography. It was found that during the microwave treatment, the content of sinapine and sinapic acid in the rapeseed increased slightly at the outset of treatment and significantly decreased thereafter. Following 7 min of microwave treatment, the content of sinapine in rapeseed exhibited its largest decrease of 16.7 %. By contrast, microwave heating of the rapeseed increased the canolol content significantly. We employed two sample paired t tests as a means to analyze the difference between meal and defatted cold-pressed cake.

The number of G. liquefaciens and bacterial diversity in the rhizosphere and bulk soil were monitored by real-time PCR and DGGE, respectively. Soil phosphorus and cucumber biomass were also examined. G. liquefaciens qzr14 effectively colonized the rhizosphere soil (bacterial density ranging from 2.70 × 10⁸ to 1.18 × 10⁹ copies per gram dry soil). G. liquefaciens qzr14 inoculation had significantly positive effects on bacterial diversity (BD) of the rhizosphere and bulk soil and the ratio of soluble phosphorus to total phosphorus (SP/TP). The number of G. liquefaciens in the rhizosphere soil was significantly related to SP/TP and the BD of the rhizosphere and bulk soil. BD in rhizosphere soil was significantly related to SP/TP and BD in bulk soil. Based on the results of correlation analysis, we inferred that the introduced G. liquefaciens qzr14 effectively colonized the rhizosphere of cucumber, and then expanded its bacterial community by solubilizing soil phosphorus. The expanded bacterial communities might promote cucumber growth by some new functions.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGluconacetobacter liquefaciens 3abacterial communities 3abiomass 3acorrelation 3acucumbers 3adenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 3amicroorganisms 3aphosphorus 3apot culture 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arhizosphere 3asoil 3asolubilization1 aWang, Huan1 aYin, Tingting1 aXu, Song1 aZhao, Wei1 aWang, Jin1 aHuang, Zhiyong0 t3 Biotech.g2017 Oct., v. 7, no. 5 p.294-294dSpringer Berlin HeidelbergwJournal:22884x2190-572X7nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0926-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03206naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002500148245015600173300001600329520175000345592002802095650000802123650002402131650002002155650002502175650001002200650001202210650001002222650001902232650001102251650002502262650002002287650001102307650001002318650002402328650001402352650002702366650001502393650000902408700002602417700002402443700005902467773011802526856008302644852000902727655001202736IND60792830420221120234711.0220909e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079283042DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-022-01498-y2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEl-Gameel, Sohila M.10aMorphomolecular characterization of Strongylus vulgaris isolated from donkeys with special references to histopathological study on the affected organs  ap. 795-803.  aEquine gastrointestinal tract is infected with Strongylus vulgaris (S. vulgaris) which is highly pathogenic parasite for its harmful effect on cranial mesenteric artery during its migration. So, this study was applied for identification of S. vulgaris in donkeys ultramorphologically and molecularly. In addition to, detection of the pathological effect of larval stage of S. vulgaris on the mesenteric arterial system using histopathology and immunohistochemistry. During the period from September to December; 2019, 60 male and 20 female donkeys at the Giza Zoo was postmortem examined. S. vulgaris adults and larvae were collected from the large intestine and cranial mesenteric arteries (CMAs), respectively. Ultramorphological examination of the collected adults was done using scanning electron microscope (SEM). DNA was extracted from 5 larvae and 6 adults for further conventional PCR studies and sequencing of the internal transcriped spacer 2 (ITS2) gene. The ITS2 gene were amplified and showed bands at 148 base pair (bp). The ITS2 gene nucleotide sequences of all isolates were aligned using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Histological sections of S. vulgaris affected mesenteric arteries exhibited the presence of the parasite larvae either in the lumen with thrombus formation or attached to the intima. Most of the detected inflammatory cell populations were CD68-positive cells. From these results, it can be concluded that the ribosomal spacers genes could be used as markers for Strongylus species identification in eggs collected from equine feces as a beneficial method of diagnosis. Also, it could be important in disease surveillance, improving preventive measures and developing an effective control strategy.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aStrongylus vulgaris 3adigestive tract 3adisease surveillance 3afeces 3afemales 3agenes 3ahistopathology 3ahorses 3aimmunohistochemistry 3alarge intestine 3alarvae 3amales 3amesenteric arteries 3aparasites 3aspecies identification 3athrombosis 3azoos1 aAl-Mokaddem, Asmaa K.1 aSalaeh, Nagla M.

The specific surface areas, antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the modified Mt were investigated. RESULTS: In the modified Mt, hydrated Cu ions and Zn ions were exchanged in the interlayer space of Mt and the particles were irregular shapes. The results showed that Cu/Zn-Mt enhanced antibacterial and antifungal activity compared with Zn-Mt and Cu-Mt possibly due to the synergistic effect between Cu and Zn. Among the Cu/Zn-Mt with different Cu/Zn raitos, Cu/Zn-Mt with a Cu/Zn ratio of 0.98 or 0.51 showed higher antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli), gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), fungi (Candida albicans). Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of Cu/Zn-Mt was correlated with its specific surface area. Cytotoxicity studies on IPEC-J2 cell showed a slight cytotoxicity of Cu/Zn-Mt. CONCLUSIONS: The current data provide clear evidence that in terms of its antimicrobial activity and relatively low toxicity, the Cu/Zn-Mt holds great promise for applications in animal husbandry.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCandida albicans 3aEscherichia coli 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aGram-positive bacteria 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aX-ray diffraction 3aanimal husbandry 3aantifungal properties 3acopper 3acytotoxicity 3afungi 3aion exchange 3aions 3amontmorillonite 3asurface area 3asynergism 3atransmission electron microscopy 3azinc1 aLin, Fanghui1 aCao, Shuting1 aWang, Chunchun1 aWu, Huan1 aShu, Miaoan1 aHu, Caihong0 tJournal of animal science and biotechnology.g2017 Dec., v. 8, no. 1 p.27-27dBioMed CentralwJournal:2268x2049-18917nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40104-017-0156-63Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02091naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245008700127300001600214500001900230520122200249592002801471650002101499650001501520650002401535653002101559653001601580700001601596700001701612700001601629700001901645773010401664852000901768655001201777IND60709867620221122044833.0200908e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070986762DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMane, S.S.10aLevel of job satisfaction of the teachers working in private agricultural colleges  ap. 292-294.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aJob satisfaction level of the teachers working in private agricultural colleges affiliated with Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri was studied and it was observed that majority (69%) teachers had medium level of job satisfaction Most of them were males, middle aged, married, qualified M.

The objective of this study was to examine the seasonal and short-term effects of solid waste compost amendments on selected hydrophysical properties of soil during dry and rainy seasons and to explore any negative impacts of municipal solid waste compost (MSWC) amendments on soil hydrophysical environment concerning Agriculture in low-country wet zone, Sri Lanka. Eight (T1–T8) MSWC and two (T9, T10) agricultural-based waste compost (AWC) samples were separately applied in the field in triplicates at 10 and 20 Mg ha⁻¹ rates, with a control (T0). Field measurements (initial infiltration rate, Iᵢ; steady state infiltration rate, ISS; unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, k; sorptivity, SW) were conducted and samples were collected (0–15 cm depth) for laboratory experiments (water entry value, hwₑ; potential water repellency: measured with water drop penetration time, WDPT) before starting (Measurement I) and in the middle of (Measurement II) the seasonal rainfall (respectively 5 and 10 weeks after the application of compost). The difference in the soil organic matter (SOM) content was not significant between the dry and rainy periods. All the soils were almost non-repellent (WDPT = <1–5 s). The hwₑ of all the samples were negative. In the Measurement I, the Iᵢ of the T0 was about 40 cm h⁻¹, while most treatments show comparatively lower values. The ISS, SW, and k of compost amended samples were either statistically similar, or showed significantly lower values compared with T0. It was clear that all the surface hydraulic properties examined in situ (Iᵢ, ISS, SW) were higher in the Measurement I (before rainfall) than those observed in the Measurement II (after rainfall). Water potential differences in soils might have affected the surface hydrological properties such as SW. However, water potential differences would not be the reason for weakened ISS and k in the Measurement II. Disruption of aggregates, and other subsequent processes that would take place on the soil surface as well as in the soil matrix, such as particle rearrangements, clogging of pores, might be the reason for the weakened ISS and k in the Measurement II. Considering the overall results of the present study, compost amendments seemed not to improve or accelerate but tend to suppress hydraulic properties of soil. No significant difference was observed between MSWC and AWC considering their effects on soil hydraulic properties. Application of composts can be considered helpful to slower the rapid leaching by decreasing the water movements into and within the soil.  aPublisher supplied data 3aMSW composts 3aUltisols 3ainfiltration rate 3alaboratory experimentation 3aleaching 3arain 3asoil organic matter 3asolid wastes 3aunsaturated hydraulic conductivity 3awater potential 3awet season 3aSri Lanka 0aUnsaturated hydraulic conductivity 0aInfiltration 0aSolid waste compost 0aSorptivity 0aWater repellency1 aManawardana, Chinthani U.0 tVodohospodársky časopis.g2019 Sept. 01, v. 67, no. 3 p.232-239dSciendowJournal:21369x0042-790X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2478/johh-2019-00073Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03334naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245013500165300001400300520178300314592002802097650001102125650002302136650001802159650002302177650001402200650001202214650001502226650002302241650001502264650001602279650001602295650001902311650000902330650001302339650001702352651001302369651001202382653001002394653001202404653001102416653002002427653001602447653002302463653001802486700001602504700005402520700001502574773010902589856008502698852000902783655001202792IND60573077420221117052116.0190411e201710  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057307742DNAL7 a10.1016/j.forpol.2017.05.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLoaiza, T.10aAnalysis of land management and legal arrangements in the Ecuadorian Northeastern Amazon as preconditions for REDD+ implementation  ap. 19-28.  aEcuador is currently completing the readiness phase for the implementation of the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism at the national level. Many challenges regarding rights, multilayered governance and land tenure remain open in this country where Indigenous Peoples (IPs) occupy 68% of the Ecuadorian Amazon. We focused on the Yasuní Biosphere Reserve to exemplify obstacles and answers found in the last years. In a REDD+ pilot project, six communities of the most widespread ethnicities (Shuar, Kichwa and Colonists) living in the buffer zone of the Yasuní National Park (YNP), were chosen. We used literature research, analysis of international and national agendas, as well as primary data on REDD+ perception obtained through semi-structured household interviews and personal observations. First, we reconstruct the historical development of territorial configuration and present the actual land tenure arrangements. And then, we analyze persistent management conflicts within institutional, planning and normative instruments. Finally we explore legal frameworks with a focus on participation and consultation. Our results show that insecure and overlapping land rights, as well as unclear and contradictory institutional responsibilities are major problems for REDD+ implementation. Despite great advancements that have been made, establishing equitable mechanisms to engage IPs and forest owners and stakeholders across many sectors in REDD+ is required. Especially in Ecuador where oil extraction is a priority and the central government has an exclusive competence over ecosystem services including carbon rights. Implementing fair methods for participation, benefit sharing and transfer of knowledge remains a challenge.  aPublisher supplied data 3acarbon 3aconservation areas 3adeforestation 3aecosystem services 3aemissions 3aforests 3agovernance 3aindigenous peoples 3ainterviews 3aland rights 3aland tenure 3anational parks 3aoils 3aplanning 3astakeholders 3aAmazonia 3aEcuador 0aREDD+ 0aEcuador 0aAmazon 0aLegal framework 0aLand tenure 0aIndigenous peoples 0aParticipation1 aBorja, M.O.1 aNehren, U.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6236-35421 aGerold, G.0 tForest policy and economics.g2017 Oct., v. 83 p.19-28dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl64120x1389-93417nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forpol.2017.05.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02884naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002100148245010400169300001600273520143900289592002801728596006001756596001901816650002001835650001301855650001501868650001301883650001201896650001601908650001801924650002101942650001401963650002301977650000902000650002802009650001402037650001602051651001002067700002202077700001902099700006302118700002302181773011802204856008302322852000902405655001202414IND60792830520221120234639.0220909e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079283052DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-022-01493-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBhat, Rouf Ahmad10aGastrointestinal helminth parasites of wild ungulates in Hirpora Wildlife Sanctuary, Kashmir, India  ap. 804-810.  aParasitic infection represents an emerging threat to wild ungulates and a challenge to their management. Although a lot of work has been carried out on helminth parasitic infestation of domestic ungulates of Kashmir but the data pertaining to this aspect of wild ungulates has been ignored. The study on gastrointestinal helminth parasitic infestation of wild ungulates was carried out during post livestock grazing period (November to May) of 2018/2019 in Hirpora Wildlife sanctuary (HWLS) to fill the gap in the existing literature. During the study fresh faecal samples of musk deer Moschus spp. (n = 44) and markhor Capra falconeri (n = 41) were collected and examined qualitatively and quantitatively for gastrointestinal helminth parasites. A total of seven helminth parasites were recorded which are arranged in the descending order of their overall prevalence as Haemonchus spp. (44.70%), Nematodirus spp. (40%), Trichuris spp. (37.64%), Strongyloides spp. (34.11%) Trichostrongylus spp. (28.23%) Moniezia spp. (23.52%) and Fasciola spp. (20%). The mean EPG (eggs per gram) of different parasites showed a considerable variation in both the wild ungulates. The highest mean EPG was that of Haemonchus spp. and the lowest mean EPG was that of Fasciola spp. in both hosts. A statistically significant difference was observed in the mean EPG of different parasites between two wild hosts (t = 3.606, p = 0.01) .  aPublisher supplied data  aCRG/2019/002369cScience and Engineering Research Board  aRUSA 2.0cRUSA 3aCapra falconeri 3aFasciola 3aHaemonchus 3aMoniezia 3aMoschus 3aNematodirus 3aStrongyloides 3aTrichostrongylus 3aTrichuris 3aconservation areas 3adeer 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminths 3aparasitoses 3aIndia1 aTak, Hidayatullah1 aBhat, Bilal A.1 aDar, Jahangir Ahmad1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5686-24761 aAḥmad, Riyāz̤,0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2022 Sept., v. 46, no. 3 p.804-810dSpringer IndiawJournal:6190x0971-71967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-022-01493-33Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03789naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001700188245009900205300001100304506007600315520191800391592002802309506003702337650002002374650002002394650002002414650001202434650002502446650002002471650002102491650001002512650001202522650001602534650001402550650001002564650002502574650001502599650001102614650001002625650001902635650002102654650001302675650001402688650002802702650001902730650002202749651001002771651001302781700002702794700001802821700002002839700002002859700006602879773012702945856008203072852000903154655001203163IND60662429820221207095729.0191228e201912  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066242982DNAL7 a10.1186/s13002-019-0323-22doi7 aPMC67168312pmcid7 a314708682pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aFarooq, Asia10aEthnomedicinal knowledge of the rural communities of Dhirkot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan  ap. 45.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Being an isolated locality and having a tough mountainous terrain, strong ethnomedicinal practices still prevail in Dhirkot and its allied areas, which have been rarely explored yet. The present study was intended with the aim to document and compare the traditional knowledge of local communities on botanical taxa of Dhirkot, Azad Jammu, and Kashmir. METHODOLOGY: Ethnomedicinal data were collected from 74 informants using a semi-structured questionnaire in addition to field observation and group discussion. Various indices were also used to evaluate the ethnomedicinal data. Furthermore, the present findings were compared with previous reports to assess data novelty. RESULT: A total of 140 medicinal plant species belonging to 55 families were recorded, which are used by local communities to treat 12 disease categories. Asteraceae was dominating with 20 species, followed by Poaceae, Lamiaceae, and Rosaceae (14, 11, and 10 species, respectively). Herbs were leading with 66% contribution, whereas leaves were the most utilized plant part with 29% utilization and decoction was the common mode of administration. Viola canescens depicted the highest use value and relative frequency of citation (1.7 and 0.92, respectively). Maximum informant consensus factor (0.88) was calculated for digestive and liver disorders. Five plant species including Berberis lycium Mentha arvensis Pyrus malus, Taraxacum officinale, and Viola canescens had 100% fidelity level. CONCLUSION: Dhirkot and its allied areas harbor rich botanical and cultural diversity because of its unique geography and diverse climatic conditions. However, mostly, traditional ethnobotanical knowledge is restricted to healers, midwives, and older people, and could be extinct in the near future. Therefore, such documentation not only conserves traditional knowledge but may also contribute significantly to novel drug resources.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBerberis lycium 3aMalus domestica 3aMentha arvensis 3aPoaceae 3aTaraxacum officinale 3aViola canescens 3aclimatic factors 3adrugs 3aelderly 3aethnobotany 3ageography 3aherbs 3aindigenous knowledge 3alandscapes 3aleaves 3aliver 3aliver diseases 3amedicinal plants 3amidwives 3amountains 3amulticultural diversity 3aquestionnaires 3arural communities 3aIndia 3aPakistan1 aAmjad, Muhammad Shoaib1 aAhmad, Khalid1 aAltaf, Muhammad1 aUmair, Muhammad1 aAbbasi, Arshad Mehmood1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9978-38660 tJournal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine.g2019 Dec., v. 15, no. 1 p.45-45dBioMed CentralwJournal:2213x1746-42697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13002-019-0323-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03384naa a2200505 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002400145245012300169300001600292520195900308592002802267650002202295650003002317650001102347650001302358650001102371650001002382650001502392650001702407650001302424650001502437650001302452650002102465650001402486650001502500650001502515650001902530650001102549650001202560650001802572650001502590650001302605651001302618700002202631700002702653700002102680773010802701856004802809852000902857655001202866IND4466511620221120084645.0121003e201110  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND446651162DNAL7 a10.1007/s11270-011-0788-72doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBeckert, Kristen A.10aCharacterization and Comparison of Stream Nutrients, Land Use, and Loading Patterns in Maryland Coastal Bay Watersheds  ap. 255-273.  aLand use and its relation to nutrient concentrations and loading via streams is an important issue in coastal lagoons and embayments worldwide including the Maryland coastal bays system, USA. As in many coastal areas around the globe, declining water quality in the bays is the result of nutrient inputs from the surrounding watershed. In this study, the sources of the nutrient inputs were examined. Monthly concentrations of total nitrogen (TN), ammonium (NH4 +), nitrate (NO3 -), phosphate (PO4 -3), and total phosphorus (TP) were measured in six streams in the St. Martin River basin from July 2006 to January 2008. Current land use information for the basins of each stream was also compiled. Several significant correlations between nutrients and land use type were found. The most significant correlation was with the land area of feeding operations, which demonstrated a significant positive relationship with mean baseflow TN concentrations. A similar relationship was also found with anthropogenic land area (cropland + urban + feeding operations), and wetland area was also positively associated with hydric soils. Using local water yields from a US Geological Survey station, annual stream watershed export was calculated using the concentration data, which indicated that the watershed with the most crop agriculture had the highest N export coefficient (20.4Â kgÂ N ha-1 year-1), while the highest P export (0.47Â kg P ha-1 year-1) was in a watershed containing a nonoperational chicken hatchery and a subsequently modified channel. This suggests that agricultural development, especially animal feeding operations, and landscape characteristics are important factors to understand nutrient loading in St. Martin River and Maryland coastal bays. The methods used and the results determined in this study have implications for determining nutrient loading in lagoons and embayments, in relation to land use in coastal regions globally.  aPublisher supplied data 3aagricultural land 3aanimal feeding operations 3abasins 3achickens 3acoasts 3acrops 3ahatcheries 3ahydric soils 3aland use 3alandscapes 3anitrates 3anitrogen content 3anutrients 3aphosphates 3aphosphorus 3apollution load 3arivers 3astreams 3awater quality 3awatersheds 3awetlands 3aMaryland1 aFisher, Thomas R.1 aOâNeil, Judith M.1 aJesien, Roman V.0 tWater, air, and soil pollution.g2011 Oct., v. 221, no. 1-4 p.255-273dSpringer-Verlagx0049-69797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11270-011-0788-7  aDNAL 7aarticle03062naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003700094040001800131100002000149245011800169300001300287520131900300592002801619650002501647650002001672650001901692650002501711650001701736650003101753650001801784650001001802650002101812650001401833650002001847650002601867650002101893650001001914653002601924653003001950653003801980653002702018653002302045653002002068653002602088653003502114653001602149700002102165700002002186773024602206856008302452852000902535655001202544IND60573077520221117051103.0190411e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057307752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.recqb.2017.04.0012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCamel, Vladimir10aRED DE COEXPRESIÓN DE 320 GENES DE Tectona grandis RELACIONADOS CON PROCESOS DE ESTRÉS ABIÓTICO Y XILOGÉNESIS  ap. 5-14.  aTeak (Tectona grandis) is a timber tree of economic importance in tropical and subtropical forests. The aim of this work was to identify families of transcription factors (TFs) and enzyme-coding genes differentially expressed (DREs) in stem xylem and their regulation involved in abiotic stress response and xylogenesis in T. grandis. Therefore, the evolutionary distribution of 19 TFs of T. grandis was derived using a phylogenetic analysis. Besides, specific data mining procedures of databases and publications were performed in order to identify 320 Arabidopsis thaliana genes (orthologous to T. grandis) as experimental and predictive support. As results, we found transcription factors of the bZIP, MYB, NAC, ER, bHLH families, and enzyme-coding genes. Furthermore, interactome analysis in T. grandis showed a significant Pearson correlation for genes regulating metabolic pathways of phenylpropanoids and abiotic stress. Also, the coexpression network revealed nodes and edges between TgRAP1, TgMyB1, TgHSF1, TgMyB3, TgNAC1, TgTsiid1, TgLieTFs1, TgNuy3, TgRAP2 and TgNuy4 genes. Gene ontology analyses showed that 31 genes respond to abiotic stress, mainly TgHShT1, TgHSF1 and TgHSF2, as co-regulators. In addition, the TFs master regulator TgNAC1 was found to be involved in the co-regulation of other TFs.  aPublisher supplied data 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aTectona grandis 3aabiotic stress 3abiochemical pathways 3aforest trees 3agene expression regulation 3agene ontology 3agenes 3aphenylpropanoids 3aphylogeny 3astress response 3atranscription factors 3atropical forests 3axylem 0abiología de sistemas 0aenriquecimiento funcional 0agenes diferencialmente expresados 0aminería de literatura 0aontología génica 0asystems biology 0afunctional enrichment 0adifferentially expressed genes 0atext mining1 aGaleano, Esteban1 aCarrer, Helaine0 tTip revista especializada en ciencias químico-biológicas.g2017 July,  Dec., v. 20, no. 2 p.5-14dElsevier España, S.L.U.aUniversidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Facultad de Estudios Superiores ZaragozawJournal:23281x1405-888X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.recqb.2017.04.0013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02595naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100001900144245010900163300002000272520137800292592002801670650001001698650002201708650001401730650001701744650001301761650001401774650001901788650001601807650001101823650001801834653001501852653001201867653003001879653001801909653002501927700001801952773012601970856008002096852000902176655001202185IND60554901120221122174610.0161026e20161019xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055490112DNAL7 a10.1021/acsami.6b055142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, L.

Lanthanide Yb³⁺ and Ho³⁺ co-doped fluorapatite (FA:Yb³⁺/Ho³⁺) and hydroxyapatite (HA:Yb³⁺/Ho³⁺) particles with varying dopant concentrations were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and thermal activation. Controllable green and red upconversion emissions were generated under 980 nm near-infrared excitation; the FA:Yb³⁺/Ho³⁺ particles resulted in superior green luminescence, while HA:Yb³⁺/Ho³⁺ dominated in red emission. The difference in the green and red emission behavior was dependent on the lattice structure and composition. Two possible lattice models were proposed for Yb³⁺/Ho³⁺ co-doped HA and FA along the hydroxyl channel and fluorine channel of the apatite crystal structure. We first reported the use of the upconversion apatite particles to clearly distinguish implanted material from bone tissue on stained histological sections of harvested in vivo samples. The superposition of the tissue image and material image is a creative method to show the material-tissue distribution and interrelation. The upconversion apatite particles and image superposition method provide a novel strategy for long-term discriminable fluorescence tracking of implanted material or scaffold during bone regeneration.  aPublisher supplied data 3abones 3acrystal structure 3aemissions 3afluorescence 3afluorine 3ahistology 3ahydroxyapatite 3amethodology 3amodels 3ananoparticles 0arare earth 0aapatite 0aupconversion fluorescence 0alattice model 0aimaging and tracking1 aChen, Haifeng0 tACS Applied Materials & Interfaces.g2016 Oct. 19, v. 8, no. 41 p.27458-27464dAmerican Chemical Societyx1944-82527nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Facsami.6b055143Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03101naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147242038300172245008500555300001600640520137000656592002802026650001102054650001402065650001202079650001202091650003302103650001602136650001702152650002002169650001502189650001802204650002202222650001902244650001202263650001102275650001502286651003102301651001902332700001802351700001802369700001402387700001302401773011502414856008102529852000902610655001202619IND60121347420221120115617.0150225e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012134742DNAL7 a10.1007/s10040-014-1191-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSánchez-Murillo, R.10aAnalyse des récessions des débits de base dans l’arrière-pays du Pacifique Nord-Ouest des Etats-Unis d’Amérique Análisis de la recesión del flujo base en noroeste continental del Pacífico de los Estados Unidos 美国内陆太平洋西北地区基流衰退分析 Análise da recessão do escoamento de base na parte continental do Pacífico noroeste dos Estados Unidos10aBaseflow recession analysis in the inland Pacific Northwest of the United States  ap. 287-303.  aThe storage-discharge relationships of 26 watersheds in the inland Pacific Northwest of the United States were analyzed. Four fitting methods were used to obtain the baseflow coefficients: lower envelope, organic correlation, and ordinary and inverse least squares. Several climatic and terrain attributes were evaluated as predictors of baseflow coefficients. Watersheds dominated by basalt and flatter landscapes exhibited the smallest recession time scales (K) (12.5–20.0 days). Greater K values (33.3–66.7 days) were obtained over catchments dominated by metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. Mean basin slope and the aridity index were found to be the best estimators of baseflow coefficients. Baseflow in flat basalt landscapes, located in dry warm climates, decrease rapidly during summer months and are most sensitive to future droughts and warming climates. Groundwater systems feeding streams during the driest months can drop to less than 1 mm of effective storage in these sensitive systems. In contrast, the minimum annual storage in mountainous systems can have greater than 10 mm effective storage. By understanding the main factors controlling baseflow recession characteristics, environmental agencies could prioritize efforts in areas where future droughts and land use changes may affect ecological assemblages and socio-economic activities.  aPublisher supplied data 3abasalt 3abase flow 3aclimate 3adrought 3adry environmental conditions 3agroundwater 3ahydrogeology 3aland use change 3alandscapes 3aleast squares 3asedimentary rocks 3asocioeconomics 3astreams 3asummer 3awatersheds 3aNorthwestern United States 3aPacific States1 aBrooks, E.

Understanding whether there are high levels of site fidelity for different species of coastal fish has important implications for habitat conservation and the design of marine protected areas. We hypothesised that common salt marsh fish species would demonstrate a high site fidelity, resulting in minimal inter-marsh connectivity. Carbon (13C) and nitrogen (15N) stable isotope ratios of larvae and juveniles of five common salt marsh fish (Atherina presbyter, Chelon labrosus, Clupea harengus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Pomatoschistus microps), seven types of primary producer and seven secondary consumer food sources were sampled in five salt marshes within two estuary complexes along the coast of south-east England. Significant differences in 13C and 15N signatures between salt marshes indicated distinct sub-populations utilising the area of estuary around each salt marsh, and limited connectivity, even within the same estuary complex. 15N ratios were responsible for the majority of inter-marsh differences for each species and showed similar site-specific patterns in ratios in primary producers, secondary consumers and fish. Fish diets (derived from isotope mixing models) varied between species but were mostly consistent between marsh sites, indicating that dietary shifts were not the source of variability of the inter-marsh isotopic signatures within species. These results demonstrate that for some common coastal fish species, high levels of site fidelity result in individual salt marshes operating as discrete habitats for fish assemblages.  aPublisher supplied data 3afoods 3acarbon 3afish 3aphilopatry 3astable isotopes 3ajuveniles 3ainterspecific variation 3atides 3ahabitat conservation 3aClupea harengus 3acoasts 3aestuaries 3aPomatoschistus 3atrophic relationships 3aDicentrarchus labrax 3amodels 3asalt marshes 3alarvae 3adiet 3anitrogen 3aAtherina 3ahabitats 2aAnimals 2aCarbon Isotopes 2aEcosystem 2aFishesxphysiology 2aFood Chain 2aFood Preferences 2aHoming Behavior 2aInvertebratesxchemistry 2aLarva 2aNitrogen Isotopes 2aWetlands 3aEngland 0aEngland 0aspecies differences1 aSmith, David J.1 aGrey, Jonathan1 aUnderwood, Graham J.

When self-assembly was performed in isopropanol (i-PrOH), a selective solvent for P2VP, a decrease in the rate of the crystallization-driven transition from the initially formed spheres (with amorphous PFS cores) into cylinders (with crystalline cores) was detected with an increase in molecular weight. This trend can be explained by a decrease in the rate of crystallization for the PFS core-forming block as the chain length increased. In contrast, when a mixture of i-PrOH with increasing amounts of THF, a common solvent for both blocks, was used, spheres, cylinders, and also narrow lenticular platelets consisting of crystallized PFS lamellae sandwiched by two glassy coronal P2VP layers were formed from the same PFSₓ-b-P2VP₆ₓ sample. The most likely explanation involves the plasticization of the PFS core-forming block which facilitates crystallization, possibly complemented by contraction of the coils of the P2VP coronal block which otherwise limit of the lateral growth of the crystalline PFS core as THF is a poorer solvent for P2VP than i-PrOH. Selected area electron diffraction studies indicated that the PFS cores of the spherical micelles were amorphous but were consistent with those of the cylindrical micelles existing in a state approximating to that of a monoclinic PFS single crystal. In contrast, in the platelets formed in THF/i-PrOH, the PFS cores were found to be polycrystalline. The formation of narrow lenticular polycrystalline platelets rather than a regular, rectangular single crystalline morphology was attributed to a poisoning effect whereby the interference of the long P2VP coronal blocks in the growth of a rectangular PFS single crystalline core introduces defects at the crystal growth fronts.  aPublisher supplied data 3ablood platelets 3acomposite polymers 3acrystallization 3aisopropyl alcohol 3amicelles 3amolecular weight 3apoisoning 3apolymerization 3asolvents1 aYusoff, Siti Fairus M.1 aWinnik, Mitchell A.1 aManners, Ian0 tMacromolecules.g2014 Apr. 08, v. 47, no. 7 p.2361-2372dAmerican Chemical Societyx1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021%2Fma402429d3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03058naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001800148245011700166300001600283520162600299592002801925650001601953650003101969650002102000650001502021650001902036650001902055650001502074650001702089650001302106650002002119650001702139653001402156653002702170653003202197653002002229700001602249700001802265700001702283700001802300700001402318700001502332700001502347773012202362856008302484852000902567655001202576IND60742157720221116185822.0220307e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074215772DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.1182doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Jiaming10aConstruction of hierarchical Co9S8@NiO synergistic microstructure for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitor  ap. 440-449.  aMetal-organic frameworks (MOFs) become a research hot-spot owing to their unique properties originating from the ultra-high porosity and large specific surface area with highly accessible active sites. However, the electrochemical performance of a single component is unsatisfied when MOFs are applied as electrode material in a supercapacitor. In this work, the hierarchical hollow framework involving interconnected Co₉S₈ structure and NiO nanosheets (Co₉S₈@NiO) are successfully prepared by MOFs derived methods and proposed to electrode materials. As a result, the prepared Co₉S₈@NiO electrode materials exhibit a superior specific capacitance of 1627 F g⁻¹ at a current density of 1 A g⁻¹. Moreover, an assembled hybrid supercapacitor shows a high energy density of 51.65 Wh Kg⁻¹ at a power density of 749.8 W Kg⁻¹ as well as excellent long-term cycling stability with 81.79% capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. Meanwhile, we concluded that the marvelous electrochemical performance is closely associated with the unique structure of NiO, in particular, the nanosheet surface provides a superior specific surface area and rich accessible redox reaction sites, thus enlarged the contact between the surface and interface of the electrode material. Finally, two supercapacitor devices connected in series can light up four light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for about 30 min. Hence, the presented strategy represents a general route for supercapacitor electrode material with promising electrochemical performance, which can combine the MOFs template and other hierarchical nanosheets together.  aPublisher supplied data 3acapacitance 3aelectrochemical capacitors 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3aenergy density 3amicrostructure 3ananosheets 3anickel oxide 3aporosity 3aredox reactions 3asurface area 0aCo9S8@NiO 0aHierarchical structure 0aElectrochemical performance 0aSupercapacitors1 aHuang, Ying1 aHan, Xiaopeng1 aZhang, Shuai1 aWang, Mingyue1 aYan, Jing1 aChen, Chen1 aZong, Meng0 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.440-449dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02869naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004800094040001800142100002300160245009200183300001300275506002800288520138900316592002801705506003701733650002501770650001601795650001201811650001801823650001201841650002801853650001501881650002201896650001401918650002801932650002001960650002201980650000902002650001502011651001402026653001902040653001502059653001802074653002502092700002302117700002202140773010902162856009502271852000902366655001202375IND60775040020221207124731.0200609e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077504002DNAL7 ahttps://doi.org/10.21897/rta.v21i2.8972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGómez, Willian R.10aFodder production and quality of three cassava varieties under three planting densities  ap. 9-20.  aResource is Open Access  aOne limitation of livestock farming in the Colombian Caribbean is the decline in production and quality of forage in times of drought or rain. The aim of this study was to evaluate forage production and nutritional quality of three varieties of cassava (SM 2546-40, SM 1511-6 and SM 2081-34) under three planting densities (40,000, 55,000 and 70,000 plants ha-1) and three harvest ages (75, 90 and 105 days). The experiment was conducted at the Research Center Turipaná-Corpoica, in 2011, under a split-split-plot design with three replications. Green fodder production (GFP), dry matter production (DMP), crude protein production (CPP), crude protein content (CPC), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and ash were evaluated. In the wet season (May-August), the GFP and DMP was 150% higher than in the dry season (January to April) and the protein 100% higher. Cassava variety SM 2081-34 produced greater GFP and DMP, and lower content of ADF. In the three planting densities, GFP and DMP were similar, but with 55,000 and 700,000 plants / ha, the CPP was higher. After 105 days, the highest GFP, DMP and CPP were obtained, whereas at 75 days, the forage had lower contents of NDF and ADF, and higher protein content (CPB). After 105 days, the ash content was higher. SM 2081-34 variety produced more dry matter and protein at 105 days with 55,000 ha-1 plants.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aacid detergent fiber 3aash content 3acassava 3acrude protein 3adrought 3adry matter accumulation 3adry season 3aforage production 3alivestock 3aneutral detergent fiber 3anutritive value 3aprotein synthesis 3arain 3awet season 3aCaribbean 0acassava forage 0adry matter 0acrude protein 0aacid detergent fiber1 aCardona, Carlos E.1 aRivero, Sandra T.0 tTemas Agrarios.g2016 July, v. 21, no. 2 p.9-20dUniversidad de CórdobawJournal:27729x2389-91827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/https://doi.org/10.21897/rta.v21i2.8973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03610naa a2200577 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006000150245009400210520190500304592002802209650002102237650001802258650001302276650002202289650001702311650001902328650002202347650001902369650001902388650001002407650001802417650002402435650002102459650001502480650001102495650001602506650002302522650001002545650001402555650001602569650002202585650001802607653002202625653002102647653001102668653002902679653003402708700002102742700002002763700001902783700002002802700001702822773008702839856008502926852000903011655001203020IND60674208720221118061025.0191214e202002  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067420872DNAL7 a10.1016/j.catena.2019.1042992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGoncharova, Olga1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1099-251X10aTemporal dynamics, drivers, and components of soil respiration in urban forest ecosystems  aThe objective of the study was to estimate the seasonal dynamics, the contribution of roots, litter, and soil microorganisms, as well as the primary drivers (soil moisture and temperature) of soil respiration (Rs) in urban forest ecosystems. Trenching and litter exclusion methods were used to distinguish root-derived (Rr) and litter-derived respiration (Rl) in soils of the Lomonosov Moscow State University (LMSU) Botanical Garden Arboretum, planted with Picea obovata (spruce) and Carpinus betulus (hornbeam). Measurements were taken every 1–2 weeks year round, as well as moisture (Θ10) and temperature (T10) of upper soil horizons (top 10 cm). The major factors affecting Rs were T10 throughout the year and Θ10 in summer. The results indicate that the contribution of Rr to Rs during the growing season on average for the spruce plantation was 34%, and for the hornbeam plantation was 38%. Our results indicated that trenching might significantly increase soil moisture, which could confound the results. The contribution of Rl to Rs on average during a year for the spruce plantation was 27%, and for the hornbeam plantation was 18%. Our data indicated a decrease in basal respiration due to litter and root exclusion in the hornbeam plantation. Year-round experiments have revealed that Rs, its temporal dynamics and drivers, as well as the contribution of individual components (roots, litter) are similar to the data obtained for natural forests. Thus, any climatic changes associated with urban development will affect the values of soil respiration similarly to natural forests. Also, the value of Rs will be influenced by manipulations carried out in urban environments, such as litter removal, the replacement of trees with lawns, and watering. Additionally, our data suggest the possibility of using such urban ecosystems as objects for research related to the carbon cycle.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCarpinus betulus 3aPicea obovata 3aarboreta 3abotanical gardens 3acarbon cycle 3aclimate change 3aforest ecosystems 3agrowing season 3alawns and turf 3aroots 3asoil horizons 3asoil microorganisms 3asoil respiration 3asoil water 3asummer 3atemperature 3atemporal variation 3atrees 3atrenching 3aurban areas 3aurban development 3aurban forests 0aBasal respiration 0aBotanical garden 0aLitter 0aRoot-derived respiration 0aSoil temperature and moisture1 aMatyshak, Georgy1 aUdovenko, Maria1 aSemenyuk, Olga1 aEpstein, Howard1 aBobrik, Anna0 tCatena.g2020 Feb., v. 185 p.104299-dElsevier B.V.wJournal:6271x0341-81627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2019.1042993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001600148245017100164300001600335520159300351592002801944650000801972650002301980650001502003650002002018650002802038650002102066650001502087650001702102650000902119650001602128650001502144653001602159653001902175653004302194700001202237700001702249700001602266773009602282856008202378852000902460655001202469IND60091676320221121060658.0161021e20131015xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6009167632DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2013.04.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiang, Gang10aElectrochemical detection of the amino-substituted naphthalene compounds based on intercalative interaction with hairpin DNA by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy  ap. 238-243.  aThe amino-substituted naphthalene compounds, such as 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (1,8-DANAP), 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (2,3-DANAP), 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (1,5-DANAP), 1-naphthylamine (1-NAP) and 2-naphthylamine (2-NAP), were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which was based on the interaction with hairpin DNA immobilized on the gold electrodes. Upon hairpin DNA interacting with the target chemicals, the charge transfer resistance (RCT) of the hairpin DNA films was significantly decreased and the charge transfer resistance change (ΔRCT) decreased in a sequence of ΔRCT 1,8-DANAP>ΔRCT 2,3-DANAP>ΔRCT 1,5-DANAP>ΔRCT 1-NAP>ΔRCT 2-NAP. The ΔRCT changes were due to the difference in the binding constant (KSV) of the target chemicals to DNA. In addition, the interaction mechanism was further explored using 1,8-DANAP as a model analyte by fluorescence spectra, Raman spectroscopy, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and EIS, correspondingly. The results demonstrated that the amino-substituted naphthalene compounds intercalated into “stem” appearing in the hairpin DNA. Moreover, the hairpin DNA sensor exhibited high sensitivity to the amino-substituted naphthalene compounds with the detection limit of nano-mole, and maintained high selectivity over other selected environmental pollutants. Finally, the DNA sensor was challenged in natural water sample with a recovery of 96–102%, which offered a platform for prospective future development of a simple, rapid, sensitive and low-cost assay for the detection of target aromatic amine pollutants.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aRaman spectroscopy 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adielectric spectroscopy 3aelectrochemistry 3aelectrodes 3afluorescence 3agold 3anaphthalene 3apollutants 0aHairpin DNA 0aAromatic amine 0aElectrochemical impedance spectroscopy1 aLi, Tao1 aLi, Xiaohong1 aLiu, Xinhui0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2013 Oct. 15, v. 48 p.238-243dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2013.04.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02620naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002000152245008400172300001500256520164400271592002801915650001301943650001901956650001601975650001401991650001102005650001202016650001802028650001902046651001802065700001802083773008602101856008602187852000902273655001202282IND60086339520221116210951.0141101e201209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008633952DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.06.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChen, Wei-Qiang10aDynamic analysis of aluminum stocks and flows in the United States: 1900–2009  ap. 92-102.  aA dynamic analysis of anthropogenic aluminum stocks and flows in the U.S. from 1900 to 2009 has been conducted. Key findings include (1) historical cumulative aluminum input into the U.S. anthroposphere amounts to 438 Tg, with only about 35% of it accumulating in domestic in-use stock; (2) less than 5% of most flows take place before 1950, while more than 50% of them happen after 1990; (3) flows into fabrication, manufacturing, and use processes, as well as trade flows, are vulnerable to energy crises; basically, after an energy crisis, the U.S. tends to produce less primary aluminum, less semis, as well as less final products, and therefore import less bauxite and alumina but import more unwrought aluminum and final products; (4) the U.S. has been a net importer of aluminum from the life cycle perspective, with its total annual net import increasing from 1945 to 2005; (5) as a result of the continuous increase of net import, total domestic stock of aluminum in the U.S. dramatically increases in the period of 1945–2009 and amounts to 316 Tg in 2009, about nine times of that in 1900; (6) in-use stock comprises about 48% of total domestic stock in 2009 and is dominated by two sectors, Buildings and Construction (32%) and Transportation (35%); (7) total per-capita stock in use of aluminum keeps increasing until 2009 and currently amounts to 490kg; (8) per-capita stock of aluminum in Transportation sector increases substantially after 1990s because of the light-weighting of automobiles, while that in the Buildings and Construction and Electrical Engineering sectors seems have reached a saturation level after 2005.  aPublisher supplied data 3aaluminum 3aaluminum oxide 3aautomobiles 3abuildings 3aenergy 3aimports 3amanufacturing 3atransportation 3aUnited States1 aGraedel, T.E.0 tEcological economics.g2012 Sept., v. 81 p.92-102dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.06.0083Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02948naa a2200493 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094024002200129024001900151040001800170100001900188245014000207300001800347506007600365520142100441592002801862506003701890650001801927650001001945650001401955650001301969650001301982650001201995650001302007650001202020650002202032650001202054650001702066650001202083650002302095650002502118700001902143700001502162700001402177700001402191700001402205700002002219773011302239856008102352852000902433655001202442IND60575365820221207135541.0170728e201705  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057536582DNAL7 a10.1007/s13197-017-2584-x2doi7 aPMC54301852pmcid7 a285596122pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhao, Jin-Hong10aEffect of osmotic dehydration pretreatment and glassy state storage on the quality attributes of frozen mangoes under long-term storage  ap. 1527-1537.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aChanges in the quality of frozen mango cuboids were investigated during long-term glassy state storage with and without osmotic dehydration pretreatment. The mango cuboids were dehydrated in mixed solutions (sucrose: glucose: fructose in a ratio of 3.6:1:3) of different concentrations (30, 40, and 50% (wt/wt)) prior to freezing and then stored at −55 °C (in the glassy state) for 6 months. The results revealed that compared with the untreated samples, osmotic pretreatment decreased total color difference (reduced by 15.6–62.3%), drip loss (reduced by 8.2–29.5%) and titration acidity (reduced by 1.3–9.4%), while increasing hardness (increased by 48.8–82.3%), vitamin C content (increased by 72.5–120.6%) and total soluble solids (increased by 21.8–53.7%) of frozen mangoes after 6 months. Dehydration with a sugar concentration of 40% was considered as the optimal pretreatment condition. In addition, a storage temperature of −55 °C provided better retention of quality than rubbery state storage at −18 °C. With prolonged storage time, the quality of frozen mangoes continued to change, even in the glassy state. However, the changes in quality of the osmotic-dehydrated samples were less than those of the untreated samples. The current work indicates that osmotic pretreatment and glassy state storage significantly improved the quality of frozen mangoes during long-term storage.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aascorbic acid 3acolor 3adrip loss 3afreezing 3afructose 3aglucose 3ahardness 3amangoes 3aosmotic treatment 3astorage 3astorage time 3asucrose 3atitratable acidity 3atotal soluble solids1 aXiao, Hong-Wei1 aDing, Yang1 aNie, Ying1 aZhang, Yu1 aZhu, Zhen1 aTang, Xuan-Ming0 tJournal of food science and technology.g2017 May, v. 54, no. 6 p.1527-1537dSpringer Indiax0022-11557nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13197-017-2584-x3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02239naa a2200313 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002600147245016700173300001600340520113900356592002801495650001401523650001701537650002001554650001801574650003001592650002101622700002101643700003001664700001901694773011001713856008101823852000901904655001201913IND60519346320221121145505.0160427e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051934632DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2331-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorda-Diez, Carlos I.14aThe tumor suppressor BTG1 is expressed in the developing digits and regulates skeletogenic differentiation of limb mesodermal progenitors in high density cultures  ap. 299-308.  aIn the developing limb, differentiation of skeletal progenitors towards distinct connective tissues of the digits is correlated with the establishment of well-defined domains of Btg1 gene expression. Zones of high expression of Btg1 include the earliest digit blastemas, the condensing mesoderm at the tip of the growing digits, the peritendinous mesenchyme, and the chondrocytes around the developing interphalangeal joints. Gain- and loss-of function experiments in micromass cultures of skeletal progenitors reveal a negative influence of Btg1 in cartilage differentiation accompanied by up-regulation of Ccn1, Scleraxis and PTHrP. Previous studies have assigned a role to these factors in the aggregation of progenitors in the digit tips (Ccn1), in the differentiation of tendon blastemas (Scleraxis) and repressing hypertrophic cartilage differentiation (PTHrP). Overexpression of Btg1 up-regulates the expression of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors, but, different from other systems, the influence of BTG1 in connective tissue differentiation appears to be independent of retinoic acid and thyroid hormone signaling.  aPublisher supplied data 3acartilage 3achondrocytes 3agene expression 3aretinoic acid 3athyroid hormone receptors 3athyroid hormones1 aMontero, Juan A.1 aGarcía-Porrero, Juan A.,1 aHurle, Juan M.0 tCell and tissue research.g2016 May, v. 364, no. 2 p.299-308dSpringer Berlin Heidelbergx0302-766X7nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00441-015-2331-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02238naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245006700170520122400237592002801461650001501489650001101504650001601515650001501531650001501546650001501561651001001576653002701586653000801613653000801621653001001629653000801639700001601647700001701663773009001680856008501770852000901855655001201864IND60674208820221118061104.0200712e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067420882DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.1322doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Jinliang13aAn adaptive hybrid model for short term wind speed forecasting  aAccurate wind speed forecasting is useful for large-scale wind power integration, which can reduce the adverse effects of wind power on the power grid. However, due to the randomness and uncertainty of wind speed, accurate wind speed forecasting becomes very difficult. To improve the forecasting accuracy, an adaptive hybrid model based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed. First, the original wind speed is decomposed into some regular and irregular components by VMD and FOA. Second, ARIMA model is built to forecast the regular components, while DBN is used for irregular components forecasting. Third, the final forecasting results is obtained by summing the forecasting results of each component. The effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by using data from two different wind farms in China. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed model, some well-recognized single models and some latest published hybrid models are selected as the comparison models. Empirical results show that the accuracy of the adaptive model is more higher than the other models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalgorithms 3amodels 3auncertainty 3awind farms 3awind power 3awind speed 3aChina 0aWind speed forecasting 0aVMD 0aFOA 0aARIMA 0aDBN1 aWei, Yiming1 aTan, Zhongfu0 tEnergy.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.115615-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.06.1323Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03128naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100002900148245005800177300001600235520178300251592002802034650000802062650001302070650001102083650000902094650001302103650002902116650001702145650001402162650001102176650002002187653001802207653003202225653002302257653002102280653002302301700005802324700001602382700006702398773013702465856008302602852000902685655001202694IND60742157920221116185901.0220307e202112  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074215792DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.1202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhalesi Moghaddam, Razie10aDeterministic particle assembly on nanophotonic chips  ap. 259-269.  aControlled particle assembly from a dilute suspension droplet is challenging yet important for many lab-on-a-chip and biosensing applications. The formation of hot spots on the localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) substrates induced by laser excitation can generate microbubbles. These microbubbles, upon the laser removal, shrink and collapse due to electron energy dissipation, leading to guided particle assembly on the LSPR substrate. After depositing dilute silica particles dispersions on both nanoisland (AuNI) and planar gold (Au) plasmonic substrates (referred to as LSPR and SPR substrates respectively), microbubbles were formed when a laser beam was applied. Particle dispersion concentration, laser power, and the radius of circular laser sequence were varied to produce different sizes of particle clusters on the LSPR substrate after bubble shrinkage upon the laser removal. To stabilize the assembled structures over time, sodium chloride (NaCl) was ad ded to the dispersions. Even though thermo-plasmonic flow and microbubbles can be produced with SPR substrates, particle assembly is only possible on LSPR substrates because of electron energy dissipation via nanoscale air gaps trapped in the LSPR substrate. By tuning the laser power, the radius of the circular laser sequence, and the particle dispersion concentration, the number of particles in the assembled structure can be controlled. The addition of NaCl to the dispersion can screen the electrostatic charges among the particles and between the particles and substrate, favoring hydrogen bonding and stabilizing the assembled structures for hours. These findings establish a new framework for utilizing nanophotonic chips where particle assembly can be achieved by a single source of light.  aPublisher supplied data 3aair 3adroplets 3aenergy 3agold 3ahydrogen 3alab-on-a-chip technology 3amicrobubbles 3ashrinkage 3asilica 3asodium chloride 0aSelf-assembly 0aSurface plasmonic resonance 0aNanophotonic chips 0aBubble shrinkage 0aHot spot formation1 aBhalla, Nikhil1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4720-36791 aQ.Shen, Amy1 aNatale, Giovanniantonio1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5331-09320 tJournal of colloid and interface science.g2021 Dec., v. 603 p.259-269dElsevier Inc.aElsevier Inc.wJournal:12461x0021-97977nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2021.06.1203Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02580naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001600150245009800166520131300264592002801577650002401605650001601629650002001645650001901665650001901684650001901703650001201722650001601734650001401750653001901764653002201783653001001805653003001815653002201845700001401867700001501881700001801896700002001914700001401934773010401948856008502052852000902137655001202146IND60687810320221116225517.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068781032DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1094092doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLi, Kunshan10aBi3TaO7/Ti3C2 heterojunctions for enhanced photocatalytic removal of water-borne contaminants  aNovel catalysts are of great interest for improved photocatalytic environmental remediation. Using a hydrothermal method, 0D/2D Bi₃TaO₇/Ti₃C₂ heterojunctions were designed rationally and characterized systematically as excellent photocatalysts for photocatalytic degradation. The hybrid catalyst exhibits superior performance in visible-light-driven photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (about 99% degradation efficiency after 2 h) and excellent stability (up to 10 cycles) under visible light irradiation (300 W Xe lamp; λ > 420 nm; light intensity 150 mW cm⁻²). In addition, Bi₃TaO₇/Ti₃C₂ has a larger rate constant (0.032 min⁻¹) than pristine Bi₃TaO₇ (0.006 min⁻¹). Quantum yield (2.27 × 10⁻⁵ molecules/photon) and figure of merit (23.3) of the system were obtained, suggesting that our catalyst has potential for application. Both experimental and computational results indicate that synergistic effects between Bi₃TaO₇ and Ti₃C₂ improve photocatalytic performance by enhancing electron-hole pair separation, electronic transmission efficiency, and interfacial charge transfer. These findings contribute to the synthesis of efficient visible-light-driven Bi-based photocatalysts and to the understanding of photocatalytic degradation reactions.  aPublisher supplied data 3ahot water treatment 3airradiation 3alight intensity 3amethylene blue 3aphotocatalysis 3aphotocatalysts 3aphotons 3aremediation 3asynergism 0aPhotocatalysis 0aBismuth tantalite 0aTi3C2 0aEnvironmental remediation 0aCharge separation1 aLu, Xinyu1 aZhang, You1 aLiu, Kuiliang1 aHuang, Yongchao1 aLiu, Hong0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 June, v. 185 p.109409-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1094093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02598naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002000150245012900170520138000299592002801679650001101707650001201718650002001730650000901750650002401759653003101783653002101814653004201835653002801877653003401905653003201939700002201971700002001993700002702013773009002040856008502130852000902215655001202224IND60674209020221118060912.0200712e20200101xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6067420902DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2019.1162242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChabok, Hossein10aOn the assessment of the impact of a price-maker energy storage unit on the operation of power system: The ISO point of view  aThis paper basically concentrates on the impact of a price-maker energy storage unit (PMESU) on the operation of the power system. Recently, energy storage systems (ESSs) have attracted much attention as one of the renewable and pollution-free sources of energy and are applicable due to their exclusive advantages in power systems. In this paper, the ESS considered as a price-maker market player, which attempts to maximize the benefits of its competition in the market environment. The main operation problem of the PMESU represented as a bi-level optimization problem which comprises of nonlinear terms. First, a stochastic-based bidding/offering approach (SBOA) is considered which is less complex and takes lesser time to be solved compared to the MPEC method. Second, conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) method is used in order to control the risk of utilizing inoperative scenarios. Finally, the operation problem of the proposed PMESU is formed as a max-min problem in order to analyse the impact of the PMESU in the worst case condition from the perspective of the independent system operator (ISO). In addition, transmission switching (TS) method is utilized to minimize the system operation cost from the ISO point of view. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on an IEEE 9-bus test system which shows the authenticity and validity of this work.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3amarkets 3aoperating costs 3arisk 3asystem optimization 0aPrice-maker storage system 0aBi-level problem 0aScenario-based stochastic programming 0aRisk-constraint problem 0aBidding and offering strategy 0aTransmission switching (TS)1 aRoustaei, Mahmoud1 aSheikh, Morteza1 aKavousi-Fard, Abdollah0 tEnergy.g2020 Jan. 01, v. 190 p.116224-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1162243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02855naa a2200469 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002400152245009900176300001600275520142800291592002801719650002501747650002801772650001501800650001301815650001601828650002001844650001801864650001101882650001101893650002101904650002601925650001201951650000901963650001301972650002101985650002002006650002202026650001002048650002902058653001602087653002002103700001902123773013502142856008702277852000902364655001202373IND60689017020221120202037.0200523e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068901702DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.2532doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGnanesh Kumar, B.S.10aSequence characterization and N-glycoproteomics of secretory immunoglobulin A from donkey milk  ap. 605-613.  aSecretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA) is the major antibody present in the human milk where it confers passive immunity to neonates. Other than human, non-ruminants such as equine, swine etc., also possess sIgA in milk but detailed characterization is limited. In the present study, we characterized sIgA from donkey milk for amino acid sequence and N-glycosylation through LC-MS/MS analysis. The complete amino acid sequence of alpha chain constant region (CH) was elucidated. The sequence analysis of variable regions (VH and VL) and light chain constant region (CL) showed several amino acid substitutions indicating the presence of diverse immunoglobulin repertoire. Glycoproteomic analysis of secretory component revealed bi-antennary complex and hybrid types with differential core fucosylation at site N₈₃LT, only complex glycans at N₁₃₅GT, N₄₂₃GT and N₅₃₀LT with mainly NeuAc whereas N₂₉₁QT harbors high mannose glycans. Heavy chain possesses majorly bi-antennary complex with differential core fucosylation at sites N₁₃₉AS and N₃₃₈VS, in which N₃₃₈VS shows partial occupancy. Joining chain harbors only complex type at N₇₂IS, with core fucosylation and terminal NeuGc to some extent. N-glycan repertoire in part is similar to human sIgA. This comprehensive analysis of sequence and glycan pattern of donkey milk sIgA would be beneficial for its potential applications.  aPublisher supplied data 3aamino acid sequences 3aamino acid substitution 3aantibodies 3aass milk 3abreast milk 3aglycoproteomics 3aglycosylation 3ahorses 3ahumans 3aimmunoglobulin A 3aliquid chromatography 3amannose 3amilk 3aneonates 3apassive immunity 3apolysaccharides 3asequence analysis 3aswine 3atandem mass spectrometry 0aDonkey milk 0aN-glycosylation1 aRawal, Apoorva0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 July 15, v. 155 p.605-613dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.03.2533Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02191naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002200147245009700169300001600266520104100282592002801323650001701351650002201368650002201390650002701412650002001439650001301459650001401472650001201486650002101498650001201519650000901531650001101540651001101551700002101562700002001583773010001603856008101703852000901784655001201793IND60537287120221118082225.0160807e201607  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053728712DNAL7 a10.1134/S10642293160500572doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGlushakova, A.

Invasion on the diversity of soil yeast communities  ap. 792-795.  aThe annual dynamics of yeast communities were studied in the soddy-podzolic soil under the thickets of Aster x salignus Willd., one of the widespread invasive plant species in central Russia. Yeast groups in the soils under continuous aster thickets were found to differ greatly from the yeast communities in the soils under the adjacent indigenous meadow vegetation. In both biotopes the same species (Candida vartiovaarae, Candida sake, and Cryptococcus terreus) are dominants. However, in the soils under indigenous grasses, eurybiontic yeasts Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, which almost never occur in the soil under aster, are widespread. In the soil under aster, the shares of other typical epiphytic and pedobiontic yeast fungi (ascomycetic species Wickerhamomyces aniomalus, Barnettozyma californica and basidiomycetic species Cystofilobasidium macerans, Guehomyces pullulans) significantly increase. Thus, the invasion of Aster x salignus has a clear effect on soil yeast complexes reducing their taxonomic and ecological diversity.  aPublisher supplied data 3aCandida sake 3aCystofilobasidium 3aRhodotorula rubra 3aTrichosporon pullulans 3aWickerhamomyces 3abiotopes 3aepiphytes 3agrasses 3ainvasive species 3ameadows 3asoil 3ayeasts 3aRussia1 aKachalkin, A.

It has been found that the penetration depth of spherical magnetic particles (SMPs) during their 150-year-occurrence in soils of a forest plot is 68 cm under forest, 58 cm on a 100-year old plowland, and only 49 cm on a 150-year-old plowland. In the chernozems of the steppe plot, the penetration depth of SMPs exceeds the studied depth of 70 cm both under natural vegetation and on the plowlands. The penetration rates of SMPs deep into the soil vary significantly among the key plots: 0.92–1.32 mm/year on the forest plot and 1.47–1.63 mm/year on the steppe plot, probably because of the more active recent turbation activity of soil animals.  aPublisher supplied data 3aChernozems 3aLuvisols 3aanimals 3aarable soils 3aforest soils 3aforests 3amagnetic materials 3asteppes 3atracer techniques1 aGennadiev, A.

However, the temperature variations caused by the thermodynamic process are important because of the following two reasons: 1) gas temperature influences the pressure and gas flow; 2) gas temperature is an important indicator for hydrate formation in gas networks, which greatly jeopardizes the gas transmission. We herein propose a probabilistic energy flow method considering the thermodynamic process in gas networks. To build the energy flow model, the algebraic pipeline flow model under the non-isothermal condition is derived according to a set of partial differential equations reflecting the thermodynamic process. The models of pressure-regulating stations and compression stations considering the thermodynamic processes are presented in an electricity–gas analysis for the first time. Risk indices are proposed to quantify the risks of hydrate formation and state variables that exceed the limits. The simulation results of two test cases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  aPublisher supplied data 3adifferential equation 3aenergy flow 3amodels 3arisk 3arisk assessment 3atemperature 3athermodynamics 0aElectricity–gas systems 0aProbabilistic energy flow 0aThermodynamic process 0aPressure-regulating stations 0aHydrate formation1 aYang, Zhifang1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6899-83031 aYu, Juan1 aDai, Wei1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6815-65361 aGuo, Lin1 aYu, Hongxin0 tEnergy.g2019 Dec. 15, v. 189 p.116263-dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2019.1162633Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02929naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012200165520118700287592002801474650001601502650001301518650001901531650001101550650001301561650002101574650002401595650001801619650001701637650001901654650001901673650001001692650002801702650001701730650001401747650001801761650001301779650001401792650002601806650002301832650001801855650001701873651001001890653003201900653001801932653002101950653001701971653002601988700001602014700001802030700001702048700001502065700001902080700001802099773010402117856008502221852000902306655001202315IND60687810520221116225411.0200607e202006  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068781052DNAL7 a10.1016/j.envres.2020.1094172doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJia, Shuyu10aDisinfection characteristics of Pseudomonas peli, a chlorine-resistant bacterium isolated from a water supply network  aLack of microbial contamination is crucial for drinking water quality and safety. Chlorine-resistant bacteria in drinking water distribution systems pose a threat to drinking water quality. A bacterium was isolated from an urban water supply network in northern China and identified as Pseudomonas peli by 16S rDNA gene analysis. This P. peli strain had high chlorine tolerance. The CT value (the product of disinfectant concentration and contact time) to achieve 3 lg unit (i.e. 99.9%)-inactivation of this P. peli isolate was 51.26–90.36 mg min/L, inversely proportional to the free chlorine concentration. Chlorine dioxide could inactivate the bacterium faster and more efficiently than free chlorine, as shown by flow cytometry. Thiazole orange plus propidium iodide staining indicated that free chlorine and chlorine dioxide inactivated P. peli primarily by disrupting the integrity and permeability of the cell membrane. The P. peli was also sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) radiation; a UV dose of 40 mJ/cm² achieved 4 lg unit (99.99%)-inactivation. The Hom model was more suitable for analyzing the disinfection kinetics of P. peli than the Chick and Chick-Watson models.  aPublisher supplied data 3aPseudomonas 3abacteria 3acell membranes 3achicks 3achlorine 3achlorine dioxide 3acomputer simulation 3adisinfectants 3adisinfection 3adrinking water 3aflow cytometry 3agenes 3amicrobial contamination 3apermeability 3apropidium 3aribosomal DNA 3astaining 3athiazoles 3aultraviolet radiation 3awater distribution 3awater quality 3awater supply 3aChina 0aChlorine-resistant bacteria 0aFree chlorine 0aChlorine dioxide 0aUV radiation 0aDisinfection kinetics1 aJia, Ruibao1 aZhang, Kefeng1 aSun, Shaohua1 aLu, Nannan1 aWang, Mingquan1 aZhao, Qinghua0 tEnvironmental research.g2020 June, v. 185 p.109417-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:12442x0013-93517nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.1094173Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03143naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006300148245009300211300001400304520186700318592002802185650002102213650001002234650001502244650001502259650001402274650001402288650001702302650001302319650002602332650001002358653001902368653001402387700002102401700002502422700002302447700006102470773011002531856008302641852000902724655001202733IND60742158220221116190925.0210812e202107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074215822DNAL7 a10.1016/j.jcpa.2021.05.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCrouch, Esther E.V.1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4505-959410aPathology of the Bearded Dragon (Pogona vitticeps): a Retrospective Analysis of 36 Cases  ap. 51-61.  aThe bearded dragon (Pogona vitticeps) is a common species in the pet reptile trade and in zoological collections. Despite this, only a few reviews detailing common causes of mortality have been published. The goal of this retrospective study was to compile information related to the presence and prevalence of various diseases in bearded dragons in several private and one zoological collection. Findings from 36 animals, necropsied over a 20-year period were categorized on the basis of the cause of death or euthanasia and the organ system affected. Multiple contributors to death were identified in a subset of animals (n = 12; 33.33%) and were counted in more than one category. The most common contributors to death by category were inflammatory (infectious or non-infectious) diseases (n = 25; 69.44%), followed by chronic/degenerative diseases (n = 17; 47.22%). Diseases or conditions that were systemic, or affected the hepatobiliary system, were the most commonly implicated in death. The most frequent histological findings included hepatic fatty change, renal tubular epithelial pigmentation and the presence of faveolar hyaline-like material. Although Chi square testing did not reveal an association between these common findings and comorbidities, a statistically significant association was found between chronic/degenerative causes of death and renal tubular epithelial pigment. Chi square testing of categorical variables, including contributors to death, primary organ(s) affected, sex, age class and institution, identified statistically significant associations between males and chronic/degenerative disease (P = 0.043) and inflammatory contributors to death and private collection animals (P = 0.039). Death due to inflammatory contributors was significantly higher in the 1–5-year-old and >5-year-old age classes (P = 0.02).  aPublisher supplied data 3aPogona vitticeps 3adeath 3aepithelium 3aeuthanasia 3ahistology 3amortality 3apigmentation 3areptiles 3aretrospective studies 3atrade 0abearded dragon 0apathology1 aMcAloose, Denise1 aMcEntire, Michael S.1 aMorrisey, James K.1 aMiller, Andrew D.1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6350-55810 tJournal of comparative pathology.g2021 July, v. 186 p.51-61dElsevier LtdwJournal:1946x0021-99757nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcpa.2021.05.0043Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02279naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005800150245012000208300001800328500001900346520092100365592002801286650001001314650002301324650001301347650001701360650001601377700005501393700001601448700001501464700001901479700005201498700005701550700005301607700002001660773012001680856008401800852000901884655001201893IND60701722720221123001558.0200714e20200605xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070172272DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c007882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aJiao, Guisheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3610-852910a3d Most-Probable All-Atom Structure of Atactic Polystyrene During Glass Formation: A Neutron Total Scattering Study  ap. 5140-5146.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aThe deepest and most interesting unsolved problem in soft condensed matter physics is the nature of glass formation, and one of the most difficult things to solve the problem is to directly observe its molecular origin. In this study, we combined neutron total scattering, deuterated labelling, and molecular dynamics simulation to visualize the most-probable all-atom positions in atactic polystyrene during the glass formation. We found that the peak at ∼0.6 Å–¹ is from the segment–segment interaction, and the peak at 1.4 Å–¹ is mainly from the phenyl–phenyl interaction. Below the glass formation temperature, both peaks remain constant in heights and shapes. Their heights jump during glass formation, revealing the melting of the configuration variation and phenyl flipping. The combined approach presented has opened a new route for directly investigating the atomic details in glass formation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aglass 3amolecular dynamics 3aneutrons 3apolystyrenes 3atemperature1 aZuo, Taisen1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6741-53991 aMa, Changli1 aHan, Zehua1 aZhang, Junrong1 aChen, Ye1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0664-665X1 aZhao, Junpeng1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2590-00271 aCheng, He1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8718-41101 aHan, Charles C.0 tMacromolecules.g2020 June 05, v. 53, no. 13 p.5140-5146dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c007883Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03479naa a2200553 u 4500001001100000005001700011008004100028016002100069024003400090040001800124100002300142245009100165300001600256520157400272536036001846592002802206650001402234650001702248650001802265650001402283650001002297650001102307650001302318650001502331650002302346650001202369650000902381650000902390650002202399650001102421650002502432651001902457653001902476653001902495653002602514653001902540653002602559653001702585653001802602653001402620700002602634700002102660700001802681700002802699773009602727856008102823852000902904655001202913IND608633920221119222619.0181124e201207  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND60863392DNAL7 a10.1177/09596836114304142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRando, Juan Carlos10aLate-Holocene asynchronous extinction of endemic mammals on the eastern Canary Islands  ap. 801-808.  aThe Lava mouse (Malpaisomys insularis), and the Canarian shrew (Crocidura canariensis) are endemic of the Eastern Canary Islands and islets. The former is extinct while Canarian shrew survives in the two main islands and two islets. In order to provide insights regarding causes and processes contributing to the extinction of these endemic mammals: (i) we established last occurrence dates for Lava mouse, and first records for two exotic species – House mouse (Mus musculus) and Black rat (Rattus rattus) – through direct ¹⁴C AMS dating of collagen from bones; (ii) we analysed recent material from Barn owl (Tyto alba gracilirostris) roosting sites to evaluate its impact on Canarian shrew in the presence of introduced rodents. The new data strongly suggest that the extinction of Lava mouse was the result of an accumulative process of independent disappearances (or ‘local extinctions’) affecting the isolated populations. The timing of the introduction of the Black rat on the main islands (before Middle Age European contact in Lanzarote and after Middle Age European contact in Fuerteventura) matches with the last occurrence dates for the presence of Lava mouse on these islands, and are very probably their cause. The losses of these Lava mouse populations occurred in an asynchronous way, spreading across at least six centuries. On small islands, hyperpredation emerges as the most plausible process to explain the disappearance of the Lava mouse in the absence of rat populations, although stochastic processes can not be definitively excluded.  aThis work was supported by Spanish DGICYT Research Projects CGL2007-62047/BTE (Cronología y causas de las extinciones de vertebrados autóctonos en Canarias y Baleares: un análisis comparativo.

Cumulative inhibition of ACE, NEP and APN effectively blocks the progression of respective pathways. In this study, N-methylated peptide inhibitors F-N(Me)H-L, V-N(Me)F-R and R-N(Me)V-Y were synthesized against ACE, NEP and APN respectively, using their respective physiological substrates. F-N(Me)H-L inhibited ACE activity with an IC50 of 83 nmol/L, V-N(Me)F-R inhibited NEP activity with an IC50 of 1.173 μmol/L and R-N(Me)V-Y inhibited APN activity with an IC50 of 3.94 nmol/L respectively. Further, the anti-hypertensive effect of N-methylated peptides was evaluated using rat model of dexamethasone-induced hypertension. Individual peptides and their cocktail treatment were started from day 6 of the study period and blood pressure was measured on every alternate day during 15 day study. Administration of F-N(Me)H-L (138 ± 3 mmHg) and cocktail of all the three peptides at a dose of 100 mg/kg significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (SBP) compared to dexamethasone group (SBP of Groups-dexamethasone; (167 ± 5 mmHg), F-N(Me)H-L (138 ± 3 mmHg), and Cocktail (122 ± 3 mmHg). Anti-hypertensive, anti-hypertrophic and anti-fibrotic effects of N-methylated peptides and cocktail was further reflected by the decreased levels of circulating Ang II and increased ANP levels in sera of hypertensive rats along with decrease in collagen deposition in heart and kidney. Though, ACE inhibition is adequate to reduce SBP, targeting NEP and APN along with ACE is beneficial in tackling hypertension and associated fibrosis of heart.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanimal disease models 3aantihypertensive effect 3acollagen 3adexamethasone 3afibrosis 3aheart 3ahypertension 3ainhibitory concentration 50 3akidneys 3amembrane alanyl aminopeptidase 3apeptides 3apeptidyl-dipeptidase A 3arats 3asystolic blood pressure 3avasoconstriction 3avasodilation 0aRAS 0aACE 0aNEP 0aAng II 0aANP 0aSBP 0aAngiotensin converting enzyme 0aNeutral endopeptidase 0aAminopeptidase N 0aF-N(Me)H-L 0aV-N(Me)F-R 0aR-N(Me)V-Y 0aAtrial natriuretic peptide1 aSuvilesh, Kanve Nagaraj1 aSiddesha, Jalahalli Mariswamy1 aMilan Gowda, M.D.1 aChoudhury, Manisha1 aVelmurugan, Devadasan1 aUmashankar, Muddegowda1 aVishwanath, Bannikuppe Sannanaik0 tPeptides.g2020 Jan., v. 123 p.170180-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.1701803Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03416naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100002200139245016800161300001800329520163200347592002801979650002702007650004102034650001402075650001102089650001302100650001302113650000902126650002202135650001902157650001702176650001102193650001102204650001002215650001402225650003002239650001302269650002102282650001702303650001102320650002302331651001002354653002202364653001502386653001402401653001902415700001702434700002002451700002702471700002202498700001702520700001802537700001602555700001902571773012902590856007402719852000902793655001202802IND60655032320221121061051.0190729e20171208xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6065503232DNAL7 a10.1093/ee/nvx1582doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWenninger, Erik J10aPhenology of the Potato Psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Hemiptera: Triozidae), and “Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum” in Commercial Potato Fields in Idaho  ap. 1179-1188.  aZebra chip disease (ZC) is an emerging disease of potato in which tubers are produced with striped necrotic patterns that make them unmarketable. ZC is associated with the bacterium “Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum” (Lso), which is transmitted by the potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Šulc; Hemiptera: Triozidae). First found in Idaho during 2011, ZC now contributes to increased production costs each season via additional insecticide sprays. To clarify the extent and severity of the threat of ZC in Idaho, we sampled potato psyllids in commercial potato fields across the state over four growing seasons (2012–2015). All life stages of psyllids were sampled using a combination of methods (yellow sticky traps, vacuum samples, and leaf samples), and adult psyllids were tested for the presence of Lso by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Abundance of potato psyllids initially increased gradually over each growing season, then exhibited a sharp late-season rise and a sharp decline as most fields were being harvested. Abundance of psyllids was higher at warmer, lower elevation sites, but infestation onset did not differ between growing regions. Fewer psyllids were collected in vacuum samples than in sticky trap samples. Nymphs and eggs were found only late season and during years with high abundance of adults. Overall incidence of Lso was similar among all years but one. The results presented here clarify our understanding of the seasonal phenology of potato psyllids and Lso in Idaho potato fields and will aid in developing integrated management strategies against this important pest of potato.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBactericera cockerelli 3aCandidatus Liberibacter solanacearum 3aTriozidae 3aadults 3aaltitude 3abacteria 3aeggs 3aemerging diseases 3agrowing season 3ainsecticides 3aleaves 3anymphs 3apests 3aphenology 3apolymerase chain reaction 3apotatoes 3aproduction costs 3asticky traps 3atubers 3azebra chip disease 3aIdaho 0aSolanum tuberosum 0aMonitoring 0aAbundance 0aTomato psyllid1 aCarroll, Amy1 aDahan, Jennifer1 aKarasev, Alexander V.,1 aThornton, Michael1 aMiller, Jeff1 aNolte, Philip1 aOlsen, Nora1 aPrice, William0 tEnvironmental entomology.g2017 Dec. 08, v. 46, no. 6 p.1179-1188dOxford University PresswJournal:jnl3243x1938-29367nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ee/nvx1583Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01473naa a2200289 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004900094040001800143100001900161245009900180300001600279500000900295520050100304592002800805650001100833650001000844650001500854650001600869650001400885700001900899773014800918856009601066852000901162655001201171IND60668465020221119163654.0191125e197211  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066846502DNAL7 a10.2136/sssaj1972.03615995003600060043x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGenrich, D.

This reduces the output of ultrasonic energy from the probe and increases the vibration time required for dispersion of soils by ultrasonic vibration of soil-water suspensions. The effect of pitting can be eliminated by polishing the probe tip with fine emery paper after every 30 min of probe operation. A simple method of checking the performance of probe-type vibrators is described.  aPublisher supplied data 3aenergy 3apaper 3asoil water 3aultrasonics 3avibration1 aBremner, J.

The dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the La Salle River (LR), Lake Winnipegosis (LW) and the Waterhen River (WR) were fractionated into hydrophobic (HPO) and hydrophilic (HPI) parts. ENV isolated less DOM (LR = 46.6 ± 1.5%; LW = 36.2 ± 1.4%; WR = 28.6 ± 2.2%) compared to PPL (LR = 50.2 ± 4.4%; LW = 47.9 ± 2.2%; WR = 37.3 ± 2.8%) and Strata (LR = 46.4% ± 1.0; LW = 51.6 ± 0.3%; WR = 31.9 ± 3.9%). The HPO fraction isolated by each SPE was characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrochemical imaging. The FTIR spectra confirmed the HPO fractions were typical of humic-material and largely resembled fulvic acids; however, the PPL and Strata HPO isolates contained slightly more polysaccharides. The THM formation potential (THMFP) confirmed that the HPO fraction formed more THMs than the HPI. The HPO fraction isolated using ENV was found to have the lowest THMFP of all three SPEs in each waterbody; however, the specific THMFP (μgTHM/mgDOM) results indicated that ENV isolated THM precursors more effectively, as the Strata and PPL isolated a greater amount of non-THM forming material. All three SPE showed significant potential for implementation at water treatment plants as a simple tool to monitor THM precursors in source waters, enabling operators to adapt processes to improve drinking water quality.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aadsorbents 3adissolved organic matter 3adrinking water 3afulvic acids 3ahydrophilicity 3ahydrophobicity 3aimage analysis 3alakes 3apolysaccharides 3arivers 3asolid phase extraction 3astyrene 3asurface water 3awater quality 3awater treatment 3aManitoba 0aDissolved organic matter 0aSolid phase extraction 0aTrihalomethanes 0aHydrophobic 0aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 0aHumic matter1 aWiens, R.1 aGorczyca, B.1 aGough, K.M.0 tChemosphere.g2017 Feb., v. 168 p.917-924dElsevier Ltdx0045-65357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.10.1183Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01881naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245012200168300001600290520072300306592002801029650001401057650002301071650001301094650001901107650001301126650001601139650001001155650001301165650001001178650001301188650001201201650001701213650001701230700002101247700002101268773010401289856008101393852000901474655001201483IND60557993420221122200642.0161104e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055799342DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674160501162doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKhilevsky, V.

Senile plaques (SPs) composed of amyloid-β (Aβ) are typical features of AD. Aβ plays a key role in the disease and has the ability to induce other pathological characteristics of AD, including oxidative stress injury. (m)VD-hemopressin (VD), a peptide derived from mouse brain extracts, can bind cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1R) as an agonist. Our previous report indicated that VD reverses memory impairment induced by Aβ1-42 in mice. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism by which VD protects hippocampal neurons against Aβ1-42-induced impairment. Our results showed that VD inhibited oxidative stress injury induced by Aβ1-42, as demonstrated by the VD-induced reversal of the upregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the intracellular lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) and the downregulation of the activities of the antioxidative enzymes catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) in mouse hippocampal neurons. We also found that VD restored the decrease in cell growth and viability induced by Aβ1-42 and reversed Aβ1-42-induced apoptosis mediated by the apoptosis-associated proteins Bcl-2 and Bax. However, cotreatment with AM251 (an antagonist of CB1R) blocked the effects of VD. In brief, this study suggested that through CB1R, VD reversed the impairment of cell growth and viability, oxidative stress injury and apoptosis induced by Aβ1-42. Therefore, VD may be a promising agent for the treatment of diseases that involve oxidative stress injury and apoptosis induced by Aβ1-42, such as AD.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAlzheimer disease 3aagonists 3aantagonists 3aantioxidant enzymes 3aapoptosis 3abrain 3acannabinoids 3acatalase 3acell growth 3aglutathione peroxidase 3alipid peroxidation 3amalondialdehyde 3amemory disorders 3amice 3aneurodegenerative diseases 3aneurons 3aoxidative stress 3apeptides 3aproteins 3areactive oxygen species 3aviability 0a(m)VD-hemopressin 0aAlzheimer’s disease 0aAβ1-421 aZheng, Yongcai1 aHu, Fengrui1 aMeng, Xin1 aLv, Bosen1 aLao, Kejing1 aGao, Xingchun1 aZhang, Xiaohua1 aGou, Xingchun0 tPeptides.g2020 Feb., v. 124 p.170185-dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11832x0196-97817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2019.1701853Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01866naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001800147245007800165300001600243520074500259592002801004650001601032650001501048650001101063650002501074650002401099650002601123650000901149650001401158650001101172650001501183700001501198700002401213700002701237700001601264773011001280856008101390852000901471655001201480IND60519346920221121145536.0160427e201605  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051934692DNAL7 a10.1007/s00441-015-2338-x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aEstudillo, E.10aGas1 is present in germinal niches of developing dentate gyrus and cortex  ap. 369-384.  aGas1 is a pleiotropic protein that inhibits cell growth when overexpressed in tumors but during development, it acts as a co-receptor for sonic hedgehog to promote the proliferation and survival of various growing organs and systems.

The decline in quality not only occurs on the soil but also on the quality of the surrounding waters. One way to improve the quality of the leachate is by draining it through biofilter plants in the form of purun tikus (Eleocharis dulcis) and bulu babi (Eleocharis retroflaxa) which can absorb or neutralize these elements. The purpose of this research was to know the inoculant influence of iron oxidizing bacteria to leachate quality in acid sulphate soil. The research was conducted on a pot scale in greenhouse. The research was in randomized block design (RBD) of 3-factors with 3 replications. The first factor was inoculants, the second factor was water management, and the third one was phytoremediation material (Eleocharis dulcis and Eleocharis retroflaxa). The results showed that the plant height in the inoculant treatment+wood charcoal was in the range of 89.33−95.33 cm, while that in the inoculant treatment+husk charcoal was in the range of 89.50­­­−93.00 cm. Meanwhile, the yield of rice with bacteria oxidizing iron inoculant+wood charcoal was higher, which was at 6.77 ton.ha-1 than inoculant treatment of oxidizing iron+husk charcoal which was only 5.95 ton.ha-1.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aEleocharis dulcis 3abiofilters 3acharcoal 3agreenhouses 3aleachates 3aphytoremediation 3aplant height 3apyrite 3arice 3asoil 3asulfates 3awater management 0aeleocharis dulcis 0aeleocharis retroflaxa 0apyrite 0athiobacillus ferrooxidans1 aMaas, Azwar1 aUtami, Nuryani Hidayah1 aYusuf, Wahida Annisa0 tIlmu pertanian.g2020 Jan., v. 5, no. 1 p.35-44dUniversitas Gadjah MadawJournal:22161x2527-71627nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22146/ipas.347313Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02812naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001500164245017300179300001800352520083600370592002801206650001001234650001201244650001201256650001301268650002001281650003101301650001001332650001801342650001101360650001201371650000901383650001201392650002401404650003401428650004701462650003001509650003801539650002801577650003801605650003901643650009001682650003301772650006701805650002701872650006901899650002101968700002101989700001602010700001602026700002402042773009902066856004802165852000902213655001202222IND4479152820221122120807.0121003e201109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND447915282DNAL7 a215163152pmid7 a10.1007/s10529-011-0622-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Min10aLhcb2 gene expression analysis in two ecotypes of Sedumalfredii subjected to Zn/Cd treatments with functional analysis of SaLhcb2 isolated from a Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator  ap. 1865-1871.  aThe Lhcb2 gene from hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii was up-regulated more than three-fold while the non-hyperaccumulator accumulated one or two-fold higher amount of the mRNA than control plants under different concentrations of Cd2+ for 24 h.

Flavonols, among flavonoids, are considered as health-protective components in functional foods and they protect plants against certain insect pests. There have been efforts to develop strategies for the enhanced production of flavonols in plants, but limited success was achieved due to complex regulation and poor substrate availability. In the present study, we have developed and optimized method for callus cultures for transgenic tobacco line expressing a flavonol-specific transcription factor, AtMYB12, with an objective to use callus as an alternative source of rutin. Transgenic callus displayed enhanced expression of genes related to biosynthetic pathway leading to increased accumulation of flavonols, especially rutin. At each time point of callus growth, the rutin content of transgenic callus was several folds higher than that of wild-type tobacco callus. Supplementation of semi-synthetic diet with extract from transgenic callus as well as purified rutin led to mortality and growth reduction in the Spodoptera litura and Helicoverpa armigera larvae. This study suggests the biotechnological potential of AtMYB12-expressing callus cultures for the production of rutin, which can be used for biopesticide formulations against insect pests. KEY MESSAGE: Tobacco callus cultures expressing AtMYB12 accumulate enhanced content of rutin and can be used as a potential alternative source of rutin as well as biopesticides against insect pests.  aPublisher supplied data 3aHelicoverpa armigera 3aSpodoptera litura 3abiochemical pathways 3acallus 3acallus culture 3afunctional foods 3agrowth retardation 3ainsect pests 3arutin 3atobacco 3atranscription factors 2aAnimals 2aArabidopsisxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aCell Culture Techniquesxmethods 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plant 2aGenes, Plant 2aGenetic Engineeringxmethods 2aLarvaxdrug effects 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aRutinxbiosynthesisxgeneticsxpharmacology. 2aSpodopteraxdrug effects 2aTobaccoxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTranscription Factorsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aTransformation, Genetic1 aMisra, Prashant1 aChandrashekar, K.1 aTrivedi, Prabodh Kumar0 tPlant cell reports.g2012 Oct., v. 31, no. 10 p.1867-1876dSpringer-Verlagx0721-77147nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00299-012-1300-6  aDNAL 7aarticle02798naa a2200529 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100001700152245011900169300001600288520107800304592002801382650003401410650002401444650004401468650002801512650002601540650002301566650001001589650002301599650002301622650002201645650001201667650001601679650002101695650001901716650004401735650001601779651001001795653002901805653003501834653003401869653003201903700001301935700001501948700001701963700001701980700001301997700001502010773013502025856008702160852000902247655001202256IND60689017520221120201925.0200607e20200801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068901752DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.0242doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCao, Chengxu10aPurification, characterization and antitumor activity of an exopolysaccharide produced by Bacillus velezensis SN-1  ap. 354-361.  aA capsular polysaccharides (CPS) producer Bacillus velezensis SN-1 (B. velezensis SN-1) was isolated in Da-jiang, China. We used ultrasonic extraction to obtain CPS from a culture of B. velezensis SN-1 at a yield of 755 mg/L. Using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), CPS was separated into a single peak with a molecular weight of 1.46 × 10⁵ Da. Its structures were characterized by gas chromatography (GC), methylation, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The CPS was identified as a polysaccharide with a highly branched main chain of mannose with (1 → 3) connections. Moreover, our results revealed that CPS has the capacity to scavenge DPPH radical, hydroxyl radical, ABTS radical and oxygen radical in a manner that relied on concentration. Anti-neoplastic analysis showed that CPS displayed significant anti-tumor activity towards HepG-2 tumor cells. Above findings indicate that CPS generated by B. velezensis SN-1 may be adapted for use as a natural antioxidant in foodstuffs and as an anti-tumor drug.  aPublisher supplied data 3a2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl 3aBacillus velezensis 3aFourier transform infrared spectroscopy 3aantineoplastic activity 3aantineoplastic agents 3aexopolysaccharides 3afoods 3agas chromatography 3agel chromatography 3ahydroxyl radicals 3amannose 3amethylation 3amolecular weight 3aneoplasm cells 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aultrasonics 3aChina 0aBacillus velezensis SN-1 0aCapsular polysaccharides (CPS) 0aAntioxidant activity in vitro 0aAntitumor activity in vitro1 aLi, Yang1 aWang, Cong1 aZhang, Naiqi1 aZhu, Xinyuan1 aWu, Rina1 aWu, Junrui0 tInternational journal of biological macromolecules.g2020 Aug. 01, v. 156 p.354-361dElsevier B.V.wJournal:12340x0141-81307nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2020.04.0243Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002900152245008500181520108800266592002801354650001801382650001901400650001601419650001101435650001401446650002401460650001401484650002401498650001301522650001101535653002201546653001801568653002001586700007001606700002101676700002701697700003001724773010001754856008701854852000901941655001201950IND60684981520221118163349.0200318e20200715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068498152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1264992doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDuque-Estrada, Patrícia10aOxidative stability of soy proteins: From ground soybeans to structured products  aThe production of soy protein-based foods requires multiple-step, intensive processing and storage of soy ingredients, which can increase the product’s susceptibility to oxidation. Therefore, we investigated the oxidative stability of soy protein-based products subjected to different relevant conditions or treatments: over storage of soy flours, over fractionation to yield soy protein isolate (SPI), and over subsequent thermomechanical processing to yield a model structured product. Soy flours were stable to lipid and protein oxidation over 250 days storage in chilled or ambient conditions. The fractionation process applied to make SPI did not increase substantially protein carbonylation, but increased surface-exposed hydrophobicity and decreased free thiols, compared to the starting defatted flour. Subsequent processing of hydrated SPI powder at 140 °C further increased protein carbonylation to a high extent. Therefore, we conclude that soy flours can be stable over long storage times, but processing to yield structured foods products promote protein oxidation.  aPublisher supplied data 3afractionation 3ahydrophobicity 3aingredients 3alipids 3aoxidation 3aoxidative stability 3asoy flour 3asoy protein isolate 3asoybeans 3athiols 0aProtein oxidation 0aCarbonylation 0aLipid oxidation1 aKyriakopoulou, Konstantina1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8460-13371 ade Groot, Wouter1 avan der Goot, Atze Jan1 aBerton-Carabin, Claire C.0 tFood chemistry.g2020 July 15, v. 318 p.126499-dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl8139x0308-81467nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.1264993Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02258naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002700094040001800121100003100139245006500170300001800235520123700253592002801490650002901518650001801547650001401565650002201579650001701601650001101618650002301629700001501652700002001667700001501687773013401702856007501836852000901911655001201920IND60537660320180405000000.0160809e20140319xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6053766032DNAL7 a10.1021/ie402052v2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGonzález-Martínez, J. M.10aEffect of Synchronization on Bilinear Batch Process Modeling  ap. 4339-4351.  aThere is a widespread assumption that batch synchronization is only required if the batch trajectories have different duration. This paper is devoted to demonstrate that synchronization is a critical and necessary preliminary step to bilinear batch process modeling, no matter whether batch trajectories have equal length or not. Another practical assumption is that all batches need the same synchronization method to be aligned. Two different synchronization approaches are compared in terms of synchronization quality: the Multisynchro approach that takes into account the type of asynchronism and the method based on linearly expanding and/or compressing pieces of variables trajectories (the TLEC method), implemented in commercial software. The consequences of inappropriately synchronizing batch data with multiple asynchronisms in process monitoring are investigated. For this study, the observationwise unfolding-T scores batchwise unfolding (OWU-TBWU) approach, which integrates the TLEC method for batch synchronization, is used for process modeling. Data from realistic simulations of a fermentation process of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultivation with five different types of asynchronism are used for illustration.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3abatch systems 3achemistry 3acomputer software 3afermentation 3amodels 3aprocess monitoring1 aVitale, R.1 ade Noord, O.

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the comprehensive therapy based on the three common TCM patterns in stable COPD patients. METHODS: A four-center, open-label randomized controlled method was conducted. A total of 352 patients were divided into the trial group (n = 176, treated with conventional Western medicine and Bu-Fei Jian-Pi granules, Bu-Fei Yi-Shen granules, and Yi-Qi Zi-Shen granules based on the TCM patterns respectively) and the control group (n = 176, treated with conventional Western medicine). The frequency and duration of acute exacerbation, lung function, clinical symptoms, 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), dyspnea scale and quality of life were observed during a 6-month treatment period and at a further 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 306 patients completed the study fully. The full analysis set (FAS) population was 350 and the per-protocol analysis set (PPS) population was 306. After the 6-month treatment and 12-month follow-up, there were significant differences between the trial and control group in the following: frequency of acute exacerbation (FAS: P = 0.000; PPS: P = 0.000); duration of acute exacerbation (FAS: P = 0.000; PPS: P = 0.001); FEV1 (FAS: P = 0.007; PPS: P = 0.008); symptoms (FAS: P = 0.001; PPS: P = 0.001); 6MWD (FAS: P = 0.045; PPS: P = 0.042); dyspnea scale (FAS: P = 0.002; PPS: P = 0.004); and physical domain (FAS: P = 0.000; PPS: P = 0.000), psychological domain (FAS: P = 0.008; PPS: P = 0.011), social domain (FAS: P = 0.001; PPS: P = 0.000) and environment domain (FAS: P = 0.015; PPS: P = 0.009) of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. There were no differences between the trial and control group in FVC, FEV1% and adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the TCM patterns, Bu-Fei Jian-Pi granules, Bu-Fei Yi-Shen granules and Yi-Qi Zi-Shen granules have beneficial effects on measured outcomes in stable COPD patients over the 6-month treatment and 12-month follow-up, with no relevant between-group differences in adverse events. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Register Center, ChiCTR-TRC-11001406.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aOriental traditional medicine 3aalternative medicine 3aclinical trials 3adyspnea 3agranules 3alung function 3apatients 3aquality of life 3aquestionnaires 3awalking1 aLi, Jian-sheng1 aWang, Ming-hang1 aXie, Yang1 aYu, Xue-qing1 aSun, Zi-kai1 aMa, Li-jun1 aZhang, Wei1 aZhang, Hai-long1 aCao, Fan1 aPan, Ying-chao0 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2012 Dec., v. 12, no. 1 p.197-197dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1472-6882-12-1973Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02704naa a2200397 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100001700148245014200165300001500307520148900322592002801811650000801839650002201847650001501869650002001884650002601904650001701930650002101947653001801968653001701986653001602003653001202019700002002031700001302051700001302064700001802077700001302095773009502108856008202203852000902285655001202294IND60553405320221119203452.0161021e20150115xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055340532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.0232doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiu, Shufeng10aHighly sensitive fluorescence detection of target DNA by coupling exonuclease-assisted cascade target recycling and DNAzyme amplification  ap. 99-104.  aBecause of the intrinsic importance of nucleic acid as bio-targets, the simple and sensitive detection of nucleic acid is very essential for biological studies and medical diagnostics. Herein, a simple, isothermal and highly sensitive fluorescence detection of target DNA was developed with the combination of exonuclease III (Exo III)-assisted cascade target recycling and DNAzyme amplification. A hairpin DNA probe was designed, which contained the 3′-protruding DNA fragment as target recognition unit, the caged DNA fragment in the stem region as target analogue, and the caged 8–17 DNAzyme sequence in the loop region as signal response unit. Upon sensing of target DNA, the 3′-strand of hairpin DNA probe could be stepwise removed by Exo III, accompanied by the releasing of target DNA and autonomous generation of new target analogues for the successive hybridization and cleavage process. Simultaneously, the 8–17 DNAzyme unit could be exponentially released from this hairpin DNA probe and activated for the cyclic cleavage toward the ribonucleotide-containing molecular beacon substrate, inducing a remarkable fluorescence signal amplification for target detection. A low detection limit of 20fM with an excellent selectivity toward target DNA could be achieved. The developed cascade amplification strategy may be further extended for the detection of a wide spectrum of analytes including protein and biological small molecules by combining DNA aptamer technology.  aPublisher supplied data 3aDNA 3aDNA fragmentation 3abiosensors 3adetection limit 3adiagnostic techniques 3afluorescence 3aoligonucleotides 0aDNA biosensor 0aFluorescence 0aExonuclease 0aDNAzyme1 aCheng, Chuanbin1 aLiu, Tao1 aWang, Li1 aGong, Hongwei1 aLi, Feng0 tBiosensors & bioelectronics.g2015 Jan. 15, v. 63 p.99-104dElsevier B.V.x0956-56637nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2014.07.0233Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03051naa a2200409 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003200094040001800126100002400144245009700168300001600265506002800281520173600309592002802045506003702073650001202110650001402122650002102136650002202157650002202179650001302201651000902214653001302223653002202236653003502258653001602293700002002309700002802329700001902357700002402376773014102400856007902541852000902620655001202629IND60775041420221207082849.0200625e201809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6077504142DNAL7 a10.22103/jab.2018.21542doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorineghad, Mahdieh10aAssessment of genetic diversity among some Kabuli type chickpea genotypes using ISSR markers  ap. 109-128.  aResource is Open Access  aChickpea is the most important pulse crop in Iran. Since Iran is a part of the diversification center of chickpea, study of its genetic diversity is considerable. In order to assessment of genetic diversity of Kabuli chickpea genotypes, 81 Kabuli chickpea genotypes originated from ICARDA, Turkey and Iran were sown in the research field of Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman in 2014-2015 growing season. Nine ISSR primer was used to detect molecular polymorphisms among the genotypes and 79 polymorphic bands yielded from mentioned premiers. Number of effective allele varied from 1.19 (primer (CAC)<sub>5</sub>AG) to 1.69 (primer (ACTG)<sub>4</sub>). Means of Nei’s genetic diversity and Shannon’s index for all studied genotypes were 0.24 and 0.38 respectively. Nei’s genetic diversity for ICARDA, Turkey and Iran originated populations were 0.27, 0.2 and 0.2, respectively. Shannon’s index was calculated for each population as well, which were 0.44, 0.32 and 0.3, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance determined significant difference between the populations. However, only 10% of total variance accounted between populations. The result of cluster analysis divided the genotypes to four separated groups that was different from the primary regional grouping. Cluster analysis generally confirm that most of genetic variation found within the studied population as well. The population analysis using STRUCTURE software separated the population into four groups with 14, 5, 8 and 4 genotypes respectively. The rest of genotypes (51) were identified as mixed genotypes. The results of this study determined a wide genetic diversity between studied chickpea genotypes could be used for future breeding programs.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aalleles 3achickpeas 3acluster analysis 3acomputer software 3agenetic variation 3avariance 3aIran 0achickpea 0agenetic variation 0aanalysis of molecular variance 0aissr marker1 aMohayegi, Mahdi1 aAbdolshahi, Rooholallah1 aKazmipour, Ali1 aZadeh, Dvood Sadegh0 tBiyutiknuluzhī-i kishāvarzī.g2018 Sept., v. 10, no. 2 p.109-128dShahid Bahonar University of KermanwJournal:27822x2228-65007nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.22103/jab.2018.21543Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02339naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100005600150245016400206300001800370500001900388520133500407592002801742650002301770650001301793650001601806700002601822773012001848856008401968852000902052655001202061IND60701723120221122225954.0200714e20200620xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070172312DNAL7 a10.1021/acs.macromol.0c008492doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aXie, Shi-Jie1https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3317-472010aMicroscopic Theory of Dynamically Heterogeneous Activated Relaxation as the Origin of Decoupling of Segmental and Chain Relaxation in Supercooled Polymer Melts  ap. 5350-5360.  aNAL-AP-2-clean  aWe combine our force-based theory of activated segmental relaxation for glass-forming polymer melts, with our new formulation of how nm-scale effectively static structural fluctuations induce dynamic heterogeneity in molecular liquids, to address the problem of decoupling of the temperature dependence of the segmental and chain relaxation times in supercooled polymer melts. The consequences of two extreme assumptions about how fluctuations of the segmental relaxation time affect chain scale relaxation, and also the influence of quantitative differences of the length scale of structurally heterogeneous domains, are studied. Though these two factors modify our precise quantitative results, they do not change the basic predictions. The highly polymer-specific degree of decoupling is predicted to correlate with the amplitude of collective elastic barrier fluctuations and segmental dynamic fragility. An apparent fractional power law form of the decoupling of the temperature dependence of the segmental and chain relaxation times in the deeply supercooled regime is predicted. The theoretical results appear to be consistent with experimental observations, including both the strong polymer chemistry dependence of the decoupling exponent and the relative insensitivity of chain-scale fragility to the chemical structure.  aPublisher supplied data 3achemical structure 3apolymers 3atemperature1 aSchweizer, Kenneth S.0 tMacromolecules.g2020 June 20, v. 53, no. 13 p.5350-5360dAmerican Chemical SocietywJournal:23616x1520-58357nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.0c008493Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01766naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002500147245015600172300001600328520037500344592002800719650001500747650001700762650001300779650002700792650001500819650001100834650001500845650001600860650001500876650001900891650001500910651001100925700002100936700002500957700002100982700002201003700001701025700002401042700002001066700002801086773010401114856008101218852000901299655001201308IND60557993720221122222915.0161104e201609  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6055799372DNAL7 a10.3103/S10683674160502202doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShamsutdinov, Z.

The disposable nature of the screen printed electrodes makes them attractive for the on-site analysis of Cr(iii) in environmental and biological samples.  aPublisher supplied data 3aanalytical methods 3achromium 3adetection limit 3aelectrodes 3aindustrial wastewater 3aions 3ananocomposites 3ananogold1 aChandra Sekar, Nadia1 aTan, Swee Ngin1 aXie, Hong1 aNg, Sum Huan0 tAnalytical methods.g2016 Jan. 28, v. 8, no. 5 p.962-967dThe Royal Society of ChemistrywJournal:26912x1759-96797nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5ay03291a3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02853naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024004000094040001800134100002800152245006800180300001400248520145200262592002801714650001101742650001901753650002201772650002701794650002301821650002501844650002101869650001501890650001101905650002101916650001501937650001201952650003601964650000902000650001802009650002102027650002302048650001302071651000902084700002202093700002202115700002302137700002002160773008402180856008602264852000902350655001202359IND60086340420221116141219.0141101e201210  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6008634042DNAL7 a10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.08.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLiebenow, Danielle King10aDo ecosystem services influence household wealth in rural Mali?  ap. 33-44.  aThe impact of ecosystem services on human livelihood is rarely demonstrated. We investigated whether ecosystem services influence household wealth in semi-arid rural Mali, where climate variability and soil degradation were expected to regulate subsistence production. Mean rainfall, mean rain use efficiency, and rain use efficiency trends (a land degradation proxy) over the last 25years were used to quantify ecosystem services. Asset wealth was measured in 2527 households from 65 villages spanning the range in ecosystem services. We evaluated effects on wealth, controlling for household size and demographics, ethnicity, village size, crop selection, and distance to open water and markets. While wealth variation was dominated by demographics, significant associations with ecosystem services were observed. Predicted household wealth increased significantly (20%) with rainfall. Effects of rain use efficiency mean and trends were also significant, but only when conditioned on rainfall. With lower rainfall, wealth increased with mean rain use efficiency (+33%) but decreased with rain use efficiency trend (−22%). With higher rainfall, however, wealth decreased with rain use efficiency (−57%) and increased markedly with rain use efficiency trend (+185%). While ecosystem services are clearly important, their effect on rural poverty is complex and potentially obscured by coping strategies that mitigate environmental limitations.  aPublisher supplied data 3aassets 3aclimate change 3acoping strategies 3ademographic statistics 3aecosystem services 3aenvironmental impact 3ahousehold income 3ahouseholds 3ahumans 3aland degradation 3alivelihood 3amarkets 3anationalities and ethnic groups 3arain 3arural poverty 3asoil degradation 3asoil heterogeneity 3avillages 3aMali1 aCohen, Matthew J.1 aGumbricht, Thomas1 aShepherd, Keith D.1 aShepherd, Gemma0 tEcological economics.g2012 Oct., v. 82 p.33-44dElsevier B.V.x0921-80097nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2012.08.0053Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02891naa a2200373 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003600094040001800130100006200148245011100210300001600321500001100337520167000348592002802018650001202046650001802058650001702076650002002093650002802113650001802141650001402159650003202173650002402205650001402229650001902243650001402262700001902276773011802295856008302413852000902496655001202505IND60792828820221118041951.0220909e202209  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6079282882DNAL7 a10.1007/s12639-021-01457-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHassan, Noha M.

Synthetic chemotherapeutics have been utilized throughout years, as a means of combating helminthiasis. Anthelmintic resistance (AR) has a serious concern on livestock industry which, mainly arises as outcome of misuse, improper dosing and frequent utilization of the synthetic drugs.Various gastrointestinal helminths have the capability to survive the therapeutic dose of anthelmintics and become resistant to the major anthelmintic classes. Early diagnosis might delay or reduce the risk of AR. Conventional phenotyping methods were commonly used for detection of anthelmintic resistant helminths, but appeared to lack of sensitivity, especially when the frequency of resistant allele is very low. Several molecular assays were carried out to detect the AR with greater accuracy. Sustainable effective preventive and control measures for gastrointestinal helminths infection remain the corner stone to overcome AR. Rational use of anthelmintics with keeping unexposed proportion of worm populations, could have the potentiality to maintain and prolong the efficacy of anthelmintics. Several alternative anthelmintic treatments might offer valuable solutions either alone or adjunct to synthetic drugs to dilute the spread of resistance alleles among the helminths population. This article reviews current status of various diagnostic methods and control measures for anthelmintic resistant gastrointestinal helminths infecting ruminants and tries to present a practical protocol to avoid or delay the development of AR.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalleles 3aanthelmintics 3adrug therapy 3aearly diagnosis 3agastrointestinal system 3ahelminthiasis 3ahelminths 3alivestock and meat industry 3alivestock husbandry 3aphenotype 3arisk reduction 3aruminants1 aGhazy, Alaa A.0 tJournal of parasitic diseases.g2022 Sept., v. 46, no. 3 p.901-915dSpringer IndiawJournal:6190x0971-71967nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12639-021-01457-z3Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02741naa a2200433 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100001700151245013300168300001600301520139400317592002801711650002501739650002701764650002901791650002301820650001401843650001601857650002101873650001501894650001501909650001101924650001301935650001401948650001301962653001301975653001401988653001502002653002902017700002002046700002102066773011302087856008602200852000902286655001202295IND50069657820221118005919.0190408e201310  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5006965782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.07.0192doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aParsa, Mehdi10aEffect of the recommended and optimized doses of haloxyfop-P-methyl or imazethapyr on soybean-Bradyrhizobium japonicum symbiosis  ap. 197-202.  aUnder natural conditions, an experiment was carried out to investigate the impact of the recommended and optimized doses of two herbicides on the biological properties of five soybean cultivars inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum, grown in pots. The required dose of haloxyfop-P-methyl or imazethapyr with adjuvant Adigor® in which 95% control of johnsongrass and velvetleaf was obtained (30.42 and 50.69g active ingredient ha−1, respectively) were chosen as the optimized doses to compare with their recommended doses (100 and 108g active ingredient ha−1, respectively). In general, toxicity of the recommended doses was higher than the optimized doses. In most biological properties of five soybean cultivars, haloxyfop-P-methyl was more toxic than imazethapyr, e.g. shoot dry weight, root nitrogen content, and shoot phosphorus content. But, the intensity of these effects depended on type and concentration of herbicides, and soybean cultivars. In instance, at recommended dose of haloxyfop-P-methyl or imazethapyr as compared with control, the nodule number was reduced up to 71%, 97%, 36%, and 83% in Williams, Sari, Bt Tellar and Inter Price varieties for the former while those were reduced up to 54%, 89%, 70%, and 93% for the latter, respectively. Clark variety was unaffected in this respect. Moreover, nodulation was unaffected with the optimized doses of herbicides.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAbutilon theophrasti 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3aBradyrhizobium japonicum 3aactive ingredients 3acultivars 3aimazethapyr 3anitrogen content 3anodulation 3aphosphorus 3ashoots 3asoybeans 3asymbiosis 3atoxicity 0aAdjuvant 0aHerbicide 0aNodulation 0aBradyrhizobium japonicum1 aAliverdi, Akbar1 aHammami, Hossein0 tIndustrial crops and products.g2013 Oct., v. 50 p.197-202dElsevier B.V.wJournal:jnl49222x0926-66907nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2013.07.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03844naa a2200601 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024002200113024003500135040001800170100002000188245009500208300001200303506007600315520183200391592002802223596005902251596008102310506003702391650002102428650002502449650001802474650001502492650001302507650002602520650003802546650003502584650002002619650002102639650001602660650001702676650002102693650001802714650001102732650001402743650001302757650004302770650000902813650001302822650000902835650002002844650003202864700001702896700001702913700001702930700006102947773013103008856008203139852000903221655001203230IND60579794520221207113629.0210514e201712  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6057979452DNAL7 a288549712pmid7 aPMC55778042pmcid7 a10.1186/s12906-017-1938-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aChang, Xiongfei10aSini-san improves duodenal tight junction integrity in a rat model of functional dyspepsia  ap. 432.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBACKGROUND: Recent reports have demonstrated that impaired barrier function and local microinflammation in the duodenal mucosa contribute to the pathogeneses of functional dyspepsia (FD). Thus, restoring normal barrier integrity becomes a potential therapeutic strategy in the treatment of FD. Sini-San (SNS) is a traditional Chinese prescription that exhibits therapeutic effects in FD, but the underlying mechanisms remain not well understood. METHODS: FD rats were established by tail clamping method and the therapeutic effect of SNS was evaluated by measuring the visceral sensitivity and gastric compliance. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) that reveals epithelial barrier integrity was measured by Ussing chamber. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins, occludin and claudin-1, in the duodenum was determined by Western blot and immunofluorescence. The amount of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interferon gamma (INF-γ) in duodenal mucosa was detected by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA level of transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) was measured by quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). RESULTS: SNS could improve gastric compliance and attenuate visceral hypersensitivity (VH) in FD rats. TEER was decreased in FD rats, but treatment with SNS restored normal level of TEER and the expression of occludin and claudin-1 in FD rats. In addition, SNS administration ameliorated FD-associated increase in the production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and the expression of TRPV1. CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of SNS on FD is at least partially through improvement of TJ integrity and attenuation of FD-associated low-grade inflammation in the duodenum. Our findings highlight the molecular basis of SNS-based treatment of FD in human patients.  aPublisher supplied data  a81503514cNational Natural Science Foundation of China  aQML20161002cBeijing Municipal Administration of Hospitals’Youth Programme0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aWestern blotting 3aalternative medicine 3aanimal models 3acompliance 3aduodenum 3aelectrical resistance 3aenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3afluorescent antibody technique 3agene expression 3ahypersensitivity 3aindigestion 3ainflammation 3ainterferon-gamma 3amessenger RNA 3amucosa 3aoccludins 3apatients 3aquantitative polymerase chain reaction 3arats 3asorbents 3atail 3atight junctions 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha1 aZhao, Luqing1 aWang, Jiajia1 aLu, Xiaofang1 aZhang, Shengsheng1https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5932-46490 tBMC complementary and alternative medicine.g2017 Dec., v. 17, no. 1 p.432-432dBioMed CentralwJournal:21388x1472-68827nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-017-1938-23Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04404naa a2200709 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072000900167072000900176100002500185245012800210300001800338500002400356520217300380650002402553650002302577650002302600650002202623650002702645650002102672650002602693650002102719650001702740650001602757650001502773650003102788650001902819650001202838650004602850650003802896650004702934650004602981650002803027650001703055650001003072650006803082651003103150651001003181651001303191651001803204653001403222653001503236700001603251700001803267700001803285700001403303700001903317700001803336700001703354700001803371773012503389852000903514856008803523930003303611945002503644946001303669655001203682IND4414075820221118041911.0081224e200812  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441407582DNAL7 a191334792pmid7 a10.1603/0022-0493-101.6.19502doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF821 0aF2001 aSiebert, M.

The intrinsic activity of Phytogen 440W was compared with nontreated non-Bt cotton (PSC355) and with management strategies in which supplemental insecticides targeting heliothines were applied to Phytogen 440W and to PSC355 cotton. Infestations were composed primarily of bollworm, which is the least sensitive of the heliothine complex to Cry toxins. Therefore, damage recorded in these studies was primarily due to bollworm. Greater than 75% of all test sites sustained heliothine infestations categorized as moderate to high (10.6-64.0% peak damaged bolls in nontreated PSC355). Phytogen 440W, alone or managed with supplemental insecticide applications, reduced heliothine-damaged plant terminals, squares (flower buds), flowers, and bolls equal to or better (1.0-79.0-fold) than managing a non-Bt cotton variety with foliar insecticides across all infestation environments. Rarely (frequency of <or= 11% averaged across structures), sprayed Phytogen 440W reduced damaged structures compared with nontreated Phytogen 440W. Protection against heliothine-induced plant damage was similar across the three levels of infestation for each viable management strategy, with exception to damaged squares for nontreated Phytogen 440W. In situations of moderate to high heliothine infestations, cotton plants expressing Cry1Ac and Cry1F may sustain higher levels of damage compared with that same variety in low infestations. No significant difference in yield was observed among heliothine management strategies within each infestation level, indicating cotton plants may compensate for those levels of plant damage. These findings indicate Phytogen 440W containing Cry1Ac and Cry1F provided consistent control of heliothines across a range of environments and infestation levels. 3aHeliothis virescens 3aGossypium hirsutum 3apopulation density 3atransgenic plants 3aBacillus thuringiensis 3acrystal proteins 3ainsecticidal proteins 3adelta-endotoxins 3ainsecticides 3acrop damage 3acrop yield 3aintegrated pest management 3ainsect control 2aAnimals 2aBacterial Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aEndotoxinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aGossypiumxgeneticsxgrowth & development. 2aHemolysin Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aInsect Controlxmethods 2aInsecticides 2aMoths 2aPlants, Genetically Modifiedxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 3aSoutheastern United States 3aTexas 3aMissouri 0aUnited States 0aBt cotton 0aCry toxins1 aNolting, S.1 aLeonard, B.R.1 aBraxton, L.B.1 aAll, J.N.1 aVan Duyn, J.W.1 aBradley, J.R.1 aBacheler, J.1 aHuckaba, R.M.0 tJournal of economic entomology.g2008 Dec., v. 101, no. 6 p.1950-1959dEntomological Society of Americax0022-04937nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493-101.6.19503Available from publisher's Web site  a20090106b20090206c00000000  aINDdNZMe2009/01/02  aOther US 7aarticle03062naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100001700166245010200183300001800285520158300303592002801886650001401914650000901928650001801937650002801955650001801983650001802001650001602019650001702035650002302052650001002075650002302085650002002108650002002128650001102148651001002159653001302169653000902182653002002191653001802211653001802229653001802247700001802265700002202283700002002305773012802325856008202453852000902535655001202544IND60517440620221119134717.0190803e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051744062DNAL7 a235525032pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800130006452doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuew, Rasmia10aNutrient intake and dietary patterns of relevance to dental health of 12-year-old Libyan children  ap. 1107-1113.  aThere are few data on the dietary intake of children in Libya, and none on free sugars intake. The present study aimed to report the intake of macronutrients and eating habits of relevance to dental health in a group of Libyan schoolchildren and to investigate any gender differences for these variables. Dietary information was obtained from a randomly selected sample using an estimated 3 d food diary. Dietary data were coded using food composition tables and entered into a Microsoft® Access database. Intakes of energy, macronutrients, sugars and the amount of acidic items consumed were determined using purpose-written programs. Benghazi, Libya. Schoolchildren aged 12 years. One hundred and eighty children (ninety-two boys and eighty-eight girls) completed the study. Their mean age was 12·3 (sd 0·29) years. The average daily energy intake was 7·01 (sd 1·54) MJ/d. The percentage contributions to energy intake from protein, fat and carbohydrate were 16 %, 30 % and 54 %, respectively. Total sugars contributed 20·4 % of the daily energy intake, and free sugars 12·6 %. The median daily intake of acidic items was 203 g/d, and of acidic drinks was 146 g/d. There were no statistically significant differences in nutrient intakes between genders. Intake of acidic items was higher in girls (P < 0·001). The contribution to energy intake from macronutrients was in accordance with global nutrition guidelines. The acidic drinks intake was low compared with other populations, while free sugars intake was above the recommended threshold of 10 % of energy intake.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3aboys 3adental health 3adietary recommendations 3aeating habits 3aenergy intake 3afood intake 3afood records 3agender differences 3agirls 3anutrient databanks 3anutrient intake 3aschool children 3asugars 3aLibya 0aChildren 0aDiet 0aNutrient intake 0aDental health 0aSugars intake 0aDietary acids1 aMaguire, Anne1 aWaterhouse, Paula1 aMoynihan, Paula0 tPublic health nutrition.g2014 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.1107-1113dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800130006453Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02554naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002100147245013700168300001600305520113900321592002801460650002001488650001101508650000901519650001601528650000901544650001301553650001601566650001801582650001401600650001001614650002001624650001101644650001101655650001601666650001001682650001401692651001001706653002001716653002601736653001801762653002101780700002501801700001901826773012401845856008201969852000902051655001202060IND60120190820221118063225.0200513e20150201xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012019082DNAL7 a10.1007/s10310-014-0451-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanazashi, Ayako10aSeed dormancy and germination characteristics in relation to the regeneration of Acer pycnanthum, a vulnerable tree species in Japan  ap. 160-166.  aSeed dormancy and germination characteristics of the vulnerable tree species Acer pycnanthum were investigated to understand its regeneration strategy. Seeds of A. pycnanthum mature 1 month after pollination and are dispersed in late spring. All dispersed seeds were in dormancy upon collection from which they were released by cold (5 °C) stratification over a period of at least 12 weeks. Germination percentages were higher under low temperature conditions (10–20 °C) and when the temperature was alternated in diurnal cycles. Light effects on germination were not observed. Seed viability was not lost even though seeds had experienced room temperature conditions (20–30 °C, 35–70 % humidity) after dispersal for 5–10 months. Seeds of A. pycnanthum can endure summer heat and survive until the following spring, allowing their seedlings to germinate promptly. In the case of light intensity-independent dormancy release, regeneration can occur under canopy conditions where shade-intolerant seedlings are at a disadvantage. To verify this conclusion, the shade tolerance of A. pycnanthum requires further investigation.  aPublisher supplied data 3aAcer pycnanthum 3acanopy 3acold 3agermination 3aheat 3ahumidity 3apollination 3aseed dormancy 3aseedlings 3aseeds 3ashade tolerance 3aspring 3asummer 3atemperature 3atrees 3aviability 3aJapan 0aAcer pycnanthum 0aRegeneration strategy 0aSeed dormancy 0aSeed germination1 aNagamitsu, Teruyoshi1 aSuzuki, Wajiro0 tJournal of forest research.g2015 Feb. 1, v. 20, no. 1 p.160-166dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl3870061x1610-74037nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-014-0451-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03269naa a2200613 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100002200151245009500173300001800268520133900286536010701625592002801732596007201760650002201832650002001854650002001874650001701894650002001911650001001931650002001941650001501961650002301976650002601999650002202025650000902047650001402056650002102070650001202091650001002103650001602113650001002129651001002139653001402149653001302163700002202176700001902198700002202217700001702239700002402256700002402280700002202304700002302326700002202349700002202371700002802393773012802421856008502549852000902634655001202643IND60660333120221118043622.0190823e20190902xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6066033312DNAL7 a10.1080/19440049.2019.16283592doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshinari, Tomoya10aDetermination of sterigmatocystin in foods in Japan: method validation and occurrence data  ap. 1404-1410.  aA survey of the contamination of foods by sterigmatocystin (STC) was performed by an analytical method based on LC-MS/MS. STC was extracted from samples with acetonitrile/water (85/15, v/v) and then purified with immunoaffinity columns. The method was validated by a small-scale inter-laboratory study using spiked wheat samples. Mean recoveries of STC were 100.3% and 92.5% from two samples spiked at 0.5 and 5.0 µg/kg, respectively. A total of 583 samples were analysed between 2016 and 2018, and STC was detected in 19.9% of all samples at >0.05 μg/kg (limit of quantification). The foods that were contaminated by STC were wheat flour, Job’s tears products, rye flour, rice, buckwheat flour, white sorghum, barley products, azuki bean and corn flour. STC was not found in beer or wine. The occurrence of STC in domestic wheat flour (44.4%), Job’s tears products (41.7%) and rye flour (29.9%) accounted for the three highest values. The highest mean concentrations were obtained for Job’s tears products (0.3 μg/kg) and rye flour (0.3 μg/kg). The maximum contamination level was present in a sample of rye flour (7.1 μg/kg). Although the contamination levels were low, these results indicate that STC frequently contaminates Japanese retail foods. A continuous survey is required to assess exposure to STC in Japan.  aThis study was supported by a research grant from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan.  aPublisher supplied data  aH28-Food-Ippan-004cMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan 3aCoix lacryma-jobi 3aSorghum bicolor 3aVigna angularis 3aacetonitrile 3abarley products 3abeers 3abuckwheat flour 3acorn flour 3afood contamination 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3arice 3arye flour 3asterigmatocystin 3asurveys 3awheat 3awheat flour 3awines 3aJapan 0aMycotoxin 0aLC-MS/MS1 aTakeuchi, Hiroshi1 aKosugi, Masaki1 aTaniguchi, Masaru1 aWaki, Masumi1 aHashiguchi, Shigeki1 aFujiyoshi, Tomoharu1 aShichinohe, Yaeko1 aNakajima, Masahiro1 aOhnishi, Takahiro1 aHara-Kudo, Yukiko1 aSugita-Konishi, Yoshiko0 tFood additives & contaminants.g2019 Sept. 2, v. 36, no. 9 p.1404-1410dTaylor & FranciswJournal:jnl35737x1944-00577nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19440049.2019.16283593Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02220naa a2200301 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024002900094040001800123100002500141245006400166520129000230592002801520650001001548650001301558650001101571650001001582651001201592651001601604700002001620700004001640700002201680773012001702856007501822852000901897655001201906IND60742466220221120115733.0210624e20210616xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074246622DNAL7 a10.3390/ani110618012doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 avan Liere, Diederik 10aConflicts with Wolves Can Originate from Their Parent Packs  aTransmission of experience about prey and habitat supports the survival of next generation of wolves. Thus, the parent pack (PP) can affect whether young migrating wolves (loners) kill farm animals or choose to be in human environments, which generates human–wolf conflicts. Therefore, we researched whether the behavior of loners resembles PP behavior. After being extinct, 22 loners had entered the Netherlands between 2015 and 2019. Among them, 14 could be DNA-identified and linked with their PPs in Germany. Some loners were siblings. We assessed the behavior of each individual and PP through a structured Google search. PP behavior was determined for the loner’s rearing period. Similarity between loner and PP behavior was significant (p = 0.022) and applied to 10 of 14 cases: like their PPs, three loners killed sheep and were near humans, five killed sheep and did not approach humans, while two loners were unproblematic, they did not kill sheep, nor were they near humans. Siblings behaved similarly. Thus, sheep killing and proximity to humans may develop during early-life experiences in the PP. However, by negative reinforcement that can be prevented. New methods are suggested to achieve that. As a result, new generations may not be problematic when leaving PPs.  aPublisher supplied data 3afarms 3ahabitats 3ahumans 3asheep 3aGermany 3aNetherlands1 aSiard, Nataša 1 aMartens, Willem Jozef Meine,d1968-1 aJordan, Dušanka 0 tAnimals.g2021 June 16, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110618013Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02176naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100002300147245010400170300001800274520104000292592002801332650002301360650002001383650001901403650001901422650002801441650001701469650001901486650000901505650001701514650001401531650001301545700002601558700002901584773009901613856008101712852000901793655001201802IND60121345820221117155757.0150225e201503  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012134582DNAL7 a10.1007/s00436-015-4315-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallardo, Anabella10aLethal activity of individual and mixed monoterpenoids of geranium essential Oil on Musca domestica  ap. 1229-1232.  aPlant essential oils and its constituent molecules have been suggested as an alternative to control insect. The contribution of the constituents to the effect of the oil is determined by the interactions occurring between them. Synergistic interactions would improve the insecticide efficacy of the compounds due to the utilization of lower doses. We evaluated the insecticidal activity of geranium (Geranium maculatum L.) oil and its major constituents against Musca domestica L. and studied the toxic interactions in artificial mixtures of those constituents in the natural ratio. While synergistic interactions were determined in house fly in this study, these were of low intensity evidencing that the effect of each constituent was slightly modified by the other constituents present in the mixtures. The search for synergism between components is a strategy to improve the insecticide activity of natural compounds. The synergism helps to reduce the environmental and toxicological impact due to the reduction of the dose of use.  aPublisher supplied data 3aGeranium maculatum 3aMusca domestica 3aessential oils 3ainsect control 3ainsecticidal properties 3ainsecticides 3amonoterpenoids 3aoils 3aparasitology 3asynergism 3atoxicity1 aPicollo, María Inés1 aMougabure-Cueto, Gastón0 tParasitology research.g2015 Mar., v. 114, no. 3 p.1229-1232dSpringer-Verlagx0932-01137nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00436-015-4315-43Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle04011naa a2200457 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024001900094024003500113040001800148100002100166245012100187300001600308520258500324592002802909650001402937650002002951650001302971650002802984650001803012650002203030650001403052650001203066650002203078650002403100650001903124650002403143650001103167653002803178653002303206653001403229653002003243700002103263700001703284700002303301773012603324856008203450852000903532655001203541IND60517440720221119134741.0190803e201405  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6051744072DNAL7 a235275132pmid7 a10.1017/S13689800130007122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRodenburg, Gerda10aAssociations of parental feeding styles with child snacking behaviour and weight in the context of general parenting  ap. 960-969.  aTo examine cross-sectional and longitudinal (one-year follow-up) associations of parental feeding styles with child snacking behaviour and weight in the context of general parenting, taking into account the multidimensionality of the controlling feeding style. Linear regression analyses were performed. Parents completed a questionnaire to measure five feeding style dimensions (Instrumental Feeding, Emotional Feeding, Encouragement, Overt Control and Covert Control) and children's fruit, energy-dense snack and sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intakes. Children's height and weight were measured to calculate their BMI Z-scores. Moderation by parenting style was tested by adding interaction terms to the regression analyses. Observational study in the Netherlands. Parent–child dyads (n 1275) participating in the INPACT (IVO Nutrition and Physical Activity Child cohorT) study; children were (on average) 9 years of age. Instrumental Feeding and Emotional Feeding were negatively related to child fruit intake one year later and positively to (changes in) child energy-dense snack intake. Encouragement was negatively related to child energy-dense snacking and SSB intake one year later. Overt Control was cross-sectionally and prospectively related to (changes in) child energy-dense snacking and SSB intake in a negative direction. Covert Control showed similar associations with child energy-dense snacking and SSB intake as Overt Control. Although Covert Control was also positively related to child fruit intake and (changes in) child BMI Z-score, bootstrapping analyses revealed only a differential effect of Overt Control and Covert Control on child BMI Z-score one year later, with Covert Control displaying a stronger, positive association. Moderation analyses showed that some significant associations between parental feeding styles and outcome measures were dependent on the degree of psychological control and behavioural control. Instrumental Feeding and Emotional Feeding may have a detrimental impact on children's snacking behaviour, while Encouragement, Overt Control and Covert Control may lead to less energy-dense snacking and less SSB intake. Overt Control and Covert Control have differential effects on child BMI Z-score one year later, which supports the idea that they should be treated as separate constructs. Prospective studies with a longer follow-up may elucidate the causal pathways between the various feeding styles and children's snacking behaviour and weight, as well as the moderating influences of psychological and behavioural control.  aPublisher supplied data 3abeverages 3abody mass index 3achildren 3across-sectional studies 3aeating habits 3afruit consumption 3aparenting 3aparents 3aphysical activity 3aprospective studies 3aquestionnaires 3aregression analysis 3asnacks 0aParental feeding styles 0aChild snack intake 0aChild BMI 0aParenting style1 aKremers, Stef PJ1 aOenema, Anke1 avan de Mheen, Dike0 tPublic health nutrition.g2014 May, v. 17, no. 5 p.960-969dCambridge University PresswJournal:jnl56775x1475-27277nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S13689800130007123Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03465naa a2200505 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003900094040001800133100005800151245012400209300001600333520191200349592002802261650002102289650002302310650001202333650001002345650001902355650001502374650001302389650001702402650000902419650001402428650002602442650002202468650001402490650000902504650001102513650001302524650002802537650001002565651002002575653002402595653001902619653002302638653003402661700002302695700002302718773011102741856008602852852000902938655001202947IND60619737820221120033944.0210108e201901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6061973782DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0262doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKöhler, Realm1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1075-217210aAnimal-based food taboos during pregnancy and the postpartum period of Southeast Asian women – A review of literature  ap. 480-486.  aThis paper gives an overview of the various taboos on animal products and the reasons behind such practices among women in the member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while they are pregnant, during their postpartum period, and while breastfeeding.Three data search engines, Google® Scholar, PubMed and Scopus, were used one after the other, to generate the papers for this review. The online searches using the term food taboo, its synonyms, and truncations, in combination with the terms pregnancy, postpartum, and breastfeeding, and with the country name, were conducted from January to February 2017. In total, 28 papers were pooled and included in this review. The taboos and the justification for avoidance were collated and grouped per their occurrence, and according to the country where they are practiced. Nine papers provided information on the food taboos during pregnancy, 16 on postpartum food taboos, and six on breastfeeding. The food taboos included various river or seafood, meat from terrestrial animals, and derived products like fish paste, blood and internal organs.Healthcare providers should be aware of the food taboos being adhered to in the region to provide the right information and guidance to the women practicing them. There is a need to educate the public in general, and women, in particular, about the risk of malnutrition when food taboos are followed, and to support their nutritional requirements during pregnancy and the postpartum period by promoting dietary diversification.More research could be conducted to fill in the gap in information with regards to the food taboos and their impact in some of the ASEAN members. Culture-sensitive health interventions based on timely research work can contribute to the attainment of the sustainable development goal of reducing the maternal and under-five mortality ratios in Southeast Asia.  aPublisher supplied data 3aSoutheast Asians 3aanimal-based foods 3aanimals 3ablood 3abreast feeding 3afish paste 3afoodways 3amalnutrition 3ameat 3amortality 3anutrient requirements 3apostpartum period 3apregnancy 3arisk 3arivers 3aseafoods 3asustainable development 3awomen 3aSouth East Asia 0aDietary restriction 0aFood avoidance 0aCultural practices 0aMaternal health and nutrition1 aLambert, Christine1 aBiesalski, Hans K.0 tFood research international.g2019 Jan., v. 115 p.480-486dElsevier LtdwJournal:jnl48420x0963-99697nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2018.10.0263Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02100naa a2200349 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001500150245012600165300001600291520103300307592002801340650001401368650001101382650001101393650001101404700001601415700002101431700001401452700001701466700002001483700001901503700001701522700001801539773008701557856008501644852000901729655001201738IND60584101520221119123244.0181002e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058410152DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.08.0692doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWu, Haihua10aReducing energy dissipation and surface effect of diamond nanoelectromechanical resonators by annealing in oxygen ambient  ap. 281-287.  aThe authors report on the marked improvement of the quality factor (Q-factor) of single crystal diamond (SCD) nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS) resonators through annealing in oxygen ambient. The SCD NEMS resonators were fabricated by ion implantation assisted technique. The resonance frequency followed well the inverse power law relationship with the length of the cantilevers despite of the annealing. It was observed that there was little modification in the resonance frequency and Q-factor at 430 °C, while an obvious red-shift in the resonance frequency occurred at 500 °C. Meanwhile, a marked improvement in the Q-factor from around 3500 to 7000 was observed at 500 °C. The frequency red shift is due to the etching of diamond with a rate of 0.4–0.5 nm/h at 500 °C. The analysis of the energy dissipation discloses that the surface effect dominates the energy loss mechanism for the SCD NEMS resonator. The improvement of the Q-factor is thus attributed to the reduction of the surface defects in SCD NEMS.  aPublisher supplied data 3aannealing 3acarbon 3aenergy 3aoxygen1 aSang, Liwen1 aTeraji, Tokuyuki1 aLi, Tiefu1 aWu, Kongping1 aImura, Masataka1 aYou, Jianqiang1 aKoide, Yasuo1 aLiao, Meiyong0 tCarbon.g2017 Nov., v. 124 p.281-287dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.08.0693Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02425naa a2200325 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001900150245011200169300001600281520136600297592002801663650001501691650001201706650001101718650001801729650002501747653001201772653001701784653001001801653003501811700005801846773009001904856008401994852000902078655001202087IND60680006420221120202618.0200103e20180715xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6068000642DNAL7 a10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1782doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRashidi, Jouan10aExergy, exergo-economic, and exergy-pinch analyses (EXPA) of the kalina power-cooling cycle with an ejector  ap. 504-520.  aThis paper intends to optimize a new power and cooling cogeneration system, Kalina power-cooling with an ejector cycle (KPCE). The cycle combines the Kalina power cycle and the ejector absorption refrigeration cycle, with an ammonia-water mixture as the working fluid. To this aim, given the thermodynamic model, the potential improvements to the KPCE components are identified by performing exergy and exergo-economic analyses. Then, the system is optimized through a combination of exergy and pinch analyses (EXPA) to find out the direction of improvement and modifications of the system. This system operates with a thermal efficiency of 12.9% and power-cooling efficiency of 25%, providing 459 kW of power and 439.5 kW of cooling. KPCE showed a total exergy efficiency and exergy destruction of 69.8% and 1076 kW, respectively. Components with the highest exergy destruction and lowest exergy efficiency and unit cost rate are identified. According to EXPA, the system achieved a 5% lower overall cost rate and higher cooling generation, which resulted in higher thermodynamic efficiencies. The modified KPCE showed increases of 32%, 36%, and 32% in thermal, power-cooling, and exergy efficiencies, respectively. Compared with other Kalina power-cooling cycles, the optimized KPCE is introduced as a high-performance power-cooling cogeneration system.  aPublisher supplied data 3aabsorption 3acooling 3aexergy 3arefrigeration 3athermodynamic models 0aEjector 0aKalina cycle 0aPinch 0aPower and cooling cogeneration1 aYoo, ChangKyoo1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9406-76490 tEnergy.g2018 July 15, v. 155 p.504-520dElsevier LtdwJournal:12436x0360-54427nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2018.04.1783Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02449naa a2200361 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100006400150245009100214300001600305520128700321592002801608650001601636650001601652650001201668650001701680650002101697650001701718651001501735653002901750653002701779653002101806653002201827653001801849700001701867773009701884856008501981852000902066655001202075IND60743915120221119150356.0210904e202111  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6074391512DNAL7 a10.1016/j.renene.2021.06.0832doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAshikuzzaman, A.K.M.1https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6972-187210aOptical efficiency comparison of circular heliostat fields: Engender of hybrid layouts  ap. 506-519.  aConcentrated Solar Power (CSP) Technology is a carbon-neutral, renewable energy source that can cover the high electricity demand even after sunset by utilizing only the sun's power. Although parabolic trough is the most established and used CSP technology, Solar Power Tower (SPT) is gaining maturity and popularity in recent years at the commercial level. The heliostat field's design is the most crucial design consideration for an SPT plant and is investigated in this study. An operating 110 MW power plant named Crescent Dunes is redesigned with biomimetic spiral, and performance is analyzed in this article. Additionally, five new hybrid layouts are proposed, and performance analysis is carried out. Among the proposed layout, Hybrid 4 layout, which has a biomimetic spiral pattern in the north region and radial staggered pattern in the south part of the central tower, outperforms all the layouts. Specifically, the optical efficiency increment for the Hybrid 4 layout is found to be 0.195% higher than the original layout. Moreover, to evaluate the layouts' performance in different weathers, the same seven layouts are studied in four zones in Bangladesh. While the order of the layouts varies slightly from zone to zone, the Hybrid 4 layout still emerges as superior.  aPublisher supplied data 3abiomimetics 3aelectricity 3ahybrids 3apower plants 3asolar collectors 3asolar energy 3aBangladesh 0aConcentrated solar power 0aHeliostat field layout 0aRadial staggered 0aBiomimetic spiral 0aHybrid layout1 aAdnan, Sakib0 tRenewable energy.g2021 Nov., v. 178 p.506-519dElsevier LtdwJournal:11970x0960-14817nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.renene.2021.06.0833Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02248naa a2200385 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100001300150245013700163300001600300520105400316592002801370650002401398650002401422650002101446650001301467650001301480650001501493650001801508650001701526650002201543650002101565700001801586700001501604700001401619700001701633700001901650773008701669856008501756852000901841655001201850IND60584101620221119123026.0181002e201711  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6058410162DNAL7 a10.1016/j.carbon.2017.08.0762doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWang, Xu10aActivation effect of porous structure on fluorination of graphene based materials with large specific surface area at mild condition  ap. 288-295.  aFluorinated 2D porous graphene-based materials, FPGMs, were synthesized by using porous activated graphene material as raw material. The fluorination of PGM was activated through the introduction of meso- and micropores which generated a large number of vacancy, edges and defects. The fluorinated sample FPGM-10 with a F/C ratio of 0.67 was obtained at room temperature. Meanwhile, the temperate fluorination conditions guaranteed the porous structure from destruction, which endowed the FPGMs with large specific surface area and well-defined micro- and mesopores, among which FPGM-10 exhibited a BET SSA value of around 1100 m²/g. It was found the bare C atoms near the CF bonds with unpaired electron showed high reactivity with F2 resulting in the clustering of fluorine atoms at the edges, thus highly fluorinated edge region was formed. The thermogravimetric analysis, electrochemical measurement and computer simulation results simultaneously confirmed this structural characteristic ensured FPGMs with high chemical and thermal stability.  aPublisher supplied data 3aambient temperature 3acomputer simulation 3aelectrochemistry 3afluorine 3agraphene 3amicropores 3araw materials 3asurface area 3athermal stability 3athermogravimetry1 aWang, Weimiao1 aXu, Dazhou1 aLiu, Yang1 aLai, Wenchan1 aLiu, Xiangyang0 tCarbon.g2017 Nov., v. 124 p.288-295dElsevier LtdwJournal:11670x0008-62237nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2017.08.0763Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01027naa a2200265 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071040001800094100001500112245004400127300001600171500002900187520027900216592002800495650002900523650001500552651001000567653002000577653002600597653001300623773010400636852000900740655001200749IND60709866020221120084607.0200908e201707  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6070986602DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAparna, B.10aSustainble livelihood security in India  ap. 228-232.  aNALT-AP-4-rerunAP2-fuzzy  aPresent communication deals with Sustainable Livelihood Security Indices, calculated on the basis of economic, social, physical and ecological indicators in different states of India.

Unfortunately, native trout populations’ abundance is significantly threatened by anthropogenic disturbance. The introduction of commercial hatchery strains for recreation activities has compromised the genetic integrity status of native populations. This work assessed the fine-scale genetic structure of Mediterranean trout in the two main rivers of Molise region (Italy) to support conservation actions. In total, 288 specimens were caught in 28 different sites (14 per basins) and genotyped using the Affymetrix 57 K rainbow-trout-derived SNP array. Population differentiation was analyzed using pairwise weighted FST and overall F-statistic estimated by locus-by-locus analysis of molecular variance. Furthermore, an SNP data set was processed through principal coordinates analysis, discriminant analysis of principal components and admixture Bayesian clustering analysis. Firstly, our results demonstrated that rainbow trout SNP array can be successfully used for Mediterranean trout genotyping. In fact, despite an overwhelming number of loci that resulted as monomorphic in our populations, it must be emphasized that the resulted number of polymorphic loci (i.e., ~900 SNPs) has been sufficient to reveal a fine-scale genetic structure in the investigated populations, which is useful in supporting conservation and management actions. In particular, our findings allowed us to select candidate sites for the collection of adults, needed for the production of genetically pure juvenile trout, and sites to carry out the eradication of alien trout and successive re-introduction of native trout.  aPublisher supplied data 3aBayesian theory 3aOncorhynchus mykiss 3aanthropogenic activities 3aaquaculture 3adata collection 3adiscriminant analysis 3afisheries management 3afreshwater fish 3agenetic stability 3agenetic structure 3agenotyping 3ahatcheries 3ajuveniles 3arecreation 3asingle nucleotide polymorphism arrays 3atrout 3avariance 3awildlife management 3aItaly1 aDe Zio, Elena 1 aSalvatore, Giovanna 1 aEsposito, Stefano 1 aIaffaldano, Nicolaia 1 aD’Andrea, Mariasilvia 0 tAnimals.g2021 June 17, v. 11, no. 6dMultidisciplinary Digital Publishing InstitutewJournal:2274x2076-26157nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani110618033Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03006naa a2200481 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001600147245011500163300001300278520161100291592002801902650001501930650001201945650001401957650001401971650002801985650001702013650001302030650001402043650001302057650001302070650000702083650001402090650001602104650001102120650001402131650001102145650001302156650002702169650001502196651001302211700002502224700002302249700003302272773011702305856008102422852000902503655001202512IND60120191120221118063406.0150216e201502  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012019112DNAL7 a10.1007/s10661-014-4221-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMulk, Shahi10aImpact of marble industry effluents on water and sediment quality of Barandu River in Buner District, Pakistan  ap. 4221.  aIndustries play an important role in improving the living standard but at the same time cause several environmental problems. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of industries on the quality of environment. In the present study, the impact of marble industry effluents on water and sediment quality of Barandu River in Buner District, Pakistan was evaluated. Water and sediment samples were collected at three different sampling sites (upstream, industrial, and downstream sites) from Barandu River and their physicochemical properties were inter-compared. In addition, different marble stones and mix water (wastewater) from marble industry were analyzed. The measured physicochemical parameters of river water including pH, electrical conductivity (EC), alkalinity, total hardness, Ca and Mg hardness, total dissolved solid (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), sulfates (SO₄²⁻), sodium (Na⁺), potassium (K⁺), nitrites (NO₂⁻), nitrate (NO₃⁻), chloride (Cl⁻), calcium (Ca²⁺), and magnesium (Mg²⁺) were found to be significantly altered by effluent discharges of marble industries. Similarly, heavy metal concentrations in both water and sediments of the river were significantly increased by marble industry wastewater. It is concluded that large quantities of different pollutants are added to Barandu River due to direct disposal of marble industry effluents which degrades its quality. Therefore, it is recommended that direct disposal of marble industry wastewater should be banned and all effluents must be properly treated before discharging in the river water.  aPublisher supplied data 3aalkalinity 3acalcium 3achlorides 3aeffluents 3aelectrical conductivity 3aheavy metals 3aindustry 3amagnesium 3anitrates 3anitrites 3apH 3apotassium 3ariver water 3arivers 3asediments 3asodium 3asulfates 3atotal suspended solids 3awastewater 3aPakistan1 aAzizullah, Azizullah1 aKorai, Abdul Latif1 aKhattak, Muhammad Nasir Khan0 tEnvironmental monitoring and assessment.g2015 Feb., v. 187, no. 2 p.4221-4221dSpringer-Verlagx0167-63697nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-014-4221-83Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle03622naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024002700133040001800160100001900178245012700197300001800324506007600342520158700418592002802005506003702033650002002070650002102090650001702111650001202128650001402140650001402154650004302168650001302211650001102224650000902235650001802244650001702262650001602279650000902295650003202304650003002336650005202366650001102418650001102429650004102440650002902481650000902510650003102519650001602550650004402566700001902610700002402629700002702653700002602680700001902706700002302725700001902748700002202767700000702789773010302796856004002899852000902939655001202948IND4485261520221207083441.0120501e201205  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND448526152DNAL7 a224321052pmid7 aPMC33298122pmcid7 a10.2337/dc11-13072doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBest, James D.10aGlycemic Control Over 5 Years in 4,900 People With Type 2 Diabetes: Real-world diabetes therapy in a clinical trial cohort  ap. 1165-1170.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aOBJECTIVE: Glycemic control in type 2 diabetes generally worsens over time, requiring intensification of therapy. The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) trial provided the opportunity to observe glycemic control in a real-world setting. We assessed the adequacy of metformin, sulfonylureas, and insulin to maintain glycemic control and their effects on weight. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes control was measured at baseline and yearly for a median of 5 years in the 4,900 patients from the nonintervention arm of this study allocated to placebo. RESULTS: Median HbA1c was 6.9% at baseline and increased by an average of 0.22% over 5 years (P < 0.001). Median weight was 86.3 kg at baseline and decreased by 0.4 kg over 5 years (P = 0.002). Baseline therapy was lifestyle measures only in 27%, oral agents without insulin in 59%, and insulin in 14% (7% also taking oral agents). Over 5 years, insulin use increased to 32% (21% also taking oral agents). Use of oral agents remained similar at 56%. Only 2% of patients at baseline and 4% after 5 years were taking oral agents other than metformin or sulfonylureas. Initiation of insulin therapy in 855 patients produced a sustained reduction of HbA1c from a median of 8.2 to 7.7%, with a weight gain of 4.6 kg over 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: With intensification of traditional therapies, glycemic control deteriorated very little over 5 years in a large cohort of type 2 diabetes. However, the requirement for insulin therapy doubled, at the expense of significant weight gain and risk of hypoglycemia.  aPublisher supplied data0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aclinical trials 3aglycemic control 3ahypoglycemia 3ainsulin 3alifestyle 3ametformin 3anoninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 3apatients 3apeople 3arisk 3asulfonylureas 3atherapeutics 3aweight gain 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aDiabetes Mellitus, Type 2xbloodxdrug therapy. 2aFemale 2aHumans 2aHypoglycemic Agentsxtherapeutic use 2aInsulinxtherapeutic use 2aMale 2aMetforminxtherapeutic use 2aMiddle Aged 2aSulfonylurea Compoundsxtherapeutic use1 aDrury, Paul L.1 aDavis, Timothy M.E.1 aTaskinen, Marja-Riitta1 aKesäniemi, Y.

It was confirmed that the dehydrogenation of IPO to adsorbed acetone was the rate-limiting step for the amination of IPO. The Ni/LaAlSiO exhibited high activity for the dehydrogenation of IPO to acetone due to its high density of active Ni sites and strong surface basicity, and thus the high activity for the amination of IPO. In addition, the strong surface basicity of Ni/LaAlSiO promoted the desorption of IPA and inhibited the condensation reaction of IPA with adsorbed acetone, leading to the increased selectivity to IPA. In particular, the microcalorimetric co-adsorption results showed that IPA might be the most abundant surface species in the reaction, and the surface basicity promoted the desorption of IPA and thus the adsorption of reactants, leading to increased activity for the amination of IPO.  aPublisher supplied data 3aacetone 3aadsorption 3aamination 3acalorimetry 3acatalysts 3acondensation reactions 3adehydrogenation 3adesorption 3aisopropyl alcohol 3anickel 0aSupported Ni catalysts 0aSurface basicity 0aIsopropanol 0aAmination 0aIsopropylamine1 aWen, Ming1 aChen, Hui1 aNi, Zilin1 aXu, Jun1 aShen, Jianyi0 tJournal of catalysis.g2017 June, v. 350 p.141-148dElsevier Inc.wJournal:11700x0021-95177nnas40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcat.2017.02.0093Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle01987naa a2200445 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003800094040001800132100002200150245010400172300001600276520068500292592002800977650001101005650001601016650001201032650001101044650002101055650001101076650002101087650002501108650001101133650001301144650001001157650001301167651001501180653002101195653001401216700002301230700002801253700002001281700002601301700002101327773012101348856005101469852000901520655001201529IND50088622720221119071153.0140414e20131002xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND5008862272DNAL7 a10.1080/10496475.2013.8186062doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSharkar, Priyanka10aEthnomedicinal Importance of the Plants in Villages in Kushtia Sador and Mirpur Upozila, Bangladesh  ap. 401-417.  aEthnomedicinal importance of native medicinal plants in Kushtia sadar and Mirpur upazilas in the Kushtia district in Bangladesh were identified.

The cDNA clones isolated from unripe and ripe fruits of Fragaria x ananassa (garden strawberry) and Fragaria vesca (wild strawberry) showed high similarity (99% at the amino acid level) to the publically available F. vesca genome sequence and no significant differences could be identified between species and developmental stages of the fruits. In contrast, the genomic F3′H clones showed differences in the non-coding regions and 5′-flanking elements. The recombinant F3′Hs were functionally active and showed high specificity for naringenin, dihydrokaempferol, and kaempferol, whereas apigenin was only a minor substrate. During fruit development, a clear difference in the F3′H expression was observed between F. × ananassa and F. vesca. While a drastic decline of F3′H expression occurred during fruit ripening in F. × ananassa, F3′H in F. vesca was highly expressed in all stages. This was reflected by the anthocyanin composition, which showed a prevalence of pelargonidin in ripe fruits of F. × ananassa, whereas F. vesca had a high content of cyanidin. Screening of 17 berry species for their anthocyanin and flavonol composition showed that the prevalence of monohydroxylated anthocyanins makes garden strawberry unique among all other fruit species indicating that selection of bright red color during strawberry breeding, which consumers typically associate with freshness and ripeness, has selected phenotypes with a special biochemical background.  aPublisher supplied data 3aFragaria ananassa 3aFragaria vesca 3aamino acids 3aanthocyanins 3aapigenin 3abreeding 3aclones 3acolor 3acomplementary DNA 3acyanidin 3adevelopmental stages 3afreshness 3afruiting 3afruits 3agene expression regulation 3ahydroxylation 3akaempferol 3anaringenin 3anucleotide sequences 3apelargonidin 3aphenotype 3aripening 3ascreening 3astrawberries 2aCytochrome P-450 Enzyme Systemxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aFlavonoidsxmetabolism 2aFragariaxenzymologyxmetabolism. 2aFruitxgeneticsxmetabolism. 2aHydroxylation 2aPlant Proteinsxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aStrawberry (Fragaria sp.) 0aFruit color 0aFruit ripening 0aAnthocyanins 0aPelargonidin 0aHydroxylation pattern 0aFlavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H)1 aMiosic, Silvija1 aGotame, Tek Prasad1 aMikulic-Petkovsek, Maja1 aGosch, Christian1 aVeberic, Robert1 aPreuss, Anja1 aSchwab, Wilfried1 aŠtampar, Franci,1 aStich, Karl1 aHalbwirth, Heidi0 tPlant physiology and biochemistry.g2013 Nov., v. 72 p.72-78dElsevier Masson SASwJournal:jnl41590x0981-94287nnas40uhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2013.03.0193Available from publisher's site  aDNAL 7aarticle02195naa a2200421 u 4500001001300000005001700013008004100030016002300071024003500094040001800129100001700147245011900164300001600283520096400299592002801263650001101291650001101302650002201313650001801335650001001353650001601363650002101379650001101400650002001411650001601431650001301447650000901460650001001469651001001479700001901489700001801508700001701526700001701543773011101560856008101671852000901752655001201761IND60120191320221118063345.0150129e201501  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND6012019132DNAL7 a10.1007/s10722-014-0164-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPatil, R.

The drug L-3, 4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) extracted from seeds of Mucuna plant has been commonly used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. In the present study, a new species of Mucuna, M. sanjappae Aitawade et Yadav from north-Western Ghats of India, has been analyzed for the presence of L-DOPA and a reasonable level of this drug (7.3 %) was detected. The necessary biochemical characterization of the seeds extract of this plant showed nutritional and anti-nutritional components. Simultaneously, moisture, ash, dietary fiber, calorific value, nitrate and mineral contents of seeds were also determined. This new plant species will be a potential candidate for extraction of L-DOPA and will be a good addition to the existing natural sources of anti-Parkinson’s drug since demand for L-DOPA is continuously escalating.  aPublisher supplied data 3aL-dopa 3aMucuna 3aParkinson disease 3adietary fiber 3adrugs 3afood plants 3afunctional foods 3aleaves 3amineral content 3anew species 3anitrates 3apods 3aseeds 3aIndia1 aGholave, A.

H.12aA health risk for consumers: the presence of adulterated food supplements in the Netherlands  ap. 1273-1288.  aThe use of food supplements is increasing. They are marketed as beneficial for health, well-being, physical or mental condition and performance, or to prevent diseases. Producers add synthetic compounds or illicit herbal material to food supplements to claim desired effects. Claims made to support marketing without scientific evidence are, however, illegal. Intake of adulterated food supplements may lead to serious adverse effects. The aim of this paper is to report the results of analyses of (adulterated) food supplements conducted by the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority between October 2013 and October 2018. In total, 416 supplements were analysed of which 264 (64%) contained one or more pharmacological active substances or plant toxins, such as caffeine, synephrine, sildenafil, icariin, sibutramine, higenamine, hordenine, phenethylamine, methylsynephrine, DMAA, phenolphthalein, octopamine and ephedrine. When compared to dose levels that are considered safe, daily doses of the substances in the food supplements were sometimes much higher, causing a risk for consumers who are unaware of the presence of these pharmacologically active substances. In many cases, neither food nor medicines legislation (easily) enables enforcement actions. This means that some products containing pharmacologically active substances (i.e. synthetic medicines and their illicit analogues), stay available on the market. An undesirable situation because for many of these substances no detailed toxicity data are available.  aPublisher supplied data 3aactive ingredients 3aadulterated foods 3aadverse effects 3acaffeine 3adietary exposure 3adietary supplements 3aephedrine 3ahordenine 3aicariin 3alaws and regulations 3amarkets 3amedicinal properties 3aoctopamine 3aphenethylamine 3aphenolphthaleins 3aphytotoxins 3aproduct safety 3atoxicity 3aNetherlands 0aFood supplement 0adietary supplement 0aadulterants 0apharmaceutical drug 0afood safety 0aregulation 0aenforcement1 aSijm, Dick T.

We consider an alternative, "avant-garde view" in which proteins are conformationally dynamic and exhibit functional promiscuity. We surmise that these properties are the foundation stones of protein evolvability; they facilitate the divergence of new functions within existing folds and the evolution of entirely new folds. Packing modes of proteins also affect their evolvability, and poorly packed, disordered, and conformationally diverse proteins may exhibit high evolvability. This dynamic view of protein structure, function, and evolvability is extrapolated to describe hypothetical scenarios for the evolution of the early proteins and future research directions in the area of protein dynamism and evolution. 3aevolution 3aprotein structure 3aproteins1 aTawfik, Dan S.0 tScience.g2009 Apr. 10, v. 324, no. 5924 p.203-207dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11693753Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03227naa a2200613 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002400180245019900204300001600403520123500419650003101654650000901685650001801694650004101712650003201753650001301785650002201798650002101820650002301841650002101864650001201885650005101897650001601948650005401964650001102018650001302029650001102042650003002053650005102083650000902134650002302143650002102166650004402187650003802231650002602269650001702295653004102312700002002353700001602373700002102389773011102410852000902521930003302530945002502563946001302588655001202601IND4403347720221119205959.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440334772DNAL7 a183563392pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Viral-specific cells are an important component of protective immunity. We hypothesized that reduction in the expansion of viral-specific cells and the microenvironment of the PEM host leads to increased incidence and severity of infections. We tested this hypothesis using a mouse model of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and an adoptive transfer system using P14 transgenic mice cells bearing T cell receptors specific for the Db-restricted LCMV glycoprotein 33-41 epitope. We transferred equal numbers of P14 cells from mice fed either an adequate, 18% protein or low, 0.6% protein diet into C57BL/6 mice that had been fed adequate-protein (AP) or low-protein (LP) diets for 2 wk, infected them with LCMV, and followed them 1 wk postinfection. During PEM, the expansion of primary viral-specific CD8 T cells diminished; in LP diet-fed mice, it was only 2-3% of that in the AP diet-fed mice. Furthermore, the diminished primary CD8 T cell response during PEM may in part have been due to low numbers of viral-specific CD8 T cells and an altered microenvironment. 3aCD8-positive T-lymphocytes 3amice 3aanimal models 3aviral diseases of animals and humans 3aprotein energy malnutrition 3aimmunity 3ahigh protein diet 3alow protein diet 3aexperimental diets 3adisease severity 2aAnimals 2aArenaviridae Infectionsximmunologyxvirology. 2aBody Weight 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesxcytologyximmunology. 2aEating 2aEpitopes 2aFemale 2aGlycoproteinsximmunology 2aLymphocytic choriomeningitis virusximmunology 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred C57BL 2aMice, Transgenic 2aProtein-Energy Malnutritionximmunology 2aStem Cellsxcytologyximmunology. 2aSubstrate Specificity 2aTime Factors 0aviral-specific CD8 T cell precursors1 aWherry, E.

Computational models have stressed the role of the hippocampus and, in particular, the dentate gyrus and its projections into the CA3 subregion in pattern separation. We used high-resolution (1.5-millimeter isotropic voxels) functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during incidental memory encoding. Although activity consistent with a bias toward pattern completion was observed in CA1, the subiculum, and the entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, activity consistent with a strong bias toward pattern separation was observed in, and limited to, the CA3/dentate gyrus. These results provide compelling evidence of a key role of the human CA3/dentate gyrus in pattern separation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3ahippocampus 3ahumans 3amagnetic resonance imaging 3amemory 3amodels1 aKirwan, C.

Intake was measured by chemical analysis of complete duplicate portions of all food eaten over 1 day by each individual. NSP intakes showed a rural - urban gradient, with 18.4 g/day in rural Finland and 18.0 g/day in rural Denmark versus 14.5 g/day in urban Finland and 13.2 g/day in urban Denmark. NSP intakes were also calculated (using food tables) from weighed food records kept over 4 days, one of which was the day on which the duplicate collection was made. Intakes were 2-2.5 g/day higher with this method than with direct chemical analysis, mainly because published tables of values have become outdated and inaccurate as a result of improved methods for measuring NSP in food. Individual variation from day to day in NSP intake was considerable. Average NSP intake of some of its component sugars were inversely related to colon cancer incidence in this geographical comparison. To show a relationship at the individual level between diet and cancer risk in a prospective study would require detailed and accurate methods for the assessment of NSP consumption.

Traits studied were growth (assessed by stem diameter), wood density, cellulose content, pulp yield and lignin content. These traits are important in breeding for pulpwood, and will be important in breeding for carbon sequestration and biofuel production. Between one and four QTL were located for each trait, with each QTL explaining between 4% and 12% of the phenotypic variation. Several QTL for chemical wood properties were co-located, consistent with their high phenotypic correlations, and may reflect pleiotropic effects of the same genes. In contrast, QTL for density and lignin content with overlapping confidence intervals were considered to be due to independent genes, since the QTL effects were inherited from different parents. The inclusion of fully informative microsatellites on the linkage map allowed the determination of homology at the linkage group level between QTL and candidate genes in different pedigrees of E. globulus and different eucalypt species. None of the candidate genes mapped in comparable studies co-located with our major QTL for wood chemical properties, arguing that there are important candidate genes yet to be discovered. 3aEucalyptus globulus 3abiofuels 3abreeding 3acarbon sequestration 3acellulose 3achromosome mapping 3aconfidence interval 3agenes 3agenotype 3alignin 3amicrosatellite repeats 3aparents 3aphenotypic correlation 3aphenotypic variation 3aphysicochemical properties 3aplanting 3apulp 3apulpwood 3aquantitative trait loci 3awood density 3aTasmania1 aWhittock, Simon P.1 aPotts, Brad M.1 aVaillancourt, René E.0 tTree genetics & genomes.g2009 Oct., v. 5, no. 4 p.713-722dSpringer-Verlagx1614-29427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11295-009-0222-0 7aarticle02009naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001500110245007700125300001400202520086700216650002301083650001701106650001801123650002001141650001501161650001101176650001501187650002101202650002301223650002001246650002601266650002501292650001501317650001201332651001501344653001601359653001201375700001801387700001701405773007501422852000901497930003301506945001301539946001101552655001201563IND2196239220221119210209.0990104e199805  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219623922DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaldon, H.10aAgroecosystem responses to organic and conventional management practices  ap. 65-75.  aThe stability and resilience of two very similar soil ecosystems were challenged over an extended time by organic and conventional management systems. The responses were compared against a native soil ecosystem by following carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus balances through the biological, geological, and chemical sub-systems. The types and amounts of carbon inputs did not predict the resulting system contents or properties. Nitrogen and phosphorus retained in the systems were related to, but not proportional to, inputs. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus moved through the agroecosystems and excesses were exported to maintain stasis in the component sub-systems. A flow diagram was proposed to describe the stabilizing responses in these systems. The unique properties of each agroecosystem must be considered when developing sustainable management practices. 3aLolium multiflorum 3aVicia sativa 3asoil analysis 3asoil management 3aecosystems 3acarbon 3aphosphorus 3anitrogen balance 3aorganic production 3afarm management 3along term experiments 3astatistical analysis 3asoil water 3asoil pH 3aCalifornia 0acomparisons 0aeffects1 aGliessman, S.1 aBuchanan, M.0 tAgricultural systems.g1998 May, v. 57, no. 1 p.65-75x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990301b19990308c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle03524naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001900164245014100183300001800324500001500342520172700357650002202084650001702106650000902123650002202132650002702154650003302181650002002214650002902234650002202263650002602285650001102311650003202322650003302354650000902387650001602396650003202412650003302444650003302477653001302510653001302523653001502536700002002551700002102571700001802592700002202610700001502632700001902647700001702666773011302683852000902796856008502805930003302890946001102923655001202934IND4440705520221119210324.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444070552DNAL7 a200914042pmid7 a10.1007/s00198-009-1132-62doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWhiteford, J. 10aEffects of a 1-year randomized controlled trial of resistance training on lower limb bone and muscle structure and function in older men  ap. 1529-1536.  a2019-12-04  aSummary A 1-year randomized controlled trial of resistance training compared with a control group was undertaken in 143 men aged 55-80 years. Although hip bone mineral density, lean body mass, and function increased in both groups, lean body mass and function but not bone density increased more in the resistance group. Introduction Previous studies have demonstrated a positive effect of resistance training on bone mineral density (BMD) in postmenopausal women, but the effect in men is unclear. The aim was to examine the effect of a 1-year resistance training program on bone and lean body mass in 143 men aged 55-80 years, randomized to either resistance training or active control. Methods Resistance exercises were selected to provide loading at the hips. Measurements were taken at 0, 6, and 12 months for BMD (whole body, hip, and spine), lean body mass, strength, and functional fitness. Results The intervention showed a significant increase in total hip BMD for both groups at 12 months (active control, 1,014-1,050 mg/cm²; resistance, 1,045-1,054 mg/cm², p < 0.05) with no increased effect of resistance training compared to active control. However, compared to the active control group, the resistance group increased their lean body mass (active control, 0.1 ± 2.1%; resistance, 1.5 ± 2.7%, p < 0.05), fitness (active control, 4.6 ± 11.1%; resistance, 13.0 ± 13.4%, p < 0.05), and lower limb muscle strength (active control, 14.3 ± 16.8%; resistance, 39.4 ± 30.87%, p < 0.05). Conclusions In contrast to previous findings in older women, in older men, a resistance training program does not increase hip bone mass more than walking 30 min three times a week. 3astrength training 3abone density 2aAged 2aAged, 80 and over 2aAnthropometryxmethods 2aBody Compositionxphysiology 2aBody Mass Index 2aBone Densityxphysiology 2aFollow-Up Studies 2aHip Jointxphysiology 2aHumans 2aLower Extremityxphysiology 2aLumbar Vertebraexphysiology 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aMuscle Strengthxphysiology 2aMuscle, Skeletalxphysiology 2aResistance Trainingxmethods 0aStrength 0aexercise 0aRandomized1 aAckland, T.

We hypothesized that AM colonization increases Ni content and tolerance in sunflower grown under varying soil Ni concentrations. The combined effect of AM colonization and soil Ni input on the assimilation of nitrogen, in particular the activity of glutamine synthetase (GS), in sunflower plants was also investigated. A factorial experimental design was performed with sunflower cv. Lemon Queen, with or without the AM fungus, Glomus intraradices Schenck & Smith, and treated with 0, 100, 200, or 400 mg Ni kg⁻¹ dry soil (DS). The AM colonization significantly enhanced plant growth and Ni content, especially at the lower soil Ni treatments. Furthermore, the AM plants exposed to the highest soil Ni level of 400 mg Ni kg⁻¹ DS had a significantly higher shoot Ni extracted percentage than non-AM plants, suggesting that the AM symbiosis contributed to Ni uptake, then its translocation from roots to shoots. The AM colonization also significantly increased the GS activity in roots, this being likely an indicator of an enhanced Ni tolerance. These findings support the hypothesis that AM symbiosis contributes to an enhanced Ni plant uptake and tolerance and should be considered as part of phytoremediation strategies. 3aplant growth 3avesicular arbuscular mycorrhizae 3aHelianthus annuus 3amycorrhizal fungi 3aexperimental design 3anitrogen 3agreenhouse experimentation 3aglutamate-ammonia ligase 3asoil 3aphytoremediation 3aRhizophagus intraradices 3anickel 3aroots 3ashoots 2aBiodegradation, Environmental 2aGlomeromycotaxphysiology 2aGlutamate-Ammonia Ligasexmetabolism 2aHelianthusxenzymologyxmetabolismxmicrobiology. 2aMycorrhizaexphysiology 2aNickelxmetabolism 2aPlant Proteinsxmetabolism 2aSoil Pollutantsxmetabolism 0aGlomus intraradices 0aMetal1 aCharest, Christiane 0 tMycorrhiza.g2010 Aug., v. 20, no. 6 p.399-406dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0940-63607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-009-0293-73Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03239naa a2200541 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175100001900184245015500203300001800358500002400376500001500400520156400415650001601979650001701995650001802012650003402030650001802064650002002082650003202102650003002134650002402164650002302188650002302211650001502234651002102249653003002270653002402300653001002324700002002334700001902354700002002373700001502393773011102408852000902519856008802528930003302616945002502649946001102674655001202685IND4418292320221119205902.0090327e20090331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441829232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.02.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK001 0aX100 0aK2501 aHarper, George10aLodgepole pine growth as a function of competition and canopy light environment within aspen dominated mixedwoods of central interior British Columbia  ap. 1829-1838.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThree lodgepole pine and aspen mixedwood sites located in the central interior of British Columbia within the Sub Boreal Spruce (SBS) biogeoclimatic zone were chosen to study the neighbourhood aspen competition and canopy light environment of 14-19-year-old lodgepole pine. All three sites had previously been established as separate research trials designed to explore various silviculture options for controlling aspen competition (aspen brushing, herbicide, thinning and untreated areas). For each site, 33-36 pine trees were selected to represent the observed range of light regimes under the influence of various aspen competition levels. At each sample pine, competition and stand measurements were made and a series of vertical canopy light measurements from the top to the base of the live crown. After an evaluation of a variety of competition indices, the index DRD; sum of the ratio of each of the three nearest neighbour's DBH to the subject pine divided by their distance and, amount of available light at the top of the crown (DIFNt) were found as the best overall predictors of pine stem volume growth. A site specific exponential relationship of relative pine stem volume growth to DRD was found and minimum growth response competition thresholds were determined, which could provide useful targets where maximizing pine volume is intended. Evaluation of both linear and non-linear models of DIFNt versus height growth indicated the response to be linear across the observed range of available light. Implications for management are discussed. 3atree growth 3aforest trees 3amixed forests 3aPinus contorta var. latifolia 3aforest canopy 3alight intensity 3atree and stand measurements 3ainterspecific competition 3aPopulus tremuloides 3aforest plantations 3astatistical models 3aprediction 3aBritish Columbia 0adiameter at breast height 0acompetition indices 0alight1 aO'Neill, Meghan1 aFielder, Peter1 aNewsome, Teresa1 aDeLong, C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Mar. 31, v. 257, no. 8 p.1829-1838dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.02.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/04/25  aNon-US 7aarticle01818naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245008900126300001600215500001500231520070800246650002600954650001800980650002200998650001401020650001601034650002001050650001501070650001401085650002001099650002501119650001701144650002201161650002101183651001001204653002001214700001801234773007801252852000901330930003301339945001301372946001101385655001201396IND2198127920221119210003.0990414e199810  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219812792DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, M.M.10aShifting from extensive to intensive agricultural systems: a case study in the Sudan  ap. 253-268.  a2019-12-05  aThe development of the mechanized vertisols of Sudan has been very successful in achieving rapid expansion of crop area. Unfortunately, there has been minimal use of purchased inputs. Hence, crop yields have been low and declining over time with increasing variability of output. Now the frontier is disappearing and past land and credit subsidies have been eliminated. With modeling, we show that in the absence of the area-expansion option, even risk-averse farmers shift to the more intensive technologies involving improved cultivars and fertilization. We explore several options involving further research or policy changes that would induce intensification even before the passing of the frontier. 3aagricultural research 3amechanization 3aagricultural land 3aVertisols 3afertilizers 3arisk assessment 3acrop yield 3asubsidies 3aSorghum bicolor 3aeconomic development 3acase studies 3aintensive farming 3aapplication rate 3aSudan 0afarming systems1 aSanders, J.H.0 tAgricultural systems.g1998 Oct., v. 58, no. 2 p.253-268x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990503b19990512c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle04001naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002500175245014400200300001800344500002400362500001500386520209500401650001602496650001202512650002402524650002202548650001702570650001002587650001102597650002502608650001602633650002102649650001002670650001802680650003002698650002202728650002102750650001202771650002002783650001702803651001202820651002802832653001902860653001002879653002202889653002202911653001102933700002802944700002102972700002402993700002103017700002403038773011103062852000903173856008803182930003303270945002503303946001103328655001203339IND4418292420221119210016.0090327e20090331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441829242DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.02.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aF300 0aK100 0aB2001 aMorrissey, Robert C.10aGrapevine (Vitis spp.) dynamics in association with manual tending, physiography, and host tree associations in temperate deciduous forests  ap. 1839-1846.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aThe role of lianas (woody vines) in the development and diversity of both tropical and temperate forests under differing management scenarios has not been thoroughly explored. We examined changes in grapevine (Vitis spp.) densities over time in clearcut stands as influenced by manual tending, physiography, and host tree associations. We used data from long-term studies on 66 clearcut stands dominated by temperate deciduous forest tree species on the Hoosier National Forest in south-central Indiana, USA. Fourteen of the stands had grapevines removed manually, approximately during the stem exclusion stage of development. Grapevine densities steadily increased from age 5 until age 15, which coincides with the period of stem exclusion of these stands. Subsequent grapevine mortality may have been related to light competition. Manually treated stands had similar grapevine densities as untreated stands after 20 years across sites, and it appeared that only on the most xeric area was the grapevine treatment effective in reducing grapevine densities. During early stand development, ranging from ages 5 to 17, grapevine density was strongly related to slope position, but as stands developed through the stem exclusion stage, aspect emerged as a stronger factor influencing grapevine density. Black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), walnut (Juglans spp.), and elm (Ulmus spp.) were the most common grapevine host trees under both treated and untreated scenarios, which may be associated with the crown architecture of these species. Results suggest lianas play a critical role in the early development of disturbed forest sites in temperate deciduous forests. With concerns that lianas are increasing in abundance and distribution in these forest types, understanding their role in forest dynamics, such as host tree associations at different stages of development, competition dynamics on different sites and corresponding influences on tree growth, species composition, and diversity, will be critical to decision-making processes in achieving desired management goals in the future. 3atree growth 3aJuglans 3amanual weed control 3adeciduous forests 3aforest trees 3aUlmus 3alianas 3aspatial distribution 3ahost plants 3ahardwood forests 3aVitis 3aforest stands 3ainterspecific competition 3aspecies diversity 3astand management 3adensity 3aPrunus serotina 3aclearcutting 3aIndiana 3aHoosier National Forest 0astem exclusion 0aslope 0astand development 0ahost associations 0aaspect1 aGauthier, Martin-Michel1 aKershaw, John A.1 aJacobs, Douglass F.1 aSeifert, John R.1 aFischer, Burnell C.0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Mar. 31, v. 257, no. 8 p.1839-1846dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.02.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/04/25  aNon-US 7aarticle02856naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001900129245009600148300001400244500001500258520147600273650001501749650001601764650001201780650000901792650001901801650002301820650001201843650002801855650002801883650001101911650003801922650001101960650003101971650002502002650005502027650002002082650003602102653001002138653001402148700001802162700001702180773009902197852000902296930003302305945001302338946001102351655001202362IND2202347820221119204356.0000201e19990701ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220234782DNAL7 a104902322pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVan Kampen, C.10aAdhesion molecules and lymphocyte subsets in milk and blood of periparturient Holstein cows  ap. 23-32.  a2019-12-05  aMigration of leukocytes into the mammary gland is an essential element of resistance to infection which is likely influenced by expression of adhesion molecules. The contribution of subsets to mammary gland resistance remains unclear. Mononuclear cells from milk and blood of dairy cows were examined for variation in CD4(+), CD8(+), and WC1(+) (Workshop Cluster 1; marker for gammadelta T cells) lymphocyte phenotypes and expression of LFA-1 and L-selectin at several time points during the periparturient period and at Week 16 of lactation. Proportions of CD4(+) T cells were higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) in blood than milk at all times between Week 0 and Week 16 relative to calving; the increase was true of CD8(+) cells. Expression of L-selectin was lower (p less than or equal to 0.05) on CD4(+) cells and higher on CD8(+) cells from milk. The WC1(+) subset was more frequent in blood than in milk except at calving when the opposite was true. After calving, proportions of L-selectin(+)WC1(+) cells decreased steadily to Week 16. Expression of LFA-1 was examined on mononuclear cell populations and found to be lower on milk cells and did not vary over time. We conclude that proportions of T cells subsets differ significantly between blood and milk, particularly around calving. Corresponding variations in L-selectin expression may indicate a role for this molecule in regulating the movement of CD8(+) and WC1(+) T cells into the bovine mammary gland. 3adairy cows 3alymphocytes 3acalving 3amilk 3amammary glands 3adefense mechanisms 2aAnimals 2aCD4 Antigensxanalysis. 2aCD8 Antigensxanalysis. 2aCattle 2aCell Adhesion Moleculesxanalysis 2aFemale 2aFlow Cytometryxveterinary 2aL-Selectinxanalysis 2aLymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1xanalysis 2aMilkxchemistry 2aT-Lymphocyte Subsetsxchemistry 0ablood 0avariation1 aMallard, B.A.1 aWilkie, B.N.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g1999 July 1, v. 69, no. 1 p.23-32x0165-24277nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03232naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111100001700129245009600146300001400242520183500256650000902091650001002100650001802110650001902128650001602147650002002163650002102183650001202204650002302216650003702239650001802276650000902294650001902303650005702322650004702379650003702426650002702463653001502490700001202505700001702517700002002534700001902554773009902573852000902672930003302681945001302714946001102727655001202738IND2202348220221119204448.0000201e19990701ne |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220234822DNAL7 a104902342pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTshamala, M.10aAntigenicity of cortical bone allografts in dogs and effect of ethylene oxide-sterilization  ap. 47-59.  aThe aims of the present study were to determine the antigenicity of cortical bone allografts and the effect of ethylene oxide-sterilization (EO-sterilization). Cortical bone allografts from one donor dog were implanted in a muscle pouch in four groups of four dogs each. The grafts were either fresh, EO-sterilized, demineralized or demineralized and EO-sterilized. The immune response against the grafts was determined by measuring the antibody response against surface antigens of donor cells and by the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Dogs receiving EO-sterilized grafts or bone matrix did not demonstrate an immune response. Only two of the four dogs with fresh cortical bone grafts showed a very weak immune response. This suggests a priming of the host by the fresh bone grafts. However, implanting skin grafts from the donor dog subdermally, in one dog of each of the groups, four months after implanting the bone grafts did not induce a secondary immune response. Macroscopic and histologic examination of the bone grafts five months after their implantation consistently revealed graft resorption (activity of osteoclasts) and vascularization of the fresh bone grafts, but not of EO-sterilized fresh grafts. For most EO-sterilized grafts, a strong inflammatory reaction was present in the tissues surrounding the graft and this was not apparent around the non-sterilized grafts. The absence of resorption and the presence of the inflammation seemed to be unwanted effects of the EO-sterilization. The EO-sterilisation did not affect osteoinduction since osteocytes were observed in the EO-sterilized demineralized grafts. Results indicate that cortical bone allografts used in the present study are very weak antigens and that the EO-sterilization procedure used has no effect on osteoinduction, but decreases bone resorption. 3adogs 3abones 3askin grafting 3aethylene oxide 3asterilizing 3aimmune response 3asurface antigens 2aAnimals 2aAntibody Formation 2aBone Transplantationxveterinary 2aDisinfectants 2aDogs 2aEthylene Oxide 2aFluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirectxveterinary 2aLymphocyte Culture Test, Mixedxveterinary 2aSkin Transplantationxveterinary 2aSterilizationxmethods 0aallografts1 aCox, E.1 aCock, H. de.1 aGoddeeris, B.M.1 aMattheeuws, D.0 tVeterinary immunology and immunopathology.g1999 July 1, v. 69, no. 1 p.47-59x0165-24277nnas  aDNAL  a20000404b20000411c00000000  aINDdCLD  aNon-US 7aarticle03262naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003700092040001800129072000900147100001600156245012700172300001800299500002400317500001500341520180600356650002002162650002302182650002302205650001302228650001602241650002102257650001202278650001402290650001902304650002402323650002802347651001302375651002902388653001602417653001802433700001702451700001802468700001802486773009902504852000902603856008702612930003302699945002502732946001102757655001202768IND4418293020221119204427.0090327e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441829302DNAL7 a10.1016/j.agwat.2009.02.0072doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aW0001 aGoswami, D.10aNitrate-N loadings through subsurface environment to agricultural drainage ditches in two flat Midwestern (USA) watersheds  ap. 1021-1030.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aA study was conducted to understand the contributions of tile flow and baseflow to total nitrate-N (NO₃-N) loadings in two subsurface (tile)-drained watersheds, namely the Big Ditch (BD) and the Upper Embarras River (UER) watersheds in Illinois. Two stream sections were selected in the watersheds and rectangular cutthroat flumes were installed at the upstream and downstream ends of the stream sections to calculate the flow mass balance for separating baseflow. The stream section at BD site had two tile outlets draining into it. The stream section at UER watershed did not have any tile drain. Tile flow was also measured along with stream flow. Water samples were collected not only from the stream sections using auto-samplers but also manually from the tile drains. Average baseflow rates per unit lengths of the stream sections at BD and UER sites were 3.5x10⁻⁰⁴ and 9.4x10⁻⁰⁵ m² s⁻¹, respectively. At BD site, for six study periods, the percentages of baseflow and tile flow contributions of NO₃-N loads within the stream section were 90 and 10%, respectively. Annual NO₃-N contributions by the upstream subwatersheds for BD and UER stream sections were 61,819 and 16,155kg, respectively. Annual NO₃-N loss from these two subwatersheds within BD and UER watersheds was 42.9 and 7.0kgha⁻¹, respectively. For the stream section at BD site, baseflow seemed to play a more important role than tile flow in raising the NO₃-N concentration level in the stream water. Land use seemed to play a major role in the significant difference in NO₃-N concentrations at the two subwatersheds upstream from the project sites. Nitrate-N loadings primarily depended on precipitation, antecedent moisture condition (AMC), fertilizer application time, and evapotranspiration (ET). 3awater pollution 3aapplication timing 3aevapotranspiration 3aland use 3afertilizers 3anitrate nitrogen 3astreams 3abase flow 3apollution load 3asubsurface drainage 3aagricultural watersheds 3aIllinois 0aMidwestern United States 0astream flow 0aprecipitation1 aKalita, P.K.1 aCooke, R.A.C.1 aMcIsaac, G.F.0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 June, v. 96, no. 6 p.1021-1030dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.02.0073Available from publisher's Web site  a20090608b20090703c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle02330naa a2200313 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245010900127300001600236520142500252650002301677650002501700650001401725650001501739650002201754700001701776700001601793700001801809700001601827700001701843773008901860852000901949939003301958946001301991655001202004IND8903355620221119204414.0890622e198904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890335562DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBaliga, B.S.10aChemiluminescence response of polymorphonuclear leukocytes from vitamin E deficient sickle cell patients  ap. 761-771.  aChemiluminescence (CL) responses of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with a vitamin E deficiency (5 microgram/ml or less) were compared with normal controls using whole blood and purified polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) in a luminol amplified system. There was significantly more CL generated by the whole blood of SCD patients than generated by control blood. However, the purified PMN isolated from the same SCD bloods generated less CL than PMN from controls. When seven of these patients were supplemented with vitamin E for three months, four of the seven had their whole blood and PMN CL responses restored to normal levels. The excessive CL response in SCD whole blood seems to be caused by sickle erythrocytes rather than PMN. The CL response in our luminol amplified system is directly dependent on the number of PMN and is inhibited by superoxide dismutase (SOD) (6 microgram/ml), iodoacetic acid (IAA) (0.2 millimole) and vitamin E (2 mM/ml). The CL responses of whole blood from SCD patients were inhibited by 20 micromole adriamycin while purified PMNs were partially inhibited. These results suggest that vitamin E deficient SCD patients have excessive CL generating blood cells and a low number of CL generating active PMN. The exact role of vitamin E in this is not understood. The demonstration of excessive CL responses by whole blood of SCD patients may be due to factors other than PMN activity. 3asickle cell anemia 3avitamin deficiencies 3avitamin E 3aleukocytes 3achemiluminescence1 aSindel, L.J.1 aSmith, C.J.1 aJenkins, L.D.1 aBendich, A.1 aMankad, V.N.0 tNutrition reports international.g1989 Apr., v. 39, no. 4 p.761-771x0029-66357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01892naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245009500126300001600221500001500237520079300252650002201045650001101067650001301078650001201091650002301103650001501126650001101141650002301152650001601175650001801191650001201209650001901221650002101240651002001261653002401281653002101305773007801326852000901404930003301413945001301446946001101459655001201470IND2198188120221119204437.0990416e199808  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219818812DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrennan, D.14aThe impact of river access rules on dairy farm incomes: a case study of the Williams River  ap. 571-584.  a2019-12-05  aConcern over river health has prompted the New South Wales (Australian) Government to consider the imposition of minimum flow standards in the state's rivers. In this paper, a case study of dairy farms in the Williams River valley is presented, which quantifies the opportunity cost of the irrigator access rules proposed for this river. The analysis is conducted using a bioeconomic model which combines the simulation of climatic conditions and pasture growth, with an optimisation procedure that represents farmers' responses to realised seasonal conditions. The approach allows the dynamic aspects of the pasture management problem to be simulated, whereby fodder storage can be used as a means of managing the increased climatic risk brought about by restricting access to the river. 3asimulation models 3arivers 3apastures 3afarmers 3abiomass production 3awater flow 3aforage 3aseasonal variation 3ariver water 3adairy farming 3astorage 3arisk reduction 3aclimatic factors 3aNew South Wales 0amathematical models 0ariver regulation0 tAgricultural systems.g1998 Aug., v. 57, no. 4 p.571-584x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL  a20060205b00000000c00000000  aINDdCTR  aNon-US 7aarticle01872naa a2200277 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130100001900148245013000167300001800297500002400315520092900339650001701268650002601285650002201311650001501333650002101348700001701369773009901386852000901485856008801494655001201582IND4418962320221119204516.0090410s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441896232DNAL7 a10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKanie, Yoshimi10aAnalysis of pyridylaminated oligosaccharides using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with a monolithic capillary column  ap. 4121-4124.  aIncludes references  aWe examined the utility of a monolithic capillary column in the analysis of pyridylaminated oligosaccharides. Fluorescence detection and mass spectrometry were used to monitor a series of oligosaccharides. Although the total-ion chromatogram appeared similar to that obtained with fluorescence detection, the sensitivity of this technique was limited, especially in the case of smaller oligosaccharides. This limitation was overcome by applying selected ion current monitoring. Further, the capillary column also exhibited good reproducibility. We showed that the retention times obtained by using the monolithic capillary column could be converted into the standard data to enable comparison of the experimental data with the existing data. Furthermore, our studies revealed an important difference in the separation profile, i.e., the monolithic capillary column could resolve smaller oligosaccharides to a greater extent. 3afluorescence 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3amonitoring 3aoligosaccharides1 aKanie, Osamu0 tJournal of chromatography.g2009 May 1, v. 1216, no. 18 p.4121-4124dElsevierx0021-96737nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2009.03.0043Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02805naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100001800201245012600219300001600345520097600361650001801337650001601355650001901371650001401390650002601404650001801430650003301448650002201481650002001503650001901523650008101542650002601623650002901649650003601678650002101714650002801735650001401763650003501777650002701812650002901839651001001868651001001878653002501888700001701913700001701930773007901947852000902026856008802035930003302123945002502156946001102181990002302192655001202215IND4403251820221119204513.0080321e200803  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440325182DNAL7 a183085242pmid7 a10.1016/j.mycres.2007.11.0202doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Other management practices that impact carbon cycling in agricultural systems, such as irrigation, are much less understood. As part of a larger C sequestration project that focused on potential of C sequestration for standard and minimum tillage systems of irrigated crops, the effects of furrow irrigation on the field C and N loading were evaluated. Experiments were conducted on a laser-leveled 30ha grower's field in the Sacramento valley near Winters, CA. For the 2005 calendar year, water inflow and runoff was measured for all rainfall and irrigation events. Samples were analyzed for C and N associated with both sediment and dissolved fractions. Total C and N loads in the sediment were always higher in the incoming irrigation water than field runoff. Winter storms moved little sediment, but removed substantial amounts of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), or about one-third of the total C balance. Despite high DOC loads in runoff, the large volumes of applied irrigation water with sediment and DOC resulted in a net increase in total C for most irrigation events. The combined net C input and N loss to the field, as computed from the field water balance, was 30.8kgCha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ and 5.4kgNha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for the 2005 calendar year. It is concluded that transport of C and N by irrigation and runoff water should be considered when estimating the annual C field balance and sequestration potential of irrigated agro-ecosystems. 3aagroecosystems 3airrigation water 3asediment transport 3asoil water balance 3aanimal manures 3anitrogen 3areduced tillage 3acomposts 3aagricultural runoff 3afurrow irrigation 3acarbon sequestration 3asoil respiration 3aagricultural management 3arain 3adissolved organic carbon 3agrowing season 3apollution load 3aCalifornia 0acarbon 0abiogeochemical cycles1 aEvatt, K.J.1 aSix, J.1 aPoch, R.M.1 aRolston, D.E.1 aHopmans, J.W.0 tAgricultural water management.g2009 June, v. 96, no. 6 p.925-930dElsevierx0378-37747nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.agwat.2009.01.0013Available from publisher's Web site  a20090608b20090703c00000000  aINDdYLPe2009/06/08  aNon-US 7aarticle03486naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002300181245010900204300001800313500002400331506007600355520138400431506003701815650002501852650001301877650001601890650002001906650001401926650001801940650002101958650001701979650003101996650001002027650001902037650000902056650002602065650001202091650001802103650001602121650002002137650001902157650001102176650003702187650001402224650002502238650003102263650003502294650003002329650001102359650004402370650004502414700001402459700001402473700001302487700001702500700001502517700001602532700002002548700001502568773011602583852000902699856008002708655001202788IND4419260220221207082854.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926022DNAL7 a192735632pmid7 aPMC26817652pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01239-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCorcionivoschi, N.10aCampylobacter jejuni Cocultured with Epithelial Cells Reduces Surface Capsular Polysaccharide Expression  ap. 1959-1967.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aThe host cell environment can alter bacterial pathogenicity. We employed a combination of cellular and molecular techniques to study the expression of Campylobacter jejuni polysaccharides cocultured with HCT-8 epithelial cells. After two passages, the amount of membrane-bound high-molecular-weight polysaccharide was considerably reduced. Microarray profiling confirmed significant downregulation of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) locus genes. Experiments using conditioned media showed that sugar depletion occurred only when the bacterial and epithelial cells were cocultured. CPS depletion occurred when C. jejuni organisms were exposed to conditioned media from a different C. jejuni strain but not when exposed to conditioned media from other bacterial species. Proteinase K or heat treatment of conditioned media under coculture conditions abrogated the effect on the sugars, as did formaldehyde fixation and cycloheximide treatment of host cells or chloramphenicol treatment of the bacteria. However, sugar depletion was not affected in flagellar export (fliQ) and quorum-sensing (luxS) gene mutants. Passaged C. jejuni showed reduced invasiveness and increased serum sensitivity in vitro. C. jejuni alters its surface polysaccharides when cocultured with epithelial cells, suggesting the existence of a cross talk mechanism that modulates CPS expression during infection.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aCampylobacter jejuni 3abacteria 3ablood serum 3achloramphenicol 3acoculture 3acycloheximide 3aepithelial cells 3aformaldehyde 3agene expression regulation 3agenes 3aheat treatment 3aloci 3amicroarray technology 3amutants 3apathogenicity 3apeptidase K 3apolysaccharides 3aquorum sensing 3asugars 2aCampylobacter jejunixphysiology 2aCell Line 2aCoculture Techniques 2aCulture Media, Conditioned 2aEpithelial Cellsxmicrobiology 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aHumans 2aOligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis 2aPolysaccharides, Bacterialxbiosynthesis1 aClyne, M.1 aLyons, A.1 aElmi, A.1 aGundogdu, O.1 aWren, B.W.1 aDorrell, N.1 aKarlyshev, A.V.1 aBourke, B.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1959-1967dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01239-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03522naa a2200661 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092040001800111072001700129072001700146072001700163100002000180245017800200300001600378520156000394650001401954650001401968650001801982650002802000650002802028650001902056650001902075650001602094650002502110650001702135650001702152650001502169650002302184650000802207650001002215650001002225650000902235650003202244650001902276650003002295650003402325650004002359650002302399650001102422650003902433650001102472650001802483650000902501650001602510650004202526700001902568700002602587700002002613700002402633773011102657852000902768930003302777945002502810946001302835655001202848IND4403346520221119204447.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440334652DNAL7 a183563272pmid  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study evaluated the efficacy of daily consumption of a cocoa flavanol-containing dark chocolate bar with added PS on serum lipids, blood pressure, and other circulating cardiovascular health markers in a population with elevated serum cholesterol. We recruited 49 adults (32 women, 17 men) with serum total cholesterol concentrations of 5.20-7.28 mmol/L and blood pressure of <=159/99 mm Hg. Following a 2-wk lead-in utilizing the AHA style diet, participants were randomized into 2 groups and instructed to consume 2 cocoa flavanol-containing dark chocolate bars per day with (1.1 g sterol esters per bar) or without PS. Each 419-kJ bar was nutrient-matched and contained ~180 mg CF. Participants consumed 1 bar 2 times per day for 4 wk then switched to the other bar for an additional 4 wk. Serum lipids and other cardiovascular markers were measured at baseline and after 4 and 8 wk. Blood pressure was measured every 2 wk. Regular consumption of the PS-containing chocolate bar resulted in reductions of 2.0 and 5.3% in serum total and LDL cholesterol (P < 0.05), respectively. Consumption of CF also reduced systolic blood pressure at 8 wk (-5.8 mm Hg; P < 0.05). Results indicate that regular consumption of chocolate bars containing PS and CF as part of a low-fat diet may support cardiovascular health by lowering cholesterol and improving blood pressure. 3achocolate 3aflavanols 3asterol esters 3acardiovascular diseases 3acardioprotective effect 3arisk reduction 3ablood pressure 3acholesterol 3ahypercholesterolemia 3aphytosterols 3ablood lipids 3abiomarkers 3aexperimental diets 3amen 3awomen 2aAdult 2aAged 2aBlood Glucosexdrug effects 2aBlood Pressure 2aBody Weightxdrug effects 2aCacaoxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCardiovascular Diseasesxmetabolism 2aCross-Over Studies 2aFemale 2aFlavonolsxanalysisxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aLipidsxblood 2aMale 2aMiddle Aged 2aPhytosterolsxanalysisxpharmacology.1 aCarson, LeaAnn1 aKwik-Uribe, Catherine1 aEvans, Ellen M.1 aErdman, John W.

However, the local inbreeding level (a), which is determined by both an increase in the migration intensity and a decrease in the effective population size (N e), has remained practically unchanged. A change in the regional administrative structure has affected the genetic structure of populations. In the 1950s, raions (administrative districts) of Kursk and Voronezh oblasts (regions) were similar with respect differentiation parameters, whereas the oblasts considerably differed from each other.

In this study, the behavior and morphology of myosin solubilized in a low ionic strength solution containing l-histidine (l-His) was investigated. More than 80% of myosin was solubilized in a low ionic strength solution with dialysis against a solution containing 1mM KCl and 5mM l-His. Transmission electron microscopy with rotary shadowing demonstrated that the rod of myosin in a low ionic strength solution containing l-His is longer than that of myosin in a high ionic strength solution. The elongation of the myosin rod in a low ionic strength solution containing l-His would inhibit the formation of a filament, resulting in the solubilization of myosin. 3amuscle protein 3ameat protein 3asarcomeres 3amyosin 3aionic strength 3asolubilization 3ahistidine 3adialysis 3apotassium chloride 3atransmission electron microscopy 3apH 3asolutions1 aIto, T.1 aWakamatsu, J.1 aNishimura, T.1 aHattori, A.0 tMeat science.g2009 June, v. 82, no. 2 p.151-154dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.01.0023Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/19  aNon-US 7aarticle03033naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092072001700110072001700127100002000144245013600164300001600300520177200316650001702088650000902105650002502114650002202139650001802161650002002179650002502199650001602224650002002240651001202260700002102272700001902293700002602312700002902338700001902367700002202386773011102408852000902519930003302528945002502561946001302586655001202599IND4403347120221119204536.0080321e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440334712DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

  1 aTessier, Sophie10aRegular Users of Supermarkets in Greater Tunis Have a Slightly Improved Diet Quality. [Erratum: 2008 Aug., v. 138, no. 8, p. 1523.]  ap. 768-774.  aDespite the recent and rapid expansion of supermarkets in developing countries, their association with diet quality has been hardly studied. The study took place in Tunisia, where incidences of obesity and nutrition-related diseases are rising. The target population was households of the Greater Tunis area where supermarkets are mostly located. Households (n = 724) were selected by a 2-stage clustered random sampling. A purposely developed quantitative questionnaire assessed food retail habits. Socioeconomic data were collected at individual and household levels. The diet quality index-international (DQI-I) derived from a FFQ specific for Tunisia measured diet quality. Data analysis by regression or logistic regression models adjusted for energy intake and socioeconomic confounders when relevant. Overall, 60% of the households used supermarkets. Most households still used the nearby grocer; only 26% shopped at the market. Characteristics associated with supermarket use were urban milieu, small-sized households, greater educational attainment, higher economic level, steady income, or easy access. Associations between these variables and using supermarkets as a first shopping place (20% of households) were even stronger. After adjustment for energy intake and socioeconomic and access data, using supermarkets chosen as first food shopping place vs. other retail resulted in a slightly higher DQI-I (63.2 vs. 59.6; P = 0.0004). Despite the long-standing presence of supermarkets in Tunis, shopping at supermarkets has not yet spread to the whole population. Supermarkets do not yet markedly modify food consumption in the Greater Tunis. However, a slight improvement of diet quality can be observed among those people who use supermarkets regularly. 3asupermarkets 3adiet 3anutritional adequacy 3ahousehold surveys 3aenergy intake 3ahuman nutrition 3asocioeconomic status 3aurban areas 3afood purchasing 3aTunisia1 aTraissac, Pierre1 aMaire, Bernard1 aBricas, N.q(Nicolas)1 aEymard-Duvernay, Sabrina1 aEl Ati, Jalila1 aDelpeuch, Francis0 tJournal of nutrition.g2008 Apr., v. 138, no. 4 p.768-774dAmerican Society for Nutritionx0022-31667nnas  aDNAL  a20090206b20090301c00000000  aINDd3CTe2008/06/20  aOther US 7aarticle02572naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177100001700186245010600203300001600309500002400325500001500349520106500364650001901429650001801448650001301466650001901479650001501498650002001513650001601533650002401549650001601573650001901589650002201608650000901630650001401639650001201653650002001665653002401685700001501709700001601724700001701740700001801757773008801775852000901863856008901872930003301961945002501994946001102019655001202030IND4418288020221119204421.0090327e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441828802DNAL7 a204167722pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ502 0aX2001 aIndurain, G.14aThe relationship of carcass measurements to carcass composition and intramuscular fat in Spanish beef  ap. 155-161.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aForty beef carcasses were classified for conformation and fatness. Besides, carcass weight, fat thickness (FT), carcass dimension, marbling by computer image analysis and ultrasound readings was recorded to complement grading. For predicting intramuscular fat (IMF) content, FT, number of intramuscular flecks and conformation increased R ²-value from 0.19 to 0.64 compared to conformation alone. For visual marbling, ultrasound readings and thoracic depth (TD) increased the R ²-value from 0.24 to 0.57 compared to fatness score (FS). The best variables for predicting weight of fabricated subprimals were carcass weight or compactness which is a function of carcass weight (R ² between 0.94 and 0.63). Fatness score was poorer than FT for predicting yield of subprimals cuts from round (R ² =0.16 vs. 0.50) and ultrasound readings for less valuable subprimals (R ² =0.31 vs. 0.39). These results showed that other variables could be used in combination with carcass fatness or conformation to achieve a more accurate estimation of fat and carcass yield. 3abeef carcasses 3acarcass yield 3amarbling 3aimage analysis 3aprediction 3acarcass grading 3ameat grades 3adressing percentage 3aultrasonics 3acarcass weight 3acomputer analysis 3abeef 3alean meat 3abackfat 3aultrasonography 0acarcass composition1 aCarr, T.R.1 aGoñi, M.V.1 aInsausti, K.1 aBeriain, M.J.0 tMeat science.g2009 June, v. 82, no. 2 p.155-161dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.01.0053Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02622naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001800110245008200128300001600210500009300226500001500319520129700334650001501631650001501646650001501661650001501676650001001691650001201701650001701713650002101730650000901751650002301760650001601783650001901799650001301818650002201831650001001853651001401863651001701877653002001894653003401914700002001948700001601968773007801984852000902062930003302071945001302104946001102117655001202128IND2198482220221119204532.0990503e199807  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND219848222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Meagher, B.10aEvolution of drought policy and related science in Australia and South Africa  ap. 231-258.  aIn the special issue: Drought policy, assessment and declaration / edited by D.H. White.  a2019-12-05  aAustralia and South Africa are dominated by extensive agriculture, both countries being predominantly arid and exposed to a highly variable climate. Limiting land degradation, maintaining the financial viability of farms and improving the risk-management skills of farmers are common problems which government and industry in both countries are attempting to address. Both countries are currently refining their approaches to drought management, and have been making substantial use of science in improving the monitoring and assessment of drought, and the management of the land. Unlike the situation in Australia, however, South Africa's approach is being reviewed against the backdrop of a fundamental reorientation of broader agricultural policies in the context of that country's transition to a fully fledged democracy. The changing approach to drought policy in South Africa can therefore only be fully understood in the context of this broader process of change. This paper compares the climate and agriculture of Australia and South Africa, and how their different drought policies have evolved. Observations are made on the role of scientists in providing advice to political decision makers, and ways in which the process of decision making with respect to drought may be improved. 3aarid zones 3amonitoring 3arangelands 3airrigation 3afarms 3adrought 3awater stress 3aclimatic factors 3arain 3aseasonal variation 3aagriculture 3arisk reduction 3aland use 3aissues and policy 3acrops 3aAustralia 3aSouth Africa 0aland management 0agovernment and administration1 aDu Pisani, L.G.1 aWhite, D.H.0 tAgricultural systems.g1998 July, v. 57, no. 3 p.231-258x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL  a19990531b19990608c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle01659naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002200145245009700167300001600264520068900280653001400969653001100983653002200994653001801016700002701034700002201061700002301083773014601106852000901252856008501261946001101346655001201357IND4440723220221119204551.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444072322DNAL7 a10.1007/s10064-010-0293-z2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKasperski, Johan 10aEvolution of the Sedrun landslide (Graubünden, Switzerland) with ortho-rectified air images  ap. 421-430.  aThe slope movement at Sedrun (Switzerland) has been studied with ortho-rectified images. Displacement maps compiled for two periods (1973-1990 and 1990-2003), based on a correlation of the aerial images indicate maximum average slope movements of 60 cm/year, similar to those obtained by traditional photogrammetry over the period 1973-1990. The limits of the most active zones determined by image correlation correspond to those obtained by fieldwork. Comparison of the two displacement maps shows an acceleration of the instability of 150% since 1990. This paper demonstrates the value of using more than one technique to help understand the evolution of this long-term instability. 0aLandslide 0aSedrun 0aImage correlation 0aAerial images1 aDelacourt, Christophe 1 aAllemand, Pascal 1 aPothérat, Pierre 0 tBulletin of engineering geology and the environment.g2010 Aug., v. 69, no. 3 p.421-430dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1435-95297nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10064-010-0293-z3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01777naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001700145245011800162300001600280500001500296520077200311653002001083653001001103653001501113653001501128700001801143700001801161773014601179852000901325856008501334930003301419946001101452655001201463IND4440722720221119204547.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444072272DNAL7 a10.1007/s10064-010-0267-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGong, Manfu 10aEngineering geological problems related to high geo-stresses at the Jinping I Hydropower Station, Southwest China  ap. 373-380.  a2019-12-11  aThe Jinping I Hydropower Station will generate some 3,600 MW. The site of the 305 m high arch dam is in a steep, 1,500-2,500 m deep valley on the Yalong River in Sichuan Province, South West China. The present geo-stresses in the marble bedrock are up to 40 MPa. Relaxation due to river incision has resulted in fractures opening up to 350 m from the rock face. The geo-stresses in the rock mass are significantly affected by the topography. A concentration of stress has developed at the foot of the slope and in the valley floor; it was estimated there would be 132 mm of relaxation/heave of the formation level.

The animals were kept in standard and uniform environmental conditions and fed the same ad libitum pellet feed. Data on live weight and feed intake were recorded. At the end of the fattening period 10 animals per group were slaughtered and data provided in the World Rabbit Science Association (WRSA) standard method were collected, as well as pH and meat colour. Animals reared in ground pens showed lower productive performances, while, as to slaughtering performances, rabbits reared in cages showed the highest slaughtering weight and also the highest weights for most body parts. Gender slightly affected productive and slaughtering performances: females showed higher feed consumption and higher perirenal fat weight than males. Meat colour parameters showed significant differences in Longissimus lumborum and Biceps femoris due to housing systems and gender effects. In both muscle, rearing system affected pH only 24h after slaughter. 3arabbits 3acarcass yield 3amarbling 3arearing 3afeed conversion 3adressing percentage 3aslaughter weight 3acarcass weight 3arabbit breeds 3aliveweight gain 3agender differences 3apH 3acolor 3afinishing 3arabbit meat 3aad libitum feeding 3alean meat 3abackfat 0agender 0apens 0ameat quality1 aBiagini, Davide1 aLussiana, Carola0 tMeat science.g2009 June, v. 82, no. 2 p.200-204dElsevier Sciencex0309-17407nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.01.0113Available from publisher's Web site  a20090619b20090703c00000000  aINDdPNNe2009/06/19  aNon-US 7aarticle02846naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245010300175300001600278500002400294520173800318650001602056650002302072650001502095650000902110650001402119650001202133650001402145650002102159650001102180650002902191650001002220700002602230700001602256700002202272773010202294852000902396856005502405655001202460IND4444460120221119204443.0101029e201012  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444446012DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00369.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHunsicker, Mary E.14aThe contribution of cephalopods to global marine fisheries: can we have our squid and eat them too  ap. 421-438.  aIncludes references  aCephalopods are a key component of marine food webs, providing sustenance for myriad marine species. Cephalopods are also of increasing economic importance as evidenced by the rapid rise in their global landings over recent decades. If fisheries continue on this trajectory, conflicts may transpire among cephalopod and finfish fisheries, particularly in ecosystems where cephalopods are highly valuable both directly as a landed commodity and indirectly as prey for other harvested species. We provide the first measure of the ecosystem services that cephalopods contribute to fisheries in 28 marine ecosystems, both as a commodity and an ecological support service. We also evaluate how current demands on cephalopods compare to mid‐20th century conditions. We find that cephalopod contributions to fisheries vary widely, but are substantial in many ecosystems. Commodity and supportive services provided by cephalopods contributed as much as 55% of fishery landings (tonnes) and 70% of landed values ($USD). The contribution of cephalopods as a commodity was generally greatest in the coastal ecosystems, whereas their contribution as a supportive service was highest in open ocean systems. Further, the commodity and supportive services provided by cephalopods to fisheries landings increased in most of the coastal ecosystems between the mid‐20th century (years 1960-70) and contemporary periods (years 1990-2004), indicating the rising demand for cephalopods. Current demands have no historical precedent and ecosystems in which cephalopods are highly exploited as a targeted resource and as an ecological support service should be further evaluated to prevent the unsustainable development of marine fisheries within them. 3aCephalopoda 3aecosystem services 3aecosystems 3afish 3afood webs 3ahistory 3aingestion 3amarine fisheries 3aoceans 3aproducts and commodities 3asquid1 aEssington, Timothy E.1 aWatson, Reg1 aSumaila, Ussif R.0 tFish and fisheries.g2010 Dec., v. 11, no. 4 p.421-438dBlackwell Publishing Ltdx1467-29607nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2010.00369.x 7aarticle02284naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245015600166300001600322520091000338650001201248650001801260650002001278650001501298650001201313650001601325650001001341650001601351650001601367650000901383653002201392653002601414653002201440700002101462700002401483700002001507700002101527700002001548773013201568852000901700856008501709930003301794946001101827655001201838IND4440728120221119204254.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444072812DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-009-0348-22doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSchwarm, Angela 10aFunction, size and form of the gastrointestinal tract of the collared Pecari tajacu (Linnaeus 1758) and white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari (Link 1795)  ap. 569-576.  aThe peccary digestive tract is characterised by an elaborate forestomach. In order to further characterise the digestive function of peccaries, we report body mass, digestive organ mass, content mass of the gastrointestinal tract compartments and their length and width, as well as liver, parotis and mandibular gland mass. Our data on eleven collared and four white-lipped peccaries suggest that peccaries have a small relative stomach volume compared to other foregut fermenters, which implies a comparatively lower fermentative capacity and thus forage digestibility. The forestomach could enable peccaries to deal, in conjunction with their large parotis glands, with certain plant toxins (e.g. oxalic acid). The finding of sand being trapped in the forestomach blindsacs could indicate a disadvantage of the peccary forestomach design. The relevance of the forestomach to peccaries remains enigmatic. 3aTayassu 3adigestibility 3adigestive tract 3afermenters 3aforegut 3aforestomach 3aliver 3aoxalic acid 3aphytotoxins 3asand 0aDigestive anatomy 0aDigestive morphometry 0aForegut fermenter1 aOrtmann, Sylvia 1 aRietschel, Wolfram 1 aKühne, Ragnar 1 aWibbelt, Gudrun 1 aClauss, Marcus 0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2010 Aug., v. 56, no. 4 p.569-576dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-009-0348-23Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01774naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001400145245011800159300001600277520058100293650001700874650001600891650001700907650001500924650001300939650003300952650001400985650001800999650001601017653002601033653003501059700002201094700002001116773011401136852000901250856008501259930003301344946001101377655001201388IND4440730020221119204227.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444073002DNAL7 a10.1007/s11557-009-0641-12doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCai, Lei 10aMorphological and molecular characterization of Mariannaea aquaticola sp. nov. collected from freshwater habitats  ap. 337-343.  aMariannaea aquaticola sp. nov. is described, illustrated, and compared with closely related taxa.

Anaplasma phagocytophilum is an intragranulocytic bacterium that utilizes sialyl Lewis x (sLex)-modified P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 as a receptor for infecting myeloid cells. Bacterial populations that do not rely on this receptor can be obtained through cultivation in sLex-defective cell lines. A. phagocytophilum major surface protein 2 [Msp2(P44)] is encoded by members of a paralogous gene family and is speculated to play roles in host adaptation. We assessed the complement of Msp2(P44) paralogs expressed by A. phagocytophilum during infection of sLex-competent HL-60 cells and two HL-60 cell lines defective for sLex expression. Multiple Msp2(P44) and N-terminally truncated 25- to 27-kDa isoforms having various isoelectric points and electrophoretic mobilities were expressed in each cell line. The complement of expressed msp2(p44) paralogs and the glycosyl residues modifying Msp2(P44) varied considerably among bacterial populations recovered from sLex-competent and -deficient host cells. Thus, loss of host cell sLex expression coincided with both differential expression and glycosylation of A. phagocytophilum Msp2(P44). This reinforces the hypothesis that this bacterium is able to generate a large variety of surface-exposed molecules that could provide great antigenic diversity and result in multiple binding properties.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3acomplement 3ahumoral immunity 3aglycosylation 3agene expression regulation 3abinding properties 3aisoelectric point 3apathogens 3agenes 3aoligosaccharides 3asurface proteins 3aelectrophoresis 3aAnaplasma phagocytophilum 3aglycoproteins 3abacteria 2aAnaplasma phagocytophilumxchemistryxphysiology. 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxbiosynthesisxisolation & purification. 2aCell Line 2aElectrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional 2aGene Expression Profiling 2aGlycosylation 2aHumans 2aNeutrophilsxmicrobiology 2aOligosaccharidesxdeficiency 2aProteomexanalysis 0apost-translational modification1 aSarkar, Madhubanti1 aGalloway, Nathan L.1 aThomas, Rachael J.1 aKearns, Sarah A.1 aReneer, Dexter V.1 aYang, Tian1 aCarlyon, Jason A.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1746-1756dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01530-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02872naa a2200409 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002000145245011800165300001600283520158200299650002301881650002201904650001301926650002601939650001301965650002201978650001202000650001602012650001302028650001302041653001902054653002402073653001802097653002302115700002102138700002102159773013202180852000902312856008502321930003302406946001102439655001202450IND4440729620221119204244.0100730e201008  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444072962DNAL7 a10.1007/s10344-010-0390-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBurlet, Pierre 10aEfficient age determination: how freezing affects eye lens weight of the small rodent species Arvicola terrestris  ap. 685-688.  aAge determination of animals by measuring the weight of their eye lenses is a widely used method in wildlife biology. In general, it is recommended to prepare lenses immediately after trapping to avoid errors in the age estimation due to decomposition of lens tissue. However, in many field studies, large numbers of animals need to be trapped over long periods of time in huge areas and by many different field workers. Therefore, the immediate preparation of eye lenses imposes a considerable logistic constraint that could be avoided by prior freezing of trapped animals. To assess the impact of freezing, weights of lens of frozen and unfrozen eyes of 114 Arvicola terrestris were compared pair wise. The frozen lenses weighed at average 3.3% (95% CI: 2.4-4.1%) more than the unfrozen ones from the same animals. Freezing time, weight of lenses and mean temperature of the trapping day as an indicator of decomposition speed did not affect the freezing-induced weight increase. Age estimates based on weights of unfrozen lenses varied between 24 and 445 days. Estimates based on frozen lenses were systematically higher. Applying a constant correction factor of 1.033⁻¹ for the weight of frozen lenses corrects this overestimation of age. We conclude that age determination with frozen lenses of small rodents can yield valid age estimates if a correction factor for freezing is applied. Thus, age determination can be organised much more efficiently in field studies, which is highly advantageous for many ecological, agricultural and epidemiological research projects. 3aArvicola amphibius 3aage determination 3aeye lens 3afield experimentation 3afreezing 3aresearch projects 3arodents 3atemperature 3atrapping 3awildlife 0aAge estimation 0aArvicola terrestris 0aEye lens mass 0aPopulation dynamic1 aDeplazes, Peter 1 aHegglin, Daniel 0 tEuropean journal of wildlife research.g2010 Aug., v. 56, no. 4 p.685-688dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx1612-46427nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10344-010-0390-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01873naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002300143245008200166300001800248520086300266650000901129650001301138650001701151650001001168650001201178650000901190650001101199650001401210651001001224700002401234773012701258852000901385856008301394930003301477946001301510655001201523IND4403357820221119204331.0080321e20080321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440335782DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11541972doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRichmond, Brian G.10aOrrorin tugenensis Femoral Morphology and the Evolution of Hominin Bipedalism  ap. 1662-1665.  aBipedalism is a key human adaptation and a defining feature of the hominin clade.

We show that the O. tugenensis femur differs from those of apes and Homo and most strongly resembles those of Australopithecus and Paranthropus, indicating that O. tugenensis was bipedal but is not more closely related to Homo than to AUSTRALOPITHECUS: Femoral morphology indicates that O. tugenensis shared distinctive hip biomechanics with australopiths, suggesting that this complex evolved early in human evolution and persisted for almost 4 million years until modifications of the hip appeared in the late Pliocene in early HOMO: 3aHomo 3aPongidae 3abiomechanics 3afemur 3afossils 3ahips 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3aKenya1 aJungers, William L.0 tScience.g2008 Mar. 21, v. 319, no. 5870 p.1662-1665dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11541973Available from publisher's Web site  a20080321b20080404c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03779naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001800181245012100199300001800320500002400338506007600362520197900438506003702417650002902454650001302483650001702496650001502513650001502528650002002543650001102563650002002574650002102594650002102615650001902636650002202655650001802677650002402695650001602719650001202735650000902747650001702756650001402773650003202787650002202819650001302841650001102854700002102865700001902886700002202905700002302927700002202950773011602972852000903088856008003097655001203177IND4419258320221207093326.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441925832DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.00086-092doi7 aPMC26817372pmcid7 a192735612pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHuang, Haibin10aDistinct Patterns of Dendritic Cell Cytokine Release Stimulated by Fungal β-Glucans and Toll-Like Receptor Agonists  ap. 1774-1781.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aβ-Glucans derived from fungal cell walls have potential uses as immunomodulating agents and vaccine adjuvants. Yeast glucan particles (YGPs) are highly purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell walls composed of β1,6-branched β1,3-D-glucan and free of mannans. YGPs stimulated secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in wild-type murine bone marrow-derived myeloid dendritic cells (BMDCs) but did not stimulate interleukin-12p70 (IL-12p70) production. A purified soluble β1,6-branched β1,3-D-glucan, scleroglucan, also stimulated TNF-α in BMDCs. These two β-glucans failed to stimulate TNF-α in Dectin-1 (β-glucan receptor) knockout BMDCs. Costimulation of wild-type BMDCs with β-glucans and specific Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands resulted in greatly enhanced TNF-α production but decreased IL-12p70 production compared with TLR agonists alone. The upregulation of TNF-α and downregulation of IL-12p70 required Dectin-1, but not IL-10. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) priming did not overcome IL-12p70 reduction by β-glucans. Similar patterns of cytokine regulation were observed in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) costimulated with YGPs and the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide. Finally, costimulation of BMDCs with YGPs and either the TLR9 ligand, CpG, or the TLR2/1 ligand, Pam₃CSK₄, resulted in upregulated secretion of IL-1α and IL-10 and downregulated secretion of IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 but had no significant effects on IL-12p40, keratinocyte-derived chemokine, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, or macrophage inflammatory protein α, compared with the TLR ligand alone. Thus, β-glucans have distinct effects on cytokine responses following DC stimulation with different TLR agonists. These patterns of response might contribute to the skewing of immune responses during mycotic infections and have implications for the design of immunomodulators and vaccines containing β-glucans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aagonists 3abeta-glucans 3acell walls 3achemokines 3adendritic cells 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunomodulators 3ainterferon-gamma 3ainterleukin-10 3ainterleukin-1beta 3ainterleukin-6 3alipopolysaccharides 3amacrophages 3amannans 3amice 3ascleroglucan 3asecretion 3atumor necrosis factor-alpha 3avaccine adjuvants 3avaccines 3ayeasts1 aOstroff, Gary R.1 aLee, Chrono K.1 aWang, Jennifer P.1 aSpecht, Charles A.1 aLevitz, Stuart M.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1774-1781dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00086-093Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01965naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002300110245007900133300001600212520118400228650001001412650000901422650001001431650001101441653001601452653001101468700001901479700002101498773008901519852000901608939003301617946001301650655001201663IND8902006320221119204536.0890403e198903  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890200632DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aGallavan, R.H. Jr.10aForage intake and performance of yearling lambs fed harvested wheat forage  ap. 643-648.  aThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of yearling lambs (28 +/- 1 kg; n=10) fed harvested wheat forage during a typical grazing period (November 1985 to January 1986). Although green forage intake averaged 8.5% of body weight (2.8 kg/hd/d) during the trial, average daily gain (ADG) was only 57 +/- 9 g/hd/d. This apparently was due to the low dry matter (DM) content (less than 24%) of the wheat forage during the first five weeks of the trial, as the estimated ADG during this period was only 17 g/hd/d. During weeks 6 and 7, the DM content and estimated ADG increased to 33% and 160 g/hd/d, respectively. There was no significant difference between the observed ADG for the trial (57 +/- 9 g/hd/d) and the mean of the weekly estimated ADG (56 +/- 4 g/hd/d). A regression analysis of the relationship between estimated ADG and DM content indicated that a DM content of 17% was required for maintenance (ADG=0.009 DM-15; r=0.80, p less than .001). The data suggests that rumen capacity limits the performance of sheep consuming wheat forage and that DM intake must be increased during the early grazing period if acceptable levels of gain are to be achieved. 3alambs 3adiet 3awheat 3aforage 0aperformance 0aintake1 aPhillips, W.A.1 aVonTungeln, D.L.0 tNutrition reports international.g1989 Mar., v. 39, no. 3 p.643-648x0029-66357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03730naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002100181245014500202300001800347500002400365506007600389520150000465506003701965650001802002650002302020650001402043650002002057650001102077650002002088650001702108650002002125650001202145650000902157650001402166650002302180650002502203650003102228650001202259650003302271650002802304650004302332650001402375650001102389650002002400650001102420650002802431650003302459650003402492650004402526650000902570650002402579650004602603650004602649650001502695650002802710700002302738700002502761700001902786700002202805773011602827852000902943856008002952655001203032IND4419258420221207093243.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441925842DNAL7 a192234762pmid7 aPMC26817462pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01226-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYoshida, Shigeto12aA Baculovirus Dual Expression System-Based Malaria Vaccine Induces Strong Protection against Plasmodium berghei Sporozoite Challenge in Mice  ap. 1782-1789.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aWe have previously shown that a recombinant baculovirus that displays Plasmodium berghei circumsporozoite protein (PbCSP), a homolog of the leading human malaria vaccine candidate, on the viral envelope protected 60% of mice against P. berghei infection. Here, we describe a second-generation baculovirus vaccine based on the "baculovirus dual expression system," which drives PbCSP expression by a dual promoter that consists of tandemly arranged baculovirus-derived polyhedrin and mammal-derived cytomegalovirus promoters. The baculovirus-based PbCSP vaccine not only displayed PbCSP on the viral envelope but also expressed PbCSP upon transduction of mammalian cells. Immunization with the baculovirus-based PbCSP vaccine elicited high PbCSP-specific antibody titers (predominantly immunoglobulin G1 [IgG1] and IgG2a) and PbCSP-specific CD8⁺ T-cell responses without extraneous immunological adjuvants in mice, indicating that there was induction of both Th1 and Th2 responses (a mixed Th1/Th2 response). Importantly, upon intramuscular inoculation, the baculovirus-based PbCSP vaccine conferred complete protection against sporozoite challenge. Thus, the baculovirus-based PbCSP vaccine induced strong protective immune responses against preerythrocytic parasites. These results introduce a novel concept for the baculovirus dual expression system that functions as both a subunit vaccine and a DNA vaccine and offer a promising new alternative to current human vaccine delivery platforms.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBaculoviridae 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aadjuvants 3agenetic vectors 3ahumans 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3aimmunoglobulins 3amalaria 3amice 3aparasites 3aprotozoan vaccines 3arecombinant vaccines 2aAdministration, Intranasal 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Protozoanxblood 2aBaculoviridaexgenetics 2aCD8-Positive T-Lymphocytesximmunology 2aCell Line 2aFemale 2aGenetic Vectors 2aHumans 2aImmunoglobulin Gxblood 2aInterferon-gammaxsecretion. 2aMalariaxprevention & control 2aMalaria Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPlasmodium bergheixgeneticsximmunology. 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aSpodoptera 2aSporozoitesximmunology1 aKawasaki, Masanori1 aHariguchi, Norimitsu1 aHirota, Kuniko1 aMatsumoto, Makoto0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1782-1789dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01226-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01629naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002600143245007200169300001800241520050900259650001400768650001300782650001000795650000900805700002100814700002200835700002400857700002700881700001800908700002400926700002100950700001900971773012700990852000901117856008301126930003301209946001301242655001201255IND4403357320221119204648.0080321e20080321xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440335732DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11516392doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLorenz, Ralph,d1969-10aTitan's Rotation Reveals an Internal Ocean and Changing Zonal Winds  ap. 1649-1651.  aCassini radar observations of Saturn's moon Titan over several years show that its rotational period is changing and is different from its orbital period.

One, represented by Suaeda taxifolia, has mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells distributed around the leaf periphery. The second, represented by Suaeda eltonica, has M and BS surrounding vascular bundles in the central plane. In both, structural and biochemical development of C₄ occurs basipetally, as observed by analysis of the maturation gradient on longitudinal leaf sections. This progression in development was also observed in mid-sections of young, intermediate, and mature leaves in both species, with three clear stages: (i) monomorphic chloroplasts in the two cell types in younger tissue with immunolocalization and in situ hybridization showing ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) preferentially localized in BS chloroplasts, and increasing in parallel with the establishment of Kranz anatomy; (ii) vacuolization and selective organelle positioning in BS cells, with occurrence of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and immunolocalization showing that it is preferentially in M cells; (iii) establishment of chloroplast dimorphism and mitochondrial differentiation in mature tissue and full expression of C₄ biochemistry including pyruvate, Pi dikinase (PPDK) and NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME). Accumulation of rbcL mRNA preceded its peptide expression, occurring prior to organelle positioning and differentiation. During development there was sequential expression and increase in levels of Rubisco and PEPC followed by NAD-ME and PPDK, and an increase in the ¹³C/¹²C isotope composition of leaves to values characteristic of C₄ photosynthesis. The findings indicate that these two forms of NAD-ME type C₄ photosynthesis evolved in parallel within the subfamily with similar ontogenetic programmes. 3aSuaeda 3achloroplasts 3adimorphism 3ain situ hybridization 3aisotopes 3aleaves 3amessenger RNA 3aphosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 3aphotosynthesis 3aribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase 3avascular bundles 3avascular tissues1 aVoznesenskaya, Elena V.1 aBerry, James O.1 aChuong, Simon D.X.1 aFranceschi, Vincent R.1 aEdwards, Gerald E.0 tJournal of experimental botany.g2011 May, v. 62, no. 9 p.3197-3212dOxford University Pressx0022-09577nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jxb/err0213Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03409naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100003100181245012800212300001800340500002400358506007600382520114800458506003701606650002301643650002201666650001301688650001401701650002001715650002001735650001701755650001201772650000901784650001301793650001901806650001301825650002301838650002501861650001601886650001201902650004101914650003301955650003101988650003202019650001402051650002002065650002602085650001102111650004402122650000902166650002402175650001602199650004602215650004502261650004002306650004602346650004702392700002502439700002202464700002002486773011602506852000902622856008002631655001202711IND4419258620221207082312.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441925862DNAL7 a192375302pmid7 aPMC26817662pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.00470-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSilva-Flannery, Luciana M.10aPolymeric Linear Peptide Chimeric Vaccine-Induced Antimalaria Immunity Is Associated with Enhanced In Vitro Antigen Loading  ap. 1798-1806.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aImmunization of mice with Plasmodium berghei or Plasmodium yoelii synthetic linear peptide chimeras (LPCs) based on the circumsporozoite protein protects against experimental challenge with viable sporozoites. The immunogenicity of LPCs is significantly enhanced by spontaneous polymerization. To better understand the antigenic properties of polymeric antimalarial peptides, we studied the immune responses elicited in mice immunized with a polymer or a monomer of a linear peptide construct specific for P. yoelii and compared the responses of antigen-presenting cells following incubation with both peptide species. Efficient uptake of the polymeric peptide in vitro resulted in higher expression of the coactivation markers CD80, CD40, and CD70 on dendritic cells and higher proinflammatory cytokine production than with the monomeric peptide. Macropinocytosis seems to be the main route used by polymeric peptides internalized by antigen-presenting cells. Spontaneous polymerization of synthetic antimalarial-peptide constructs to target professional antigen-presenting cells shows promise for simple delivery of subunit malaria vaccines.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aPlasmodium berghei 3aPlasmodium yoelii 3aantigens 3achimerism 3adendritic cells 3aimmune response 3aimmunization 3amalaria 3amice 3apeptides 3apolymerization 3apolymers 3aprotozoan vaccines 3arecombinant vaccines 3asporozoites 2aAnimals 2aAntigen-Presenting Cellsximmunology 2aCD40 Antigensxbiosynthesis. 2aCD27 Ligandxbiosynthesis. 2aB7-1 Antigenxbiosynthesis. 2aCell Line 2aCells, Cultured 2aCytokinesxsecretion. 2aFemale 2aMalaria Vaccinesxgeneticsximmunology. 2aMice 2aMice, Inbred BALB C 2aPinocytosis 2aPlasmodium bergheixgeneticsximmunology. 2aPlasmodium yoeliixgeneticsximmunology. 2aProtein Multimerizationximmunology 2aProtozoan Proteinsxgeneticsximmunology. 2aVaccines, Syntheticxgeneticsximmunology.1 aCabrera-Mora, Monica1 aDickherber, Megan1 aMoreno, Alberto0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1798-1806dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00470-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01587naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100002100110245008300131300001400214520085000228650002301078650001401101650001401115650001301129650000901142653001601151773008701167852000901254939003301263946001301296655001201309IND8902932220221119204649.0890607e198901  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND890293222DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCerklewski, F.L.10aInfluence of maternal chloride intake on fluoride utilization by rat offspring  ap. 43-50.  aA factorial experiment was conducted with pregnant rats, fed a purified diet throughout gestation and the first 15 days of lactation, to determine the influence of dietary chloride (0.70 or 1.35 g/kg as NaC1) on fluoride utilization (2 or 10 mg/kg as NaF) by offspring. The 5-fold difference in maternal fluoride intake significantly increased fluoride concentration of maternal and offspring femur and offspring 1st and 2nd molar teeth. Although maternal femur fluoride was unaffected by the level of dietary chloride, offspring fluoride content of femur, 1st molar and 2nd molar in the low chloride group was significantly greater than the normal chloride group for either dietary fluoride level by 32, 100 and 50-60% respectively. Offspring fluoride utilization can therefore be enhanced by reducing the chloride content of the maternal diet. 3amaternal nutrition 3achlorides 3afluorides 3aneonates 3arats 0autilization0 tNutrition reports international.g1989 Jan., v. 39, no. 1 p.43-50x0029-66357nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02385naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166100002100175245010300196300001400299500002400313500001500337520093700352650001701289650001701306650001501323650002401338650002201362650002101384650001201405651001201417653001601429653001601445653001501461700002001476700002101496700002701517700002401544700003401568700001801602773009301620852000901713856008801722930003301810945002501843946001101868655001201879IND4418295320221119204441.0090327e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441829532DNAL7 a10.1016/j.apsoil.2009.01.0052doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aH000 0aJ100 0aF3001 aEisenhauer, Nico10aNo interactive effects of pesticides and plant diversity on soil microbial biomass and respiration  ap. 31-36.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aNon-target effects of pesticides are widespread and potentially modify essential ecosystem processes. Since microorganisms are major soil decomposers driving key processes such as organic matter decomposition, nutrient cycling and, thereby, plant productivity, effects of pesticides on soil microorganisms need to be considered. In the context of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning debate, the question arises if pesticide effects are modulated by the diversity of the plant community. We applied pesticides (dimethoate, chlorpyrifos and fosthiazate) to plots of the Jena Experiment field site differing in plant diversity, and measured basal respiration, biomass and specific respiration of soil microorganisms. Pesticide applications either increased (chlorpyrifos and fosthiazate) or decreased (dimethoate) soil microbial parameters, but the effects neither varied with plant species nor with plant functional group richness. 3asoil ecology 3achlorpyrifos 3adimethoate 3asoil microorganisms 3aspecies diversity 3asoil respiration 3abiomass 3aGermany 0anematicides 0afosthiazate 0apesticides1 aKlier, Matthias1 aPartsch, Stephan1 aSabais, Alexander C.W.1 aScherber, Christoph1 aWeisser, W.

The level of antimicrobial resistance continues to increase and the requirement for a novel and possibly dramatic change in therapy choices is required. One possible mechanism for overcoming resistance is the actual removal of antimicrobial treatment from the therapeutic armoury. This review examines the potential for success of a policy advocating the reduction of antimicrobial use and additionally the withdrawal of such treatments. Evidence from agriculture suggests that the removal of certain drugs from animal husbandry can result in concomitant falls in certain drug resistances in human patients. 3adrug resistance 3ainfectious diseases 0atreatment1 aKelly, Alison F.1 aGould, Simon W.J.1 aCassar, Claire A.1 aFielder, Mark D.0 tFEMS immunology and medical microbiology.g2008 Aug., v. 53, no. 3 p.300-305dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0928-82447nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2008.00429.x3Available from publisher's Web site  aNon-US 7aarticle01510naa a2200265 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245003400165300001300199520063700212650000900849650001500858700002300873773012700896852000901023856008301032856007101115930003301186946001301219655001201232IND4392497120221119204609.0070617e20070615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439249712DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11394152doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBrown, Michael E.14aThe Mass of Dwarf Planet Eris  ap. 1585.  aThe discovery of dwarf planet Eris was followed shortly by the discovery of its satellite, Dysnomia, but the satellite orbit, and thus the system mass, was not known.

We cloned a pea Ran gene (PsRan1) and characterized its expression in tissues, and under different light sources. PsRan1 is a member of a highly homologous multigene family, and it encodes a protein containing plant-specific amino acids in its sequence. It is ubiquitously expressed in pea tissues with high expression in radicles. The amount of total mRNA transcripts representing multiple Ran family members increased in response to very low-fluence R, while the amount of mRNA transcript encoding PsRan1 specifically was not affected by various light treatments. In addition, Ran genes in Arabidopsis were also differentially expressed in various mutants defective in phytochromes or the light-responding HY5 protein, such as phyA, phyB, and hy5. AtRan1 and AtRan3 gene expression was significantly reduced in the phyA mutant background compared to that in Ler-0 wild type plants. AtRan1 expression was also decreased in the phyB background. In contrast, the expression of AtRan2 did not vary in the hy5 and phytochrome mutant backgrounds examined. Interestingly, expression of AtRan1 was significantly reduced in hy5 plants, while AtRan3 expression was increased in the same plants. From these results, we conclude that Ran gene expression is differentially regulated by various light sources and phytochrome-mediated signaling pathways. 3aArabidopsis 3aG-proteins 3aamino acid sequences 3agene expression 3agene expression regulation 3amessenger RNA 3amultigene family 3amutants 3apeas 3aphytochrome 3asignal transduction 3atissues 2aAmino Acid Sequence 2aArabidopsis Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBasic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBlotting, Northern 2aGene Expression Regulation, Plantxradiation effects 2aLight 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMutation 2aNuclear Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPeasxgeneticsxmetabolismxradiation effects. 2aPhylogeny 2aPhytochromexgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhytochrome Axgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPhytochrome Bxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aReverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction 2aSequence Homology, Amino Acid 2aran GTP-Binding Proteinxclassificationxgenetics. 0aDifferential gene expression 0ahy5 0aLight-regulated gene expression 0aRan GTP-binding protein 0aR/FR reversibility1 aKim, Min-Hee 1 aKim, Seong-Ki 1 aKim, Soo-Hwan 0 tPlanta.g2008 June, v. 228, no. 1 p.215-224dBerlin/Heidelberg : Springer-Verlagx0032-09357nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-008-0745-x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080523b20080606c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle02965naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100002400128245008700152300001600239520144800255650002501703650002001728650001701748650002001765650002301785650001201808650001201820650001301832650001901845650001701864650001001881650001201891650003001903650003201933650004001965650003502005650001102040650002002051650002002071650001102091650001902102650000902121650002602130650002302156650001002179700001602189700001502205773015002220852000902370939003302379946001102412655001202423IND9203642220221119204241.0920610e199107  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920364222DNAL7 a17740192pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLeblanc, J.q(Jean)10aThermogenic and hormonal responses to palatable protein and carbohydrate rich food  ap. 336-340.  aSimultaneous variations of oxygen consumption, and plasma insulin and norepinephrine were measured during the postprandial cephalic and gastrointestinal phases of feeding in six human subjects following the ingestion of various nutrients. On alternative days the subjects were given foods (1280 kjoules) either rich in carbohydrates (sugar pie) or in proteins (fish). Both nutrients produced an initial (0-40 min) enhanced thermogenesis and an early (2 min) cephalic insulin release. During that period, elevations of plasma norepinephrine were also observed with pie feeding at 10 and 30 min and at 10 min with fish. Palatability ratings indicated that both food items were equally tasting. During the gastrointestinal phase (40 to 120 min) the variations of these same parameters including glucagon seem to be explained by the content in carbohydrates and proteins in the food rather than by its palatability. Indeed during that period the protein meal was more thermogenic and the carbohydrate meal induced the expected insulin secretion. These results suggest that the palatability of the food is responsible for the early cephalic increase in postprandial thermogenesis, and for the insulin and norepinephrine release. During the subsequent gastrointestinal phase the increased thermogenesis is related to the composition of the food which exerts its action by the biochemical processes involved in the disposal of the absorbed nutrients. 3adietary carbohydrate 3adietary protein 3apalatability 3aheat production 3aoxygen consumption 3ainsulin 3aglucose 3aglucagon 3anorepinephrine 3ablood plasma 2aAdult 2aAnimals 2aBlood Glucosexmetabolism 2aBody Temperature Regulation 2aDietary Carbohydratesxpharmacology 2aDietary Proteinsxpharmacology 2aFishes 2aGlucagonxblood 2aHormonesxblood 2aHumans 2aInsulinxblood 2aMale 2aNorepinephrinexblood 2aOxygen Consumption 2aTaste1 aDiamond, P.1 aNadeau, A.0 tHormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme.g1991 July, v. 23, no. 7 p.336-340x0018-50437nnas  aDNAL  a00000000b19931102c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03462naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001800152245013400170300001600304500001500320520170900335650001702044650001002061650001002071650001802081650002402099650001502123650001502138650001402153650002302167650001002190650003302200650002202233650002302255650001102278650001602289650002502305650002102330650001802351650001202369650001202381650001402393650001602407651001602423653002402439653001802463653003702481653001802518700001902536700001902555700002302574773011802597852000902715856009202724930003302816946001102849655001202860IND4407929320221119204310.0080718e200808  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440792932DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01000.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aYANG, SHIYONG10aEffects of host-plant shift on immune and other key life-history traits of an eruptive Geometrid, Epirrita autumnata (Borkhausen)  ap. 510-516.  a2019-12-04  a1. Population density of Epirrita autumnata (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) reaches outbreak densities regularly in northernmost Scandinavia. During these outbreak years, the most abundant host species, the mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii), is regularly exhausted, although larvae may rescue themselves from starvation by using alternative host species. 2. In this paper, the effects of the shift of host species on the immune defence and other life-history traits of E. autumnata were investigated, and possible consequences for population dynamics were briefly discussed. Moth larvae were reared on the leaves of the main host, mountain birch, until larvae reached their third instar. After this, larvae were allocated randomly to five treatments: larvae were either allowed to finish larval stage on the mountain birch or were shifted onto four alternative host species that are typical species for the area. 3. As expected, the host species had a major effect on fitness traits: body weight, development, and survival rate of the moths. The pupal weight was lower and development rates slower on the three alternative host species, Salix myrsinifolia Salisb., Vaccinium uliginosum L., and Betula nana L., than on the main host, mountain birch. 4. The immunity was, however, the same or better on the alternative hosts than on the main host. The immunity and pupal weights were negatively related, suggesting a trade-off between body size and immunocompetence. 5. The decreased body size and fecundity of E. autumnata during outbreak years may be partly due to the shift to alternative host species whereas the host-plant species probably does not affect markedly the rate of parasitism. 3alife history 3amoths 3apupae 3ainsect larvae 3apopulation dynamics 3astarvation 3aparasitism 3afecundity 3aEpirrita autumnata 3aSalix 3aBetula pubescens var. pumila 3aalternative hosts 3apopulation density 3aleaves 3abody weight 3aVaccinium uliginosum 3aimmunocompetence 3asurvival rate 3arearing 3ainstars 3abody size 3aBetula nana 3aScandinavia 0alife-history traits 0aAutumnal moth 0aBetula pubescens subsp. tortuosa 0aphenoloxidase1 aRUUHOLA, TEIJA1 aHAVIOLA, SANNA1 aRANTALA, MARKUS J.0 tEcological entomology.g2008 Aug., v. 33, no. 4 p.510-516dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0307-69467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01000.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080718b20080801c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03489naa a2200685 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002100161245018300182300001800365500002400383520144400407650000801851650002501859650001701884650001801901650001401919650001501933650001401948650001401962650001401976650002601990650001502016650002902031650002302060650002102083650002202104650001402126650001002140650003102150650002502181650001602206650002002222650001102242650003702253650001102290650003402301650002702335650000902362650002102371650002602392650002302418650001202441650002002453650001602473700002102489700002102510700003102531700002402562700001702586700001802603773011602621852000902737856004502746655001202791IND4445015320221119204330.0101105e201011  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444501532DNAL7 a205401442pmid7 a10.1002/mnfr.2009003902doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMüller, Nadine.10aBolus ingestion of white and green tea increases the concentration of several flavan‐3‐ols in plasma, but does not affect markers of oxidative stress in healthy non‐smokers  ap. 1636-1645.  aIncludes references  aWhite tea (WT) is rich in flavan‐3‐ols as green tea (GT) and might provide health protective effects due to the strong antioxidant properties of flavan‐3‐ols. Since intervention studies with WT are lacking, we evaluated the effects of WT consumption on antioxidant status, antioxidant capacity and biomarkers of oxidative stress compared to water and GT. After an overnight fast, 70 healthy non‐smokers were randomized to consume 600 mL of WT, GT or water (control). Plasma (epi‐)catechin and epi(gallo)catechingallate, antioxidant capacity (Folin assay, trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity test), 8‐iso‐prostaglandin F₂α, ascorbic acid and uric acid were determined before and several times within 8 h after consumption. DNA strand breaks were measured in vivo and ex vivo (H₂O₂ stimulation) in leukocytes. Plasma flavan‐3‐ols significantly increased after WT and GT ingestion. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity was lower after 5 h in controls versus WT (p=0.031) and GT (p=0.005). Folin‐Ciocalteu reducing capacity, ascorbic and uric acid as well as markers of oxidative stress (8‐iso‐prostaglandin‐F₂α, DNA strand breaks) were not affected by the beverages. A short‐term increase of catechins does not change plasma antioxidant capacity in healthy subjects. Conclusions with respect to health protective effects of WT and GT on the basis of these biomarkers can, thus, not be drawn. 3aDNA 3aantioxidant activity 3aantioxidants 3aascorbic acid 3abeverages 3abiomarkers 3aflavanols 3agreen tea 3aingestion 3aintravenous injection 3aleukocytes 3anutritional intervention 3anutritional status 3aoxidative stress 3aprotective effect 3auric acid 2aAdult 2aAntioxidantsxpharmacology 2aAscorbic Acidxblood 2aBiomarkers. 2aCatechinxblood 2aFemale 2aFlavonoidsxbloodxpharmacology. 2aHumans 2aHydrogen Peroxidexmetabolism 2aLeukocytesxmetabolism 2aMale 2aOxidative Stress 2aPlant Extractsxblood 2aPlasmaxmetabolism 2aSmoking 2aTeaxmetabolism 2aYoung Adult1 aEllinger, Sabine1 aAlteheld, Birgit1 aUlrich‐Merzenich, Gudrun1 aBerthold, Heiner K.1 aVetter, Hans1 aStehle, Peter0 tMolecular nutrition & food research.g2010 Nov., v. 54, no. 11 p.1636-1645dWiley‐VCH Verlagx1613-41257nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mnfr.200900390 7aarticle02515naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245007800206300001800284506007600302520089700378506003701275650000801312650002801320650002001348650001101368650002501379700002301404700002101427700001901448700002301467700001701490700002001507700001401527700002301541700002001564700002401584700002201608700002001630700002301650773012701673852000901800856008301809856007101892930003301963946001301996655001202009IND4392498420221207093027.0070617e20070615xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439249842DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11398162doi7 aPMC28250532pmcid7 a175698672pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHoskins, Roger A.10aSequence Finishing and Mapping of Drosophila melanogaster Heterochromatin  ap. 1625-1628.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aGenome sequences for most metazoans and plants are incomplete because of the presence of repeated DNA in the heterochromatin. The heterochromatic regions of Drosophila melanogaster contain 20 million bases (Mb) of sequence amenable to mapping, sequence assembly, and finishing. We describe the generation of 15 Mb of finished or improved heterochromatic sequence with the use of available clone resources and assembly methods. We also constructed a bacterial artificial chromosome-based physical map that spans 13 Mb of the pericentromeric heterochromatin and a cytogenetic map that positions 11 Mb in specific chromosomal locations. We have approached a complete assembly and mapping of the nonsatellite component of Drosophila heterochromatin. The strategy we describe is also applicable to generating substantially more information about heterochromatin in other species, including humans.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aDNA 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aheterochromatin 3ahumans 3anucleotide sequences1 aCarlson, Joseph W.1 aKennedy, Cameron1 aAcevedo, David1 aEvans-Holm, Martha1 aFrise, Erwin1 aWan, Kenneth H.1 aPark, Soo1 aMendez-Lago, Maria1 aRossi, Fabrizio1 aVillasante, Alfredo1 aDimitri, Patrizio1 aKarpen, Gary H.1 aCelniker, Susan E.0 tScience.g2007 June 15, v. 316, no. 5831 p.1625-1628dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11398163Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03241naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003100092024002200123024001900145040001800164100002400182245009500206300001600301506007600317520153500393506003701928650002701965650002401992650001302016650001602029650002502045650001702070650002102087650001902108650001402127650002202141650002102163650001702184650002402201650001602225650001602241650002202257650001102279650001602290650001702306650001402323650001802337650002202355650001702377700001702394700001802411700001902429773006902448852000902517856008102526930003302607946001102640655001202651IND4419027020221207093628.0090410e200905  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441902702DNAL7 a10.1093/glycob/cwp0042doi7 aPMC26671592pmcid7 a191508062pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKobayashi, Motohiro10aRoles of gastric mucin-type O-glycans in the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori infection  ap. 453-461.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aHelicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that infects over 50% of the world's population. This organism causes various gastric diseases such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and gastric cancer. H. pylori possesses lipopolysaccharides that share structural similarity to Lewis blood group antigens in gastric mucosa. Such antigenic mimicry could result in immune tolerance against antigens of this pathogen. On the other hand, H. pylori colonizes gastric mucosa by utilizing adhesins that bind Lewis blood group antigen-related carbohydrates expressed on gastric epithelial cells. After colonization, H. pylori induces acute inflammatory responses mainly by neutrophils. This acute phase is gradually replaced by a chronic inflammatory response. In chronic gastritis, lymphocytes infiltrate the lamina propria, and such infiltration is facilitated by the interaction between L-selectin on lymphocytes and peripheral lymph node addressin (PNAd), which contains 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X-capped O-glycans, on high endothelial venule (HEV)-like vessels. H. pylori barely colonizes gland mucous cell-derived mucin where α1,4-GlcNAc-capped O-glycans exist. In vitro experiments show that α1,4-GlcNAc-capped O-glycans function as a natural antibiotic to inhibit H. pylori growth. These findings show that distinct sets of carbohydrates expressed in the stomach are closely associated with pathogenesis and prevention of H. pylori-related diseases, providing therapeutic potentialities based on specific carbohydrate modulation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aGram-negative bacteria 3aHelicobacter pylori 3aadhesins 3aantibiotics 3ablood group antigens 3ablood groups 3aepithelial cells 3agastric mucosa 3agastritis 3aimmunosuppression 3ain vitro studies 3ainflammation 3alipopolysaccharides 3alymph nodes 3alymphocytes 3amolecular mimicry 3amucins 3aneutrophils 3apathogenesis 3apathogens 3apeptic ulcers 3astomach neoplasms 3atherapeutics1 aLee, Heeseob1 aNakayama, Jun1 aFukuda, Minoru0 tGlycobiology.g2009 May, v. 19, no. 5 p.453-461x0959-66587nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwp0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01763naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002000184245004900204300001600253506007600269520068100345506003701026650001001063650001201073650001101085650004401096700002201140773012501162852000901287856008301296930003301379946001301412655001201425IND4419020720221207093236.0090410e20090410xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441902072DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11693782doi7 aPMC29814332pmcid7 a193595792pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aLee, Gregory M.10aTrapping Moving Targets with Small Molecules  ap. 213-215.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStructure-based drug design traditionally uses static protein models as inspirations for focusing on "active" site targets. Allosteric regulation of biological macromolecules, however, is affected by both conformational and dynamic properties of the protein or protein complex and can potentially lead to more avenues for therapeutic development. We discuss the advantages of searching for molecules that conformationally trap a macromolecule in its inactive state. Although multiple methodologies exist to probe protein dynamics and ligand binding, our current discussion highlights the use of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the drug discovery and design process.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3adrugs 3aligands 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy1 aCraik, Charles S.0 tScience.g2009 Apr. 10, v. 324, no. 5924 p.213-215dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11693783Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03381naa a2200853 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002600184245009200210300001800302506007600320520074300396506003701139650001801176650002201194650002801216650002301244650001101267650001601278650001001294650002001304650002001324650001901344650002501363650001401388650001801402650002401420700002801444700002101472700001601493700002301509700002601532700002801558700001601586700002301602700002601625700001701651700001701668700002301685700002701708700002401735700001701759700002401776700002501800700002201825700002001847700002001867700001801887700002101905700002001926700002101946700001601967700001501983700002101998700001402019700002302033700002602056700002202082700002302104700002302127700002902150773012702179852000902306856008302315856007102398930003302469946001302502655001202515IND4392645620221207093243.0070624e20070622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439264562DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11398622doi7 aPMC20421072pmcid7 a175889282pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aWaterhouse, Robert M.10aEvolutionary Dynamics of Immune-Related Genes and Pathways in Disease-Vector Mosquitoes  ap. 1738-1743.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aMosquitoes are vectors of parasitic and viral diseases of immense importance for public health. The acquisition of the genome sequence of the yellow fever and Dengue vector, Aedes aegypti (Aa), has enabled a comparative phylogenomic analysis of the insect immune repertoire: in Aa, the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae (Ag), and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster (Dm). Analysis of immune signaling pathways and response modules reveals both conservative and rapidly evolving features associated with different functional gene categories and particular aspects of immune reactions. These dynamics reflect in part continuous readjustment between accommodation and rejection of pathogens and suggest how innate immunity may have evolved.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aAedes aegypti 3aAnopheles gambiae 3aDrosophila melanogaster 3aYellow fever virus 3adengue 3afruit flies 3agenes 3aimmune response 3ainnate immunity 3ainsect vectors 3anucleotide sequences 3apathogens 3apublic health 3asignal transduction1 aKriventseva, Evgenia V.1 aMeister, Stephan1 aXi, Zhiyong1 aAlvarez, Kanwal S.1 aBartholomay, Lyric C.1 aBarillas-Mury, Carolina1 aBian, Guowu1 aBlandin, Stephanie1 aChristensen, Bruce M.1 aDong, Yuemei1 aJiang, Haobo1 aKanost, Michael R.1 aKoutsos, Anastasios C.1 aLevashina, Elena A.1 aLi, Jianyong1 aLigoxygakis, Petros1 aMacCallum, Robert M.1 aMayhew, George F.1 aMendes, Antonio1 aMichel, Kristin1 aOsta, Mike A.1 aPaskewitz, Susan1 aShin, Sang Woon1 aVlachou, D̲ina.1 aWang, Lihui1 aWei, Weiqi1 aZheng, Liangbiao1 aZou, Zhen1 aSeverson, David W.1 aRaikhel, Alexander S.1 aKafatos, Fotis C.1 aDimopoulos, George1 aZdobnov, Evgeny M.1 aChristophides, George K.0 tScience.g2007 June 22, v. 316, no. 5832 p.1738-1743dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11398623Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02359naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245006200163300001800225520100400243650001601247650001701263650000901280650002301289650001101312650001701323650001801340650001401358650001301372700001401385700002001399700001801419700002101437700001401458700002401472700002601496700002301522700002001545773012701565852000901692856008301701856007101784930003301855946001301888655001201901IND4392645220221119204626.0070624e20070622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439264522DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11425252doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMichel, F.

We uncovered the atomic arrangement by real-space modeling of the pair distribution function (PDF) derived from direct Fourier transformation of the total x-ray scattering. The PDF for ferrihydrite synthesized with the use of different routes is consistent with a single phase (hexagonal space group P6₃mc; a = ~5.95 angstroms, c = ~9.06 angstroms). In its ideal form, this structure contains 20% tetrahedrally and 80% octahedrally coordinated iron and has a basic structural motif closely related to the Baker-Figgis δ-Keggin cluster. Real-space fitting indicates structural relaxation with decreasing particle size and also suggests that second-order effects such as internal strain, stacking faults, and particle shape contribute to the PDFs. 3aX-radiation 3aferrihydrite 3airon 3airon oxyhydroxides 3amodels 3ananocrystals 3aparticle size 3asediments 3asorbents1 aEhm, Lars1 aAntao, Sytle M.1 aLee, Peter L.1 aChupas, Peter J.1 aLiu, Gang1 aStrongin, Daniel R.1 aSchoonen, Martin A.A.1 aPhillips, Brian L.1 aParise, John B.0 tScience.g2007 June 22, v. 316, no. 5832 p.1726-1729dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11425253Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02522naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002200143245009900165300001800264520090200282650001401184650001601198650001001214650001001224650001701234650002401251650002201275650001701297650001301314650001101327700001601338700002001354700002001374700002101394700001701415700002101432700002301453700001901476700002201495700002301517700001801540700002301558700002501581700002001606700001801626773012701644852000901771856008301780856007101863930003301934946001301967655001201980IND4392646320170526000000.0070624e20070622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439264632DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11421892doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRock, Fernando L.13aAn Antifungal Agent Inhibits an Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetase by Trapping tRNA in the Editing Site  ap. 1759-1761.  aAminoacyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) synthetases, which catalyze the attachment of the correct amino acid to its corresponding tRNA during translation of the genetic code, are proven antimicrobial drug targets. We show that the broad-spectrum antifungal 5-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-1-hydroxy-2,1-benzoxaborole (AN2690), in development for the treatment of onychomycosis, inhibits yeast cytoplasmic leucyl-tRNA synthetase by formation of a stable tRNALeu-AN2690 adduct in the editing site of the enzyme. Adduct formation is mediated through the boron atom of AN2690 and the 2'- and 3'-oxygen atoms of tRNA's3'-terminal adenosine. The trapping of enzyme-bound tRNALeu in the editing site prevents catalytic turnover, thus inhibiting synthesis of leucyl-tRNALeu and consequentially blocking protein synthesis. This result establishes the editing site as a bona fide target for aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase inhibitors. 3aadenosine 3aamino acids 3aboron 3adrugs 3agenetic code 3aleucine-tRNA ligase 3aprotein synthesis 3atransfer RNA 3atrapping 3ayeasts1 aMao, Weimin1 aYaremchuk, Anya1 aTukalo, Mikhail1 aCrépin, Thibaut1 aZhou, Huchen1 aZhang, Yong-Kang1 aHernandez, Vincent1 aAkama, Tsutomu1 aBaker, Stephen J.1 aPlattner, Jacob J.1 aShapiro, Lucy1 aMartinis, Susan A.1 aBenkovic, Stephen J.1 aCusack, Stephen1 aAlley, M.R.K.0 tScience.g2007 June 22, v. 316, no. 5832 p.1759-1761dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11421893Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02857naa a2200625 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003900111040001800150072000900168072000900177072000900186100001600195245015900211300001600370500002400386500001500410520106900425650001901494650001601513650001901529650002701548650001501575650002301590650002001613650001701633650001301650650001601663650002101679650002001700650003501720650001001755650001601765650000701781650002301788650001101811650001801822650001001840653002201850700001501872700001601887700001401903700001701917700001601934700001401950773008801964852000902052856008902061930003302150945002502183946001102208655001202219IND4418289320221119204448.0090327e200906  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441828932DNAL7 a204167452pmid7 a10.1016/j.meatsci.2009.01.0182doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aL500 0aL600 0aQ5021 aVicenti, A.10aUse of sweet lupin (Lupinus albus L. var.

The steers were divided into 2 homogeneous groups and were fed durum wheat (Triticum durum L.), straw and a complete pellet feed containing 20% sweet lupin seeds or 16.5% soybean. Productive performances were similar for both groups. The values of pH, measured on Longissimus lumborum and Semitendinosus muscles 24h after slaughter, were similar. No differences were shown between groups regarding the colour characteristics of both muscles or the tenderness of the cooked meat. No statistical differences were found between diets regarding the fatty acid profile of meats, except for a significantly higher incidence of linoleic acid in the meat obtained from animals on soybean feed. In conclusion, comparable results were obtained when soybean was replaced with sweet lupin seeds in complete pellet feed for Podolian steers. 3abeef carcasses 3aGlycine max 3acattle feeding 3afatty acid composition 3abeef bulls 3aexperimental diets 3afeed conversion 3abeef quality 3asoybeans 3adurum wheat 3aslaughter weight 3aliveweight gain 3aTriticum turgidum subsp. durum 3astraw 3afeed intake 3apH 3alongissimus muscle 3acalves 3aLupinus albus 3acolor 0alongissimus dorsi1 aToteda, F.1 aTuri, L.

  1 aGlare, Travis R.10aBeauveria caledonica is a naturally occurring pathogen of forest beetles  ap. 352-360.  aIn New Zealand, two introduced scolytid beetles, Hylastes ater and Hylurgus ligniperda (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are pests in pine plantations. Investigation of the naturally occurring pathogens of these exotic pests revealed that both are attacked by Beauveria caledonica, a species originally isolated and described from soil in Scotland. The isolates in New Zealand were identical in morphology and conserved DNA region (rDNA, elongation factor @a) sequence to isolates held in the USDA-ARS insect pathogens culture collection. In bioassay, the B. caledonica isolates were highly pathogenic to adults of H. ligniperda and larvae of Tenebrio molitor. Sporulation was observed on cadavers, confirming the species can utilise the cadavers. As both species were likely to have been introduced to New Zealand from Europe, a search was made for B. caledonica in the northern UK and Ireland. The fungus was found as a naturally-occurring pathogen of the weevil pest, Hylobius abietis (Curculionidae: Scolytinae), developing in spruce and other beetles in forests in both regions. 3aBeauveria 3aentomopathogenic fungi 3apathogen identification 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3apathogenicity 3abioassays 3afungal anatomy 3aHylastes ater 3aHylurgus ligniperda 3ainsect pests 3aplant pests 3aintroduced species 3aPinus 3aforest trees 3aforest plantations 3aHylobius abietis 2aAnimals 2aBeauveriaxclassificationxgeneticsxisolation & purificationxpathogenicity. 2aColeopteraxgrowth & developmentxmicrobiology. 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aPeptide Elongation Factor 1xgenetics 2aPhylogeny 3aNew Zealand 3aIreland 3aEngland 0aEurope 0aNew Zealand 0aBeauveria caledonica1 aReay, Stephen D.1 aNelson, Tracey L.1 aMoore, Roger0 tMycological research.g2008 Mar., v. 112, no. 3 p.352-360x0953-75627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2007.10.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/07/07  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle02109naa a2200349 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002100143245009100164300001800255520095100273650000901224650001501233650001001248650003201258650001401290700002301304700002301327700002201350700001801372700002101390773012701411852000901538856008301547856007101630930003301701946001301734655001201747IND4392645720170526000000.0070624e20070622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439264572DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11414122doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPersson, Lennart10aCulling Prey Promotes Predator Recovery--Alternative States in a Whole-Lake Experiment  ap. 1743-1746.  aMany top-predator fish stocks in both freshwater and marine systems have collapsed as a result of overharvesting. Consequently, some of these communities have shifted into seemingly irreversible new states. We showed, for predators feeding on prey that exhibit food-dependent growth, that culling of fish prey may promote predator recovery. We removed old stunted individuals of a prey-fish species in a large, low-productive lake, which caused an increase in the availability of small-sized prey and allowed the predator to recover. The shift in community state has been sustained for more than 15 years after the cull ended and represents an experimental demonstration of an alternative stable state in a large-scale field system. Because most animals exhibit food-dependent growth, shifts into alternative stable states resulting from overcompensating prey growth may be common in nature and may require counterintuitive management strategies. 3afish 3afreshwater 3alakes 3apredator-prey relationships 3apredators1 aAmundsen, Per-Arne1 aDe Roos, André M.1 aKlemetsen, Anders1 aKnudsen, Rune1 aPrimicerio, Raul0 tScience.g2007 June 22, v. 316, no. 5832 p.1743-1746dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11414123Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03820naa a2200589 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002500181245011900206300001800325500002400343506007600367520188300443506003702326650002702363650001402390650001402404650002002418650001902438650001002457650001602467650000902483650001202492650001402504650001402518650003702532650001102569650001202580650004602592650004102638650003302679650002802712650003802740650002602778650002902804650003902833650003302872650004302905650000902948650001902957700001902976700001802995773011603013852000903129856008003138655001203218IND4419260520221207085908.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926052DNAL7 a192375182pmid7 aPMC26817682pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01382-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aCase, Christopher L.10aAsc and Ipaf Inflammasomes Direct Distinct Pathways for Caspase-1 Activation in Response to Legionella pneumophila  ap. 1981-1991.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aCaspase-1 activation is a key feature of the innate immune response of macrophages elicited by pathogens and a variety of toxins. Here, we determined the requirement for different adapter proteins involved in regulating host processes mediated by caspase-1 after macrophage infection by Legionella pneumophila. The adapter protein Asc was found to be important for caspase-1 activation during L. pneumophila infection. Activation of caspase-1 through Asc did not require the flagellin-sensing pathway involving the host nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein Ipaf (NLRC4). Asc-dependent caspase-1 activation was inhibited by high extracellular potassium levels, whereas Ipaf-dependent activation was unaffected by potassium treatment. Activation of caspase-1 in macrophages occurred independently of Nalp3 and proteasome activity, suggesting that a previously uncharacterized mechanism for caspase-1 activation through Asc may be triggered by L. pneumophila. Rapid pore formation and pyroptosis induced by L. pneumophila required caspase-1, Ipaf, and bacterial flagellin but occurred independently of Asc. Equivalent levels of active interleukin-18 (IL-18) were detected in the lungs of mice infected with a flagellin-deficient strain of L. pneumophila and Asc-deficient mice infected with wild-type L. pneumophila. Active IL-18 was undetectable in the lungs of Asc-deficient mice infected with an L. pneumophila flagellin mutant, indicating independent roles for Ipaf and Asc in caspase-1-mediated processing and release of IL-18 in vivo. Ipaf-dependent activation of caspase-1 restricted bacterial replication in vivo, whereas Asc was dispensable for restriction of L. pneumophila replication in mice. Thus, L. pneumophila-mediated caspase-1 activation involves the coordinate activities of inflammasomes differentially regulated by Ipaf and Asc.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aLegionella pneumophila 3acaspase-1 3aflagellin 3ainnate immunity 3ainterleukin-18 3alungs 3amacrophages 3amice 3amutants 3apathogens 3apotassium 3aproteasome endopeptidase complex 3atoxins 2aAnimals 2aApoptosis Regulatory Proteinsximmunology 2aCalcium-Binding Proteinsximmunology 2aCarrier Proteinsximmunology 2aCaspase 1xbiosynthesis 2aCytoskeletal Proteinsximmunology 2aFlagellinximmunology 2aInterleukin-18xanalysis 2aLegionella pneumophilaximmunology 2aLungximmunologyxpathology. 2aMacrophagesximmunologyxmicrobiology. 2aMice 2aMice, Knockout1 aSin, Sŏn-hwa.1 aRoy, Craig R.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.1981-1991dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01382-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02185naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245009800168300001800266520087200284650001001156650001601166650001701182650002001199650001701219650002001236650001001256650002801266650001901294650002901313650002601342700002401368700002501392700002201417773012701439852000901566856008301575856007101658930003301729946001301762655001201775IND4392645920221119204438.0070624e20070622xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439264592DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11410842doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aVartiainen, Maria K.10aNuclear Actin Regulates Dynamic Subcellular Localization and Activity of the SRF Cofactor MAL  ap. 1749-1752.  aActin, which is best known as a cytoskeletal component, also participates in the control of gene expression. We report a function of nuclear actin in the regulation of MAL, a coactivator of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). MAL, which binds monomeric actin, is cytoplasmic in many cells but accumulates in the nucleus upon serum-induced actin polymerization. MAL rapidly shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus in unstimulated cells. Serum stimulation effectively blocks MAL nuclear export, which requires MAL-actin interaction. Nuclear MAL binds SRF target genes but remains inactive unless actin binding is disrupted. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrates that the MAL-actin interaction responds to extracellular signals. Serum-induced signaling is thus communicated to nuclear actin to control a transcriptional regulator. 3aactin 3ablood serum 3acytoskeleton 3aenergy transfer 3afluorescence 3agene expression 3agenes 3aphysiological transport 3apolymerization 3atranscription (genetics) 3atranscription factors1 aGuettler, Sebastian1 aLarijani, Banafshé.1 aTreisman, Richard0 tScience.g2007 June 22, v. 316, no. 5832 p.1749-1752dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11410843Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02796naa a2200421 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001500145245013300160300001600293520145700309650002301766650002301789650001301812650002101825650004301846650001501889650002401904650001001928650001301938651001001951653003201961653003901993653000902032700001802041700001702059700001802076700001902094773010902113852000902222856008502231930003302316946001302349655001202362IND4440738220221119204303.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444073822DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-009-9113-02doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aPeng, Lin 10aUltrasonically Assisted Extraction of Rutin from Artemisia selengensis Turcz: Comparison with Conventional Extraction Techniques  ap. 261-268.  aUltrasonically assisted extraction (UAE) followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis method for the fast extraction and determination of rutin in Artemisia selengensis Turcz has been developed. Artemisia selengensis Turcz has been used as food and herbal medicine for thousands of years in China. Rutin is one of the main active ingredients of this plant. The extraction of rutin from Artemisia selengensis Turcz was investigated by UAE. Special emphasis has been given to optimize the extraction conditions which were those with 90:10 (v/v) methanol-ethanol as solvent, 30:1 liquid-solid ratio, and 40 min extraction time. In order to show the superiority of UAE, other extractions were investigated, including microwave-assisted extraction, reflux extraction, and marinated extraction. The results showed that UAE was most suitable for the extraction of rutin in Artemisia selengensis Turcz because of its high extraction efficiency. Reversed phase-HPLC with ultraviolet detection was employed for the analysis of rutin in Artemisia selengensis Turcz. Under the optimum conditions, the calibration curve for the analyte was linear in the range of 0.34-20.7 μg mL⁻¹. The mean recovery of rutin was 100.77%, and its relative standard deviation was 0.37% (n = 5). Three kinds of Artemisia selengensis Turcz from different habitats were investigated. The total content of rutin was 9.90, 6.23, 5.56 mg g⁻¹, respectively. 3aArtemisia vulgaris 3aactive ingredients 3ahabitats 3aherbal medicines 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3amarinating 3amicrowave treatment 3arutin 3asolvents 3aChina 0aArtemisia selengensis Turcz 0aUltrasonically Assisted Extraction 0aHPLC1 aJia, Xiaopin 1 aWang, Yuzhi 1 aZhu, Hongbin 1 aChen, Qingmei 0 tFood analytical methods.g2010 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.261-268dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-009-9113-03Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02238naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001600110245013300126300001600259500001500275520102900290650001901319650002001338650002101358650002001379650001801399650001601417650000901433650002801442650001401470651001001484653001101494653002201505653002401527653002201551653002301573700001801596700001601614700001801630773007801648852000901726930003301735945001301768946001101781655001201792IND2201870620221119204345.0991206e199902  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220187062DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTambi, N.E.10aProbit analysis of livestock producers' demand for private veterinary services in the high potential agricultural areas of Kenya  ap. 163-176.  a2019-12-05  aIn this paper, empirical maximum likelihood (ML) and weighted least squares (WLS) estimates of socio-economic factors influencing the demand for private veterinary services in the high potential agricultural areas of Kenya are derived using probit analysis. While ML estimates explain 65 and 56% of the variation in demand for artificial insemination and clinical services, respectively, WLS estimates explain 74 and 72% of the variation after correcting for sample selection bias using the Heckman two-step procedure. Based on the ML and WLS coefficients, herd size, number of breeding cows, farm income, education, knowledge of husbandry practices and time devoted to farm activities are identified as important determinants of demand and are used to construct producer demand profiles. Using the predictive success rate together with information on the profiles, the model correctly classifies the demand for artificial insemination and clinical services to be higher than demand for vaccination and herd health services. 3aprivate sector 3aprobit analysis 3aanimal husbandry 3afarm management 3aleast squares 3afarm income 3acows 3aartificial insemination 3aeducation 3aKenya 0ademand 0alivestock numbers 0aveterinary services 0aclinical services 0amaximum likelihood1 aMukhebi, W.A.1 aMaina, W.O.1 aSolomon, H.M.0 tAgricultural systems.g1999 Feb., v. 59, no. 2 p.163-176x0308-521X7nnas  aDNAL  a20000302b20000309c00000000  aINDdTBT  aNon-US 7aarticle02802naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245012300200300001800323500002400341506007600365520149500441506003701936650001801973650002001991650001002011650001302021650000902034650003702043650003702080650001702117700002202134700002102156700002202177773011602199852000902315856008002324655001202404IND4419260720221207092254.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926072DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.01070-082doi7 aPMC26817692pmcid7 a192551862pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aZhang, Xiaoxia10aInvolvement of SOCS3 in Regulation of CD11c⁺ Dendritic Cell-Derived Osteoclastogenesis and Severe Alveolar Bone Loss  ap. 2000-2009.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTo investigate the role of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) molecules in periodontal immunity and RANKL-mediated dendritic cell (DC)-associated osteoclastogenesis, we analyzed SOCS expression profiles in CD4⁺ T cells and the effect of SOCS3 expression in CD11c⁺ DCs during periodontal inflammation-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in nonobese diabetic (NOD) versus humanized NOD/SCID mice. Our results of ex vivo and in vitro analyses showed that (i) there is significantly higher SOCS3 expression associated with RANKL⁺ T-cell-mediated bone loss in correlation with increased CD11c⁺ DC-mediated osteoclastogenesis; (ii) the transfection of CD11c⁺ DC using an adenoviral vector carrying a dominant negative SOCS3 gene significantly abrogates TRAP and bone-resorptive activity; and (iii) inflammation-induced TRAP expression, bone resorption, and SOCS3 activity are not associated with any detectable change in the expression levels of TRAF6 and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling adaptors (i.e., Erk, Jnk, p38, and Akt) in RANKL⁺ T cells. We conclude that SOCS3 plays a critical role in modulating cytokine signaling involved in RANKL-mediated DC-derived osteoclastogenesis during immune interactions with T cells and diabetes-associated severe inflammation-induced alveolar bone loss. Therefore, the development of SOCS3 inhibitors may have therapeutic potential as the target to halt inflammation-induced bone loss under pathological conditions in vivo.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aT-lymphocytes 3abone resorption 3agenes 3aimmunity 3amice 3amitogen-activated protein kinase 3asevere combined immunodeficiency 3atransfection1 aAlnaeeli, Mawadda1 aSingh, Bhagirath1 aTeng, Yen-Tung A.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.2000-2009dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01070-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02898naa a2200481 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100002100145245010200166300001600268520146500284650002601749650001701775650001701792650001401809650001701823650001701840650001301857650001901870650001101889650002601900650002201926650002001948650001401968650001601982650001401998651002102012653001402033653003202047653001302079700002202092700001902114700002202133773010902155852000902264856008502273930003302358946001302391655001202404IND4440737020221119204751.0100730e201009  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444073702DNAL7 a10.1007/s12161-009-9102-32doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aTürkben, Cihat 10aEffect of Freezing and Frozen Storage on Phenolic Compounds of Raspberry and Blackberry Cultivars  ap. 144-153.  aThe phenolic compounds in raspberry and blackberry cultivars grown in Turkey were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS)/MS in fresh, just-frozen, and stored fruits at −22 °C for 6 months period. The major phenolic compounds in water extracted samples were ellagic acid (1,350.36-727.9 mg/kg fresh fruit), ferulic acid (820.78-338.27 mg/kg fresh fruit), caffeic acid (754.85-202.78 mg/kg fresh fruit), p-coumaric acid (361.68-142.63 mg/kg fresh fruit), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (534.20-233.29 mg/kg fresh fruit), and quercetin (46.97-27.31 mg/kg fresh fruit) in raspberry and ellagic acid (1,828.07-1,555.13 mg/kg fresh fruit), ferulic acid (757.69-413.82 mg/kg fresh fruit), caffeic acid (736.85-337.89 mg/kg fresh fruit), p-coumaric acid (877.45-287.15 mg/kg fresh fruit), and quercetin (74.69-56.78 mg/kg fresh fruit) in blackberry. The varietal differences in the phenolic compound contents were larger among the blackberry cultivars (from 1,828.07 to 56.78 mg/kg fresh fruit) than among the raspberry cultivars (1,350.36 to 27.31 mg/kg fresh fruit). A significant decrease was observed in the content of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (from 534.20 to 114.30 mg/kg; Aksu Kırmızısı) and the least decrease was in the content of caffeic acid (from 545.42 to 530.91 mg/kg; Heritage) in raspberry cultivars. On the other hand, ferulic acid (from 475.16 to 113.33 mg/kg) decreased significantly in blackberry (Bursa 2) after storage for 6 months. 3a4-hydroxybenzoic acid 3ablackberries 3acaffeic acid 3acultivars 3aellagic acid 3aferulic acid 3afreezing 3afrozen storage 3afruits 3aliquid chromatography 3amass spectrometry 3ap-coumaric acid 3aquercetin 3araspberries 3araw fruit 3aTurkey (country) 0aRaspberry 0aFreezing and Frozen Storage 0aLC-MS/MS1 aSarıburun, Esra 1 aDemir, Cevdet 1 aUylaşer, Vildan 0 tFood analytical methods.g2010 Sept., v. 3, no. 3 p.144-153dNew York : Springer-Verlagx1936-97517nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12161-009-9102-33Available from publisher's Web site  a20100730b20100807c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03795naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003800111040001800149072001700167072001700184100001700201245012300218300001600341500019400357520155900551650001502110650001502125650001802140650002202158650002602180650004102206650002602247650002902273650003602302650001702338650002802355650003402383650003702417650001402454650003502468650002702503650006502530653002302595653002802618653002702646653002402673700002202697700003002719700001902749700001702768700003202785700002302817700001902840700001802859773007902877852000902956856008802965930003303053945002503086946001103111990002303122655001203145IND4403250720141224000000.0080321e200802  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440325072DNAL7 a183191462pmid7 a10.1016/j.mycres.2007.07.0042doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0a

Stadler and N. P. Keller. The 8th International Mycological Congress held on August 21-28, 2006, Cairns, Australia.  aA chemotaxonomic evaluation using hplc profiling was undertaken to resolve the infrageneric and intergeneric affinities of over 150 strains of Xylariaceae. Daldinia placentiformis, Hypoxylon nicaraguense, H. polyporus, and Phylacia sagrana were found to contain 8-methoxy-1-naphthol, which is apparently absent in Annulohypoxylon, Hypoxylon, and related genera with bipartite stromata. D. placentiformis and other species of Daldinia and Entonaema produced this naphthol, 5-hydroxy-2-methylchromone, isosclerone derivatives, and 'AB-5046' phytotoxins. Phylacia sagrana differed from most Daldinia spp., except for D. caldariorum, by producing eutypine derivatives in addition to the above compounds. Indolylquinones were observed in H. nicaraguense and H. polyporus. Isosclerones were also identified in the A. multiforme complex, but Hypoxylon and other Annulohypoxylon and most Hypoxylon spp. studied Annulohypoxylon spp. contained 5-methylmellein as the major metabolite of their cultures. Based on the occurrence of the above metabolites, further mellein-type dihydroisocoumarins, teleomorphic and anamorphic Xylariaceae with Nodulisporium-like anamorphs ('Hypoxyloideae') were divided into various chemotypes. A comparison of their 5.8S/ITS nuc-rDNA sequences agreed in some important aspects with the above results: H. nicaraguense and H. polyporus appeared basal to a clade comprising Daldinia, Entonaema, and Ph. sagrana. The latter species appeared allied to D. caldariorum, but was distantly related to Pyrenomyxa morganii and Hypoxylon s. str. 3aAscomycota 3achemotypes 3aribosomal DNA 3asequence analysis 3asecondary metabolites 2aChromatography, High Pressure Liquid 2aDNA, Fungalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomalxgenetics 2aDNA, Ribosomal Spacerxgenetics 2aFermentation 2aMolecular Sequence Data 2aMycological Typing Techniques 2aNaphtholsxanalysisxmetabolism. 2aPhylogeny 2aRNA, Ribosomal, 5.8Sxgenetics 2aSequence Analysis, DNA 2aXylarialesxchemistryxclassificationxgeneticsxmetabolism. 0aPhylacia sagraeana 0aDaldinia placentiformis 0aHypoxylon nicaraguense 0aHypoxylon polyporus1 aLaessøe, Thomas.1 aFournier, Jacques,d1940-1 aKummer, Volker1 aDecock, Cony1 aTichy, H.-V.q(Hans-Volker)1 aPiepenbring, Meike1 aPeršoh, Derek1 aStadler, Marc0 tMycological research.g2008 Feb., v. 112, no. 2 p.251-270x0953-75627nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mycres.2007.07.0043Available from publisher's Web site  a20080707b20080801c00000000  aINDdRSCe2008/07/07  aNon-US  mNon-PubAg articles 7aarticle03768naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003800092040001800130072000900148072000900157072000900166072000900175072000900184100001900193245014000212300001800352500002400370500001500394520206500409650002802474650001902502650002202521650002602543650001702569650001502586650001802601650001302619650002402632650002102656650001202677650001102689650001402700650002602714650001702740650002402757650001502781650002302796650002002819650000902839653002402848700002902872773011102901852000903012856008803021930003303109945002503142946001103167655001203178IND4418291120221119204341.0090327e20090331xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441829112DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.0302doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aJ100 0aJ500 0aK001 0aJ200 0aJ3001 aKooijman, A.M.10aEffects of litter quality and parent material on organic matter characteristics and N-dynamics in Luxembourg beech and hornbeam forests  ap. 1732-1739.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aTo test effects of litter quality and soil conditions on N-dynamics, we selected seven forests in Luxembourg dominated by beech (Fagus sylvatica, L.) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), and located on acid loam, decalcified marl or limestone, and measured organic matter characteristics, microbial C and N and net N-mineralization in a laboratory incubation experiment. Organic layer characteristics were significantly affected by species, with lower litter decay and higher accumulation under the less palatable beech, even on limestone. However, beech and hornbeam did not show any differences in N-cycling at all. Instead of species, N-cycling was affected by site conditions, albeit different than expected. Microbial N generally increased from acid loam to limestone, but acid loam showed higher net N-mineralization, especially in the organic layer. Also, acid loam showed high instead of low efficiency of N-mineralization per unit microbe, in both organic layer and mineral topsoil. In addition, acid loam showed net consumption of DOC instead of release in both soil layers, which suggests that not N, but C was a limiting factor to decomposition. In contrast, limestone showed low net N-mineralization in the organic layer, despite high mass and well-decomposed organic matter, and low efficiency of N-mineralization per unit microbe in both organic layer and mineral topsoil. DOC was net released instead of consumed, which supported that not C, but N was a limiting factor. The general lack of differences in net N-cycling between species, but relatively clear site effects, is discussed in relation to different microbial strategies. Acid soil may have high net N-release despite low biological activity, because N-requirements of fungi are also low, while in calcareous soil, high bacterial N-demand may counteract high gross N-release. Thus, species producing litter that decomposes rapidly may be planted to improve soil conditions and plant biodiversity, but litter quality effects on N-availability may be less important than soil conditions. 3ainterspecific variation 3amineralization 3adeciduous forests 3asoil parent materials 3aforest trees 3aacid soils 3aforest litter 3anitrogen 3asoil organic matter 3aCarpinus betulus 3asoil pH 3acarbon 3alimestone 3abiogeochemical cycles 3aforest soils 3asoil microorganisms 3aloam soils 3amicrobial activity 3aFagus sylvatica 3amarl 0aspecies differences1 aMartinez-Hernandez, G.B.0 tForest ecology and management.g2009 Mar. 31, v. 257, no. 8 p.1732-1739dElsevier Sciencex0378-11277nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2009.01.0303Available from publisher's Web site  a20110518b20110603c00000000  aINDdLYNe2009/04/25  aNon-US 7aarticle03015naa a2200493 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159100002100168245008500189300001600274500002400290520154600314650001501860650000901875650001301884650001601897650002301913650001401936650002201950650001501972651002201987653002902009653002702038653003102065700002902096700001902125700001802144700002502162700002102187700002302208700001702231773009302248852000902341856009002350930003302440945002502473946001102498655001202509IND4418286920221119204411.0090327e20090801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441828692DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.01.0162doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ206 0aW0001 aNania, Valentina10aMonitoring of perfluorinated compounds in edible fish from the Mediterranean Sea  ap. 951-957.  aIncludes references  aPerfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) are environmental contaminants belonging to a chemical group known as perfluorinated compounds (PCFs). The United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) considers both compounds to be carcinogenic. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the contamination levels of PFOS and PFOA in edible fish of the Mediterranean Sea. Twenty six fish muscles, 17 fish livers, five series of cephalopods (each composed of ten specimens) and thirteen series of bivalves (each composed of about 50 specimens) were used for the investigation. A fast sample treatment, followed by an LC-ESI-MS/MS method is described for the identification, and quantification of PFOA and PFOS in fish. The method was in-house-validated through the determination of precision, accuracy, specificity, calibration curve, decision limit (CCα), and detection capability (CCβ). The results showed PFOA and PFOS levels in fishes and molluscs lower than those reported for analogue matrices in different geographic areas. Therefore, our biomonitoring results did not show that the Mediterranean Sea had any particularly alarming pollution by PFCs, although it is located in a semi-closed basin with scarce water change. Nonetheless, a worrying element is that a few fish showed extremely high contamination by PFOA and PFOS. This finding needs further clarification in order to assess whether such unusual contamination is linked to “dot-like” pollutant release, which could explain the anomaly. 3amonitoring 3afish 3aseafoods 3acarcinogens 3afood contamination 3apollution 3aindicator species 3apollutants 3aMediterranean Sea 0aperfluorinated compounds 0aperfluorooctanoic acid 0aperfluorooctane sulphonate1 aPellegrini, Guido Enrico1 aFabrizi, Laura1 aSesta, Giulio1 aSanctis, Patrizia De1 aLucchetti, Dario1 aPasquale, Mauro Di1 aConi, Ettore0 tFood chemistry.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 115, no. 3 p.951-957dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.01.0163Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02544naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150072000900159072000900168100001600177245010700193300001600300500002400316520109200340650002101432650002501453650002101478650003501499650002301534650001601557650003601573650002801609650002201637650002301659650002801682653001901710653005001729700001501779700001901794773009301813852000901906856009001915930003302005945002502038946001102063655001202074IND4418286720221119204444.0090327e20090801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441828672DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.01.0082doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aQ500 0aF600 0aS2001 aLi, Jianlin14aThe in vitro antioxidant activity of lotus germ oil from supercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction  ap. 939-944.  aIncludes references  aThe in vitro antioxidant activity of lotus germ oil extracted by supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) has been investigated. The distinctly high total phenolic compounds content and tocopherol content in lotus germ oil composition were found to be 9.06±0.11% and 485.1±50mg/100g, respectively. The lotus germ oil exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the hydroxyl free radical and superoxide anion free radical. However, the scavenging effects on the superoxide anion free radical were deceased when the extract concentration was greater than 70mg/mL. Lotus germ oil showed substantial antioxidant activity in the mice liver and kidney tissues homogenates in a dose-dependent manner. The auto-haemolysis of mice red blood cells was also blocked by lotus germ oil in a dose-dependent manner. Lotus germ oil showed a higher antioxidant activity in the lard system. The high content of phenolic compounds and tocopherol in the lotus germ oil could partially account for the antioxidant activity. These results suggest the lotus germ oil can be used as healthcare oil to develop. 3ain vitro studies 3aantioxidant activity 3aNelumbo nucifera 3asupercritical fluid extraction 3aphenolic compounds 3atocopherols 3achemical constituents of plants 3afree radical scavengers 3achemical analysis 3alipid peroxidation 3areactive oxygen species 0alotus germ oil 0asupercritical fluid carbon dioxide extraction1 aZhang, Min1 aZheng, Tiesong0 tFood chemistry.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 115, no. 3 p.939-944dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.01.0083Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02776naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004000092040001800132072000900150100001200159245013000171300001600301500002400317500001500341520116100356650001701517650001601534650002001550650002801570650002401598650001301622650000901635650001901644650002701663650001801690650001201708650002101720650002601741650002501767653000901792653001501801700001501816700001401831700002201845700001601867700001701883700001801900700001801918700001301936773009301949852000902042856009002051930003302141945002502174946001102199655001202210IND4418286820221119204333.0090327e20090801xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441828682DNAL7 a10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.01.0152doi  aAGLbengcAGL 0aT2001 aHou, Hu14aThe effect of pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) skin gelatin polypeptides on UV radiation-induced skin photoaging in ICR mice  ap. 945-950.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aGelatin was extracted from Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) skin and hydrolysed sequentially with pepsin and alkaline protease. The hydrolysates were fractionated into two ranges of molecular weight (PEP1: 2000Da<Mr<6000Da; PEP2: Mr<2000Da) using ultrafiltration membranes. In this present study, we investigate the protective effects of both polypeptides against ultraviolet radiation-induced skin photoaging by the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and the contents of glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxyproline (HYP) in photoaging skin tissue. The arrangement of collagen fibres in skin tissue was examined by Van Gienson stain. UV radiation-induced decrease in the antioxidase activity and depletion of reduced glutathione (20.4%) in the skin of hairless mice in a model group. Compared with the model, both polypeptides can enhance the activities of SOD, GSH-Px, CAT and the contents of GSH and HYP, and reduce the content of MDA, which minimised the skin photo damage. Moreover, the results of histology study confirmed that both polypeptides could protect collagen fibres in skin. 3apolypeptides 3aglutathione 3amalondialdehyde 3areactive oxygen species 3aGadus macrocephalus 3acollagen 3amice 3ahydroxyproline 3aamino acid composition 3aanimal models 3agelatin 3amolecular weight 3aultraviolet radiation 3aantioxidant activity 0askin 0aphotoaging1 aLi, Bafang1 aZhao, Xue1 aZhuang, Yongliang1 aRen, Guoyan1 aYan, Mingyan1 aCai, Yangpeng1 aZhang, Xiukun1 aChen, Li0 tFood chemistry.g2009 Aug. 1, v. 115, no. 3 p.945-950dElsevier Sciencex0308-81467nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2009.01.0153Available from publisher's Web site  a20090611b20090703c00000000  aINDd3CTe2009/05/15  aNon-US 7aarticle02523naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003000092024002200122024001900144040001800163100001900181245009000200300001800290500002400308506007600332520106100408506003701469650002601506650001801532650001301550650001701563650001401580650001101594650001401605650001401619650002501633650001701658650001801675700002301693700001901716700001901735700001901754700002001773700002601793700001701819773011601836852000901952856008001961655001202041IND4419261220221207090913.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926122DNAL7 a10.1128/IAI.01388-082doi7 aPMC26817342pmcid7 a192551902pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aThomas, Damien10aStaphylococcus aureus Superantigens Elicit Redundant and Extensive Human Vβ Patterns  ap. 2043-2050.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aStaphylococcus aureus can produce a wide variety of exotoxins, including toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (TSST-1), staphylococcal enterotoxins, and staphylococcal enterotoxin-like toxins. These toxins share superantigenic activity. To investigate the β chain (Vβ) specificities of each of these toxins, TSST-1 and all known S. aureus enterotoxins and enterotoxin-like toxins were produced as recombinant proteins and tested for their ability to induce the selective in vitro expansion of human T cells bearing particular Vβ T-cell receptors (TCR). Although redundancies were observed between the toxins and the Vβ populations, each toxin induced the expansion of distinct Vβ subsets, including enterotoxin H and enterotoxin-like toxin J. Surprisingly, the Vβ signatures were not associated with a specific phylogenic group of toxins. Interestingly, each human Vβ analyzed in this study was stimulated by at least one staphylococcal superantigen, suggesting that the bacterium derives a selective advantage from targeting the entire human TCR Vβ panel.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aStaphylococcus aureus 3aT-lymphocytes 3abacteria 3aenterotoxins 3aexotoxins 3ahumans 3aphylogeny 3areceptors 3arecombinant proteins 3aseptic shock 3asuperantigens1 aDauwalder, Olivier1 aBrun, Virginie1 aBadiou, Cedric1 aFerry, Tristan1 aEtienne, Jerome1 aVandenesch, François1 aLina, Gerard0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.2043-2050dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01388-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02474naa a2200337 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100001900152245009500171300001400266500002400280520146900304650000901773650001201782650002101794650001401815650001701829650001301846650001201859650001201871700002001883700001701903700001701920773012301937852000902060856005502069655001202124IND4451835220221119204413.0110401e201104  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND445183522DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1745-4557.2011.00374.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aBuescher, R.W.10aElevated calcium chloride in cucumber fermentation brine prolongs pickle product crispness  ap. 93-99.  aIncludes references  aThe effects of treating cucumbers with calcium chloride (CaCl₂) during fermentation and alum during desalting on changes in crispness of processed pickle mesocarp tissue during storage were determined from probe penetration forces, measurements of sound frequencies and sensory panel ratings. Penetration forces of mesocarp tissues from salt-stock and desalted pickles that had been treated with CaCl₂ were similarly higher than untreated tissues. After processing and storage, crispness and its retention was significantly correlated to the amount of residual Ca⁺⁺. A high level of crispness was retained during 52 weeks of storage in only the tissues containing elevated residual Ca⁺⁺ (1,248 and 1,490 ppm). Tissues containing 96 ppm Al⁺⁺⁺ and 655 ppm Ca⁺⁺ were substantially crisper than tissues with less than 900 ppm Ca⁺⁺ and without Al⁺⁺⁺; however, retention of crispness was better in tissues containing elevated Ca⁺⁺. It is concluded that alum can be replaced by elevating residual Ca⁺⁺. Practical Applications: Augmenting calcium chloride in cucumber fermentation brines to increase the residual concentration of Ca⁺⁺ in the processed pickle product provides manufacturers the opportunity to improve retention of crispness without using alum. Elimination of Al⁺⁺⁺ without compromising texture should improve marketability of products, since Al⁺⁺⁺ is objectionable to some distributors and consumers. 3aalum 3abrining 3acalcium chloride 3acucumbers 3afermentation 3ahardness 3apickles 3atexture1 aHamilton, Cathy1 aThorne, Jack1 aCho, Mi-jin.0 tJournal of food quality.g2011 Apr., v. 34, no. 2 p.93-99dBlackwell Publishing IncwJournal:jnl10994x0146-94287nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1745-4557.2011.00374.x 7aarticle03530naa a2200529 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245006900175300001800244520195000262650002202212650002702234650001202261650004102273650002102314650001402335650002602349650001202375650001502387650001602402650002602418650001202444650001502456650001002471650001202481650002602493650002202519650001202541650002202553650001502575650001002590651001402600653003602614653002902650653002302679700002302702773011802725852000902843856009202852930003302944946001102977655001202988IND4408946220221119204436.0080815e200809  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440894622DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02002.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSLOCUM, MATTHEW G.10aEffects of three stressors on vegetation in an oligohaline marsh  ap. 1783-1796.  a1. When multiple stressors have interactive effects they can lead to important changes in ecosystem function. We examined how three stressors affected the plant community in an oligohaline marsh in southeastern Louisiana, U.S.A. These stressors included herbivory (mostly by the introduced rodent Myocastor coypus), disturbance (herbicide application) and nutrient enrichment (three levels of N-P-K fertilizer). Sampling was conducted six times over 4 years. 2. Recovery after disturbance was slow, such that after 26 months biomass in disturbed plots was 36% that of controls. Slow recovery appeared to be due to herbivory, as exclusion of herbivores for 14 months led to much more biomass compared to non-excluded plots. Exclusion did not, however, aid recovery of species richness; this recovery required 51 months in total. 3. Nutrient enrichment increased biomass by 41% and decreased species richness by c. 20% in later sampling periods. Decreased species richness was due primarily to a reduced ability of dominant species to co-exist (as determined with Hill's diversity number N1). Nutrient enrichment did not interact with the other treatments. 4. Disturbance favoured two grasses (Echinochloa crus-galli and Leptochloa fascicularis), while lack of disturbance favoured two herbs (Sagittaria lancifolia and Polygonum punctatum) and two vines (Ipomoea sagittata and Cuscuta pentagona). Nutrient enrichment positively affected abundance of two species (C. pentagona and L. fascicularis). Herbivory did not affect species composition. 5. The effect of one stressor (experimental disturbance) on plant biomass depended on the strength of another stressor (herbivory). Nutrient enrichment was also important in affecting the plant community, but only as a single stressor. All effects changed over time, and it was clear that to understand properly the effects of multiple stressors, long-term, manipulative field experiments are necessary. 3aCuscuta pentagona 3aEchinochloa crus-galli 3aIpomoea 3aLeptochloa fusca subsp. fascicularis 3aMyocastor coypus 3aPolygonum 3aSagittaria lancifolia 3abiomass 3aecosystems 3afertilizers 3afield experimentation 3agrasses 3aherbivores 3aherbs 3amarshes 3apesticide application 3aplant communities 3arodents 3aspecies diversity 3avegetation 3avines 3aLouisiana 0acoastal and oligohaline marshes 0aexperimental disturbance 0amultiple stressors1 aMendelssohn, I.

Peanut (Arachis sp.), squash (Cucurbita moschata), and cotton (Gossypium barbadense) macrofossils were excavated from archaeological sites on the western slopes of the northern Peruvian Andes. Direct radiocarbon dating indicated that these plants grew between 9240 and 5500 ¹⁴C years before the present. These and other plants were recovered from multiple locations in a tropical dry forest valley, including household clusters, permanent architectural structures, garden plots, irrigation canals, hoes, and storage structures. These data provide evidence for early use of peanut and squash in the human diet and of cotton for industrial purposes and indicate that horticultural economies in parts of the Andes took root by about 10,000 years ago. 3aArachis 3aCucurbita moschata 3aGossypium barbadense 3acarbon 3acotton 3adry forests 3aearly development 3afarming systems 3agardens 3ahuman nutrition 3airrigation canals 3apeanuts 3aradiocarbon dating 3aradionuclides 3asquashes 3atopographic slope 3aAndes region 3aPeru1 aRossen, Jack1 aAndres, Thomas C.1 aWilliams, David E.0 tScience.g2007 June 29, v. 316, no. 5833 p.1890-1893dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11413953Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02247naa a2200457 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002000143245005800163300001800221520088900239650002201128650001101150650001501161650000901176650001101185650002101196650001201217650001101229650001601240700002201256700001701278700001501295700001801310700002101328700001401349700001801363700002401381700001601405700002001421773012701441852000901568856008301577856007101660930003301731946001301764655001201777IND4392786020221119204621.0070701e20070629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439278602DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11421052doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDubrovinsky, L.10aBody-Centered Cubic Iron-Nickel Alloy in Earth's Core  ap. 1880-1883.  aCosmochemical, geochemical, and geophysical studies provide evidence that Earth's core contains iron with substantial (5 to 15%) amounts of nickel.

Our experimental and theoretical results not only support the interpretation of shockwave data on pure iron as showing a solid-solid phase transition above about 200 gigapascals, but also suggest that iron alloys with geochemically reasonable compositions (that is, with substantial nickel, sulfur, or silicon content) adopt the bcc structure in Earth's inner core. 3aX-ray diffraction 3aalloys 3ageophysics 3airon 3anickel 3aphase transition 3asilicon 3asulfur 3atemperature1 aDubrovinskaia, N.1 aNarygina, O.1 aKantor, I.1 aKuznetzov, A.1 aPrakapenka, V.B.1 aVitos, L.1 aJohansson, B.1 aMikhaylushkin, A.S.1 aSimak, S.I.1 aAbrikosov, I.A.0 tScience.g2007 June 29, v. 316, no. 5833 p.1880-1883dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11421053Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03703naa a2200553 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002500181245021400206300001800420500002400438506007600462520178900538506003702327650002602364650002702390650001802417650001602435650001502451650001402466650001702480650000902497650001402506650001102520650003002531650003602561650003502597650001802632650003602650650001102686650003102697650003802728650003902766650002302805650002002828650003202848700001902880700001702899700001602916773011602932852000903048856008003057655001203137IND4419261820221207090951.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926182DNAL7 a192735542pmid7 aPMC26817542pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01561-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aShaughnessy, Jutamas10aFunctional Comparison of the Binding of Factor H Short Consensus Repeat 6 (SCR 6) to Factor H Binding Protein from Neisseria meningitidis and the Binding of Factor H SCR 18 to 20 to Neisseria gonorrhoeae Porin  ap. 2094-2103.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBoth Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae recruit the alternative pathway complement inhibitory protein factor H (fH) to their surfaces to evade complement-dependent killing. Meningococci bind fH via fH binding protein (fHbp), a surface-exposed lipoprotein that is subdivided into three variant families based on one classification scheme. Chimeric proteins that comprise contiguous domains of fH fused to murine Fc were used to localize the binding site for all three fHbp variants on fH to short consensus repeat 6 (SCR 6). As expected, fH-like protein 1 (FHL-1), which contains fH SCR 6, also bound to fHbp-expressing meningococci. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified histidine 337 and histidine 371 in SCR 6 as important for binding to fHbp. These findings may provide the molecular basis for recent observations that demonstrated human-specific fH binding to meningococci. Differences in the interactions of fHbp variants with SCR 6 were evident. Gonococci bind fH via their porin (Por) molecules (PorB.1A or PorB.1B); sialylation of lipooligosaccharide enhances fH binding. Both sialylated PorB.1B- and (unsialylated) PorB.1A-bearing gonococci bind fH through SCR 18 to 20; PorB.1A can also bind SCR 6, but only weakly, as evidenced by a low level of binding of FHL-1 relative to that of fH. Using isogenic strains expressing either meningococcal fHbp or gonococcal PorB.1B, we discovered that strains expressing gonococcal PorB.1B in the presence of sialylated lipooligosaccharide bound more fH, more effectively limited C3 deposition, and were more serum resistant than their isogenic counterparts expressing fHbp. Differences in fH binding to these two related pathogens may be important for modulating their individual responses to host immune attack.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aNeisseria gonorrhoeae 3aNeisseria meningitidis 3abinding sites 3ablood serum 3acomplement 3ahistidine 3alipoproteins 3amice 3apathogens 3aporins 3asite-directed mutagenesis 2aAntigens, Bacterialxmetabolism 2aBacterial Proteinsxmetabolism 2aBinding Sites 2aComplement Factor Hxmetabolism 2aHumans 2aMutagenesis, Site-Directed 2aNeisseria gonorrhoeaeximmunology 2aNeisseria meningitidisximmunology 2aPorinsxmetabolism 2aProtein Binding 2aProtein Interaction Mapping1 aLewis, Lisa A.1 aJarva, Hanna1 aRam, Sanjay0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.2094-2103dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01561-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle03433naa a2200565 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100002400181245011800205300001800323500002400341506007600365520144200441506003701883650003001920650002101950650001901971650001001990650001202000650001702012650002302029650002102052650001002073650001402083650004702097650001202144650003302156650006102189650005002250650004502300650002802345650001802373650004902391650003002440650001002470650003302480650004502513650004402558700002502602700002302627773011602650852000902766856008002775655001202855IND4419262220221207090817.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926222DNAL7 a192375312pmid7 aPMC26817392pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01379-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aNicholson, Tracy L.10aContribution of Bordetella bronchiseptica Filamentous Hemagglutinin and Pertactin to Respiratory Disease in Swine  ap. 2136-2146.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aBordetella bronchiseptica is pervasive in swine populations and plays multiple roles in respiratory disease. Most studies addressing virulence factors of B. bronchiseptica are based on isolates derived from hosts other than pigs. Two well-studied virulence factors implicated in the adhesion process are filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN). We hypothesized that both FHA and PRN would serve critical roles in the adhesion process and be necessary for colonization of the swine respiratory tract. To investigate the role of FHA and PRN in Bordetella pathogenesis in swine, we constructed mutants containing an in-frame deletion of the FHA or the PRN structural gene in a virulent B. bronchiseptica swine isolate. Both mutants were compared to the wild-type swine isolate for their ability to colonize and cause disease in swine. Colonization of the FHA mutant was lower than that of the wild type at all respiratory tract sites and time points examined and caused limited to no disease. In contrast, the PRN mutant caused similar disease severity relative to the wild type; however, colonization of the PRN mutant was reduced relative to the wild type during early and late infection and induced higher anti-Bordetella antibody titers. Together, our results indicate that despite inducing different pathologies and antibody responses, both FHA and PRN are necessary for optimal colonization of the swine respiratory tract.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aBordetella bronchiseptica 3adisease severity 3ahemagglutinins 3ahosts 3amutants 3apathogenesis 3arespiratory system 3astructural genes 3aswine 3avirulence 2aAdhesins, Bacterialxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aAnimals 2aAntibodies, Bacterialxblood 2aBacterial Outer Membrane Proteinsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aBordetella Infectionsxpathologyxveterinary. 2aBordetella bronchisepticaxpathogenicity 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aGene Deletion 2aRespiratory Systemxmicrobiologyxpathology. 2aSeverity of Illness Index 2aSwine 2aSwine Diseasesxmicrobiology 2aVirulence Factorsxgeneticsxphysiology. 2aVirulence Factors, Bordetellaxgenetics1 aBrockmeier, Susan L.1 aLoving, Crystal L.0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.2136-2146dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01379-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle02360naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092024002200125024001900147040001800166100002200184245006400206300001800270506007600288520101700364506003701381650002501418650001001443650001101453650001101464650003001475650002001505700001901525700002201544700003001566700001801596773012701614852000901741856008301750856007101833930003301904946001301937655001201950IND4392786820221207083210.0070701e20070629xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439278682DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11415882doi7 aPMC24300582pmcid7 a176002182pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHauert, Christoph10aVia Freedom to Coercion: The Emergence of Costly Punishment  ap. 1905-1907.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIn human societies, cooperative behavior in joint enterprises is often enforced through institutions that impose sanctions on defectors. Many experiments on so-called public goods games have shown that in the absence of such institutions, individuals are willing to punish defectors, even at a cost to themselves. Theoretical models confirm that social norms prescribing the punishment of uncooperative behavior are stable--once established, they prevent dissident minorities from spreading. But how can such costly punishing behavior gain a foothold in the population? A surprisingly simple model shows that if individuals have the option to stand aside and abstain from the joint endeavor, this paves the way for the emergence and establishment of cooperative behavior based on the punishment of defectors. Paradoxically, the freedom to withdraw from the common enterprise leads to enforcement of social norms. Joint enterprises that are compulsory rather than voluntary are less likely to lead to cooperation.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3abusiness enterprises 3agames 3ahumans 3amodels 3apublic services and goods 3asocial behavior1 aTraulsen, Arne1 aBrandt, Hannelore1 aNowak, M.

This investigation sought to confirm whether or not the paper mill was the pollution source, and to characterize the risk to recreational bathers imposed by the source. Quantification of E. coli in river water collected at incremental distances showed that paper mill effluent caused elevated E. coli levels in beach samples. Samples collected throughout the mill were variably positive for heterotrophic bacteria, total coliforms and E. coli, but negative for pathogenic E. coli O157 and Salmonella. Escherichia coli O157 or Salmonella spiked into mill samples (4·2 log₁₀ or 5·6 log₁₀ CFU per 100 ml, respectively) fell below detection levels within 14-24 h in raw (unaltered) samples, while in heat-sterilized replicates, the counts remained at initial levels or increased over 36 h. Pathogenic E. coli O157 and Salmonella were not isolated from paper mill samples. The absence of native bacteria allowed the survival of pathogens, while their presence accelerated pathogen decline. The co-existence of paper mill and swimming beach may be reasonable for now in spite of the limitations of an E. coli-based assay for beach water. 3aEscherichia coli O157 3aSalmonella 3acoliform bacteria 3amilling 3apathogens 3apulp and paper mill effluents 3apulp and paper mills 3arisk 3ariver water 3aswimming 2aAntibiosis 2aBathing Beaches 2aColony Count, Microbial 2aEnvironmental Microbiology 2aEscherichia coli O157xisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aFresh Water 2aHumans 2aIndustrial Microbiology 2aIndustrial Waste 2aMicrobial Viability 2aPaper 2aSalmonellaxisolation & purificationxphysiology. 2aSterilization 2aWood 0abeach 0aEscherichia coli O157 0apaper mill0 tJournal of applied microbiology.g2008 Feb., v. 104, no. 2 p.534-540dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx1364-50727nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2007.03576.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080120b20080202c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01906naa a2200325 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245008900167300001600256520081800272650001901090650001901109650001701128650000901145650002201154650001301176650002401189700002201213773012401235852000901359856008301368856007101451930003301522946001301555655001201568IND4392980120221119204454.0070708e20070706xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439298012DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11404882doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRakoff-Nahoum, Seth10aRegulation of Spontaneous Intestinal Tumorigenesis Through the Adaptor Protein MyD88  ap. 124-127.  aInflammation is increasingly recognized as an important component of tumorigenesis, although the mechanisms and pathways involved are not well understood. Tumor development is regulated by products of several modifier genes, but instructions for their tumor-specific expression are currently unknown. We show that the signaling through the adaptor protein MyD88 has a critical role in spontaneous tumor development in mice with heterozygous mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. We found that MyD88-dependent signaling controls the expression of several key modifier genes of intestinal tumorigenesis and has a critical role in both spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumor development. This study thus reveals the important role of an innate immune signaling pathway in intestinal tumorigenesis. 3acarcinogenesis 3aheterozygosity 3ainflammation 3amice 3amodifiers (genes) 3amutation 3asignal transduction1 aMedzhitov, Ruslan0 tScience.g2007 July 6, v. 317, no. 5834 p.124-127dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11404883Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02569naa a2200433 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100001900179245008400198300001800282506007600300520118500376506003701561650000801598650003401606650001001640650003601650650002201686650002001708650001801728650002101746650003301767650002401800700002501824700001801849700002401867700001901891773008201910852000901992856007802001930003302079946001102112655001202123IND4419028920221207092000.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441902892DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp0132doi7 aPMC26652132pmcid7 a191745642pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKuo, Pan-Hsien10aStructural insights into TDP-43 in nucleic-acid binding and domain interactions  ap. 1799-1808.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aTDP-43 is a pathogenic protein: its normal function in binding to UG-rich RNA is related to cystic fibrosis, and inclusion of its C-terminal fragments in brain cells is directly linked to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we report the 1.65 Å crystal structure of the C-terminal RRM2 domain of TDP-43 in complex with a single-stranded DNA. We show that TDP-43 is a dimeric protein with two RRM domains, both involved in DNA and RNA binding. The crystal structure reveals the basis of TDP-43's TG/UG preference in nucleic acids binding. It also reveals that RRM2 domain has an atypical RRM-fold with an additional β-strand involved in making protein-protein interactions. This self association of RRM2 domains produced thermal-stable RRM2 assemblies with a melting point greater than 85°C as monitored by circular dichroism at physiological conditions. These studies thus characterize the recognition between TDP-43 and nucleic acids and the mode of RRM2 self association, and provide molecular models for understanding the role of TDP-43 in cystic fibrosis and the neurodegenerative diseases related to TDP-43 proteinopathy.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aRNA 3aamyotrophic lateral sclerosis 3abrain 3acircular dichroism spectroscopy 3acrystal structure 3acystic fibrosis 3amelting point 3amolecular models 3aprotein-protein interactions 3asingle-stranded DNA1 aDoudeva, Lyudmila G.1 aWang, Yi-Ting1 aShen, Che-Kun James1 aYuan, Hanna S.0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Apr., v. 37, no. 6 p.1799-1808x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp0133Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03259naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003500092040001800127100001800145245008300163300001600246500002400262500001500286520199800301650001102299650001302310650001302323650001102336650001102347650003102358650001402389650001102403650002102414650002102435650001102456650001702467650001902484650001302503650002402516650001102540650001602551650001202567651001502579653001102594700001702605773009802622852000902720856004802729655001202777IND4442908420221119204519.0100924e201010  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND444290842DNAL7 a10.1007/s10584-009-9750-82doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMadani, Kaveh10aEstimated impacts of climate warming on California's high-elevation hydropower  ap. 521-538.  aIncludes references  a2019-12-06  aCalifornia's hydropower system is composed of high and low elevation power plants. There are more than 150 high-elevation power plants, at elevations above 1,000 feet (300 m). Most have modest reservoir storage capacities, but supply roughly 74% of California's in-state hydropower. The expected shift of runoff peak from spring to winter due to climate warming, resulting in snowpack reduction and increased snowmelt, might have important effects on power generation and revenues in California. The large storage capacities at low-elevation power plants provide flexibility to operations of these units under climate warming. However, with climate warming, the adaptability of the high-elevation hydropower system is in question as this system was designed to take advantage of snowpack, a natural reservoir. With so many high-elevation hydropower plants in California, estimation of climate warming effects by conventional simulation or optimization methods would be tedious and expensive. An Energy-Based Hydropower Optimization Model (EBHOM) was developed to facilitate practical climate change and other low-resolution system-wide hydropower studies, based on the historical generation data of 137 high-elevation hydropower plants for which the data were complete for 14 years. Employing recent historical hourly energy prices, the model was used to explore energy generation in California for three climate warming scenarios (dry warming, wet warming, and warming-only) over 14 years, representing a range of hydrologic conditions. The system is sensitive to the quantity and timing of inflows. While dry warming and warming-only climate changes reduce average hydropower revenues, wet warming could increase revenue. Re-operation of available storage and generation capacities help compensate for snowpack losses to some extent. Storage capacity expansion and to a lesser extent generation capacity expansion both increase revenues, although such expansions might not be cost-effective. 3aenergy 3asnowmelt 3asnowpack 3awinter 3aprices 3aenergy use and consumption 3amountains 3amodels 3apower generation 3awater reservoirs 3aspring 3apower plants 3aglobal warming 3aaltitude 3asystem optimization 3arunoff 3awater power 3aclimate 3aCalifornia 0aplants1 aLund, Jay R.0 tClimatic change.g2010 Oct., v. 102, no. 3-4 p.521-538dSpringer Netherlandsx0165-00097nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10584-009-9750-8 7aarticle02320naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002500143245008800168300001600256520107200272650002301344650002401367650001201391650001201403650002401415650001201439650001101451650004401462650002801506650001101534650001101545650001301556700001901569773012501588852000901713856008301722856007101805930003301876946001301909655001201922IND4393162420221119204529.0070716e20070713xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439316242DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11443142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMelnick, Jonathan G.10aCleaving Mercury-Alkyl Bonds: A Functional Model for Mercury Detoxification by MerB  ap. 225-227.  aThe extreme toxicity of organomercury compounds that are found in the environment has focused attention on the mechanisms of action of bacterial remediating enzymes. We describe facile room-temperature protolytic cleavage by a thiol of the Hg-C bond in mercury-alkyl compounds that emulate the structure and function of the organomercurial lyase MerB. Specifically, the tris(2-mercapto-1-t-butylimidazolyl)hydroborato ligand [TmBut], which features three sulfur donors, has been used to synthesize [TmBut]HgR alkyl compounds (R = methyl or ethyl) that react with phenylthiol (PhSH) to yield [TmBut]HgSPh and RH. Although [TmBut]HgR compounds exist as linear two-coordinate complexes in the solid state, ¹H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates that the complexes exist in rapid equilibrium with their higher-coordinate [κ²-TmBut]HgR and [κ³-TmBut]HgR isomers in solution. Facile access to a higher-coordinate species is proposed to account for the exceptional reactivity of [TmBut]HgR relative to that of other two-coordinate mercury-alkyl compounds. 3aalkylmercury lyase 3aambient temperature 3aisomers 3aligands 3amechanism of action 3amercury 3amodels 3anuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy 3aorganomercury compounds 3asulfur 3athiols 3atoxicity1 aParkin, Gerard0 tScience.g2007 July 13, v. 317, no. 5835 p.225-227dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11443143Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle01968naa a2200289 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003200092040001800124100002000142245012100162300001800283500002400301520100800325650004301333650001101376650001501387650001601402650001301418650001401431700002101445773010901466852000901575856008201584655001201666IND4425666020221119204631.0090905s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442566602DNAL7 a10.1002/jssc.2009002132doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKand'ár, Roman10aDetermination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ in human plasma using HPLC with UV detection based on SPE sample preparation  ap. 2953-2957.  aIncludes references  aInterest in the metabolism and physiological action of vitamin D is increased exponentially. The most important metabolites of vitamin D are 25-hydroxyvitamin and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃. The aim of the study was to develop a rapid and simple HPLC method for the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ in human plasma. A method for the measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ using HPLC with UV detection and investigation into the extraction techniques with regard to stability and recovery are described. For the separation, RP column LiChroCart 125-4, Purospher RP-18e, 5 μm, was used. The mixture of methanol and deionized water (95:5 v/v) was used as mobile phase. The analytical performance of this method is satisfactory: the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation were below 10%. Quantitative recoveries from spiked plasma samples were between 92.0-103.2%. The LOD was 10 nmol/L. The preliminary reference range of 25-hydroxyvitamin D₃ in a group of blood donors is 62 ± 26 nmol/L. 3ahigh performance liquid chromatography 3ahumans 3ametabolism 3ametabolites 3amethanol 3avitamin D1 aŽáková, Pavla0 tJournal of separation science.g2009 Sept., v. 32, no. 17 p.2953-2957dWiley-VCH Verlagx1615-93067nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jssc.2009002133Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01901naa a2200373 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003200111040001800143100002700161245010300188300001800291500002400309520067300333650002001006650001701026650001901043650001001062650001601072650002001088650005701108650005301165650001001218650002801228650001901256700001801275700002201293773010901315852000901424856008201433655001201515IND4425667220221119204401.0090905s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND442566722DNAL7 a196300052pmid7 a10.1002/jssc.2009002142doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aDawidowicz, Andrzej L.10aStatic and dynamic superheated water extraction of essential oil components from Thymus vulgaris L  ap. 3034-3042.  aIncludes references  aSuperheated water extraction (SWE) performed in both static and dynamic condition (S-SWE and D-SWE, respectively) was applied for the extraction of essential oil from Thymus vulgaris L.

The filter composition and the sorbent used in the SPE strongly influence the correct recovery, both in terms of total and dissolved FQs concentration. An accurate comparison among different filters and SPE sorbents showed that a full determination of analytes was possible on nylon filters followed by anionic (WAX) and hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) resins as SPE. Quantitative analysis was done by chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FD). Fluoroquinolones recovery was between 90 and 116% with RSD not greater than 10% (sample volume 250 mL). The developed method allowed to determine both dissolved and NOM-absorbed fractions of FQs, therefore a full determination of the analytes was possible.

However, the process of sulphate respiration is still incompletely understood. Several mechanisms of energy conservation have been proposed, but it is unclear how the different strategies contribute to the overall process. In order to obtain a deeper insight into the energy metabolism of sulphate-reducers whole-genome microarrays were used to compare the transcriptional response of Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough grown with hydrogen/sulphate, pyruvate/sulphate, pyruvate with limiting sulphate, and lactate/thiosulphate, relative to growth in lactate/sulphate. Growth with hydrogen/sulphate showed the largest number of differentially expressed genes and the largest changes in transcript levels. In this condition the most up-regulated energy metabolism genes were those coding for the periplasmic [NiFeSe] hydrogenase, followed by the Ech hydrogenase. The results also provide evidence for the involvement of formate cycling and the recently proposed ethanol pathway during growth in hydrogen. The pathway involving CO cycling is relevant during growth on lactate and pyruvate, but not during growth in hydrogen as the most down-regulated genes were those coding for the CO-induced hydrogenase. Growth on lactate/thiosulphate reveals a down-regulation of several energy metabolism genes similar to what was observed in the presence of nitrite.

Predictive models of impact are needed for the risk assessment of invasive species. One such species is the Eurasian zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), a fouling bivalve that overgrows and kills native mussels (Unionidae) in many North American lakes and rivers. The level of mortality in a native mussel population increases with the fouling intensity - i.e. the mean number of zebra mussels attached to each native mussel. 2. We conducted a multi-site survey within the St Lawrence and Richelieu rivers (Quebec, Canada) to determine whether zebra mussel fouling intensity can be predicted from environmental variables. We found fouling intensity to be positively correlated with calcium concentration [Ca²⁺] and negatively correlated with sediment size, but not affected by local macrophyte cover. 3. A multiple regression model that includes calcium concentration and sediment size explains 86% of variation in fouling intensity across all sites. 4. Analysis of data from invaded sites in North America and Europe revealed a nonlinear relationship in which fouling intensity increases with calcium concentration up to an asymptotic threshold of 24 mg L⁻¹ Ca²⁺. 5. Our results suggest that the community-level impacts of zebra mussels are mediated by abiotic environmental variables and gradients in these variables may provide local habitat refugia for native mussels. 3aDreissena polymorpha 3aUnionidae 3acalcium 3acorrelation 3adata analysis 3aenvironmental factors 3afouling 3ainvasive species 3alakes 3amacrophytes 3amodels 3amortality 3amussels 3apopulation growth 3aprediction 3arefuge habitats 3aregression analysis 3arisk assessment 3arivers 3asediments 3asurveys 3aEurope 3aQuebec 0aempirical models1 aRICCIARDI, ANTHONY0 tFreshwater biology.g2008 Sept., v. 53, no. 9 p.1845-1856dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0046-50707nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.02009.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080815b20080905c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01773naa a2200469 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001800092040001800110100001700128245008800145300001600233520048800249650001200737650001300749650001400762650001300776650001000789650000900799650002200808650001400830650001500844650001200859650001300871650002600884650002800910650001300938650002800951650002100979650000901000650002601009650001201035653001601047653003001063700001901093773012401112852000901236939003301245946001301278655001201291IND9200643320221119204130.0920212e199109  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND920064332DNAL7 a18711482pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSoares, M.J.10aTurkey and chicken prolactins stimulate the proliferation of rat Nb2 lymphoma cells  ap. 384-386.  aThe purpose of this investigation was to assess the actions of two avian prolactins (PRL) on rat Nb2 lymphoma cell proliferation.

However, in the presence of interleukin-6 (IL-6), TGF-β has also been found to promote the differentiation of naïve T lymphocytes into proinflammatory IL-17 cytokine-producing T helper 17 (TH17) cells, which promote autoimmunity and inflammation. This raises the question of how TGF-β can generate such distinct outcomes. We identified the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid as a key regulator of TGF-β-dependent immune responses, capable of inhibiting the IL-6-driven induction of proinflammatory TH17 cells and promoting anti-inflammatory Treg cell differentiation. These findings indicate that a common metabolite can regulate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory immunity. 3aCD4-positive T-lymphocytes 3aautoimmunity 3acell differentiation 3ainflammation 3ainterleukin-17 3ainterleukin-6 3ametabolites 3aretinoic acid 3atransforming growth factor beta 3avitamin A1 aPark, Yunji1 aKim, Gisen1 aTurovskaya, Olga1 aScott, Iain1 aKronenberg, Mitchell1 aCheroutre, Hilde0 tScience.g2007 July 13, v. 317, no. 5835 p.256-260dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11456973Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03638naa a2200637 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024002200111024003000133040001800163100001800181245017600199300001800375500002400393506007600417520154300493506003702036650002402073650001302097650001702110650001302127650001902140650001302159650003702172650001702209650001302226650001702239650001402256650001102270650001002281650002102291650004202312650002702354650006302381650006102444650001102505650003602516650001102552650001402563650001102577650002002588650003202608650001602640651001502656700001902671700002602690700002002716700002102736700002602757773011602783852000902899856008002908655001202988IND4419261420221207092030.0090417s2009    xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441926142DNAL7 a192735602pmid7 aPMC26817732pmcid7 a10.1128/IAI.01571-082doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aAhmed, Tanvir10aChildren with the Le(a+b-) Blood Group Have Increased Susceptibility to Diarrhea Caused by Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli Expressing Colonization Factor I Group Fimbriae  ap. 2059-2064.  aIncludes references  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aRecent studies have shown that children with blood group A have increased susceptibility to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhea and that Lewis blood group "a" antigen (Lea) may be a candidate receptor for ETEC colonization factor (CF) antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae. Based on these findings, we have attempted to determine if children with the Le(a+b-) phenotype may be more susceptible to diarrhea caused by ETEC, in particular ETEC expressing CFA/I and related fimbriae of the CFA/I group, than Le(a-b+) children. To test this hypothesis, we have determined the Lewis antigen expression in 179 Bangladeshi children from a prospective birth cohort study in urban Dhaka in which ETEC expressing major CFs such as CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6 was the most commonly isolated diarrhea pathogen during the first 2 years of life. The Lewis blood group phenotypes were determined by a dot blot immunoassay using saliva samples and by a tube agglutination test using fresh red blood cells. The results indicate that Le(a+b-) children more often had symptomatic than asymptomatic ETEC infections (P < 0.001), whereas symptomatic and asymptomatic ETEC infections were equally frequent in Le(a-b+) children. We also show that children with the Le(a+b-) blood type had significantly higher incidences of diarrhea caused by ETEC expressing fimbriae of the CFA/I group than Le(a-b+) children (P < 0.001). In contrast, we did not find any association between the Lewis blood group phenotype and diarrhea caused by ETEC expressing CS6 or rotavirus.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aagglutination tests 3aantigens 3ablood groups 3achildren 3acohort studies 3adiarrhea 3aenterotoxigenic Escherichia coli 3aerythrocytes 3afimbriae 3aimmunoassays 3apathogens 3asaliva 2aAdult 2aChild, Preschool 2aDiarrheaxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aDisease Susceptibility 2aEnterotoxigenic Escherichia colixisolation & purification 2aEscherichia coli Infectionsxepidemiologyxmicrobiology. 2aFemale 2aFimbriae Proteinsxbiosynthesis 2aHumans 2aIncidence 2aInfant 2aInfant, Newborn 2aLewis Blood Group Antigens. 2aYoung Adult 0aBangladesh1 aLundgren, Anna1 aArifuzzaman, Mohammad1 aQadri, Firdausi1 aTeneberg, Susann1 aSvennerholm, Ann-Mari0 tInfection and immunity.g2009 May, v. 77, no. 5 p.2059-2064dAmerican Society for Microbiologyx0019-95677nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.01571-083Available from publisher's Web site 7aarticle01873naa a2200361 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100002400143245007800167300001600245520071100261650001700972650001300989650002201002650002301024650001001047650001801057650001401075650002201089650002101111650001101132700002201143773012501165852000901290856008301299856007101382930003301453946001301486655001201499IND4393417420221119203833.0070722e20070720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439341742DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11430462doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMattila, Heather R.10aGenetic Diversity in Honey Bee Colonies Enhances Productivity and Fitness  ap. 362-364.  aHoney bee queens mate with many males, creating numerous patrilines within colonies that are genetically distinct. The effects of genetic diversity on colony productivity and long-term fitness are unknown. We show that swarms from genetically diverse colonies (15 patrilines per colony) founded new colonies faster than swarms from genetically uniform colonies (1 patriline per colony). Accumulated differences in foraging rates, food storage, and population growth led to impressive boosts in the fitness (i.e., drone production and winter survival) of genetically diverse colonies.

We used protein microarrays and quantitative fluorescence polarization to characterize the binding selectivity of 157 mouse PDZ domains with respect to 217 genome-encoded peptides. We then trained a multidomain selectivity model to predict PDZ domain-peptide interactions across the mouse proteome with an accuracy that exceeds many large-scale, experimental investigations of protein-protein interactions. Contrary to the current paradigm, PDZ domains do not fall into discrete classes; instead, they are evenly distributed throughout selectivity space, which suggests that they have been optimized across the proteome to minimize cross-reactivity. We predict that focusing on families of interaction domains, which facilitates the integration of experimentation and modeling, will play an increasingly important role in future investigations of protein function.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3across reaction 3afluorescence 3amice 3amicroarray technology 3amodels 3apeptides 3aprotein-protein interactions 3aproteome1 aChen, Jiunn R.1 aGrantcharova, Viara P.1 aLei, Ying1 aFuchs, Daniel1 aAllen, John E.1 aZaslavskaia, Lioudmila A.1 aMacBeath, Gavin0 tScience.g2007 July 20, v. 317, no. 5836 p.364-369dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11445923Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle02552naa a2200385 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024002800092024002200120024001900142040001800161100002500179245015000204300001800354506007600372520126900448506003701717650002901754650002101783650001301804650001101817650001301828650001101841700002201852700002601874700002301900700001801923773008201941852000902023856007802032930003302110946001102143655001202154IND4419028620221207091730.0090410e200904  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND441902862DNAL7 a10.1093/nar/gkp0102doi7 aPMC26652112pmcid7 a191745652pmid  aAGLbengcAGL1 aKozmin, Stanislav G.14aThe formation of double-strand breaks at multiply damaged sites is driven by the kinetics of excision/incision at base damage in eukaryotic cells  ap. 1767-1777.  aResource is Open Accessuhttp://purl.org/eprint/accessRights/OpenAccess  aIt has been stipulated that repair of clustered DNA lesions may be compromised, possibly leading to the formation of double-strand breaks (DSB) and, thus, to deleterious events. Using a variety of model multiply damaged sites (MDS), we investigated parameters that govern the formation of DSB during the processing of MDS. Duplexes carrying MDS were inserted into replicative or integrative vectors, and used to transform yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Formation of DSB was assessed by a relevant plasmid survival assay. Kinetics of excision/incision and DSB formation at MDS was explored using yeast cell extracts. We show that MDS composed of two uracils or abasic sites, were rapidly incised and readily converted into DSB in yeast cells. In marked contrast, none of the MDS carrying opposed oG and hU separated by 3-8 bp gave rise to DSB, despite the fact that some of them contained preexisting single-strand break (a 1-nt gap). Interestingly, the absence of DSB formation in this case correlated with slow excision/incision rates of lesions. We propose that the kinetics of the initial repair steps at MDS is a major parameter that direct towards the conversion of MDS into DSB. Data provides clues to the biological consequences of MDS in eukaryotic cells.0 fUnrestricted online access2star 3aSaccharomyces cerevisiae 3aeukaryotic cells 3aexcision 3amodels 3aplasmids 3ayeasts1 aSedletska, Yuliya1 aReynaud-Angelin, Anne1 aGasparutto, Didier1 aSage, Evelyne0 tNucleic acids research.g2009 Apr., v. 37, no. 6 p.1767-1777x0305-10487nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkp0103Available from publisher's Web site  a20090410b20090508c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle01535naa a2200301 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024003300092040001800125100001900143245006400162300001600226520054200242650001900784650001000803650001200813650001500825700002500840700002200865773012500887852000901012856008301021856007101104930003301175946001301208655001201221IND4393417720221119203817.0070722e20070720xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND439341772DNAL7 a10.1126/science.11397402doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aRohatgi, Rajat10aPatched1 Regulates Hedgehog Signaling at the Primary Cilium  ap. 372-376.  aPrimary cilia are essential for transduction of the Hedgehog (Hh) signal in mammals. We investigated the role of primary cilia in regulation of Patched1 (Ptc1), the receptor for Sonic Hedgehog (Shh). Ptc1 localized to cilia and inhibited Smoothened (Smo) by preventing its accumulation within cilia. When Shh bound to Ptc1, Ptc1 left the cilia, leading to accumulation of Smo and activation of signaling. Thus, primary cilia sense Shh and transduce signals that play critical roles in development, carcinogenesis, and stem cell function. 3acarcinogenesis 3acilia 3amammals 3astem cells1 aMilenkovic, Ljiljana1 aScott, Matthew P.0 tScience.g2007 July 20, v. 317, no. 5836 p.372-376dAmerican Association for the Advancement of Sciencex0036-80757nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.11397403Available from publisher's Web site40uhttp://www.scienceonline.org/3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080625b20080704c00000000  aOther US 7aarticle03415naa a2200445 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024004200092040001800134100002300152245007500175300001600250520208800266650001202354650001902366650002302385650001502408650001402423650001702437650002202454650001502476650002202491650001402513653001602527653001402543653001602557653002802573653001902601653002002620653001602640700002002656700002102676773011502697852000902812856009202821930003302913946001102946655001202957IND4406708520221119203819.0080613e200807  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440670852DNAL7 a10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01391.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aHiggins, Steven I.10aCosts of persistence and the spread of competing seeders and sprouters  ap. 679-686.  a1. Trade-offs between reproduction and persistence are thought to regulate life-history evolution and competitive interactions between plants. We examined how seeder (non-persistent semelparous) and sprouter (persistent iteroparous) life-history strategies compete in fire prone shrublands. 2. Our hypothesis was that a trade-off between persistence and colonization ability implies that seeders would be better colonizers than sprouters and would therefore stand to benefit from periods of rapid climate change, whereas sprouters are candidates for extinction in periods of shifting climates because of their relatively poor ability to colonize. 3. We developed an individual based simulation model that simulates lottery plant competition in a homogeneous spatial arena. We used an indirect method to estimate the fecundity and dispersal parameters needed by the model. Dispersal was described by a lognormal dispersal kernel. 4. We found that coexistence was possible in the system only for a restricted range of conditions. Moreover, the model when parameterized using our empirical estimates of demographic and dispersal rates, suggested that the sprouting strategies have a competitive advantage in the system we studied. 5. The migration capacities of the sprouter species were substantially lower than those of the seeder species. Our simulations suggested that, even though sprouters had a competitive advantage over seeders, interspecific competitive interactions did not slow the spread of seeder species, but did substantially hamper the spread of the slower spreading sprouter species. 6. Synthesis. We conclude that, in fire driven systems characterized by lottery recruitment, existing theories of colonization - persistence trade-offs do not completely describe interactions between persistent and non-persistent strategies. Moreover, our investigation of seeder - sprouter interactions suggests that sprouters, even though they might be competitively superior, will be more threatened by periods of rapid climate change because of their limited colonization ability. 3aclimate 3aclimate change 3acolonizing ability 3aextinction 3afecundity 3alife history 3aplant competition 3ashrublands 3asimulation models 3asprouting 0acoexistence 0adispersal 0aiteroparous 0alife-history strategies 0alottery models 0aplant migration 0asemelparous1 aFlores, Olivier1 aSchurr, Frank M.0 tJournal of ecology.g2008 July, v. 96, no. 4 p.679-686dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0022-04777nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01391.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080613b20080704c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03880naa a2200649 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024004200111040001800153100001900171245006700190300001600257520192300273650001502196650001302211650002002224650001002244650002002254650001202274650001802286650001402304650001402318650001302332650002302345650001302368650001202381650001102393650001602404650004702420650001202467650002802479650004302507650002302550650002402573650001402597650003802611650004002649650000902689650003102698650002202729650001702751650003902768653003002807700001802837700001902855700001802874700001802892700001702910773014602927852000903073856009203082930003303174946001103207655001203218IND4402808420221119204538.0080314e200804  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND440280842DNAL7 a183364142pmid7 a10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00724.x2doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aO'Connor, C.I.10aMineral balance in horses fed two supplemental silicon sources  ap. 173-181.  aNumerous studies suggest that silicon (Si) supplementation is beneficial for mineral metabolism and bone health. Mineral balance studies have not been performed in horses to determine how these supplements affect absorption of other minerals. The purpose of these studies was to investigate the effects of two different Si supplements on mineral absorption and retention in horses. Eight geldings were randomly placed in one of two groups: control (CO) or supplemental Si, which was provided by one of two supplements. The first, sodium aluminium silicate (SA), contains a bioavailable form of Si and is high in aluminium (Al). The second supplement contains oligomeric orthosilicic acid (OSA). All horses received textured feed and ad libitum access to hay. Supplemented horses received either 200 g of SA or 28.6 ml of OSA per day. Following a 10-day adaptation period, the horses underwent a 3-day total collection. Blood samples were taken on days 0 and 13. The two balance studies were conducted 4 months apart to reduce carryover effects. Intakes of Al and Si were greater with SA supplementation (p < 0.05). Sodium aluminium silicate increased faecal and urinary Si excretion (p < 0.05). Calcium retention and apparent digestion were increased by SA (p < 0.05). It also maintained plasma Si compared with the CO which tended to have a decrease in plasma Si (p = 0.08). Supplemental OSA increased retention of Ca and B (p < 0.05) and apparent digestion of B (p < 0.01). Orthosilicic acid tended to increase Si retention (p = 0.054), apparent digestion (p < 0.065), and also increased plasma Si. Both supplements were able to alter Ca retention and B metabolism, however, only OSA was able to alter Si retention, digestibility and plasma concentration. Orthosilicic acid, an Si supplement without substantial Al, appears to be a viable option for Si supplementation as it increased Si retention and digestibility. 3aabsorption 3aaluminum 3abalance studies 3ablood 3abone metabolism 3acalcium 3adigestibility 3adigestion 3aexcretion 3ageldings 3amineral metabolism 3aminerals 3asilicon 3asodium 2aAnimal Feed 2aAnimal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena 2aAnimals 2aBiological Availability 2aBone and Bonesxchemistryxmetabolism. 2aCross-Over Studies 2aDietary Supplements 2aDigestion 2aHorsesxbloodxmetabolismxurine. 2aIntestinal Absorptionxdrug effects 2aMale 2aMineralsxpharmacokinetics 2aRandom Allocation 2aSilicic Acid 2aSiliconxmetabolismxpharmacology. 0asodium aluminium silicate1 aNielsen, B.D.1 aWoodward, A.D.1 aSpooner, H.S.1 aVentura, B.A.1 aTurner, K.K.0 tJournal of animal physiology and animal nutrition.g2008 Apr., v. 92, no. 2 p.173-181dOxford, UK : Blackwell Publishing Ltdx0931-24397nnas  aDNAL40uhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00724.x3Available from publisher's Web site  a20080315b20080404c00000000  aNon-US 7aarticle03600naa a2200577 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070024001900092024003500111040001800146100001700164245010000181300001600281500002400297520179600321650002502117650001202142650001902154650001702173650000902190650001402199650001002213650001102223650001402234650001302248650002302261650001202284650003102296650002602327650005902353650002302412650005502435650004102490650001402531650002902545650004202574650005502616650003102671650002602702650003302728700001802761700001602779700001502795700001902810700002102829773010302850852000902953856004802962655001203010IND4433933520221119204545.0100313e201004  xx |||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND443393352DNAL7 a201120512pmid7 a10.1007/s11103-010-9597-42doi  aAGLbengcAGL1 aMatus, J. T.10aIsolation of WDR and bHLH genes related to flavonoid synthesis in grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.)  ap. 607-620.  aIncludes references  aAnthocyanins and tannins are two of the most abundant flavonoids found in grapevine, and their synthesis is derived from the phenylpropanoid pathway. As described for model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, maize and petunia, the end-point branches of this pathway are tightly regulated by the combinatorial interaction of three families of regulatory factors; MYB, bHLH (also known as MYC) and WDR proteins. Among these, only MYB genes have been previously identified in grapes. Here, we report the isolation of the first members from the WDR and bHLH families found in Vitis vinifera, named WDR1, WDR2 and MYCA1. WDR1 contributed positively to the accumulation of anthocyanins when it was overexpressed in A. thaliana, although it was not possible to determine the function of WDR2 by ectopic expression. The sub-cellular localizations of WDR1 and MYCA1 were observed by means of GFP-fusion proteins, indicating both cytoplasm and nuclear localization, in contrast to the localization of a MYB factor exclusively in the nucleus. The expression patterns of these genes were quantified in coloured reproductive organs throughout development, and correlated with anthocyanin accumulation and the expression profiles of the flavonoid-related MYBA1-2, UFGT, and ANR genes. In vitro grapevine plantlets grown under high salt concentrations showed a cultivar-dependent response for anthocyanin accumulation, which correlated with the expression of MYBA1-2, MYCA1 and WDR1 genes. These results suggest that MYCA1 may regulate ANR and UFGT and that this last control is easier to distinguish whenever MYBA genes are absent or in low abundance. Future studies should address the specific interactions of these proteins and their quantitative contribution to flavonoid synthesis in grape berries. 3aArabidopsis thaliana 3aPetunia 3aVitis vinifera 3aanthocyanins 3acorn 3acytoplasm 3agenes 3agrapes 3aplantlets 3aproteins 3asalt concentration 3atannins 2aAnthocyaninsxbiosynthesis 2aArabidopsisxgenetics 2aBasic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factorsxgenetics 2aCloning, Molecular 2aFruitxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aGreen Fluorescent Proteinsxanalysis 2aPhylogeny 2aPlant Proteinsxgenetics 2aRecombinant Fusion Proteinsxanalysis 2aSeedsxgeneticsxgrowth & developmentxmetabolism. 2aSequence Analysis, Protein 2aStress, Physiological 2aVitisxgeneticsxmetabolism.1 aPoupin, M.

  1 aCarey, E.14aThe Growing Growers Training Program: an apprenticeship program for market gardeners serving Kansas City  ap. 439-443.  aPaper presented at the workshop "Curriculum development for organic horticulture," July 21, 2005, Las Vegas, Nevada.  aThe Growing Growers Training Program facilitates on-farm apprenticeships complemented by workshops on critical skills to train new growers and improve the skills of existing growers to meet large demand for local and organically grown produce in the Kansas City metropolitan area. The program is a collaborative effort of Kansas State University, University of Missouri Extension, the Kansas City Food Circle, and the Kansas Rural Center, and was established in response to requests by area organic growers for a training program to increase numbers of local organic producers. In Fall 2003, we developed the components of the program, including a curriculum designed to help apprentices gain a set of core competencies through practical and theoretical training activities, including one-on-one training by host farmers, readings, workshops and farm tours. During the 2004 growing season II apprentices worked part time or volunteered on eight host farms, and participated in a series of II workshops and farm tours. Based on self-assessment, apprentices felt they gained considerable skill in most of the core competencies. Both apprentices and host farmers expressed high satisfaction with the program. At the start of the 2005 season, demand for the program increased, with 25 apprentices with diverse backgrounds placed on 12 host farms. Workshop participation was not restricted to apprentices, and over 200 trainees paid to attend workshops during 2004, helping to generate funds to cover program costs. It is still early to judge program success, but eight of II of the 2004 apprentices were engaged in full- or part-time market gardening in 2005. 3ahorticulture 3aorganic production 3asustainable agriculture 3acurriculum 3aprofessional education 3asmall-scale farming 3aagroecology 3aextension education 3ahorticultural crops 3aMissouri 0aliterature reviews 0ainterdisciplinary studies 0aexperiential learning 0aon-farm training 0amarket gardening1 aKelly, K.1 aHendrickson, M.1 aNagengast, D.1 aQuinn, Joseph.1 aVolland, C.1 aKumar, L.0 tHortTechnology.g2006 , v. 16, no. 3 p.439-443wJournal:2120x1063-01987nnas  aDNAL  a20070906b20071002c00000000  aINDd2CTe2006/09/15  aOther US 7aarticle02648naa a2200397 u 4500001001200000005001700012008004100029016002200070040001800092100001700110245018200127300001600309520142300325650005601748650001801804650001701822650001901839650001001858650001601868650002501884650001401909650001201923650003501935650001201970700002201982700002102004700002302025700001602048700002002064773008802084852000902172930003302181945001302214946001102227655001202238IND2206682020221119204531.0000828e200002  enk|||||o|||||||||||eng||7 aIND220668202DNAL  aAGLbengcAGL1 aSamsom, J.N.10aChanges of leukocyte phenotype and function in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of pigs infected with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus: a role for CD8+ cells  ap. 497-505.  aPorcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRSV) primarily infects and destroys alveolar macrophages of the pig. The aim of the present study was to characterize the changes of leukocyte populations in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of PRRSV-infected pigs. Piglets were inoculated intranasally with PRRSV strain LV ter Huurne. On various days post-infection the piglets were sacrificed and the lungs removed, washed semi-quantitatively and analysed by flow cytometry. The total number of recovered BALF cells increased approximately 10 times between day 10 and day 21 of infection and decreased thereafter. The number of small low-autofluorescent cells (SLAC), i.e. lymphocytic and monocytic cells, increased very strongly from day 2 until day 21 of infection; in contrast, the number of large highly autofluorescent cells (LHAC), i.e. mostly macrophages, remained constant until day 14 of infection, increased slightly on day 21 and then decreased. On day 21 of infection in specific-pathogen-free piglets approximately 60% of the SLAC consisted of CD2+CD8+CD4-gammadeltaTCR- cells, which were partly CD8+CD6+ and partly CD8+CD6-. These phenotypes correspond to that of cytotoxic T-cells and natural killer cells respectively. From these results we can conclude that during a PRRSV infection the total number of BALF cells increases mainly due to an influx of lymphocytic cells with a cytolytic phenotype. 3aPorcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 3aT-lymphocytes 3acytotoxicity 3aflow cytometry 3alungs 3amacrophages 3anatural killer cells 3aphenotype 3apiglets 3aspecific pathogen-free animals 3aviruses1 aBruin, T.G.M. de.1 aVoermans, J.J.M.1 aMeulenberg, J.J.M.1 aPol, J.M.A.1 aBianchi, A.T.J.0 tJournal of general virology.g2000 Feb., v. 81, no. pt.2 p.497-505x0022-13177nnas  aDNAL  a20001002b20001005c00000000  aINDdRF1  aNon-US 7aarticle
